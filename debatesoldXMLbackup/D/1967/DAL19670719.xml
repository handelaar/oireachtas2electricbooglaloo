    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In page 2, line 15, to delete &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;Deputy M.J. O'Higgins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last night, I was trying to convey <Col N="149" /> to the House the type of cattle sales we have in Donegal, and for the benefit of those who were not present, let me say we have three types: the old system of selling cattle at fairs on fair greens, the new system of selling them in marts, and another system which is not used very often but is there to be availed of, the traditional system.  It is my view that tradition should not be interfered with in the manner proposed in this legislation. For that reason I support this amendment. If the small farmers are to avail of this traditional way of selling their livestock of all descriptions, including Deputy Corry's goat, certain protection should be given to them.  One of the ways in which they can be protected is for the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>I hold that if a small farmer in north Donegal or east Donegal feels that he can obtain a higher price for his livestock by having what is described as a private auction on his holding, he should be entitled as a citizen of this country, under the Constitution, to claim that right and avail of it.  This amendment in some way guarantees that in time to come he will not be obstructed in his method of carrying on his business.  I have in mind a small farmer or the widow of a small farmer in Donegal who for one reason or another, wishes to dispose of his or her livestock, and contacts a local auctioneer and asks him to dispose of that stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this relevant to the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, if the Parliamentary Secretary will have patience and listen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more like a Second Reading speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was waiting for the Deputy to develop his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>If that person invites an auctioneer to sell his stock on the farm and does anything at all to interfere with the present arrangement of the farmyard, under this Bill he could be <Col N="150" /> prosecuted, whereas we hold that the deletion of &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; and the substitution of &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo; would put beyond doubt the right of that individual, if he or she so wishes, to have an auction on the farm, to which he or she is justly entitled by law.  The Minister has claimed that the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; is a better and more suitable description.  The Minister represents the same constituency as Deputy Cunningham and myself and, in spite of the fact that Deputy Cunningham claims I was the last of the three to be elected, might I remind him that because one ballot box was invalidated, he got past the post as second by a mere 16 votes?</P>
      <P>I feel that because I hold this strong conviction, the Minister and Deputy Cunningham should see this problem in the way I see it and for this reason the House should accept the amendment. Very strong pressure has been brought to bear on Deputy Cunningham about this matter and he has so far declined to deny this fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I present the case as it is seen in Donegal is that I have been inundated by people contacting me by telephone and coming to my home to discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> I have reason to believe that Deputy Cunningham has been put under the same pressure.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would all this matter about Donegal not be more spicy in Donegal than here?  I suggest that the Deputy confine himself to the amendment and leave the spicy bits for Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I opened my remarks on this amendment by saying that in Donegal we have three traditional ways of selling cattle and I am dealing now with the third of these three traditional ways.  This Bill interferes with the right of the small farmer in Donegal to avail of the traditional method of selling cattle which he, his father and his grandfather used.  I do not see, when a foreign Government did not interfere with their rights in this matter, why a native Government should now try to take these rights from them.  I would ask Deputy Cunningham to tell the Minister bluntly in this House, as he has no doubt told him in the lobbies, that he has been under duress and pressure by his constituents in North Donegal who are closely identified with the mart in Carndonagh which Deputy Cunningham visits consistently every week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has now been forced to deny that he is under pressure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What has this to do with the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It has this to do with it, Sir, that with the Government's majority, they will not accept the amendment but will bulldoze the Bill through the House.  If I can reason with Deputy Cunningham and the Minister, I may be able in some way to help the people who have sent me here and who have sent Deputy Cunningham and the Minister here. If they cannot see the wood for the <Col N="152" /> trees, it is my duty to try to brighten the horizon for them.  It is for this reason that I appeal to Deputy Cunningham, to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>What is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Read it.  The back benchers of Fianna Fáil do not know what business is being carried on in this House, but when we call for a quorum they come into the House like bulldogs and Irish terriers protesting against being disturbed in their sleep and being brought in to earn the allowance of £1,500 given to them.  The amendment before the House is that the Government should delete from the section the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; and substitute for it the words &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo;.  We ask this because we feel that the small farmers around Bridgend and Burnfoot, an area well known to Deputy Cunningham, should be allowed to conduct the sale of cattle on their small holdings as they did in the past.  If we substitute &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo; for &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;, it will be abundantly clear to the average individual that unless he uses his premises for the consistent sale of cattle, he will be free to sell his own cattle in the future as in the past.</P>
      <P>I hope I have made that clear to Deputy Cunningham, and if he now understands the business before the House, we will continue with it.  These small farmers have used this method of selling cattle in the past.  Tradition dies hard in Ireland and it is a challenge to the rights of the individual, a threat to his rights as a citizen, that the Minister should include &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; instead of accepting the amendment to use the words &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy explain that, because it is far from clear to anybody else?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>If a small farmer claims the right to sell his cattle as his father and his grandfather did, if he interferes with the present arrangement of his farmyard, either as Deputy Clinton said, by putting out a few bales of straw, or as Deputy Donegan said, by putting out farmyard machinery to control the cattle while they are being&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>My claim is that if the buyers or the audience who come out of curiosity, form a circle to keep the cattle under control while the auctioneer tries to get the highest price possible, it could quite easily be accepted or claimed by Members on this side of the House, and indeed by farmers who wish to avail of this method to sell their cattle, that they are breaking the law&mdash;that from now on they will not be allowed to use this method of selling livestock.  That is my interpretation of &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;&mdash;that the farmyard can be adapted for the sale of cattle whereas if the farmyard were reconstructed of something concrete like what Deputy Cunningham described, then it would be a recognised permanent place for the sale of cattle and any person using that place could come within the ambit of this legislation. People using this traditional method for the sale of cattle in Donegal are merely using it to sell their own cattle or the cattle of their next door neighbours.  It is a small afternoon auction, as Deputy Cunningham will bear out.</P>

      <P>I have no other method of asking the Government to accept this amendment than by appealing to Deputy Cunningham, who represents the same people as I represent, who comes from the same constituency, who understands the same problems as I understand.  The Minister, while a different person, I agree, from Deputy Cunningham, should appreciate those problems in the same way as Deputy Cunningham and I appreciate them.  He should recognise, to a greater extent indeed than Deputy Cunningham, who has no connection, to my knowledge, with the agricultural commmunity other than by conversation or making himself concerned with the problems of the agricultural community&mdash;I do not know if Deputy Cunningham is at all engaged in the business of agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I am asking it again this morning, as Deputy Cunningham refused to do this until this morning.  It is quite understandable because of the Minister's influence and because he bluntly told Deputy Cunningham to watch his path.  Both Deputy Cunningham and the Minister yesterday evening discussed this.  If Deputy Cunningham has not succeeded in persuading the Minister <Col N="158" /> to do as his constituents in Donegal have requested him to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude, if you will allow me, by saying that if I have not succeeded in conveying my thoughts to Deputy Carty, if I have not succeeded in persuading Deputy Cunningham again to try to influence the Minister outside the House because he cannot succeed in doing it in the House, unless this amendment is accepted, the people who try to use this traditional method of selling cattle will have to seek a permit either from the local court or from some other local or other authority or will be breaking the law if this legislation is passed.  That is as I see it, whereas the simple solution to it all is for the Government to accept this amendment to delete the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Our argument is first and foremost that we are against this Bill, but if we must have it, let us have it in the form most acceptable to the people who have seen fit to send us here.  If this is not accepted by the Government, then the threat as I see it is not to me or to Deputy Cunningham because we can use the modern ways of selling cattle.  I repeat: tradition dies hard and, if the existing method has proved a satisfactory way for farmers to sell their cattle, I see no God-given right bestowed on a native Irish Government to impede or obstruct that method of selling cattle.  It is for that reason I repeat again and again my argument that, if Deputy Cunningham would cease being a &ldquo;yes-man&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have learned this morning that it is a much more pleasant duty to represent the southern end of Ireland here in this House than it is apparently to represent the northern end of the country. The reasons are obvious.  In the south, we do not keep tabs on who calls on whom or who makes representations to someone else; we are too busy looking after our constituents and doing our own business.  We have no time for watching our colleagues and we should be very worried, indeed, if the position which apparently obtains in Donegal were to obtain in South-West Cork.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary just one question.  It arises out of Deputy Harte's statement and it is the only reason for my intervention in this debate.  Will the dispersal sale in a farmyard be interfered with in any way?</P>

In fact, &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; seems to me to be a better term than either &ldquo;constructed&rdquo; or &ldquo;reconstructed&rdquo;.  However, that is just a personal view.  Now, after the disposal of a farm the farmer holds a dispersal sale; the auctioneer advertises 20 head of cattle to be sold on a certain date.

      <P>I do not know if Deputy Murphy is aware of what may happen as a result of the change proposed&mdash;to delete &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo;. There will be people who will apply for licences for existing marts and others who will apply for licences for new marts.  Many marts have already replaced fairs and have replaced them on the location where the fairs were held before the advent of the marts.  That will be done in future.  However, if we insert the words &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo;, where it is proposed to establish a mart instead of holding a fair, it will be made more difficult under this amendment for the interested group to get a licence for that mart.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able for once to agree with Deputy Cunningham about something.  This Bill does not cover fairs, but there is no doubt whatsoever that the construetion of section 1 of the Bill, if not amended, will and must cover dispersal sales and the courts must, under section 1, convict any auctioneer who throws a rope around an area in a farmyard at a dispersal sale in order to adapt that yard.  It is no use Deputy Cunningham shaking his head.  Ask anybody.  What both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have said is something quite different and they have codded Deputy Cunningham. What was said was that the Minister can, if he wishes, make an exemption from this under section 4.</P>
      <P>That is not the proper way in which to draw legislation.  The way to draw it is to ensure that it is not necessary for a farmer, who wants to have a dispersal sale in his own farmyard and who sets up a soapbox for the auctioneer and ropes off a section to keep the cattle back, to go cap in hand to the Minister for an exemption, and it should not be necessary for the auctioneer to go cap in hand to seek either a particular or a general exemption. The proper way to deal with the situation is so to phrase legislation that this contingency will not be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, of course, the Minister were a reasonable man, instead of taking the line of bullying his way through by getting this Bill at the tail-end of a session, merely because of his own personal pride, we would have had the Bill drafted by the parliamentary draftsman in such a way that it would have carried out those instructions if the instructions were given to omit a case such as a dispersal sale.  The position is perfectly clear under section <Col N="163" /> 1.  Incidentally, Deputy Cunningham showed he did not know what the section means: he made it clear he thought it was only where a business, as he understood it, was included.  If that was the explanation given to the Fianna Fáil Party, then it is not true. The section as it stands defines &ldquo;business&rdquo; and it is not business as we understand it at all, but a business is an auctioneer, in one single case in one single way, providing somewhere in the yard of a farmer, adapting it, to sell his cattle on a dispersal sale&mdash;one single case.  That is not a business as we understand it but it is caught by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not like this Bill.  I do not think it is necessary.  I can understand a difference of opinion between myself and the people on the other side of the House in relation to the general week-in week-out selling in a mart, as we understand it, of hundreds of cattle. That is a business undoubtedly in the form and the term of business as it is understood by the ordinary layman. That, I can understand.  I do not think it is desirable that there should be this ministerial power to prevent a person from carrying on this business unless he kow-tows to the wishes of the Minister for the time being.  Be that as it may, there is no excuse for the provision in this section as it stands that a person who on one single occasion throws a rope around portion of a field to sell cattle by auction at a dispersal sale and takes bids must have a licence to do so and section 1, if not amended, in this way means just that.</P>
    <P>The amendment by Deputy O'Higgins means, in effect, that the type of auction to be caught by the terms of section 1 has to be what we understand by a mart in the ordinary proper sense of the term, something that is made, that is properly constructed to have sales week-in and week-our.  For Deputy Cunningham to suggest that this would make it more difficult under this Bill is the antithesis of sense.  The Minister has made up his mind and quite clearly has given instructions to his Parliamentary Secretary that no amendment of any sort is to be considered <Col N="164" /> on its merits.  He wants to use the big stick and to act the bully in relation to this Bill.  He got a bit of a shock on 28th June last when he asked, and when the Taoiseach asked, for an endorsement of their policy throughout the country.  If the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary and the members of Fianna Fáil are so certain that this is a good Bill, we shall give them every facility to put this Bill to the country in a referendum.  We shall even agree quickly to the appropriate referendum machinery.  Then we shall see whether or not the country wants the Bill but, in this method they are now adopting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am quite certain, for one thing, that the country would overwhelmingly reject any question of the ordinary dispersal sale, when a man is changing his farm, being included in a licensing provision as this section does and will include it unless the amendment is accepted.  There is no case being made at all this morning against the amendment except that made by Deputy Cunningham and, quite clearly, Deputy Cunningham is under a misapprehension as to the meaning of the section and the meaning of the amendment, as a result, I suspect, of having been misled by the Minister.  The viewpoint that is being put in relation to this is a clear one and the Minister, if he had not shut his eyes and his ears to proper drafting, would undoubtedly accept Deputy O'Higgins's amendment or one following it very closely.</P>

      <P>There are one or two points that now appear quite striking in relation to the Minister's real intention regarding this Bill.  It is quite obvious that he seeks powers so far-reaching that I think the people are not, as yet, even aware of, and <Col N="165" /> only as this debate proceeds are we beginning to realise the far-reaching powers he is seeking in this Bill.  Some Deputies opposite are trying to convey the impression that this amendment is a mere quibbling over terminology but the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;, as used in the Bill, is of much greater significance than meets the eye.  As the Minister said last night, adaptation means to make something fit or suitable, and a place can easily be adapted for the purpose of conducting a sale by auction, whether it be in a farmer's yard, as Deputy Sweetman said, by providing a soapbox for the auctioneer and a rope to keep back the crowd, or in any type of temporary structure. I understood that this Bill was a Livestock Marts Bill by which the Minister was seeking power to control the livestock marts, but it is now quite obvious that he is not merely seeking to control and regulate the livestock marts but seeking control over sales by auction whether these are held in an existing livestock mart, in a farmer's yard, or in a field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Acceptance of this amendment would make this Bill much more precise and much more definite.  The main argument advanced by the Minister when introducing the Bill was that under the EEC regulations, it was essential that the livestock marts should be brought up to the highest standards of hygiene and so forth and that strict conditions should be laid down, if and when we went into the EEC.  However, as I said, the Minister is seeking power not merely to control the livestock marts but to control livestock sales by auction in any type of temporary structure or any place which may even be adapted only temporarily for this purpose.  It is a simple job to adapt a place for the sale of livestock by auction and, therefore, this amendment, far from being material for a lawyer's argument, as some Deputy opposite said, is very relevant and very necessary for the purpose of defining what type of place may be termed a livestock mart.  If the Minister accepted this amendment, he would be going a long way towards clarifying the position and arriving at some type of <Col N="166" /> definition of the powers which he seeks in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; is very vague and very loose.  It is to be assumed that the Minister will be the final authority in this matter but he does not give the House any indication of what regulations and conditions must be complied with before he regards a place as qualifying for the sale of livestock by auction. What regulations will have to be complied with before a place can be deemed to have been adapted for the sale of livestock by auction?  Deputy O'Higgins suggests that we delete the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo;, which is a very logical argument for the reason that a place can easily be adapted but I cannot see how a place can be adapted for the sale of livestock under the terms of this Bill unless a certain amount of construction work, or perhaps reconstruction work, is undertaken.  You can have adaptation on a temporary basis or you can have permanent adaptation.</P>
    <P>We argue that by the insertion of these words in the amendment there would be no doubt that the place was a place which had been constructed for the sale of livestock by auction and in which all the ancillary facilities would be provided, that there would be no doubt in anybody's mind that this was a place constructed or reconstructed for the sale of livestock by auction and not, as the Minister's terminology says, by using the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;, a place which may be used on one occasion only.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment because it is necessary to clarify what can be deemed a place in which the sale of livestock by auction may be permitted under the Bill.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary for some clarification in regard to his intentions and those of the Government in relation to the definition section and what the Government want to embrace in it. I understood, as did other Deputies, that the Minister's intention was to bring in legislation which would enable him to control livestock marts.  I understood <Col N="167" /> that the Minister's efforts were directed towards the question of the sale of livestock by auction in those marts, and that it was only ar eagla na h-eagla that the Minister introduced the phrase &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; into the definition section in case there might be methods by which the terms of the Act could be evaded and, ar eagla na h-eagla, he wanted to get that covered.</P>
      <P>I do not think there was any suggestion of a deliberate intention by the Government to extend this Bill in such a way that it could interfere with private sales by a man of his own livestock in his own premises.  The case I want to make to the House&mdash;I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to answer it and to correct me if i am incorrect in anything I say&mdash;is this: as the definition section stands, if we allow it to remain unaltered, there is grave danger that private sales by a man of his own livestock in his own premises will be subject to the licensing and other restrictions it is intended to impose if this Bill ever becomes an Act.</P>
      <P>I do not think I am alone in that view.  Deputy Booth contributed from time to time to the discussion on this section.  When speaking on Friday last, 14th July, at column 1800, he gave his view&mdash;admittedly, it was in relation to another amendment, but it is very relevant to this one&mdash;of the situation that was going to be brought about by this Bill.  At that column Deputy Booth said:</P>
      <P>What we are trying to do here is to see that anyone who adapts premises for the sale of livestock, whether that sale is by auction or any other way, who is providing special premises for the sale of livestock comes under this Act&mdash;by way of auction or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first query to the Parliamentary Sceretary is whether or not Deputy Booth is correct in that statement, whether he has correctly interpreted the effect of this section as it stands? I am quite sure Deputy Booth considered the matter carefully&mdash;he has shown considerable interest in the discussion&mdash;before he made that statement. <Col N="168" /> Having considered the matter, he came to a particular conclusion. That conclusion is that we are trying to make the Bill apply to anyone who adapts premises for the sale of livestock, whether that sale is by auction or any other way; anyone who is providing special premises for the sale of livestock comes under this Act, he says, by way of auction or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Booth is correct in his assessment of the effect of this section if it remains unaltered.  As matters stand, if the Government persist in their refusal to accept this amendment or any other amendment endeavouring to modify or restrict what I assumed was the original intention of the Government in the application of this section, I think Deputy Booth is right and the section is going to be wide enough to cover any premises that are adapted for the sale of livestock.</P>
    <P>If that is so, it means, to my mind, that this Bill when an Act will apply in such circumstances whether a person is dealing with his own livestock or not.  It did not occur to me that that was the intention of the Government in this connection.  I assumed that the Government, and every Deputy supporting the Government, visualised a situation when this Bill had passed in which the various regulations to be made under it, the licensing provisions and so on, would apply only to what all of us would regard as the genuine livestock mart&mdash;the mart that was there for the business of conducting sales of livestock by auction.  It now seems, first, that it is not going to be necessary to sell by auction in order to bring in the operation of this Bill when enacted, but also that there is grave danger&mdash;I am sorry Deputy Booth is not here for I could put it plainly to him, but it would seem from what I have quoted that he agrees with this&mdash;that this Bill will apply to a sale by a man of his own livestock, whether by auction or otherwise, in his own premises.</P>
    <P>I would ask the eight or ten Fianna Fáil Deputies in the House if they ever contemplated that situation arising when they gave their support to the Government for the introduction <Col N="169" /> of this Bill.  Did they ever visualise a situation in which any of them who are farmers or the owners of livestock might find that, purely by the accidental or temporary adaptation of their paddock or yard, they were going to be caught under the provisions of this Bill and were going to make themselves liable to penalties of six months in jail or a fine of £1,000 if they had not had foresight to secure a licence before they sold their beasts in their own premises?  I do not think for a second that any Fianna Fáil Deputy visualised that that position could arise.  As I see it, if the Government insist rigidly on standing over this definition section without alterations, without allowing any amendment which will modify it as we are suggesting in this amendment here, that situation could conceivably arise.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to concede straight away that it is not the intention of the present Minister or of the Parliamentary Secretary when this Bill becomes an Act to operate it in the way I suggest; but it would be open to be operated in that way by a strict viewing of the wording of the definition section as it stands.  Remember, Deputy Booth says that what we are trying to do here is to see that anyone who adapts premises for the sale of livestock will be caught.  I am summarising the rest of his remarks.  Later on, he refers to a person providing special premises for the sale of livestock coming under this Bill.  If a farmer provides special premises in his own property for the sale of his own livestock, is it right that that man should be required to get a licence under this Bill?  Remember, that is what all this talk is about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to feel I could legitimately enlarge the debate on this amendment, but I am not trying to do so.  This amendment is to restrict the terms of the definition. The quotation which I have given from Deputy Booth shows the dangers of adhering to the word &ldquo;adapt&rdquo; in this section and my amendment is to cut out the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; completely and substitute instead of it &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The position, if my amendment is accepted, is that every farmer will know where he stands.  He will know that so long as he continues as he has been doing, conducting his own sales of his livestock in the field to a neighbour or to a buyer, no Minister can interfere with him in so conducting his business, because, if my amendment is accepted, he would not be required to get a licence until he actively and positively constructs or reconstructs his premises so that they are then constructed or reconstructed for the sale of livestock by auction. If we do not accept that amendment, if we do not modify the provisions of this definition section, then the interpretation which Deputy Booth gave, I think, rightly, must stand and any farmer who even accidentally or as a temporary measure adapts his premises&mdash;it does not matter whether it is a building or an open field&mdash;for the sale of livestock by auction will be caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it bluntly to the Parliamentary Secretary, whether or not this Bill is being designed for the purpose of preventing farmers from selling their own beasts on their own property in whatever manner they want to sell them.  Surely that is the kernel of the matter.  If the Parliamentary Secretary or his Minister gets up and says: &ldquo;We intend by this Bill to ensure that no farmer will in future be able to auction off his own beasts at the best price he can obtain on his own land, that no farmer will in future be able to strike a bargain with his neighbour if he has, before doing that, adapted his premises so as to make them suitable for the auction of livestock&rdquo;, then all the Deputies, particularly those from rural areas, sitting <Col N="171" /> behind the Minister will have second thoughts about continuing their support for this Bill and the provisions contained in it.</P>
    <P>Remember, Deputy Booth, having studied this definition section, has given his view as to what it means.  I do not want to repeat myself but in fairness to Deputy Booth who is here now, I think I should call his attention to the particular matter to which he referred.</P>

      <P>I will come back to Deputy Booth in a minute, provided he stays.  The danger to which I have referred is accentuated by&mdash;I will not say his admission because he did not say it in the spirit of admission&mdash;the Minister's declaration that the meaning of the word &ldquo;adapt&rdquo; was to make fit or suitable.  What I am principally concerned about in what I am saying is the position of the man who wants to sell his own beasts.  The Minister, when he defined the word &ldquo;adapt&rdquo; as meaning to make fit or suitable, made it clear as to how he reads this definition.  I do not think it is necessary to deal with the first part of the definition, which deals with the business of selling livestock by auction, but the second part of the definition, if we take the Minister's meaning of the word &ldquo;adapt&rdquo; as to make fit or suitable, would read as follows:</P>
      <P>or providing for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise a place made fit or suitable for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>

      <P>Deputy Booth stated here on Friday last, at column 1800 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>What we are trying to do here is to see that anyone who adapts premises for the sale of livestock, whether that sale is by auction or any other way, who is providing special premises for the sale of livestock, comes under this Act&mdash;by way of auction or otherwise.</P>
      <P>That is Deputy Booth's view.  I have already said in the Deputy's absence that I am sure he came to that conclusion after giving this section very great consideration and attention.  I think the Deputy is right, not that he is right in saying that that is what we are trying to do here, but that he is right in that that would be the effect of what we are doing here, if we allow this definition to remain unaltered. That worries me, coming from Deputy Booth, who, although not now in practice as such, was eminent in the legal profession in this city for many years, who has considerable legal experience and legal training. That is Deputy Booth's pronounced judgment on the effect of this section if we leave it unaltered. That means, to my mind&mdash;and this, again, is the crux of the matter&mdash;that we are going to prohibit a man selling his own beasts on his own land unless he obtains a licence or is exempt, if he has done anything to adapt his land to make it fit or suitable for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>

      <P>Deputy Booth, according to his contribution before, seems to think there will be a distinction under this section, in such circumstances where the place has been adapted, between the sale by a man of his own stock and the sale by a man of somebody else's stock.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>All right. What the Deputy said, in any event, is this: &ldquo;If Deputy Clinton were to take Deputy Dillon's cattle in and sell them I cannot see anybody catching Deputy Dillon on that, but if Deputy Dillon, as a matter of practice, had adapted part of his own farm for the sale of Deputy Clinton's cattle or anybody else's cattle, then he would be coming into the livestock business.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I read that, Deputy Booth's view is that a man would not be in danger if he is selling his own beasts but he would be in danger under this Bill if he sells somebody else's beasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

      <P>The danger then is that of accidentally being captured by this definition.  I do not think that the majority of the Fianna Fáil Deputies relish this kind of legislation. They are prepared to go along with it on the arguments that have been presented to them by the Government, but I imagine they are only prepared to go along with it provided it does not interfere with a man's right to sell his own cattle privately on his own land.  The danger here is that that right will be affected if we do not amend this definition.  If the amendment which I have suggested here is accepted, in my judgment a person will not then be caught by this Act unless he deliberately <Col N="174" /> constructs or reconstructs his premises so as to have it then a place for the sale of livestock by auction.  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if there is any objection under this Bill to a man selling his own livestock whether by auction or otherwise.</P>

However, the Minister for Local Government may be able to give the House some information on this subject. Before Deputy Booth interrupted me I was querying the position of the proprietor of a proper livestock mart who either fails to get a licence under this legislation, if it is passed, or who, having got a licence, then finds that licence is revoked by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I do not mind what the reason is.  The example I am giving and the case I want to have considered and replied to is the case where there are premises that are a livestock mart within the ordinary known meaning, and that mart becomes unlicensed for any reason: the proprietor may own livestock; he may not have any place else in which he can sell them or exhibit them for sale.  Will he be precluded from selling his livestock on those premises, selling his own beasts?  Is that intended under these provisions?  I am not talking now about the man who wants to contravene the provisions of this Bill and conduct auctions or sales for other people on his unlicensed livestock mart premises, but the man who merely wants to sell his own beast on his own premises.</P>

      <P>There would be no occasion for repetition if Deputies did not need to ask for further <Col N="176" /> information on it.  However, as long as I am within the rules of order, I shall seek an answer to that question.  I think the House is entitled to it.  It is important in our consideration of this Bill to have an answer to this question and I think many Fianna Fáil Deputies, not excluding some eminent Deputies who may temporarily find themselves in a difficult position, would like to get an answer to that question.  Remember, we have Deputy Booth's judgment on the definition section; we have the Minister's definition of the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;.  The whole trouble arises because the Government have decided that the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; must remain in this section.  The difficulty can be solved very easily if the Government agree to delete that word and accept this amendment that the requirement to be imposed on people whose premises require licensing under this legislation, should be that something positive and concrete should be done.  That can be provided by, instead of using the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;, providing in the definition that the premises must be constructed or reconstructed for the particular purpose for which the Bill is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham in dealing with this amendment yesterday, and, I think, today &mdash; I did not hear him today but I understand he did contribute&mdash;made what I think is a valid point.  He adverted to a danger that it is valid to point out but, in fact, the danger does not exist under this amendment.  As I understand his view, he felt that if this amendment is accepted the position is being made more onerous for those who seek or propose to seek licences for the establishment and operation of livestock marts.  As I understand his argument, it is that at the moment all you need to do is to adapt your premises but that if this amendment is accepted a heavier burden is attached in that you must then construct or reconstruct.  I think the Deputy is missing the point that this is the definition section and that if the modification which I am recommending is accepted it would mean that only those premises that were constructed or reconstructed would then require to be licensed under this legislation and that the <Col N="177" /> other premises or places the Deputy has in mind and which have merely been adapted, whether for a short or a long period, would not require to be licensed at all.  Consequently, there is no question of this amendment making conditions more onerous for a person proposing to apply for a licence and no question of any greater hardship being involved for an applicant for a licence in respect of a proposed livestock mart.</P>
    <P>The whole idea of the amendment is to ease the position, to limit in some way the requirement of the licensing provisions; to limit the scope of the Bill; to restrict the definition and to confine as far as we can the net that the Government are throwing out in this definition section.  I ask Deputy Cunningham to consider the amendment afresh in the light of what I am saying and to put entirely from his mind any fear in regard to this amendment to take out the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;&mdash;is Deputy Booth going?  I want to come to the Deputy in a moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to substitute the words &ldquo;construct or reconstruct.&rdquo;  He can put out of his mind any fear in that regard.  To my mind, the danger he sees is not there because in the circumstances envisaged by the amendment, the licensing provisions and the exemption provisions in section 4, the provisions concerning regulation and so on, in&mdash;I think&mdash;section 6 will not apply to that premises or place.  The proprietor of such a place will be able to continue to sell his livestock, or even sell his neighbours' or his customers' livestock, in that place without any interference by the Minister or the Legislature, without any danger that he can be required by an officer of the Minister, accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána, to give information under penalty of committing an offence.  None of that machinery will apply to such a place if this amendment is accepted but if it is not accepted all that danger does arise.  The danger of a place finding itself, merely because some adaptation is being made, coming within the net cast by <Col N="178" /> the definition section might arise in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Booth is not here but I suppose I shall get another opportunity of discussing this with him. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary now to take this opportunity of answering the specific questions I have put to him in connection with this amendment. Deputies who have spoken to the amendment have made it clear that we regard it as a matter of considerable importance.  I feel that the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that these matters are best discussed and thrashed out fully here in the course of the Committee Stage discussion on a Bill of this sort.  His contribution to the discussion would be welcomed not only by Deputies in his own Party but by the Deputies opposite.</P>

      <P>While the Parliamentary Secretary is tuning up to make this profound reply&mdash;which I very much doubt he will make&mdash;I express the hope that Deputy de Valera will intervene in this debate.  He is a lawyer and professes to have&mdash;and I always believed he has&mdash;a veneration for the law.  What this Bill is doing, by the Minister's admission, is seeking to encompass everybody within its control, and having done that, to leave it to the Minister under section 4 to exempt people seriatim.  I think Deputy de Valera will agree that it is a sound principle of legislation that we here in the House, when we settle the terms of an Act for the Oireachtas, should set out clearly what the intention of the Oireachtas is.  If that is not our purpose why have a long Bill?  Why not a Bill which says that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries can do whatever he likes subject to regulations made by himself.</P>
      <P>That is the purpose of this amendment. The purpose of this amendment is to say to the Minister that if he wants to use the majority of which he disposes to acquire the powers in the 12 sections of this Bill, let us know and let us say and tell the judiciary in explicit terms to whom these powers are to be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not make the case <Col N="179" /> that his Bill, as introduced and as now before us, does that.  Deputy Cunningham intervened at an earlier stage of this discussion and said with reference to a particular case cited by us&mdash;that is covered, that is included as being the business of a livestock mart.  The Minister made one of his rare interventions to tell Deputy Cunningham that he was wrong, that it was not. Then, it was pointed out to the Minister that Deputy Cunningham was right, but that within the definition as here contained in section 1 that category of business was, in fact, included.  &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said the Minister, &ldquo;what do you think I put section 4 into the Bill for?&rdquo;.  Section 4 is the section under which the Minister has power to exempt any body by name from the operation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Who is right?  Is it we who want to set out in the definition of this Bill a clear, precise directive to the judiciary as to who is to be covered by the terms of the Bill, or is it the Government who want to take within the ambit of the Bill practically all dealing of cattle or livestock, with a general power to the Minister to exempt those whom he does not want to see included.</P>
    <P>This proposal is evil in itself, but what is worse is that the precedent which the Minister seeks here to establish is an evil precedent of legislation and it is one to which every executive bends more especially when he disposes of an adequate majority in the House.  Every executive is tempted to come to the Oireachtas and say: &ldquo;Look, we must proceed on the assumption that this legislation will be reasonably operated.  Therefore, it is safe to ask for every power we require and we will at our discretion shed it.&rdquo;  Does Deputy de Valera believe that a sound principle of legislation here?  There is another step and that is to stop Deputies from legislating. Listen, let us not go through the farce of legislating at all.  Give us for four months the power to legislate what is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputies to their eternal credit have resented this.  They have learned to <Col N="180" /> their cost that it is not the last time that such an imposition will be put on them.  I want to warn the House that if Dáil Éireann accepts the proposition, which the Minister admits, that this definition section includes a considerable number of persons to whom he designed the Bill ought to apply but that he will exempt them by executive Act, that precedent will be quoted hereafter and we will be told in the future: &ldquo;Do not look at the definition section of the Bill: it does not matter.  If there is any flaw that transpires during the operation of the Act it can always be remedied by law&rdquo;.  But, surely the logical next step is not to legislate at all.</P>
    <P>So long as we are here we will not give the executive that power.  We will not pretend to our people that Parliament is functioning when, in fact, it is only functioning so long as its directives to the judiciary are clear, precise and certain and understood by every citizen of the State.</P>
    <P>The Deputies who sit in this House, particularly those who sat here for some time, may be reasonably deemed to be people more competent to understand the terms of a statute of this House than ordinary citizens.  Yet, we have Deputy Cunningham and Deputy Booth interjecting, and I am gratified to see that Deputy de Valera has fled from the House because I know his mind.  He is revolted by this procedure and when you tackle poor Deputy Booth and put his nose to the grinding stone he flees from the scene.  Deputy Cunningham has stayed on but he will be gone in a minute particularly if one brings him to terms.</P>
    <P>They do not understand the definition section of this Bill.  It is not we on this side of the House who have convinced them of misapprehension. It is their own Minister who has told Deputy Booth and Deputy Cunningham to shut up, that they are only putting their feet in it.  They have, in my opinion, correctly interpreted and seen that the definition as it now stands includes persons to whom nobody believed the Bill was designed to apply.</P>
    <P>The purpose of our amendment, which we are now discussing and <Col N="181" /> which is number 2 on the amendment sheet, is an effort to restrict the application of the Act to a limited and ascertainable section of the community. I could understand the Minister saying that that limitation is not reasonable, but he admits the House is not satisfied with the proposal to give a carryover definition clause, with an exemption section which will give him the right to exclude such persons as he thinks ought to be excluded and that he will bring forward a definition clause designed to say in section 1 precisely what persons are to be controlled. If he does that, we will give ear to the proposal with sympathy.</P>
    <P>We dislike the Bill.  We think it is bad.  We know it is a Bill that was conceived in anger, drafted in haste and bears on its face all the marks of that operation.  But it would be good, with all its flaws, if in the definition section at least, we ascertained to what categories of persons it is to apply.  The Minister has told us that that category is not certain, that it is not even yet ascertained but that he has power, under section 4, to do what may be necessary hereafter to provide the certainty we think ought to be provided by Oireachtas Éireann, and not by the act of the Executive which this Oireachtas is supposed to control.  Let us have no illusion about it: we have a duty to discharge, that is, to maintain the ultimate sovereignty of the Oireachtas over the Executive.  We shall do it by every means at our disposal and, mind you, those means are by no means yet exhausted.</P>

      <P>I want to make just one brief point on this section.  Seemingly, from the Government benches, we have three different definitions of the word &ldquo;adapt&rdquo;.  We have one from the Minister, one from Deputy Booth and another from Deputy Cunningham, and I think last night Deputy Clinton was asked to define the word &ldquo;reconstruct&rdquo;. He did that, and did it extraordinarily well.  That is the definition of the word, and that is the reason Deputy O'Higgins, in the name of the Fine Gael Party, put down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> I should like to put this to the Minister, Deputy Booth, or Deputy Cunningham.  In my constituency we have still the old procedure of the fairs in the various towns.  We have a very limited number of cattle marts but we also had a procedure which existed for many years, up to about two years ago, prior to the price falling out of the cattle trade.  Even away back in the time of the late Senator John D. Sheridan who used to come to the west of Ireland and, as he said himself, would have an order for maybe 200 or 300 head.  Sometimes it would be blue heifers; sometimes it would be 2½ year-old bullocks, or some other type of beast&mdash;as he termed it&mdash;for which he had an order.  He usually got in touch with one or two farmers and asked them to take the particular type of beast to a particular centre, or to a farmer's outhouse, farmyard, or some other place.  He duly arrived and proceeded to buy those beasts.  Now, this man made a point of going, maybe once, twice or three times a year.  Do I take it that if that is the position, the people who were selling their cattle there will now have to have a licence, that is, if my farm was used this time, I must, under this section now obtain a licence for the sale of those cattle perhaps once, twice or three times a year?</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth clearly stated this morning in respect of anybody who makes a practice of it, who will decide the number of times it will be done in the year or whether or not it will be a practice.  I should like the Minister to enlighten me on that, or do I take it that this can no longer go on without a licence?  In my opinion, it cannot, and that is my reason for supporting this amendment.  The Minister should re-examine his conscience and think of those people in the west of Ireland.  It is often very convenient for farmers there to take their cattle on a given day to their neighbours' farms or perhaps up the road half a mile, where some buyer will arrive and buy them.  It would save them time and the responsibility of getting their cattle either into a fair or a cattle mart, which probably would mean most of a day, and they would be able <Col N="183" /> to transact their business in a couple of hours.  The Minister should examine his conscience about this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment we are discussing is very important. It is designed to safeguard the rights of the individual.  Fianna Fáil give lip service to the principle of cherishing all the children of the nation equally. If this section is passed with the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; in it, it means that a farmer, going about his lawful business, who adapts a place and sells cattle, faces six months in Mountjoy or a fine up to £1,000 for selling his cattle on his own land in a place adapted for an auction.  Deputy Booth, in volume 229 at column 1800 said:</P>
      <P>What we are trying to do here is to see that anyone who adapts premises for the sale of livestock, whether that sale is by auction or any other way, who is providing special premises for the sale of livestock, comes under this Act&mdash;by way of auction or otherwise.</P>
      <P>We may take it that in the case of a farmer who adapts his field or yard, if a man comes to him to buy cattle he has to put them in somewhere, has to rail the area off, even if with bales of straw.  According to the wording of the Bill, that would be &ldquo;adapting&rdquo; and would come within the provisions of the Bill.  It would then be up to that farmer to go on bended knee to the Minister to get a licence from him; if he did not he would be breaking the regulations and could face six months in jail or a £1,000 fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the most dangerous sections in a dangerous and vindictive Bill.  The Bill is bringing an important co-operative enterprise&mdash;set up without Government help, without Government grant and functioning efficiently&mdash; under Government control.  According to Fianna Fáil speakers and the Minister, it was the intention to control marts in the interests of the farmers. Surely if this word is left in this section of the Bill, it will not be controlling marts in the interests of the farmers? <Col N="184" /> There is no doubt that it would be detrimental to the farmers and, for that reason, Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, on behalf of this Party, put down this amendment.</P>
    <P>It may be hard to know what is in the mind of the Minister at times.  We do know why he introduced the Bill, but it is a vindictive Bill, aimed at crushing a particular organisation.  At the same time, on Friday, 14th July, 1967, in volume 229 of the Dáil Debates, at column 1802, he said:</P>
    <P>There is no question whatsoever, nor is there any implication in the section, or in the part of it being discussed, that sales in the manner outlined by Deputy Dillon, in the widow's field somewhere down the country, will be interfered with in the slightest degree by the words contained in the phrase which are objected to.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;not&rdquo; should be inserted there.  What the Minister meant to say was &ldquo;will not be interfered with in the slightest degree by the word in the phrase objected to.&rdquo;  It is interesting to recall those words: &ldquo;There is no question that sales will not be interfered with in the slightest degree.&rdquo;  The words we were objecting to were the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;.  Can the Minister give us the same assurance and guarantee that they will not be interfered with now by the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; which is also in this section.  He has given an assurance to the House that they will not be interfered with by the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; and we on this side of the House would like him now to give the same assurance in regard to &ldquo;adapted.&rdquo;  Assurances from the Minister here in this House are no use.  It is, as Deputy Dillon stated what is stated in the Bill that matters and it should be clear, precise and understandable because the court will have to rule on what is in the Bill.  A judge will interpret the law as it is set out in this section.</P>
    <P>There are still buyers going around the country who call to a farmer's place&mdash;a farmer who may have 25, 30 or 40 cattle to sell.  He has to get them into a part of his farm that is adapted for that particular sale, let it be a sale <Col N="185" /> by hand, by auction or otherwise.  We, on this side of the House, claim that under this section that farmer is caught while doing his own legitimate business and faces a fine of £1,000 or six months in jail.  Deputy Reynolds mentioned parks near towns and people in the west of Ireland and the south of Ireland bringing in cattle the night before instead of having to take them in early the next morning.  Buyers come there and perhaps 30 per cent or 40 per cent of the cattle are sold the night before in those parts of the country. The same happens in the Dublin market. Cows are brought to yards the night before and buyers and dairymen go into those yards and buy those cows from the farmers.  I claim that under the Bill those people are caught, and I do not see why any farmer should have to go on his hands and knees to any Minister to appeal or to get a licence to sell his cattle.  As I have said, if the Minister does give the licence, he can revoke it afterwards. Such far-reaching powers should not be given to any man to control auctions or sales in marts or in the farmers' yards.</P>
    <P>It is very necessary to safeguard the greatest industry we have in this country.  It is carrying on efficiently and well and any interference by the Minister will do more harm than good. It would have been much better if the Minister devoted his energies to trying to see that the people got a fair price for their cattle and not using, as he is, the powers of Parliament to put through a Bill, a particular section of which is definitely detrimental to individual farmers and to all the farmers combined.  I would appeal to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> It seems to me as the discussion develops and as various amendments we have tabled from this side of the House have been rejected by the Minister, that his objective is to secure broad, extensive powers under this definition.  It certainly seems to me at this juncture that the Bill will operate in such a way that practically any form of livestock sale anywhere will come within its ambit because the definition of what is a livestock mart is a blanket definition.  I accept that it is not intended to apply in practice.  I believe the Minister's intention is that he wants a blanket definition but intends to make certain exemptions. He intends to make them on an individual basis, each case being judged on its merits.  There may be certain categories which he may intend to define but we are inviting him to define those categories now, and to incorporate them in the Bill so as to avoid the objectionable practice which will arise afterwards of having anybody and everybody going to public representatives and to the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>There are many forms of livestock sale activities which I presume will be exempted.  Questions have been raised here on several instances.  One that has been raised is the question of a man selling cattle on his own farm. Is he, under the terms of the Bill, conducting the business of selling his cattle on his own farm?  A relation of mine sold his cattle annually on his land.  He brought in an auctioneer and it was the practice, when he had his annual sale, for some neighbours to bring a few cattle as well.  Ordinary auctioneers do that when they are selling furniture, and the same applies to cattle.  The practice is followed all over the country.  Could he, therefore, be described as a person who was in the business of selling cattle?</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Assuming that Deputy Lemass was never inside a mart in his life, he might get some notion of how cattle are bought and sold all over the country if he visited a mart even once.  I was dealing with the amendment which seeks to provide that a person engaged in the selling of cattle by auction, or otherwise, should have his place constructed or reconstructed.  That is the burden of the amendment.</P>
      <P>I was dealing with a farmer selling cattle on his own land, perhaps annually, and perhaps seeking, very properly, to help his neighbours on occasion, by allowing them to introduce their own cattle.  That man has not, by construction or reconstruction, adapted his field to that purpose.  If the amendment is accepted, it will be obligatory on him to have his place so constructed or reconstructed as to come within the ambit of the Bill, and such a person will be automatically excluded under the exemptions which the Minister will make.  It would be completely irrational to stop this man from selling cattle on his own land. He will be exempted but he will have to apply for exemption.  Every such man will have to apply for exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why put every individual who wants to sell cattle on his own land to the trouble of filling up a complicated form, posting it to the Minister, waiting for some days or perhaps weeks, going to the local Deputy and asking why it has not come back, and inquiring here and there as to why his projected sale has not yet been exempted?  It would be a simple matter to accept this amendment and provide that the place must be specifically regarded as a place constructed or reconstructed for the purpose of selling livestock before it would be covered by this Bill.  Such a man would then be automatically exempt and could sell his cattle on his own land as he did the year before, <Col N="188" /> and the year before that, and as his father, and probably his grandfather, did before him.  It is to protect the rights of a person such as that that we want to incorporate this amendment and similar amendments in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Let me raise the case of a man selling cattle at a fair.  An ordinary open fair is not a place that has been constructed or reconstructed and therefore should not come within the ambit of the Bill, but as the Bill is phrased, it would.  Are the local authority who permit a fair to be run in a town in the west or the south of Ireland, or elsewhere, now to be held responsible and subject to a fine if a fair is held within their jurisdiction?  In some towns and villages, they have what are called toll fairs.  I do not know whether that is a proper dictionary word but they are called toll fairs and a poll tax is charged.  Sometimes the ownership of these poll taxes is very ill-defined.  It is handed down from father to son.  These taxes are collected but no facilities are provided.  Sometimes a weighing scales is provided or an attendant, to do a bit of droving.  Are these people to be held responsible?  They are conducting places for the auction of livestock. They have not carried out any construction or reconstruction.  I presume they should be exempt from the provisions of the Bill.  That would be the reasonable intention&mdash;if the Minister can ever be regarded as a reasonable man.  If this amendment were accepted, construction or reconstruction would have to be carried out for that specific purpose and therefore these people would be automatically exempt.</P>
    <P>It cannot be maintained that a local authority who allow a fair to be held in a street have done any specific construction or reconstruction.  Some of them provide weighing scales but not specifically for the fairs.  They are provided for anyone who wants to sell turnips or potatoes to local shopkeepers. It cannot be argued that a local authority have provided, by construction or reconstruction, facilities to carry on the sale and purchase of cattle.  By accepting this amendment, they would be exempt but under this Bill they would have to apply for an <Col N="189" /> exemption order which I believe would be given to them.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister means to shoot down the ordinary fairs. If this amendment were accepted, the local authorities and the people who collect poll tax would be exempt from any interference by the Minister and could continue with the fairs as usual if they wanted to do so.  I should like to know if the Minister intends to exempt these places.  If he does, why not accept our amendment and incorporate it in the Bill?  It could be said that every fair in the country whether cattle, sheep or pigs are sold, in which there has been no reconstruction, is an ordinary traditional type of fair and is outside this Bill.  I must assume that the Minister wants to take to himself powers by which he may or may not exempt from the provisions of this measure the markets and fairs which are traditional and, if the Minister is going to exempt this type of activity, he should accept this amendment so that these people will not have to go hat in hand asking him for exemption orders.</P>

      <P>Deputy Booth has been at pains to point out on some occasions that this Bill in its definition section, requires that a business be carried on before a transaction is captured by the section.  There is fair ground for making that statement but Deputy Cunningham has given his views with regard to the type of transaction which will require to be licensed, if the Bill goes through.  I want an answer from the Minister as to whether the type of farmyard auction Deputy Hogan and others have referred to is a transaction which requires a licence or an exemption order under the Bill.</P>
      <P>When we were discussing another matter on Friday of last week, Deputy Clinton referred to the type of farmyard sale other Deputies have in mind and on which Deputy Cunningham has given his views.  In column 1807 of volume 229 of the Dáil Debates of 14th July last, Deputy Clinton said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no limitation on the words <Col N="190" />&ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; or &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;.  I have seen hundreds of cows, and hundreds of calves sold in a farmer's yard where the only adaptation was the placing of a few bales of straw to make comfortable seating under cover for people who were there to bid.</P>
    <P>Here Deputy Cunningham intervened to say:</P>
    <P>It must be licensed.</P>
    <P>I wonder is that the answer to the question we have been asking.  If it is, then, to my mind, the position is extremely serious.  If the Dáil, having been alerted by Deputy Cunningham to the danger, allows this definition to pass without amendment or alteration we have then arrived at a situation where the farmyard sale requires a licence under this legislation, or else has to cease operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, on an earlier occasion, I think, quite properly, invited consideration of the exemption provisions in conjuncton with the definition section.  As the last speaker has said, it might be the intention of the Minister to make exemption orders in respect of the farmyard sales which Deputy Cunningham says require a licence. Deputy Cunningham later on adverted to the fact that if they were not licensed, they could get an exemption. I do not think that is a proper answer to the problem.  We do not know yet what the machinery is to be, what the requirements are to be for obtaining an exemption order.</P>
    <P>If either through inadvertence on the part of the farmer or for any other reason, an exemption order is not made and the farmer conducts a farmyard sale, he is then going to be put in peril of his liberty under the Bill and can find himself in the position in which, by not getting such licence or exemption order, he has committed an offence under the Bill for which the penalty may be as high as a fine of £1,000 or six months in prison.  Is it good enough that the House should contemplate quite blatantly passing legislation that may have that result for the farmer who has done nothing other than continue to carry on his occupation <Col N="191" /> and his business in the way in which he has traditionally done it?</P>
    <P>I started by saying that Deputy Booth had referred to the condition of business in this definition.  I do not know where you end when you talk of one incident and another, where the question links up or where it ends in order to constitute a business, but take the example for the farmer who regularly each year conducts a farmyard sale.  He collects his cattle or sheep, as the case may be, and arranges with a local auctioneer to sell them off. If he does that year after year, is it not fair to suggest to the Minister that in those circumstances there is no question of one isolated incident?  It is a regular pattern year after year and surely, in those circumstances, it is open to a Deputy to argue that this constitutes a business?  It is certainly part of the man's business and Deputy Cunningham thinks that requires to be licensed.  I do not think there is any doubt about it.  Deputy Cunningham is here now, and if I am doing him an injustice or misinterpreting his views on the subject, he is free to correct me.</P>
    <P>I understand the position to be that Deputy Cunningham regards this Bill, regards the adaptation referred to by Deputy Clinton in the example he gave, as bringing the farmyard sale into the category of transactions for which licences will be required.  I want to get, if I can, a positive answer from the Minister as to whether that transaction is one for which a licence is contemplated in the Bill.  I do not think the exemption provision would constitute a sufficient protection if the definition section captures transactions such as that.  Remember that, in line with other provisions in the Bill, the definition section leaves it entirely discretionary to the Minister whether exemption will be granted or not in any case&mdash;it does not matter what the case is&mdash;and if the Minister in his wisdom decides he wants to stamp out any particular type of trading in livestock, he can do so by refusing to exempt the transaction from the provisions of the Bill.  If transactions are not exempted, then a licence is required and it is then discretionary, <Col N="192" /> entirely at the discretion of the Minister, whether licences will be granted.</P>
    <P>Therefore, any particular pattern of trade in livestock can be shattered and stamped out by the Minister if we allow the Bill to go through unaltered. We are endeavouring in this amendment to afford some measure of protection to the farming community from the all-embracing net being cast by the Bill.  Certainly, if the amendment I am supporting now is carried. the picture will be completely different: it will be a completely different situation as far as farmyard sales are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that the Minister should get away completely from the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; in the definition section because I believe it is vague in the context in which it is used and can lead to accidental adaptations which will bring a person within the ambit of the Bill when he should not be and I believe it will apply to cases Deputy Cunningham referred to of farmyard sales, if anything is done to adapt the farmyards to make them suitable for sale by auction.  If the Minister agrees to delete the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo; a completely different situation arises. Then we are making it clear to all the world that we intend this Bill to apply only to properly constructed and established livestock marts, that we do not intend the Bill to apply to the ordinary farmer conducting his business in the traditional manner in his own premises, in his own farmyard.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should make that distinction.  It is important that we should set at rest any doubts that exist either in the House or outside it With regard to the possibilities in relation to the operation of this measure.  Therefore, I again urge on the Minister to let us have his mind with regard to farmyard sales and in doing that, to forget for the moment about his proposal in section 4 to take to himself power to decide which transactions will or will not be exempt from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Would it not be far better that the House should not take any chance on this?  Would it not be far better that in dealing with the definition section <Col N="193" /> we should exclude specifically the transactions which are not intended to be included in the operation of this Bill?  I do not know what machinery the Minister will find it necessary to establish, if this Bill goes through unaltered.  I do not know whether he proposes to set up some sort of register whereby certain places, certain people or certain transactions will automatically be exempt from the provisions of the Bill.  It does not seem to me that that can be done because if the Bill is passed as it stands, there will be an obligation on the Minister to exercise his authority and discretion under the exemption provision.  I think a mass of applications are likely to be made to the Minister and it will be the Minister's responsibility to decide whether they are proper for exemption under the Bill.</P>
    <P>All that kind of thing can be avoided at this stage by being clear, definite, precise in our definition.  It can all be avoided by taking out this word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;, by accepting the amendment and making it necessary that something concrete in the nature of construction or reconstruction be done before a place will require to be licensed under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham, as I have said, has given his views on a farmyard sale.  I think he is right in saying that as the Bill stands, a licence or an exemption order is likely to be required. Certainly, bearing in mind Deputy Booth's contribution about a business&mdash;that it should not be one isolated transaction merely&mdash;one must regard Deputy Cunningham's view as correct.  It is likely to be correct anyhow where an annual sale is the pattern in a particular place or locality.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan also referred to the question of fairs and raised the query as to whether local authorities would require either to obtain licences or exemption orders if they habitually, down through the years, have been putting particular places at the disposal of local people in which to hold fairs. That point also requires clarification. Is it intended in this legislation to give some kind of legislative disapproval of the continuance of fairs throughout the <Col N="194" /> country?  I know the tendency is away from fairs and towards marts, but do we intend this legislation to carry with it legislative disapproval of the continuance of fairs?  Do we intend this legislation to mean that in future if a fair is to be held, a licence or an exemption order must be obtained? That seems to be on the cards so long as the definition remains as it is with the use of the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It would not be on the cards and it would not be necessary to consider fairs in terms of either licences or exemption orders, if this amendment is accepted.  The fair green may be fenced off as a temporary measure once a month whenever the fair is held.  The square in the town where the fair is to be held can quite safely have its ropes, its fences and its various divisions erected on a temporary basis once a month if my amendment is accepted because those types of adaptation could not be construed as constructing or reconstructing the place for the sale of livestock by auction.  If we are content to leave the definition as it is in the Bill, if we are content to carry on with the use of the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;, then those temporary measures, the erection of fences, the roping off of a section of a town, the placing of divisions in a fair green, all those things are steps which, according to the definition, amount to adapting the place.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that &ldquo;adapting&rdquo; means making the place fit or suitable so any of those temporary measures would in those circumstances make the place fit or suitable for the sale of livestock by auction.  That being so, if it is not merely one isolated transaction, if it is a fair held&mdash;I do not care whether it is once a year or once a month&mdash;if the pattern is there and if that is the ordinary thinking, then it seems to me that the element of business has been established, so that you have the element of business, you have the adaptation, you have the making of the place fit and suitable for the sale of livestock by auction.  In all those circumstances, it seems to me that you then have the requirement that that place <Col N="195" /> can only continue in business, that that transaction can only continue to be held, provided a licence is obtained or an exemption is made under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister intended that but it has become clear in the course of the discussion that those results are likely to ensue.  I do not think, as I say, that the Minister intended it and if I am right in believing that, the Minister did not intend it, surely now is the time to get the record clear, to straighten the matter out, to be precise in our definition and to exclude what was not intended to be included?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in favour of the amendment.  Under the terms of this Bill, we are told that any person who does not conform to the rules will be liable to a heavy fine or a term in jail. It is a serious thing for any Minister at this stage to bring into this House a Bill of this sort.  It is not so long since we had young men throughout this country sent to jail simply because they put trucks on the road and did not conform to the law laid down which was all in favour of CIE.  This did not make for a very happy situation. Hundreds of those fine young men had to clear off to England as a result.</P>
      <P>Now, getting down to the question of these sales, if people, the many people who auctioned their cattle, have to get in touch with the Department before they make any move towards holding those sales, the whole thing will suffer a big setback.  Throughout the country today we have many people who are growing old who decide to have an auction, who decide that it is getting too heavy for them to carry on and who wish to sell out. Those people heretofore could come to a very good agreement by going to the local auctioneer, deciding on what they would do, fixing a date to hold an auction and everything worked out perfectly.  This was one of the dearest places where you could go to buy cattle.  If that is to be interfered with, it is a sad day for the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today we have many people who decide to go to England.  The first thing that enters their minds is that they will <Col N="196" /> have an auction and will sell their cattle.  There are people who suffer severe losses on their farms, such as that which they have suffered over the past ten days through flooding, when haycocks were washed away, who decided to have an auction and sell out. If all those people have to get in touch with the Minister for permission to have these sales, the Department will have to double its staff.  As well as the man with the white coat and the garda down the country, the staff will have to be doubled in the Department. Apart from the inconvenience caused, the holding up of those people is serious.  We know the delay there is from the time of the holding of a sale until the matter is finally cleared up. This will interfere with the right to sell when you like or not to sell.</P>
    <P>The amendment would cut out a lot of unnecessary hardship.  I should like to know if this Bill will interfere with the fairs we have been holding for centuries.  People for generation after generation have been attending these fairs and they have been quite satisfied with them.  If there is a slight change&mdash; somebody said it would not make much difference&mdash;and that fair is to be stopped completely, it would be very serious for some parts of this country. I know, judging from my own part of the country, that a mart is not a success there for the very reason that we have not enough of the right type of cattle to encourage the dealer to come down once a month, but by going into a fair, you have every type of buyer and every type of beast there, particularly in small lots.  As you know, the big cattle dealer does not want to go to a fair where he does not get pretty large lots of cattle of the same type.  If the fairs are interfered with, or changed in any way, it will be very serious for the town involved.  In my local town on fair day each month money is spent from early morning until late at night.  If that money is taken away from that town, it will almost close down.</P>
    <P>It will be serious for the farmers if they cannot decide to sell their cattle without permission from the Department. They do all the really hard <Col N="197" /> work, with no fixed hours, seven days a week.  They have no guaranteed prices.  Remember the farmers are depending solely on cattle now and the sale of those cattle should be left to the farmers.  Poultry have disappeared. Farm produce, because of the high production cost, is down to a minimum. It will be very serious if the time ever comes when the farmer has to take pen and paper and appeal to the Minister for permission to sell his cattle.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk this morning about exemptions.  In my opinion there is not much sense in exemptions because the whole country will be looking for exemptions.  Half will, I suppose, get them and the other half will not.  There are numbers of cattle dealers in the country.  They buy suitable cattle at fairs.  They are there at two and three o'clock in the morning. They take the cattle away and a buyer comes from some of the good centres&mdash;Dublin, Meath, Westmeath and sometimes from Britain&mdash;and he walks out on the farm and inspects the cattle.  Because of the experience of the dealer, there is very little inspection to be done.  The dealer buys only what he knows will be acceptable to his customer. If that practice is interfered with, there will be a loss to the farmer and the situation will be very serious for the producers.  Will this Bill interfere with fairs?  Is the time coming when people will not be allowed to sell their cattle without permission from the Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister must now have some notion in his mind as to what type of livestock sales he intends to exempt but, so far as we are concerned, all that remains a closed book.  The Minister has intervened not very often and not very long, without telling us what type of livestock activities he is prepared to exempt.  It would help us considerably in framing our amendments to the definition section if we knew what type of activities he is prepared to exempt.  We could write them down for him and incorporate them in <Col N="198" /> the definition section, which would make the whole thing nice and proper, but the Minister has not seen fit to give us any inkling as to what type of activities he is prepared to exempt.</P>
      <P>The definition section, as I interpret it, will apply to marts and to ordinary fairs.  As we read further in the Bill, we find that its operation in relation to fairs will be extremely difficult, particularly if the hygiene regulations are strictly implemented.  It would seem that, when the Minister comes to making his exemptions, he will have to consider whether ordinary fairs can be allowed and whether he will be forced to refuse a licence or give an exemption and the situation could, therefore, become a critical one.  According to the various sections, it would be difficult to grant an exemption as regards fairs. Yet, when this Bill becomes operative, what happens if the marts close down? If some proprietors close down their marts or if people refuse to send their cattle there, then we shall be forced into the position of having only fairs left.  The Minister will be faced with the dilemma of whether to exempt fairs&mdash;presumably an exemption order will be necessary in the event of marts closing down&mdash;or to take over the marts.  I would ask him to give us a concrete answer to that.</P>
      <P>In the event of the marts closing down, as is conceivable, does he intend then to make an exemption order to allow the fairs to continue or will he run the gauntlet of taking over the marts himself and attempt to run them and face the possibility of a general boycott?  It is right at this juncture that we should inquire whether the Minister intends to exempt our fairs or whether he feels they will be allowed to continue in traditional fashion.  My main purpose in intervening at this stage is to inquire specifically whether the Minister will allow fairs to continue or will allow them merely in the event of marts closing down or will disregard them altogether if they prove too difficult for him or will decide to take them over under some regulation in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister had been in the House earlier this morning, <Col N="199" /> then, to put it mildly, he would have been extremely surprised, if not appalled, that one of his Deputies asked to have the word &ldquo;constructed&rdquo; explained. Deputy Booth wanted a detailed and accurate explanation of the word &ldquo;constructed&rdquo;.  I am sorry Deputy Booth is not in the House now. I felt I had gone to considerable pains last night to describe to this House what &ldquo;constructed&rdquo; means.  The Minister said he is tired of listening to questions from Fine Gael about this piece of legislation and that he himself wants an answer to some questions.  He dished out a couple of questions to me.  I just say to him now that if he feels it is necessary for me again to give more detail in relation to the meaning of these two words &ldquo;constructed&rdquo; and &ldquo;reconstructed&rdquo; for the benefit of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, I shall be very pleased to do so.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious that one of the very few Fianna Fáil Deputies who have contributed to this debate&mdash;we had only two contributions apart from the Minister's short contribution now and again&mdash;does not know what &ldquo;constructed&rdquo; means so it is very difficult to know whether or not to go back over the same ground again.  If I did, the Chair would probably object even though the meaning of the expression obviously has not got through to them. I explained what we mean by the words we want to substitute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we asked the Minister to tell us what exactly he meant by the word he had there&mdash;&ldquo;adapted&rdquo;&mdash;all he said was to make fit and suitable.  If I say something is made fit, my idea of what is fit might be very different from what the Minister has in mind as being fit. Similarly with the second word &ldquo;suitable&rdquo;. What I would think suitable and what could be used to carry on this business might be very different from what the Minister has in mind.  I believe that what he has in mind is a full cattle mart with all the paraphernalia.  He has not spelled out what he means by &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; or what will satisfy his requirements.  He said that the various activities that we, on this side of the House, feel may come within the scope of this legislation do not, in fact, do so <Col N="200" /> and the only additional proof he gives of that is to say that section 4 takes care of it.</P>
    <P>This was also stated this morning by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Davern, in reply to Deputy Murphy's query in relation to draught sales or the ordinary fair where a case might arise that a green, a small field or the corner of a street is temporarily adapted for the purpose of keeping cattle penned up at a fair.  Section 4 gives no indication whatever as to what the Minister has in mind.  Before it is reasonable to expect us to accept the vague definition at the outset of this Bill, the Minister should have written into section 4 the exemptions he has in mind at present.</P>
    <P>I think that this definition section is by far the most important section in the Bill in so far as it governs afterwards the type of place that comes within the licensing provisions of this measure.  If we cannot tell the people clearly at this stage what comes within its scope and what does not, then the Bill means nothing throughout and the people will, all the time, be in serious doubt as to whether any and every type of sale is not brought within the ambit of this legislation.  That is the subject of pretty genuine fear by everybody who has spoken on this Bill simply because the categories of sales that do not come within the scope of the measure are not mentioned in it.</P>
    <P>When we use this uncertain expression, this expression that is open to so many interpretations&mdash;&ldquo;adapted&rdquo;&mdash; we simply do not know where we stand. It is a word which is open to many meanings.  We want to eliminate that vagueness.  We want to substitute in its place two words which, I think, cannot be misunderstood and cannot be given any other meaning.  If the Minister expects us to accept his version, he should have supplied a specification of what he has in mind as a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction or otherwise and the type of place that comes within the ambit and all those other types of sales that are excluded from the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="201" /> When I sit down, I hope, at least for the records of this House, the Minister will list the types of sales that are outside the scope of this measure. I hope he will give us some promise of his intention before we reach the Report Stage of this measure that he is prepared to amend section 4.  I hope he will give us all the examples in a list of the types of sales he proposes and intends to exempt.  That would go some distance towards clarifying his intentions not only by statement in this House but in such a way that when people are called upon afterwards to carry out the provisions of this Bill, they will know clearly where they stand, and everybody interested in the business of livestock marts and livestock sales in any form will know whether or not he is carrying on his business within the law or outside it.</P>

Neither do they care how low prices for cattle go.  Other rural Deputies have not contributed but they are seriously concerned and they will not express themselves in favour of the Bill because that would be detrimental to them.  They know that it is a wrong measure but they have to support the Minister and walk behind him into the Division Lobby.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in relation to this measure should be considered. I have summarised the statement issued and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, quite properly, has asked me to relate that to this amendment.  That I propose to do.  The whole difficulty in relation to this discussion arises because of the refusal of the Government to accept the first amendment proposed here, which referred to two apparently simple words in the definition section, the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;.  The refusal to delete those words&mdash;I trust Deputy Geoghegan is attending to this&mdash;now means we are facing a situation in relation to this Bill where under the definition section the Bill extends nor only to the sale of livestock by auction but the sale of livestock in any other manner&mdash;the sale of livestock by auction or the sale of livestock otherwise than by auction.  I am endeavouring in the amendment I am proposing to the House now to restrict somewhat the categories of places to which this section, or by reason of this section, the Act as a whole, will apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time I said a few words on this amendment I was asking the Minister and two Parliamentary Secretaries who came in during the course of my <Col N="206" /> remarks to let us have their views as to whether an auction conducted by a farmer in his own farmyard was covered by this or not.  Deputy Dowling may not be aware that I did not succeed in getting a reply to that query.</P>
    <P>While I do not want either to offend against the rules of order or to weary Deputies by repeating myself, I am simply calling attention to the fact that, despite the plea having been made by me, despite that request for information having been made to the Minister, to his Parliamentary Secretary and to another Parliamentary Secretary, the point so far as I am concerned remains unanswered.  For the present I propose to leave that query hanging in the air, in the hope that, while I did not get an answer so far, it may possibly attract the attention of Deputy Allen or Deputy Geoghegan, or possibly even Deputy Dowling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody suggested two words.  We were talking about two words in the first amendment. In this particular amendment, we are dealing with three words &ldquo;constructed and reconstructed&rdquo;.  Before I come to that, we will leave the query regarding the farmyard auction hanging in the air, in the hope that it will attract the attention of some of the Deputies opposite who may persuade one or other of the Parliamentary Secretaries in the House at the moment to give a reply to the query raised.  If the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretaries feel they would not like to venture a reply, possibly some of the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches will feel that the door is open to them and that they are entitled to throw their hat in the ring and make up their own minds as to whether or not such transactions are within the definition section as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time I spoke I was dealing with the position of the farmyard auction but I am afraid it is a lot more serious than that and goes much further than that.  With this definition section, and particularly having regard to the decision of the House not to accept amendment No. 1 proposed by <Col N="207" /> Deputy Clinton, the position now may very well be that even if you do not hold an auction in your farmyard, even if you do not go through the annual pattern I spoke of, where each year an auction may be held, some bales of straw put down for seating accommodation, as Deputy Clinton pointed out, if you sell your beasts privately in your own farmyard, it may be that those transactions will be captured by the definition section.  If Deputy Geoghegan wants to know the ground on which I raise this point of view, it is because we endeavoured to limit the application of this section to auctions but the House decided against that and decided that the application should be to &ldquo;auctions or otherwise&rdquo;, which, Deputy Geoghegan will, of course, appreciate, means auctions or otherwise than by auction.  Otherwise than by auction, in the context in which I speak at the moment, refers to a private sale.  I know the Minister has referred to a sale by hand but I am not talking about any sale that is intended to be an evasion of the provisions of this Bill, should it ever become an Act.  I am talking about the ordinary bargain and sale that all of us know about, the ordinary sale by a farmer to a buyer, to a neighbour or to anyone else, taking place in his own farmyard.</P>

      <P>We have now reached a situation where, if we leave this definition section unaltered, we could conceivably have interference by ministerial order or regulation with a private sale by a farmer of his own beasts, not merely in his own yard, but, as Deputy Alien reminds be, in his own field.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so much concerned with the public highway as with a man's private property, <Col N="209" /> dealing with his own property by private bargain and sale on his own land.  That is what I am concerned with.  Deputy Alien reminds me that what I am saying could apply with equal force and, I am sure, with equal clarity, to the situation where the sale is conducted, not in the yard, but in the field.</P>
      <P>I have felt, since this discussion started, that it was not the deliberate policy of the Minister or the Government to interfere with private sales of this sort and I am still so convinced, notwithstanding the earlier intervention of some Fianna Fáil Deputies. Possibly I will have an opportunity of referring to those shortly.  I am still not convinced that it is deliberate policy on the part of the Government to take power in this measure to regulate in any way or to interfere in any way with the free system of bargaining and selling by a man of his own livestock on his own property, but the danger exists.  Deputy Cunningham referred some time ago to his idea of what would require to be licensed. Again, let me say that I agree with Deputy Cunningham in this.  I am afraid this applies not merely to auctions but also to private sales.</P>
      <P>At column 1807 of the Official Report of Friday last, Deputy Clinton said:</P>
      <P>There is no limitation on the words &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; or &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;. I have seen hundreds of cows and hundreds of calves sold in a farmer's yard where the only adaptation was the placing of a few bales of straw to make comfortable seating under cover for people who were there to bid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, Deputy Clinton had in mind what Deputy Hogan referred to earlier, that was, the conduct of an auction in the farmer's yard, and the only adaptation which Deputy Clinton visualised was the placing of some bales of straw for seating accommodation for those there to bid.  It is the use of the words &ldquo;there to bid&rdquo; in what Deputy Clinton said that makes me take the view that he was referring to an auction.  At this stage Deputy Cunningham came in and <Col N="210" /> said: &ldquo;It must be licensed&rdquo;.  According to Deputy Cunningham, even though the only adaptation taking place is the placing of a few bales of straw to make comfortable seating under cover for people who are there to bid, even though that is the only manner in which the place is adapted, a licence is required.  The particular specific query I want to put to the brace of Parliamentary Secretaries here at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular query I want to put to them is: If, in the circumstances outlined by Deputy Clinton and which Deputy Cunningham says would require a licence, instead of contemplating an auction what was contemplated as a private sale, if the farmer had collected together his cattle, his sheep or his pigs into his farmyard, if he had a buyer, who customarily took the beasts from that area, coming along to inspect them to see if they were up to the standard that he required; and if in order to assist that man in his cogitations when inspecting the beasts, the farmer brings out a few bales of straw or, indeed, the kitchen chair and asks the buyer to sit on it while he is viewing the cattle, there an auction is not being held but livestock is being offered for sale privately. Would either of the Parliamentary Secretaries say if in those circumstances the position still is that the farmyard or, if one takes Deputy Allen's amendment of it, the field, has been adapted for the sale of livestock by auction, even though no auction is taking place or is contemplated?</P>

      <P>No; that is the whole point of the amendment.  I am very glad the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="211" /> has contributed now to the discussion, because that is the all-important point of the amendment, and the Parliamentary Secretary is absolutely relevant when he makes that point.  The word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; is used in the definition and I am complaining, and other Deputies are complaining, that in this context it is too vague and too loose; it leaves the whole position too elastic and it can embrace all sorts of transactions which should not be embraced.</P>

      <P>We are suggesting that that is too elastic, that a minor modification, a temporary change, a slight adaptation, can be brought in under that definition and that accidental transactions which were never intended or contemplated should be covered by this Bill will be brought in.  Deputy Mark Clinton suggested a solution for the difficulty earlier.  The House, by majority decision, decided not to accept that solution. I then, in amendment No. 1a, suggested another solution and the House again, by majority vote, decided not to accept that solution.  Now I am suggesting another possible solution, that we drop completely the use of the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; and substitute instead the words &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo;.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach possibly was not here when I opened the discussion on this amendment, and possibly that is why he feels a bit at sea at the moment.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has seen the point of it.  He says this includes sales in a field, and you cannot construct a field or reconstruct it.  The Parliamentary Secretary is a Daniel come to judgment, and in a moment he has perceived the whole heart of this matter.  He is perfectly right.  The purpose of our amendment is to say that you must have a structure which is recognisable as a mart.  The Parliamentary Secretary truly says: &ldquo;You cannot construct or reconstruct a field.  You can adapt it but you cannot construct or reconstruct it.&rdquo;  That is exactly what we have been trying to make this House see since half past ten this morning.</P>
      <P>The purpose of our amendment is to confine the application of this Bill to what is in the ordinary accepted sense of the term, the cattle mart.  We have offered alternatives.  It may occur to the mind of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and that of other Deputies that we are obstructing but I have sat here for many years in my time.  We have offered five amendments as alternatives in order to achieve the very purpose the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach says is essential.  He says that you cannot construct or reconstruct a field.  Exactly: we have tried to put in five separate, alternative methods of avoiding the very confusion which the Parliamentary Secretary, coming with a fresh mind to this discussion, promptly discerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were dealing with a sane Minister, would he not say: &ldquo;I do not like Nos. 1, 2, 3 or 5 but I shall take No. 4&rdquo;?  If he had said that ten hours ago, I do not doubt that this front bench would say: &ldquo;We would prefer Nos. 1 or 2 or 3 or 5 but if we can find agreement on No. 4, which we believe would be a substantial <Col N="215" /> improvement of the section, that is what we are looking for&rdquo;.  But from the beginning of this disscussion the attitude of the Minister has been that he will not accept any qualification, and that refusal to accept the qualification, is perceived at once by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach who comes in here with a fresh mind as meaning that it includes every field in Ireland.  The poor Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture jumps in quickly and says: &ldquo;We have section 4.&rdquo;  The old and experienced operator here is often caught out by the too-bright boys who say: &ldquo;Two and two make five&rdquo; and he says: &ldquo;Master, two and two do not make five; they make four.&rdquo;  Then they find themselves in the position that they have to say: &ldquo;What I meant to say is that two and two do not make five.&rdquo;  They change in a twinkling. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture changed feet at once.  But the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach is right.  He has gone to the very heart of the matter.</P>
    <P>This definition section covers every field in Ireland and we want to insert words into it which will make the Parliamentary Secretary say most sensibly: &ldquo;You cannot construct or reconstruct a field&rdquo;.  Exactly: that is what we want to do.  If you prefer to say that the place is not habitually used or is not permanently used, these are alternatives, all of them designed to ensure that there will not be brought within the ambit of this Bill a farmer's field or indeed a farmer's yard or indeed that which all of us here know very well is not a livestock mart.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, who has been in and out of this debate very constantly and has been well schooled as a result, knows that the meaning of the section as it stands is far wider&mdash;who says &ldquo;no&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody outside the door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How discreet they have become.  Interrupting from outside the door is a very safe occupation.  The <Col N="216" /> Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture fully understands that this definition section is far too wide and he immediately falls back on section 4 which he says we can accept. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach: does he think it is good legislation of Oireachtas Éireann to have a definition section which brings within the ambit of the Livestock Marts Bill every field and farmer's yard in Ireland?  I think he would agree with me that it is not.  His own interjection is one of the most powerful and effective made in this whole debate: you cannot construct or reconstruct a field. That is exactly our point.  We want to use words that make it clear to the judiciary and to the people that this Bill is designed to apply to what every Deputy knows to be a livestock mart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But it is possible, and we are accepting the possibility, that there might be a place where auctions of cattle are casually held but which, under the terms of this Bill, would no longer qualify for a licence.  If the proprietor constructed something new there or reconstructed what was already there, he could benefit under section 3 (6), which provides that anybody who has been in the business of selling cattle by auction in the past can automatically become entitled to a licence on the passing of this Bill without a permit from the Minister other than that which he is constrained by statute to give.  Then the person who has been in the business of selling cattle by auction brings his premises into conformity with the general regulations. They are constructed or reconstructed, but it is perfectly clear as the Parliamentary Secretary said, that if somebody comes along and says: &ldquo;I have constructed or reconstructed a field,&rdquo; one can say: &ldquo;How the hell can you reconstruct a field?&rdquo; I say that if the Minister comes along and says: &ldquo;You cannot sell cattle by auction or otherwise&rdquo;&mdash; remember these vital words which go to the root of all these amendments &mdash;&ldquo;without my licence and permit under the Livestock Marts Act,&rdquo; we want to put the farmer in the position of saying: &ldquo;What the hell are you talking about? This is a field.  This is the kind of <Col N="217" /> place the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said that you could not construct or reconstruct.  If that applies in this place, how can you claim that your Marts Act would bring regulations to bear on it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We should be most grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach. He has gone to the heart of the matter and he has done so because he came into this discussion with a fresh mind.  He does not hold himself out to be a farmer bur he has lived all his life among them and has had dealings with the parents of the children coming to school.  He knows the language they speak and the circumstances of their lives and it is only somebody like him who has had that experience who would instinctively burst out and say: &ldquo;You cannot construct or reconstruct a field.&rdquo;  Now does it dawn on the Parliamentary Secretary why we suggested these words would be a useful safeguard?  Somebody said that we wanted to exclude from the ambit of this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Bill is not intended to deal with livestock.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to leave out of the control of the Bill a whole vast area.  Is that not so?  The whole object of the Bill is to leave outside its control a vast area dealing in livestock. This Bill is concerned only to control the sale and purchase of livestock in livestock marts.  Is that not so? If that is your purpose, then you should go to section 1 which is the directive to the judiciary, telling them what they are to have regard to in any proceedings connected with the Livestock Marts Bill.  We want to tell the courts that this is not a Bill, as Deputy Dowling thinks, to control the sale of livestock. We want to tell the judiciary, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach so sensibly thinks, that this is not a Bill dealing with farmers' fields.  It is a Bill to deal only with places constructed or reconstructed to function as cattle marts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What puzzles me is that every single member of the Fianna Fáil Party who has entered this discussion with anything approximating to an open mind is in fact <i>ad idem</i> with us.  The ridiculous thing is that we have taken the trouble to find five separate alternative ways of giving the appropriate directions to the judiciary and the Minister sits like a bump on a log and says: &ldquo;No, no, no, no, no.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> We have said that without some qualifying word, the Bill extends to a far wider area than he meant it to extend to, and he says: &ldquo;Yes, and that is why I have put in section 4, the exemption section, because I want the right to exempt by order the people I have unintentionally brought in&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We say to him that this is not the way to make the law.  The way to make the law is, when drafting a Bill, to get as near to precision as humanly possible. We are prepared to say to him that having done that, we will give him section 4 with suitable safeguards to deal with exceptional cases such as where there might be an agricultural show at which an auction might be held which it would be desirable to exempt from the operation of the Bill. Instead of saying to us: &ldquo;Well, that is fair.  Let us put our joint minds together to put in the definition section as comprehensive and effective a definition as we can&rdquo;, he says: &ldquo;I want a grab-all definition under which exemptions can be made by executive order&rdquo;.  The moment the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and Deputy O'Connor walk into the House with fresh minds, they spot that at once themselves, but what they do not spot is that what we have been trying to do is to achieve that which they themselves think ought to be done.</P>
    <P>It is most reprehensible on the part of the Minister that we have taken the trouble to find five different ways of applying the necessary limiting words; we offered any one of the five as meeting in some measure the case we are making and the case which I believe most Fianna Fáil Deputies believe requires to be made; and the Minister's answer is: &ldquo;I am not even prepared to discuss it.  I do not propose to attend in the House while it is being discussed.&rdquo; So long as he disposes of an absolute majority who are prepared to jump when they are told to jump, that kind of thing can be done, but it will not be done for ever.  In the meantime, a useful service is done for the country, and I think a useful service is done in the education of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is coming to understand <Col N="220" /> that his colleagues in his Party agree with us, then he is coming to understand why.  Mind you, the Parliamentary Secretary could take a worse preceptor than his colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach. He did not come down in yesterday's shower.  He is no fool, and he has a very shrewd understanding of the people of rural Ireland.  Let us recall his intervention.  &ldquo;You cannot construct or reconstruct a field.&rdquo;  If we were talking for months, we could not more eloquently defend the amendment in the name of Deputy M.J. O'Higgins. &ldquo;You cannot construct or reconstruct a field.&rdquo;  The purpose of our amendment is to say to the judge or the district justice: &ldquo;Is it not manifest that in the words `construct or reconstruct' in the definition section, Oireachtas Éireann cannot have been referring to a farmer's field?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every one of the Deputies sitting on the other side of the House knows that the logic and justice and common sense of this matter are on our side, and that in regard to this section there is nothing on the other side of the House on the front bench but what is known in the Province of Ulster as a man who has got thick.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and others who know Donegal or Monaghan or Cavan realise that when talking to a man who normally reacts fairly rationally, if he gets what we speak of in that part of Ireland as thick, he is no longer susceptible to reason.  There is another adjective which describes that state of mind, that is, berserk.  Whether he is thick or berserk, the situation is that the Minister will not meet any one of the five amendments which every one of his colleagues who has spoken admits are reasonable.  That is not a good enough reason for forcing legislation like this through this House.</P>

If the farmers feel that it is right for them to sell their cattle by this means and that they can obtain a better price for them by doing so, they should be allowed to continue to sell them by this method. No matter what Deputy Dowling tells us he knows about a cattle mart, he knows as much about it as the animals sold there know about him, and so he should confine his remarks to the Fianna Fáil Party room, or else should listen to the suggestions made by Deputy Carty who seems to agree with the views expressed on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question on 21st October, 1965, when I set out in considerable detail the findings of the investigation into the economics of utilising the reserves of &ldquo;crow&rdquo; coal in the Arigna area for the generation of electricity.

The wearing of the same form of dress by all pupils ensures that at least in this regard no odious comparisons can be made as between one pupil and another.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would again ask the Minister, now that he is present, to reconsider his decision and to accept this amendment.  Perhaps I might be allowed to ask him if he does not consider that one of the traditional ways of selling cattle in Donegal, apart from the fairs and the cattle mart, is to have sales on the small holdings and that, for various reasons, the owners of livestock see advantages in selling their cattle in this manner.  As Deputy Dillon has said, if every member of this Party spoke here for a month, we could not put it more clearly than it was put by Deputy Carty, Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, when he said, just before Question Time: &ldquo;You cannot construct or reconstruct a field&rdquo;.  But you can construct or reconstruct premises. You can also adapt a farmyard or a small holding for the sale of cattle.</P>
      <P>I know the small farmers on the Fanad Peninsula, the home of the Minister, and I know that this is a peculiar way for those small farmers to sell their stock.  Maybe, with the new mart being erected at Milford, this will cease to be as popular in the future as it has been in the past, but nevertheless that is not for us to decide.  What we have to decide here is whether these people will be allowed to continue a tradition which their fathers and grandfathers used in days gone by for the sale of livestock.  We must ask ourselves whether we shall prevent these people from using this method in the future. If the Minister agrees that this system of marketing cattle is to be allowed to continue, then it is only reasonable to request him to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> As Deputy Carty says, you cannot construct or reconstruct a field and you cannot construct or reconstruct a farmyard. This is the nucleus of our argument.  However, you can adapt a farmyard or you can adapt a small field for the sale of cattle.  This being so, the owner of the cattle must, as I understand it, make application to the court or to the Minister or to some other authority for permission to hold a small auction if he feels it necessary to sell his stock.  Failing that, any auctioneer who accepts the business and is found to have sold cattle by this method can be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts this amendment, then any person who would construct or reconstruct premises, be it a farmyard or a small field, would do so with a view to having cattle sales there at some future date or dates.  He or she would therefore be in a position, or should be in a position, to know what was required in order to have such a sale.  People have sold cattle by this method possibly since the barter system went out.  They have sold cattle by this method under alien and under native Governments.  I do not know whether it is that the Minister is being thick in this matter: I should explain that in County Donegal, that term means &ldquo;awkward&rdquo;.  For the life of me, I cannot see why the Minister or the Government hold out the threat of intention to take this traditional right from the people.</P>
    <P>Speaking on behalf of the small farmers in particular&mdash;some of the Fianna Fáil Party seem to think we speak for nobody but small farmers &mdash;because there are more of them in Donegal than larger farmers and for any farmer who wishes to sell his cattle by this method, I feel the Minister must be alive to the desire of these farmers to protect their God-given right.  I have been in contact with people who are concerned with the operation of co-operative marts, and people concerned with the sale of cattle by other methods, and I do not think it is unreasonable for me to conclude that people have also approached the Minister to see if he would either delay the implementation <Col N="234" /> of this Act or accept reasonable amendments by the Fine Gael Party. These people have been with me and they have been with Deputy Cunningham.  They have asked Deputy Cunningham to request the Minister to come down off his high horse.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> This amendment, as indeed all the amendments which we have offered so far, is an attempt to circumscribe the application of this Bill to livestock marts proper.  The very name of the Bill, the Livestock Marts Bill, 1967, becomes a misnomer unless we by our amendment here endeavour to limit the definition to livestock marts proper.  The very Preamble to the Bill reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bill entitled an Act to provide <Col N="237" /> for the control and regulation by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries of livestock marts and the sale of livestock at such marts and to provide for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
    <P>That very Preamble, as well as the Title of the Bill, to any reasonable person would mean livestock marts proper, as we understand them and as they operate in this country at present. But when we come to read the definition as drafted, it extends the scope of the Bill to all types of livestock sales, so much so that the Preamble becomes nonsensical and the Title of the Bill becomes incorrect.</P>

This amendment and the previous ones were all devoted to that purpose. It is obvious to me that the Fianna Fáil Deputies must not have had a Party meeting to discuss this Bill.  Certainly, very few of them appear to be well-briefed on it.  Deputy Booth has read the definition, but I do not know whether or not he has gone any further.  He attempted to give us a dissertation on the definition on a couple of occasions, but apart from that, there is no evidence that the Opposition have studied it.  I believe it is our duty to try to educate them in this matter.  If their own hierarchy have failed to give them that information and if they have not had a Party meeting to study it, it is desirable that we should point out where their failure <Col N="238" /> to accept our amendments may lead them and the country in general.</P>

I will attempt, for the guidance of the Deputies on the far side of the House, to point out the dangers inherent in their failure to accept this amendment.  That is a fair comment to make about the amendment. You all have read it.  You appreciate its purpose is to limit the wider application which the Minister seeks, seeks with a definitive purpose.  The Minister has told us that when this Bill becomes an Act all existing marts will be licensed.  I take that as correct.  Of course, he has not added that these licences might be subject to certain provisos and to regulations being adhered to.  He has not told us he can on the morrow following giving the licence revoke it for reasons entirely his own, that the appeal will be to him and to him alone, although he may make provision for some kind of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister's answer is that he intends this to be of limited application and that he will exempt certain activities. Of course, he will.  It is logical to assume he will straight away exempt fairs in some areas of the country where there are no marts.  If he did not, how could the people dispose of their cattle?  That exemption may be temporary, but at least it would be an exemption.  We may assume all existing marts will be licensed and all existing fairs allowed to continue for some period, as yet unspecified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is this amendment being resisted then?  The obvious purpose is this.  If the marts refuse to operate this Bill and seek to divert their services <Col N="240" /> and their work back to the fairs, the Minister is then empowered, if this amendment is defeated, to proscribe these fairs and say to the marts: &ldquo;You have failed to provide an essential service for the people.  I proscribe these fairs.  I will not allow them to be held, because it would be a restrictive measure and they are largely closed at the moment.  You have failed to provide an essential service.  Therefore, I will take you over.&rdquo;  The Minister will probably operate these marts on his own.  He may open State marts elsewhere in time in areas where fairs are being held.  That is the eventuality that will flow from this Bill.</P>

That is the point I want to bring home to the Deputies opposite, if they refuse to accept the amendment.  Sooner than let them be deceived, I have told them exactly what is there.  They will be thankful to me because their Minister has not taken them into his confidence.

These are the eventualities which I can foresee flowing from this measure and I again appeal to Deputies on the opposite side of the House to consider the wider implications.  I appeal to Government Deputies to weigh up the implications of their refusal to accept the amendment and to use their influence on the very recalcitrant Minister whose recalcitrance shows no sign of abating no matter how long the debate becomes.

      <P>The only two Deputies opposite who had the necessary courage were Deputy Booth and Deputy Cunningham.  Deputy Carty made a very valuable interjection when he said that this definition was intended to take in every field in the country, every field, every garden, every yard.  Of course it was, he said, because, he said, you cannot reconstruct a held and that is why the Minister objects to this &ldquo;construct or reconstruct&rdquo; because, he said, you can <Col N="244" /> neither construct nor reconstruct a field and that he means &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; to include a field.  The Minister, I hope, will deal with this when he gets up because it certainly has been made clear to all of us by the Parliamentary Secretary and by anybody on the far side who has intervened that they are terribly confused.</P>
      <P>We want this tightened up and perhaps by this time the Minister may see the seriousness of leaving this definition section so loose that so many farmers can find themselves in court and in jail and fined.  When he has another look at this, I think he will come back and say that Fine Gael are sensible in this, that they want this drafted so that it can be read by the ordinary man, so that it can be defined by the court and so that people can know in advance where they stand and whether they are acting within the law or outside it.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputies are quite relevant.  I would hate to be responsible for putting them in the category of the irrelevant.  This amendment, as some Deputies have probably gathered by this, relates to the definition section of this Bill. Deputy Booth, not for the first time, may I say, in the course of a discussion on this Bill, made a very valuable contribution a few minutes ago when he stated categorically&mdash;I hope I am not misquoting him&mdash;that it is never up to a Minister to interpret an Act of Parliament.  I take it what Deputy Booth had in mind in making that contribution was the fact that it is the business of the courts to interpret Acts of Parliament.  However, the point is <Col N="246" /> this, and this is where Deputy Booth fell down: he is quite correct in saying that it is not up to the Minister to interpret an Act of Parliament, that that is a matter for the courts, but this Bill does not become an Act until it has been passed by this House and by the Seanad, and has got the signature of the President.  It is not yet an Act; it remains a Bill, and it is the Livestock Marts Bill, 1967, we are engaged in considering at the moment.</P>

      <P>We are now engaged in considering an amendment to this Bill, and so long as it remains a Bill, it is open to this House to amend it; so long as it remains a Bill, it is, in my humble opinion, open to the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary to give the House his interpretation of what the Bill means, what every section in the Bill means and, if necessary, what every line and every sentence in the Bill means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, Deputy Booth, while he is right in the blunt statement he made, is wrong if he applies that to the present situation in this House.  The Minister is quite free to give us his interpretation of this section.  Deputy Booth is concerned about the amendment.  The definition <Col N="247" /> section of this Bill sets out to define what the business of a livestock mart is.  Some difference of opinion has been expressed as to whether we are dealing with livestock or dealing with livestock marts.  As Deputy Hogan pointed out, it is clearly the intention of the Bill&mdash; and this is implicit both in the Short Title and the Long Title-to deal not with livestock as such but with livestock marts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have arrived at the stage of convincing the House that we are dealing now with livestock marts and not livestock <i>simpliciter</i>.  The definition section of this Bill sets out to define what livestock marts are, and we are concerned on this side of the House to ensure as far as we can that the definition of livestock marts will be confined to livestock marts proper.  It is not, as I understand it, the intention that places which are not, in the ordinary meaning of the term, livestock marts will require to have licences under this Bill when it becomes an Act.  It is not intended, as I understand the position, to interfere with the right of farmers to sell their stock in such manner as they think right and proper and most suitable to them.  All that is intended or was intended&mdash;I am not entirely sure now if I am still right in saying that all that is intended&mdash;as I understand the position, was that the Minister should take certain powers in connection with livestock marts and that only those marts which are licensed by him <Col N="248" /> could carry on the operations and the business of a livestock mart.  If that is so, vital importance attaches to what is or is not the business of a livestock mart.</P>
      <P>Deputy Booth will recall that on another occasion the House found a measure of agreement on the proposition that this definition presented to us is a double-barrelled one.</P>

      <P>I agree.  It would be a very good idea.  I was saying that I argue that the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; in the context in which it is used in this definition is too elastic and that it may enable this definition and, by virtue of that, the entire Act to be extended to bring within its framework various transactions which should not be in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Booth, in one of his not infrequent contributions, questioned whether Deputy Hogan was correct in suggesting that there might be circumstances in which the ordinary fair we all know about, the ordinary town fair or market, would come within the provisions of the definition as it stands.  As I understand the purpose of Deputy Booth's interjection on that occasion, it was to question the validity of the argument, to question whether if we do not accept the amendment, a fair could be captured by the definition.  I put this point of view to him: there is no doubt that if the amendment is accepted and if, instead of using the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;, we use the phrase &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo;, then, to my mind anyhow&mdash;I think the same is probably true of other Deputies&mdash;it would be beyond doubt that a fair would not be captured by the definition in this Bill which would then refer not to the adaptation of a place for the sale of livestock by auction but to the construction or reconstruction of such a <Col N="251" /> place.  Normally, where a fair is being held in a country town, a certain amount of adaptation might be necessary to adapt the market square or the fair green for use for that particular purpose.</P>

      <P>I hope the Deputy is not misleading himself.  As Deputy Clinton explained, the artificial definition of livestock contained in this Bill refers only to cattle, sheep and pigs.  It does not refer to horses, donkeys or mules, so that it is unlikely that the class of livestock that we are dealing with here would be trained for show jumping or the other jumping Deputy Booth has in mind.</P>

      <P>What I fear is that we might be sold a pig in a poke and that is what I am trying to guard against.  The Deputy asked me quite fairly what kind of adaptation would be necessary for a market square or a fair green.  I have given just one example.  If allowed time to consider it, I am sure I could think of others.</P>

      <P>It would be better still if the Deputy continues interrupting; things may come to my mind.  I think I have said enough to convince Deputy Booth that there are types of adaptation which could be made.  If the Deputy is still with me, we can go on from that point.  If the adaptation is such as would render that place, in the words of the Minister, fit or suitable for the holding of an auction, then that place would come <Col N="252" /> within the provisions of this definition section so long as we keep the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; there, and so long as&mdash;and I concede this point to the Deputy&mdash;it is not merely one isolated incident.</P>
      <P>Deputy Booth may not be aware, but other Deputies are, that normally speaking, fairs are not fixed on any kind of haphazard basis.  They are regular functions.  They occur and recur, usually on the same day of the month, or on the same day of the year, time after time, in the same town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question here of an isolated incident. This is something that has happened for a long time past and will continue to happen, so that here we have a situation arising where adaptation has taken place, and where by virtue of that adaptation the place has become suitable for the sale of livestock by auction, even though no auction may take place.  In addition to the adaptation having taken place, and in addition to its having become suitable for the sale of livestock by auction, we have the final clincher that it is not a single isolated incident.  It is something that is recurring time after time, month after month.  Surely Deputy Booth and the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that in those circumstances that place falls within the proposed definition?</P>
      <P>My complaint is that that is not intended, and it is not wanted.  I have invited the Parliamentary Secretary to contribute to the discussion.  Even though he may feel shy about getting to his feet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I take it that it is not intended.  Deputy Cunningham contributed his views to this and it would seem to me from the views expressed by Deputy Cunningham that not only would a fair which had gone through the process of adaptation fall to be licensed under this Bill, but that <Col N="253" /> a farmer's own yard, in certain circumstances, would also require to be licensed, although the farmer is selling only his own livestock in his own yard.</P>

      <P>Yes.  At column 1807 of the Official Report of the Dáil Debates on Friday, 14th July, 1967, Deputy Clinton said:</P>
      <P>There is no limitation of the words &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; or &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;. I have seen hundreds of cows and hundreds of calves sold in a farmer's yard where the only adaptation was the placing of a few bales of straw to make comfortable seating under cover for people who were there to bid.</P>
      <P>At that stage Deputy Cunningham intervened and said: &ldquo;It must be licensed&rdquo;.  I do not believe I have been misquoting the views of Deputy Cunningham in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

      <P>That also is a matter for further discussion.  However, I have given this quotation and I am going on record as saying I believe the views expressed by Deputy Cunningham are correct.  If he was correct in relation to the farmyard sale by a farmer of his own livestock, on his own premises, how much more correct would he be if he applied that reasoning to a monthly fair where an adaptation has taken place and where, even though no auction is held, the adaptation is such that the fair green or the market square has become fit or <Col N="255" /> suitable for the sale of livestock by auction, and that is the whole test.</P>

      <P>The definition of &ldquo;adapt&rdquo; which I quoted and stand over is to maKe fit some thing or person for another purpose.

      <P>Precisely. This is where Deputy Booth seems to be <i>ad idem</i> with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  You cannot construct or reconstruct a field or a fair green but you can adapt it.  If you get rid of the word &ldquo;adapt&rdquo; from the definition, then you are on much more firm ground and can safely put down your feet in all firmness and say that the definition does not mean this and does not mean that.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that only God can make a field. You may alter, adapt, fence, put a gap or dig a hole in a held but I do not think that by doing so you are constructing or reconstructing a held.  If the Deputy is with me to this extent, that the preferable thing to do would be to be clear in our definitions, he will agree that between the phrase &ldquo;construct or reconstruct&rdquo;, on the one hand, and &ldquo;adapt&rdquo; on the other, the phrase &ldquo;construct or reconstruct&rdquo; is more definite and concrete.  It requires something to be done physically to the field. It does not mean, as in the case of the phrase &ldquo;adapt&rdquo;, that accidental adaptation can take place.  I do not think you can construct or reconstruct something accidentally.</P>

      <P>I do not seem to have made it clear to Deputy Booth. He wants to find out what I mean by the phrase &ldquo;adapt accidentally&rdquo;.  The phrase used in the second part of the definition of the business of a livestock mart is that it provides for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise.  It is a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction or otherwise.  It does not say that it has to be adapted accidentally for that purpose.  You can have a field or a yard or any other place you like to think of, and by virtue of adapting it for a particular purpose, for example, for penning sheep before you dip them, you then have adapted your field or paddock for the purpose of containing sheep before you dip them.  But by virtue of the adaptation which has taken place, you have also made the field a place fit or suitable for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>

I now want to get back to the important contribution Deputy Booth made some time ago when he said that it is never up to a Minister to interpret an Act.  At the moment we are talking about a Bill, but if the Government force this Bill through the House, if it is carried through the Seanad and if the Government can persuade the President to sign it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if the President signs it without referring it to the Supreme Court and if there is no move from the Members of the Dáil and Seanad to seek a referendum on it, eventually the Bill will become an Act.  At that stage Deputy Booth is correct.  It would not then be open to the Minister to interpret it.  It would be a matter entirely for the courts and that is why it is of the very greatest importance that we should put into this Bill only that which we intend should go into it because nothing Deputy Booth says here, nothing the Parliamentary Secretary says&mdash;I am sorry to say he has not said much&mdash;and nothing the Minister says will affect the determination of the matter by the courts.  The courts can have regard only to what we put into the Bill.  Deputy Booth will now see the importance of being careful about what we put into the Bill.  If the Government accept my amendment, which has commanded the support of Deputies on this side of the House, deletes the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; and substitutes the words &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed.&rdquo;  many of their difficulties in relation to this section will disappear and many of the difficulties which the court might subsequently <Col N="259" /> encounter in interpreting the section will also disappear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment put forward by Deputy M. J. O'Higgins is not merely logical but absolutely necessary because the section, as it stands, leaves the thing wide open and a place &ldquo;adapted for the sale of livestock by auction&rdquo; can mean anything.  It can mean the adaptation of any kind of premises or place, such as farmyards and markets.  These could be adapted for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>
      <P>I understood the purpose of this Bill was to give the Minister power to control and regulate the sale of livestock at the various livestock marts.  The Title of the Bill is the Livestock Marts Bill, but it would now appear from section 1, and particularly that part to which Deputy O'Higgins's amendment relates, that the Minister is seeking power to control and regulate not merely the sale of livestock at cattle marts, as we have come to know them, but the sale of livestock everywhere. He is seeking complete control of livestock sales of every kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point made by the Minister when introducing the Bill was that he felt it was necessary for him to exercise control over livestock marts in view of the stringent regulations which would have to be applied consequent on our entry into the EEC.  Far from the Minister limiting the power he seeks, or confining it to livestock marts, he is now seeking, in fact, complete control over the domestic marketing of livestock.  It is very easy to adapt a place, be it a fair green, a field or a backyard, for the purpose of conducting a sale of livestock by auction.  There is too, the question of adapting a place temporarily for a specific purpose, or for one particular sale, and adapting it permanently.  I fail to understand how a fair green or a farmer's yard could be adapted for the purpose of a sale of livestock by auction under the regulations which apply now and the more stringent regulations which will apply in future to livestock marts.  Surely &ldquo;construction or reconstruction&rdquo; is the correct term?  Surely buildings&mdash;<Col N="260" /> yards, pens, offices and all the paraphemalia necessary in a modern cattle mart&mdash;presuppose that construction will have to be undertaken?  The substitution of the words &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo; in place of the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;, as suggested in Deputy O'Higgins's amendment, will clearly define the application of this Bill.  More important still, it will set clear limits on the powers of the Minister.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i>&mdash;&mdash;why we have put in these amendments. This amendment is concerned to make the definition of the Bill more specific.  It is calculated to limit its application to a certain form of trading activity.  Failure to accept this amendment and analagous amendments simply gives the Minister control of our domestic marketing arrangements &mdash;fundamental departure from the position we have enjoyed up to this&mdash; and ultimately of our export marketing arrangements.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable agitation in the past few months by various farming organisations who claim a right to a say in marketing arrangements and who ask the Minister to set up a marketing board in which they will have some operational say.  Failure to accept this amendment would mean that the entire marketing arrangements, domestic and non-domestic, will flow into the hands of the Minister in contradistinction to the fundamental constitutional rights not alone of farmers but of every citizen.  It is to that fundamental concept that Deputy Molloy must advert.  Obviously, he has not done so or, having adverted to it, he does not want to see it and, merely to paraphrase his words, he is indulging in silly filibustering tactics.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The amendment is devoted to that purpose. Much as we dislike the Bill&mdash; we dislike it in its entirety&mdash;at least a bad Bill should be as circumscribed as possible.  The people have the right to do wrong.  When the people, as expressed by the Government of the country, do wrong it is our duty to ensure that it will be done to the least number of people.  This amendment is an endeavour to limit the application of this wrongdoing; it is an endeavour to ensure that this obnoxious Bill and the various obnoxious sections will apply only to a small sector of the community, namely, to the livestock marts and to them alone.  We do not want to extend its activity.</P>
      <P>We want to ensure that when this Bill is enacted and put into operation, as it possibly will, the Minister will not be enabled thereby to make things more difficult still.  We do not want a situation to arise whereby refusal to accept this amendment will give him greater scope and that he will be able to proscribe fairs.  If this Bill should prove too onerous on proprietors of marts, they may decide to close their doors.  I do not think we should give the Minister such powers.  If the farmers want to go back to the old fairs, we should not, by rocking this amendment, give the Minister power to proscribe fairs thereby giving him that loophole and depriving the farming community of an alternative method of selline their stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said he wishes to establish these marts as a popular marketing system, although they were not initiated by him, and that, in the event of our joining the Common Market, it would be a very desirable type of arrangement.  I agree with that, <Col N="265" /> but it should be done by evolution, not by revolution and not by steam-rolling legislation through this Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In the greater part of the country, marts have taken over fairs but, particularly on the western seaboard, fairs are still the order of the day in places. If the Minister will accept this amendment and thereby limit the legislation to the existing marts and allow the ordinary evolutionary process to develop in the other part of Ireland as it has developed in other parts of the country in the past ten years, then at least the legislation will be less objectionable.  In so far as he is looking for a blanket coverage, we must ask everybody to support this amendment and try to convince Government Deputies of the seriousness of our purpose and the justice of our case.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that some Deputies move out when we are discussing an important matter like this, and despite the fact that some of them heckle us a little, I am still confident that they are gradually being indoctrinated to a certain extent with the wisdom of our attitude and our approach and with the commonsense aspect of our approach.  The Fianna Fáil Party are not completely devoid of commonsense or a sense of justice.  There are many honourable Members on the opposite side and I include the small number of three now present, which is two more than we usually have.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> My train of thought has been interrupted. I am sorry Deputy Booth has not returned because he is the only Deputy, apart from Deputy Cunningham, who appears to have read the first section of this Bill which comprises five lines.  It seems to me that no other Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party has read these five lines. Deputy Booth has made some contribution, as has Deputy Cunningham. Deputy Booth is a rational individual, as is Deputy Cunningham.  Deputy Booth is engaged in private business <Col N="266" /> and he would be the last man to concede that where a private business is being properly conducted, legislative measures should be introduced to infringe its liberties in any way or to control it unduly.  I am sure he would go this far with me, that that should not be made an excuse for extending legislation to a form of trading for which it was never intended.  The ordinary fairs have a system of selling which is on the way out.  I do not know how long it will take but I do not feel that we should give the Minister power to use the guillotine on the fairs as it appears he is going to use the guillotine on discussion of this Bill.</P>

We do not require that it should be licensed, but you say it is unpardonable to imagine the sale of beasts without the Minister certifying that he considers the persons holding the sale to be fit and proper persons. We say you are daft in that.  But, if you want to be daft, we want to keep you within well defined limits.  You are grabbing for this unnecessary power but we want at least to confine you to no more than a properly constructed livestock mart.  Not only is it the putting together of the constituent parts in their proper place and order, it is also &ldquo;the building, the forming, the making, the construction of an edifice.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Níl cead agat.  An edifice is &ldquo;a building, especially a large one.&rdquo; It is not a farmyard.  It is not a person's field with a few bales of straw strewn around.  It is not a farm-yard with Deputy Dillon's forms out in it.  It is &ldquo;a building, especially a large one.  The word &ldquo;edifice&rdquo; comes from the French <i>édifice</i> or the Latin <i>aedificium</i>, which is a temple.  I could go on, but I think I will confine myself for the moment to the English and the Irish language. To construct is &ldquo;to build, to erect, to form, to compile, to make, to fabricate, to originate or to invent.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>But at least it is something <Col N="270" /> more than a mere modification. It is something planned for, something drawn up, something constructed.  It is a building, especially a large one. Deputies will recall that in my quotation from Webster's International Dictionary.  I said the word &ldquo;construct&rdquo; meant to put together the constituent parts and I promised I would help them out with that difficult word.  The word &ldquo;constituent&rdquo; means &ldquo;that which constitutes or composes, as a part, or an essential part; a component; an element&rdquo;.  The important thing to remember is the constituents, the essential parts.</P>
      <P>Dryden it was who said &ldquo;Body, soul and reason are the three parts necessarily constituent of a man.  Body and soul do not make man.&rdquo;  But the Minister and the Deputies opposite would have us consider that a livestock mart meant any arrangement, any modification, any assembly of inanimate objects which could be used for the purpose of the sale of cattle by auction even on a temporary basis.  When we emphasised that that was the meaning of this Bill, the Minister did not deny it.  When these most reasonable of all amendments which could be tabled in any Parliament in the world were put down, the Minister said he would not allow them because we were trying to put a restriction on him.  He wanted the widest powers so as to prohibit every sale unless it was one done under the sanction of himself and of his inspectors. That is what is very wrong. That is why we say reject the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; and use &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo;.  I go now to the Oxford English Dictionary, the latest volume available to Deputies.</P>

      <P>No.  It must be a long time since Deputy Cunningham consulted it.  The volume for 1933 is still there.  If the Minister for Finance wants to bring it more up to date, it is up to him.  The word &ldquo;construct&rdquo; means &ldquo;to make or form by fitting the parts together; to frame, build, erect&rdquo;.  It means to build, to construct, to pile up, to heap the parts of things together.  Again, the emphasis in the Oxford Dictionary is on <Col N="271" /> the placing of parts together, assembling them together so as to complete an edifice, to complete a building.  The purpose of the Fine Gael amendment is to provide that we will not consider anything to be a livestock mart unless it is a building constructed for that purpose.  We consider, and the Members opposite know, that the ordinary, reasonable people of this country do not consider anything to be a livestock mart except a building constructed for that purpose. What you are seeking to license here is not a building of that kind but every sale of cattle, sheep and pigs by auction.  One Deputy who supported the Bill thought we were going to licence the sale of puck goats.  It did not seem to worry him that nanny goats were exempt.  That was his understanding of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I apologise to Deputy Clinton but somebody wanted an explanation of the difference between &ldquo;construct&rdquo; and &ldquo;reconstruct&rdquo;.  Again, Sir, out of consideration for your feelings and those of others, we rely upon the Concise Dictionary which Deputies will be glad to hear is 1929&mdash;27 years later than the non-concise one.  This deals, at pages 966, 957, 968 with an explanation of the prefix &ldquo;re&rdquo; in compound words.  I think, Sir, this could be an advanced course for many of the Deputies opposite and I do not propose to go beyond their understanding, but it explains that &ldquo;re&rdquo; is used in connection with other words for the purpose of explaining the doing of something once more, again, anew, afresh, repeated, often, with the implication that previous doing, etc. was deficient or erroneous or now requires alteration or improvement or renewal and mentions in this general description as an example of what they have in mind the verb, transitive, &ldquo;reconstruct&rdquo;.  I hope that will be of assistance to Deputies opposite in considering the worth of this most reasonable amendment tabled by Deputy O'Higgins on <Col N="272" /> behalf of the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>If they fail to understand the meaning of what I have been saying, if they repair with me to the Library, I will be only too glad to take them through more of the reference books there, some of them published a long time ago, which will give them a better understanding of the remaining words in this Bill which runs to six pages and of which we are now only at the fifth line.  If they are unable to accept the validity of what we say, it does seem to me that they would need a crash course in the English language.</P>
      <P>We ask to have this &ldquo;building&rdquo;, as Deputy Hogan said, confined within the limits which the Minister considers are absolutely vital.  We do not consider it is necessary to have this evil exist anywhere, but if it is to exist, let it be within a well-constructed edifice so that at least this madness will not spread over all the land and poison every activity of our people.  Because, remember, this, if we confine it today to cattle, sheep and pigs, we will have it extended for Deputy Corry's edification to the puck goats and then to the nanny goats and then to the sheep of the Fianna Fáil Party and then throughout the country.  The limits of this amendment do not allow me to describe the horrors which will flow if we allow this evil to spread.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2a:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 15, after &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment also concerns the definition section of this Bill.  So far, the Minister has resisted making any alteration at all or, in any event, so far, he has resisted making any of the alterations already proposed to this definition section.</P>
      <P>The first amendment was designed to clarify the position by confining the definition section to auctions.  That has been defeated by a vote of this House. It was then suggested by way of amendment that the operation of the Bill should be restricted by altering the definition section so that the second half of the definition would apply only to places that had been permanently adapted for the sale of livestock by auction.  That amendment also was resisted by the Minister.  He resisted it, I think, on the ground that it was restrictive of the definition section and not acceptable to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We then suggested that the Minister should at least modify the application of the Bill or, rather, modify the Bill in its application by providing that instead of referring to a place <Col N="277" /> adapted for the sale of livestock by auction, it should refer to a place constructed or reconstructed for the sale of livestock by auction.  That, too, was rejected by the Minister, and now the House has decided against it.</P>
    <P>The amendment I have now moved is also for the purpose of trying to clarify the definition section of the Bill and, at the same time, of trying to impose a restriction on the application of this measure, a restriction which I think&mdash;and I hope I am right in this&mdash; is in line with the intention of the Minister, and the intention of the House.</P>
    <P>In order to put this in perspective I think we should consider how the definition would read if this amendment were made.  It would read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;business of a livestock mart&rdquo; means the business of selling livestock by auction or providing, for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise, a place adapted exclusively for the sale of livestock by auction;</P>
    <P>Various arguments were advanced in the course of the discussion on the other amendments, and Deputy Cunningham was one of those who contributed very helpfully, albeit at times only by interjection, in the previous discussion.  It transpired from what was said earlier that circumstances could arise in which a sale conducted by a farmer in his own farmyard would require to be either licensed or exempt from licensing if it were to be lawful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham will remember the particular example given by Deputy Clinton of a man conducting a sale in his own farmyard, and adapting the farmyard by putting out a few bales of straw to provide comfortable seating accommodation for those who attended to bid for the livestock. Deputy Cunningham made it clear that those circumstances would warrant that place being licensed.  I am not going to fence with Deputy Cunningham or anyone else as to whether the occurrence was a single transaction or a series of transactions.  I am prepared to accept that what was in Deputy Cunningham's mind was that this was not merely an isolated transaction <Col N="278" /> but a series of transactions whereby the farmer utilises his yard in that manner for selling his own livestock.</P>
    <P>The point is that Deputy Cunningham believes that such an operation would require to be licensed under this Bill.  I think he is right but I do not think that was the intention of the Minister when he first introduced the Bill.  I think his intention was that the Bill should apply only to proper livestock marts and that it should apply only in the case of operations which were operated as a business, the business of a normal livestock mart.  I do not think it was intended when this Bill was first introduced to capture this kind of accidental operation and I do not think it was intended to have it applied to the control of livestock sales other than in a livestock mart.  It has transpired in the course of the discussion that the wording of the definition section as it stands is at least capable of being interpreted in such a manner as to capture these other operations.</P>
    <P>We have endeavoured to solve the difficulty by some other amendments which were moved.  I am now trying in connection with this amendment to solve the difficulty by presenting the Minister with another suggestion which I think is not going to detract one whit from the effectiveness of the definition section if the amendment is accepted by the Minister and if I am right in what I think was the intention of the Minister and the Government in introducing this legislation at the start.</P>
    <P>It has now been decided by the House that the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; should remain part of the definition section.  While I and others have argued that in the context in which it is used, that word is too vague and too elastic, the House has come to the decision that the word is to remain.  What I want to achieve now, if I can, is that while the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; remains in the definition section, it will be qualified and limited in the way suggested in the amendment.  The quarrel with the use of the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; in relation to a place for the sale of livestock <Col N="279" /> by auction was that in any adaptation which might take place for another purpose, it would, in the sense of the definition of &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; given by the Minister, become a place which had become fit or suitable for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>
    <P>Although the intention might be different, by reason of the adaptation which had taken place in the premises, field or yard, the place had accidentally become fit and suitable for the sale of livestock by auction.  That danger is there and that danger remains, unless we do something to qualify the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;, unless we do something to restrict it and to restrict the definition contained in this section.  I would not be happy with the definition even if the amendment were accepted, but I would be a little happier with it if the Minister is prepared to accept the amendment so as to say that the place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction requires to be adapted exclusively for that purpose.  That is the amendment I am now suggesting, that whatever adaptation is made must be exclusively for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>
    <P>If we make this amendment, a certain amount of the obscurity which exists in relation to the definition, a certain amount of the confusion which may arise later if the courts are charged with the task of interpreting this section, will disappear.  At least we will have achieved the position where there must be a definite intention on the part of the person who carried out the adaptation and that intention must be to make some alteration which is exclusively made for the purpose of enabling that place to be used for the sale of livestock by auction and for no other purpose.</P>
    <P>Relating to the example I gave the Minister earlier, if a person carries out alterations to a paddock for the purpose of containing sheep in pens before dipping them, and if as a result of that operation, the place has become fit and suitable for the sale of livestock by auction, as I see it at the moment there is a danger that that operation would be captured by this definition.  But, if <Col N="280" /> we insert after the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo;, then that danger disappears and the man who constructs barriers, fences or pens to contain his sheep before dipping, can do so with a clear conscience, in the knowledge that there is no danger that that construction of his will require to be licensed or exempted from licence under the provisions of this measure.  If this amendment is accepted, the only places which will require licences will be places which have been provided and adapted exclusively for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>
    <P>It is clear, I think, that those of us who want to deal with the Bill at all want to deal only with livestock marts. If that is so&mdash;again, I invite the Minister to give us his ideas on the matter &mdash;surely there is no reason at all why anyone should resist an amendment which will make that position clear or, at least, make it somewhat clearer than the definition section does at the moment?  I would strongly urge on the Minister, and on the Deputies behind him, the desirability of limiting the all-embracing nature of this definition section.  The Minister has refused to accept our invitation to restrict the definition in the manner previously proposed in the earlier amendments. This amendment will not cause any radical or drastic change in the definition section but it will at least impose on any authority which seeks to establish that a place should have been licensed but was not licensed the obligation and the onus of showing that that place has been adapted exclusively for the purpose of the sale of livestock by auction.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is here now.  He is a man who has had some occasion to deal with questions of agriculture during the period in which he was Minister for Agriculture.  I do not know whether he obtained any briefing from his successor before he left the House but, if he did, I would invite him to give us the benefit of whatever briefing he got.  If he has not had the benefit of such a briefing, then I would ask him to give us his own views on the desirability or otherwise of accepting this amendment and altering, modifying, and qualifying <Col N="281" /> the definition section in the manner I now suggest.  Whether we like it or not, nothing the Minister will say, nothing I will say and nothing any Deputy will say will be relevant subsequently in the courts if this section has to be interpreted by the courts, and, once again, I urge on the House the desirability of clarity, the desirability of ensuring that in this definition section we say what we mean.  If we do not mean to deal with places other than livestock marts, then let us say so in this definition section.  If we do not intend to capture places by accident, because some adaptation has been carried out, which accidentally makes them fit and suitable places for the sale of livestock by auction, let us say so.  We can do that by accepting this amendment and providing that the places in question must be adapted exclusively for the purpose of the sale of livestock by auction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite extraordinary how Fianna Fáil Deputies who intervene in this debate invariably show themselves to be on our side.  I do not think they can be rational men at all.  This amendment has no relation to subsequent user of the premises at all.  The amendment meets the point so eloquently and effectively raised by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Carty, when he intervened in the debate.  He pointed out that the definition section, as at present drafted, includes a farmer's field.  He was arguing against Deputy O'Higgins's proposal&mdash;&ldquo;construct or reconstruct&rdquo;.  He said we cannot construct or reconstruct a field and he was perfectly right.  The purpose of Deputy O'Higgins's amendment on that occasion was to exclude a field and to make it perfectly manifest not only to the citizens but to the judiciary that they must not interpret the business of a livestock mart as meaning the sale of livestock in a field.  For reasons best known to himself, the Minister resisted the amendment.  We now propose <Col N="283" /> to him another phrase which would narrow the application of the Bill to what I understand everyone wants it narrowed and that is a livestock mart as it is popularly understood.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham cannot get it out of his head that the words in the definition section are words of restriction on the user of a livestock mart. There is no reason why, if you have a livestock mart, you should not employ the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and have a symphony concert.  There is no reason why, having got a licence to carry on the business of a livestock mart, you should not have an open-air dance in it or any other function you care to stage in it.  There is no reason why you should not sell wool, hay or any other commodity in it which did not thereby create the kind of nuisance that would render it unfit for the sale of livestock.</P>
      <P>We are all agreed on every side of this House, so far as I can find out, that it is a matter of consequence that this Bill, if it ever passes, should apply to what we ordinarily understand a livestock mart to be.  We are also agreed that manifestly, as the Bill is drafted, it will not do that.  It will apply not only to what we all understand a livestock mart to be but to fields, yards and a variety of other possibilities to which clearly the House does not want it to apply.  The Minister's defence of that is not that he disagrees with that assumption but that he knows it to be true.  It is for that reason that he has put section 4 into the Bill.  He wants to say to the House: &ldquo;Everywhere is potentially a livestock mart but I will undertake hereafter-ward, by regulation made, to exempt such premises as are caught which do not fall within the ordinary meaning of the words `the business of a livestock mart&rdquo;.  We pointed out to him that that is not the way to pass legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood the Minister to say to Deputy Corish that he intended to spend the months that lie immediately ahead after the passage of this Bill in <Col N="284" /> discussion and negotiation with the various interests to determine what exemptions need to be made in order to bring within the scope of the Act those premises he intended and believed the House intended to cover and to prepare the exemptions requisite to exclude the premises which manifestly were never meant to be touched.  I think he demurred to my paraphrase of what he said when I spoke of discussions which would lead to agreement as to the exemption orders.  He was prepared, I think, to discuss it only for the purpose of agreeing, if that were possible, on the terms of the exemption orders he ought to make without any prior commitment to make such orders.  We are not prepared to accept that and I think any Legislature that did accept it would be reneging on its fundamental responsibility.</P>
    <P>I think there is a graver indictment against the Minister.  All his colleagues in his Party have made it manifest that they do not understand precisely what it is the Bill will actually operate upon. He does not claim to know himself at this stage when he says that, after discussions, he will, by regulation, limit the application of the Bill in such a way as to make it apply to what is known only as the business of the livestock marts.  Our purpose is to come as near to a definition in the Bill as to make the user of section 4 virtually unnecessary, except in the case of an exceptional show, an agricultural show or perhaps a place where a sale would be held once, or even once a year.  We made suggestions for the qualification in the definition section which would make the use of that exemption section virtually unnecessary if the Minister meant to transact parliamentary business in the customary way.</P>
    <P>It was perfectly open to the Minister, at the beginning of this Committee Stage debate, to say: &ldquo;You have down approximately seven amendments all substantially directed to the same end, that is, to make the definition of &ldquo;the business of a livestock mart&rdquo; more certain.  I do not like Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.  I shall look at this No. 6 or I shall look at No. 7 and <Col N="285" /> I shall see if I cannot draft something on those lines between now and Report Stage.&rdquo;  Everybody would then know that the Minister meant business and that that is the way he would go about his business.  I want to admit quite frankly that had the Minister, at the beginning of the Committee Stage of this Bill, done so, he would then have the right to look across at us and to ask: &ldquo;Why are you trying to resort to perpetual devices to hold up this Bill?&rdquo; and we should have had to answer and to make a case for that but it has never happened.</P>
    <P>A deliberative assembly has no purpose if there is not some effort to reach a consensus about the details of a measure.  It is perfectly proper and perfectly normal, in regard to only about 20 per cent of our legislation, that, on the principle of the Second Stage of a Bill, there should be a head-on clash, on principle, which is to be resolved in the lobbies.  Eighty per cent of the legislation of this House never brings anyone into the lobbies at all, for the simple reason that 80 per cent is necessary legislation which all reasonable men know is requisite for carrying on the affairs of State.  The remaining 20 per cent of the legislation deals with matters about which we differ fundamentally and this is resolved by applying the rules of majority.  But of the 80 per cent that passes through on Second Stage without reference to the Division Lobby, 90 per cent is amended in Committee and the interesting thing is that it is almost invariably at the instance of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, not so long ago, learned that the sensible and sane way in which to get legislation enacted sensibly is not to come in convinced that in regard to everything, you must dig your heels into the ground.  If the Opposition feel strongly about something that does not go to the roots of the Bill and about which a change might be made, he may say: &ldquo;Very well; as to amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, these are amendments I cannot accept: Nos. 5 and 6 aim at the same end and while I could not accept them in their present form, I will look at the matter and I can bring in something <Col N="286" /> on Report Stage.&rdquo;  Has the Minister for Agriculture said that at any stage of the Committee Stage of this Bill?  He has not.  If the Minister had said, <i>ab initio:</i>&ldquo;That definition is adequate; it is precise and there can be no doubt about its application.  It will stand up in any court of law.  I have examined it from all aspects raised by the Opposition and I am advised, and I agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that this amendment is merely another effort to produce the certainty which the Minister does not claim is present in his own Bill.  The only definition he has to fall back on is section 4.  I am arguing not to reverse the decision taken in principle on the Second Stage of the Bill but recognising that decision has been taken, against our vote, not for a moment declaring we approve the principle of the Bill, though we accept the fact that Dáil Éireann has, but saying at least let us know what the Bill is intended to do.  Let us know the categories of persons to whom the Bill is intended to apply.  I say, and I challenge contradiction by the Minister for Finance or anybody else, that there is no living creature at this moment who knows to whom this Bill will apply.  We know the categories of persons who will be overtaken but we do not know the categories of persons who may be overtaken by this Bill in regard to section 4 to secure certificates of exemption from the Minister for the time being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham is wrong in imagining that this amendment would place any burden on co-operative societies.  The amendment simply imposes the duty on a court to determine what the intention was of the adapter when he made the adaptation, If he had a certain intention, then he had undertaken the business of a livestock mart, and immediately all the other sections apply to him, but it would be open to him to argue in court: &ldquo;I never sought to qualify as a person in the <Col N="287" /> business of a livestock mart.  I made these adaptations to my premises just to make them more convenient and I do not want, and am not looking for, a licence for a livestock mart.  Therefore sales carried on here otherwise than by auction do not come within the ambit of the Minister's supervision at all&rdquo;.  But suppose he makes the adaptations exclusively for the sale of livestock by auction, then his decision affects merely his status in the eyes of the law. He now ceases to be a farmer and becomes a person engaged in the business of a livestock mart.  Thereafter he is as free as a bird to use his premises as he will, provided he does not reduce them to a condition in which the Minister's regulations would declare them to be unsuitable for the purpose of carrying on the business of a livestock mart.</P>
    <P>It is manifestly ludicrous to suggest that the sale of wool, or corn, or any other material ancillary to the agricultural industry, in such place could be calculated to violate any rational reeulation the Minister could conceivably make under a Livestock Marts Bill.  If the Minister, on Committee Stage, is prepared to say: &ldquo;I agree that the definition section is too wide but I have not found any of your amendments which I regard as acceptable, but I will look at the Bill and if I do not take Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, we might find a solution which would be satisfactory in relation to No. 6 or 7,&rdquo; then a very different situation would arise.  However, we are in the position that the Minister is steadfast in so far as he wants power over everybody and the House must take on faith what the Minister will provide in due course under section 4.  I do not accept that and I do not think anybody on this side of the House will accept it.  I never heard such a claim being made by any Minister of any Government before.  It is a bad legislative precedent and one to which we emphatically demur.  Even if he persists in it, we want to fix the House with notice that we think it is a bad principle, that we will correct <Col N="288" /> it at the earliest possible opportunity and that we will not accept it hereafter as any precedent upon which legislation can be promoted here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Although we on this side of the House have made it very clear that we do not like this Bill in any shape or form, the Minister must concede that this series of amendments on section 1, coming up to the one we are dealing with at the moment, is a definite attempt to give a fundamentally sound definition to the Bill. My principal objection to this Bill is that it is filled with ambiguity from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  A Bill such as this, which is likely to meet a good deal of opposition and, shall we say, adamant resistance in the country, should be made crystal clear to those who have to construe its meaning.  I submit to the House that this section, unamended as it is to date, is such that it is going to lead to endless controversy as to what the section actually means.  From the beginning we have argued from this side of the House that a clear definition of what is intended is necessary for those who will be directly concerned with this legislation.</P>
      <P>The amendment I am speaking in support of at the moment, moved by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, seems to make absolutely clear what is intended as a definition of a livestock mart.  It seems to pin it down and to place over it an umbrella of safety from the many doubts, dangers and difficulties cited by Deputies on the Fine Gael benches.  If we have embodied in this section the word &ldquo;exclusively,&rdquo; far from its causing confusion, as suggested by Deputy Cunningham&mdash;the only Deputy from that side of the House who has spoken on this amendment so far&mdash;it will make clear to all and sundry that a livestock mart is an exclusive place for the sale of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the very few interventions made by the Minister, at least while I have been in the House, during this long session, he referred to the fact that any existing livestock mart would be granted a licence.  That stands here officially on the record.  He said that dogmatically here one day.  For that reason it is above all necessary to get <Col N="289" /> a clear picture in our own minds of what a livestock mart means.  Anyone reading the opening section&mdash;un-amended as it unfortunately is to date, despite the valiant efforts of my colleagues&mdash;must see clearly that it does not define what a livestock mart is. Words can convey a good many things. If words did not convey a good many things, we would not have so many of the legal fraternity practising in this country today.  We are trying to nail it down so that in this Bill, in this unwanted political child of the Fianna Fáil Party in this Dáil, we can at least get a definition of what we are going to deal with.  That is the reason why this debate has dragged on interminably.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows the Bill is arousing a good deal of controversy.  He knows there is a great deal of opposition to it.  He is probably conscious of the fact there is not a lot of support over his shoulder in favour of the Bill, in spite of the oft-repeated protestations of his Parliamentary Secretary that we are speaking to a unanimous Party on the subject.  It is necessary this Bill should get off to a good start. Therefore, it is unfortunate that this debate from the beginning has been marred by the fact that amendments put down by the main Opposition Party&mdash;it appears to be our function in this House to protect the rights of those we conceive we should protect&mdash; should have been treated with such scant consideration.  I would hope that when the Minister intervenes, as I hope he will intervene presently, to say &ldquo;yea&rdquo; or &ldquo;nay&rdquo; to this amendment&mdash; I consider it more likely he will say &ldquo;nay&rdquo;&mdash;if he says it with a good grace and gives us a full explanation as to why he says &ldquo;nay&rdquo;, it will create a happier situation in this long drawn-out debate and will also create, if we have to have it, a better Bill.  That is the main and primary purpose of the introduction of this amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon drew attention to the very unusual fact&mdash;in my time in Dáil Éireann I never remember it-that on the first section of a Bill there are six or seven amendments tabled to the definition.  I have never <Col N="290" /> known that to happen before.  I hope that as long as I remain in public life I will not see it happen again.  It is surely an indication that we are dealing with a measure with which there is something wrong.  In my experience of debate in this House, which is considerable, normally a Bill comes in and perhaps meets with a certain amount of adverse criticism in the preliminary stages when opinions are expressed in favour of or against it. But when one proceeds to the Committee Stage, the Ceann Comhairle says &ldquo;Section 1 stand part of the Bill&rdquo; and there are no amendments before the House.  That, in itself, should make the Minister, his Parliamentary Secretary and those who advise him stop to think.</P>
    <P>After all, this strenuous and hard-fought opposition on behalf of the Party to which I belong must mean something.  What have we to gain by holding up this Bill, when it is quite evident already that the guillotine is being used almost as freely as it was in France in 1797?  We have nothing to gain except the fact, as I have said, that we wish to try to secure at least a clear definition.  The Minister will find that acceptance of this amendment would do nothing except improve and clarify the definition.  If he accepts the amendment, he will find that he will have a better atmosphere in dealing with the Bill generally, that he will get more co-operation from the Members of this House than, perhaps, he is likely to get if everything we suggest here, everything we offer him, is rejected.  These amendments come, not from the idle thoughts of an idle fellow, but from hard work, thought out behind the scenes with competent advisers and the full use of the political intuition which I claim we command in this Party.</P>
    <P>It is frustrating to an Opposition if they try to make a debate effective and to produce a better Bill and a better definition by amendments so that it may be acceptable not only to us on this side of the House but to the Minister's Party and, above all, to the country, to have their amendments rejected.  Therefore, I ask the Minister <Col N="291" /> when he intervenes, as I hope he will in the near future, to consider including this simple word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; in this first section and in that way provide some clarification.  If he is not prepared to accept the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo;, will he open up the debate and tell us why he feels that word is not acceptable?  If he does that, he will be going a long way towards making this a more useful debate, not only for us in the Opposition but for his own followers because when they go down to their constituencies at the week-end they will be able to justify themselves to their constituents for voting for the Bill.  They will be able to say that they did not vote like sheep, that they voted because their Minister got up and opposed amendments and when he opposed them, gave a full explanation justifying his opposition.  It is for that purpose, not wishing to detain the House any longer, at this stage that I now give way, hoping that the Minister's answer this time will be &ldquo;aye&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;nay&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to disappoint the Deputy but the answer is still &ldquo;no&rdquo; and for the very good reason that far from the Deputy and his Party having given any great thought to this matter with a view to being helpful, they set out from the start and time without number during the various Second Reading debates, not to mention the filibustering of the past couple of days, they have indicated that they want no part of the Bill and this they have displayed to such a degree that the most obtuse of their blindest followers must know that their opposition is for opposition's sake.  After all the flowery language in which they may dress up this amendment, it comes down to the same thing that if we are to have the definition section as they propose, it would require another volume to define what the definition section meant.  The Deputies well know that this is the purpose of their amendments and then they come in tongue in cheek after spending nine hours on the previous <Col N="292" /> amendment, on which incidentally, technically, there was a closure motion but the fact is that they had dried up and had nothing more to say.</P>

      <P>They have spent nine hours bluffing and bumming their way, obstructing the House, with no thought &mdash;I deliberately say this&mdash;not a thought in the nut of any one of them, to do anything for the Bill except to obstruct its passage.  Their object has been determined quite a bit back, namely, to obstruct this Bill as a test of their strength as an Opposition to overpower the majority in this House.  This they are not going to get doing now or at any other time either inside the House or outside.</P>
      <P>The definition section in this Bill, without amendment, is as clear and as fair as it is possible to draft such. The word now under discussion, the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo;, if adopted, would do nothing for the section, which is a definition section and should be to define something.  All it would do would be to make for imprecision. That is all it would add to the section. It is proposed to amend the section by the addition of a word and the only thing this word would do is to make for imprecision.  There is the sort of Opposition that we have who have behind closed doors or out of sight given a great deal of thought to this and put a great deal of effort into it and were well advised.  I have not the slightest doubt that they were well advised, that they gave it a great deal of thought, but I question the motives that inspired the work and the thought and the advice that was tendered which brought about these amendments because here is how the section would read if Fine Gael had their way.  Listen to it and then tell me when I am finished what it does mean:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;business of a livestock mart&rdquo; means the business of selling livestock by auction or providing for the holding of sales of livestock at a place permanently adapted exclusively and habitually used for the sale of livestock by auction but does <Col N="293" /> not include the sale otherwise than by auction of livestock the property of the proprietor of such a place.</P>
    <P>Did you ever see anything approaching that as a definition section in any Bill, even those introduced by your Party as part of the Coalition Government?</P>

      <P>They introduced the measures that I have chided Deputy Dillon for bringing into this House and he would glory in their usefulness now, despite the fact that what is in them is no different in the slightest degree from the terms of this Bill here. I refer to the Fertilisers, Feedingstuffs and Mineral Mixtures Act, 1955.  That is the sort of stuff we are getting from Fine Gael and Fine Gael seriously expect to get it across in this House and hope for outside publicity, and that there may be people foolish enough to believe that they have any role in this House or wish to have any role other than that of obstructors and destroyers in every sense of the word.</P>
      <P>We have listened to the mumbo-jumbo that has come from that side of the House for nine hours on the previous amendment, a continuous repetition, as far removed as possible from what was at issue.  Then they come along, tongue in cheek, in an effort to show that they are good boys in the Opposition, trying to make the Bill better than it would be without their assistance and that the Minister does not appreciate their efforts.  I do appreciate them and that is why I am saying what I have said now so that the few members of the public outside who can see anything in their antics except obstruction will not be misled &mdash;not even the few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they feel as an Opposition that they are getting anywhere with this creation that they are trying to impose on us here by sheer will of their Party, they have a change of mind coming.  I will go further and say that after the whipping up of opposition to this Bill they have attempted in this House opposition to it is now dwindling. By their antics they have helped <Col N="294" /> it to dwindle because those on whom they may have exerted influence are beginning to catch themselves on, are beginning to realise that this section does not mean what they have gone to great lengths to repeat time without number.  It does not mean that farmers cannot sell their cattle in their own backyard, that farmers cannot sell their cattle in their own pastures.  This is the greatest fabrication of all time and it has been repeated over there, parrot-like, by speaker after speaker as if it were gospel.  It is the greatest lie that has been put across the House so far, and goodness knows, there have been many in the days we have been listening to the Opposition opposing this measure for opposition's sake.</P>
    <P>I want to let the Opposition clearly understand they have had their hours of debate.  They have contributed nothing.  They have attempted to arouse opposition to the Bill where none exists.  They are doing no service to the community, no service to the farmers, no service to the mart owners, and in time they will find they are doing no service to themselves as an Opposition.  We have a motion on the Order Paper to put an end to this farce that has been imposed on the House by Fine Gael, claiming it is their right as an Opposition to uphold the rights of the public.  This farce will be brought to an end within a few days, and I think the public, if they could have their voice heard in here, would have it finish tonight, not two or three nights from now.</P>
    <P>We are bringing it to an end because of the waste of time and money that has been imposed on this House by Fine Gael for the sheer sake of obstructing a measure they do not like, in the hope of making political capital out of it.  This cost is too high to be allowed to continue further.  The Opposition have their hours between now and whatever time may be determined by the motion which will be taken tomorrow night.  Let them not waste those hours on these useless, stupid amendments they have down here.  Let them go on to the real bones of the Bill.  Let us hear some construetive thoughts expressed by them and <Col N="295" /> let them get away from these silly little pranks in which they have been indulging.</P>
    <P>Let this be a warning to them.  Let them not say at the end of the week they had no time to discuss the important parts of the Bill.  They will not have any time if they fiddle their time away as they have been fiddling the time away in this House for the past couple of weeks on these silly little amendments, trying to make imprecise what is precise and is as fair and just as can be composed by any draftsman. They should not try to put it across that this definition section is something to be abhorred, the like of which was never seen before.  It is in several Acts, two or three of which have been supported by the Party who now oppose this measure.  If it was worthy of their support then, why is it so abhorrent now?</P>
    <P>Let them tell this House and the public why they cannot see the point in having a definition section which is fair and just and which, if the Opposition amendments were added to it, would become so imprecise that it would need further definition to define the definition section.  Do not let Deputies in Fine Gael, either in the front bench or in the back benches, tell me that they are so far removed from things that they do not see that this is the effect their amendments would have, and let them not be so naïve as to try to make me or any other Member of this House believe that these amendments were not designed for the purpose of confusion and imprecision.</P>
    <P>That is what Fine Gael set out to do and they worked very hard behind closed doors to do it.  All I can say is they did an excellent job.  With the help of all the legal brains in their Party, they have done their best to nullify the definition section so that the Bill would have no meaning.  This is what Fine Gael want to do and this is exactly what the Government will not allow them to do.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I must thank the Minister for his intervention, <Col N="296" /> but I must also say he is not being very informative on the different points on which we have been seeking information.  He has sidestepped those points and contented himself with merely telling us how to conduct our opposition.</P>
      <P>I admit we are filibustering, and there is nothing wrong with that.  I do not think any Irishman should ever say anything about filibustering.  It was filibustering by Irishmen in another House, the parent House of Parliament, which first focused attention upon the wrongs and sufferings of this country and helped to initiate developments which culminated in the measure of freedom we enjoy today. Therefore an Irishman is the last man who should decry filibustering.  I suppose it is an annoyance to any Minister who wants to push through a Bill, and if I were in the Minister's position, I would probably be saying the same thing about filibustering.  Nevertheless, I do not think it is a terrible crime or anything of which we should be ashamed.</P>
      <P>We object to this Bill <i>in toto</i>, and we object particularly to its broad implications. We realise we cannot prevent its being passed and we have endeavoured, in so far as we could, by various amendments, to limit its application. This purports to be a Livestock Marts Bill and the amendments we have put in have been designed to keep it as that and no more.  It is quite possible that when this Bill is passed, if it does not receive too much opposition and if the Minister can get it to operate, it will be remembered and used, for a considerable time at least, as a Livestock Marts Bill.  However, by definition, the Minister has extended its power and its scope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been chided here for devoting too much attention to definition. The Minister said that many Bills have got through this House and never before had he seen this type of opposition on the simple question of definition. Even the Ceann Comhairle has criticised our approach as being too broad when dealing with, perhaps, a simple amendment concerning one word.  He has remonstrated with us more than <Col N="297" /> once that we are extending the scope of our remarks too widely, but I would make the point that the various amendments we have put down, including this amendment, are not simple amendments to ordinary sections in the Bill. This amendment with which we are dealing is an amendment to the very fundamentals of the Bill, the definition of what is a livestock mart.  It is an amendment to the field of operation of the Bill, and if we object to the Bill in substance, we must logically try to limit its application.</P>
    <P>We can only do that by putting down a series of amendments to the definition section of the Bill.  In so far as the definition section is fundamental to the Bill, our remarks, of necessity, at times tend to be general and indeed would warrant in that context almost a Report Stage speech.  It is wrong to contend that, because it is a short amendment, our remarks must therefore be confined to extremely narrow limits and, as might be said, entirely related to the amendment as written down.  All these amendments are on a broad issue, the spread, scope or extent of the Bill.  We are trying to persuade the Minister to accept a watertight definition applicable solely to livestock marts as everyone here understood that term up to now.</P>
    <P>At the moment, this is, in effect, a Livestock Sales Bill if we are to follow the definition which we are trying to amend.  It purports to be a Livestock Marts Bill and I believe the Minister initially will try to operate it as such but he has allowed himself sufficient elbow room to operate it as a Marts Bill if he finds he is obstructed.  That is why there is this apparent discrepancy between the Title of the Bill, which is the Livestock Marts Bill, the Preamble to the Bill and the definition.  By a definition bringing all forms of livestock sales within the ambit of the Bill, the Minister is giving himself power to meet any opposition which he feels may arise.  Obsessed with this difficulty he has had with the farming organisations, particularly the NFA, he is resisting any attempt to narrow this down to livestock marts.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The amendment is designed to relate the Bill to livestock marts: the definition is designed to relate the Bill to livestock sales.  It is that discrepancy we are attempting to overcome.  In the event of the livestock marts not accepting this Bill, refusing to operate it or suppose it comes about that the farmers refuse to send cattle into the marts when this Bill comes into operation because they are frightened or because they think they will not get fair play, or because they do not like the Bill or for any other reason, they may decide to do as their fathers did, not go to the marts even if there is a local one but try to sell their cattle as best they can outside the mart at a local fair.  They may say: &ldquo;Although there is a mart in the town, we will not go there any more and let the Minister see how we dispose of our livestock.  We shall do as we always did.  We shall now go back to tradition and hold our meeting as a fair.&rdquo;  The Minister by extending the scope of the definition bevond livestock marts in now entitled to intervene and proscribe any fair which may be set up in that way.  This is why he has introduced the extensive definition.</P>

I am sure Deputy Cunningham, a man with a logical mind and a man who has studied many more of these productions than I have, would appreciate and understand that conformity between the Title of the Bill, the Preamble and the definition <Col N="299" /> is very desirable and that anything else suggests a lack of logic and coherence.  The purpose is clear and I have outlined it.  I believe the Minister does not wish to do that; I give him that much credit but he is obsessed with this fear of opposition to such an extent that he feels he must take unto himself power to proscribe any fair that may arise as an evasion of the operation of this measure or in any other way.  This is a completely wrong approach.  None of us agrees that this Marts Bill is really necessary.</P>

We are getting bad example from the Minister himself. The Minister did refer to the amendment in a passing manner towards the end of his speech and said he had no intention of accepting it or any other of the amendments on the definition section, that if he accepted any of them, it would only lessen the effectiveness of the section and make its meaning more obscure.</P>
      <P>From his standpoint, the amendment might make the definition section less effective because he does not want it to mean anything other than what he wants to achieve from it.  We know that this is the most important section of the Bill because on it depend all the other sections, on it depends his whole control over the livestock marts of the country.  We have reason to suspect how he is going to use that control and for that reason we are using every device at our disposal, and we make no apology for it, to make this definition section so clear that there will be no uncertainty about it and that when the courts come to interpret it, they will have a fair chance of saying that someone has or has not contravened the Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to endeavour to word the definition section with all our amendments in it in order to confuse the public mind.  What we have done is to offer the Minister a number of amendments but they are alternatives all down the way.

He complains that we do not drive on into what he describes as the more important sections of the Bill.  We have no intention of driving on.  This is a disgraceful and abominable piece of legislation that we want to dissect into its smallest pieces to show the people the rot that is in it and I do not accept that the Minister has the right to dictate to us as to how we will conduct our business as the Opposition in this House.</P>

      <P>I will accept the ruling of the Chair on this, but I have been goaded into it by the remarks of the Minister on one of the few occasions on which he has contributed to the debate.  We have one purpose, and one purpose only, in putting forward these amendments, that is, to make this definition section less dangerous and to clarify the situation for all those who will eventually be concerned in the operation of the Bill if it succeeds in <Col N="306" /> getting through this House.  I know that all the force the Government can use, the closure and the guillotine, is being used by them to secure this measure for their own purposes, to secure a measure that is unwanted by everybody concerned in the trade.</P>
      <P>We are naturally going to use all the devices we can to oppose this Bill, and if we cannot oppose it outright, we are doing our best to improve it.  It is not easy to improve a measure that is rotten in itself but we have tried to divorce ourselves from the background which begot this measure and to see if there is any way in which we can make it less dangerous and less objectionable to the people who are being forced to accept it until we get this Government out of power.</P>

We are trying to save them from their own folly.  We are trying to improve this Bill and, by our amendments, save them from their own destruction because their majority in this House has obviously gone to their heads.  The only thing we can do now, therefore, is to take this Bill to pieces to see in what way we can possibly improve it.  We have made a number of attempts to amend it.  Our first amendment was not accepted; our second amendment was not accepted.</P>

      <P>The amendment we now propose suggests that the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; be qualified by the addition of the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo;.  The Minister stated earlier on, and he repeated it a while ago, that he wants this word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; to apply only to what everybody knows is a full-blown livestock mart, with all the equipment and essential ancillary buildings.  That is what the Minister says and then he comes back again and says it excludes <Col N="307" /> the field and the man selling cattle in his own haggard.  He repeats that. But I have heard the Minister before repeat things on other measures and I know that it does not matter how often he does so.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the Planning Bill and the Housing Bill.  A great deal of what the Minister said on those two Bills has proved to be a lot of nonsense.  Law agents all over the country have laughed and said: &ldquo;We do not care what the Minister said.  It is not written into the legislation.&rdquo; While the Minister says he does not mean it to apply to certain things, we have fears about it because he refuses to amend in the slightest degree the definition section and because we know he is completely insincere in the statements he makes here. If he said: &ldquo;Look, I see it is wide open and I am prepared on Report Stage to redraft it along these lines so that it will not be limitless and will not be wide open to any and every sort of interpretation, will that satisfy the Opposition?&rdquo; then he would automatically eliminate seven of the amendments we have down to this section.  If he were generous enough and genuine enough to do that, we would long since have finished our discussion on this definition section but, because he refuses to move and because he comes in here and makes a bluffing speech, intended to deceive the public, we must keep on.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment.  The outburst we have just had from the Minister is typical of his attitude, typical of the bulldozing tactics he is adopting in order to get this legislation.  In putting forward these amendments, we have tried to clear up ambiguities in the definition section.  The Minister really went to town a few moments ago in relation to the Opposition because we have put down seven or eight amendments to this definition section.  We make no apology either to the Minister or to the Government for moving this amendment, an amendment designed to ensure that the Minister will see eventually that this word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; needs qualification.  In an earlier amendment, we tried to get it deleted altogether from the Bill.  We failed in that and we now seek to qualify the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; by the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo;.  We would have preferred it had the Minister accepted the earlier amendment and deleted the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;.  But the Minister refused and we must now press for acceptance of this qualification.</P>
      <P>The argument in support of this amendment is somewhat similar to that advanced on a previous amendment. By the insertion of the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo;, we are trying to ensure that the powers the Minister seeks will be clearly defined and that, in the event of premises being adapted for the sale of livestock, that adaptation would be done in such manner as to bring the particular premises into conformity with modern marketing requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister makes a very big mistake if he thinks that by hurling all manner of abuse and imputing all manner of motives to us in the Opposition for daring to fight this Bill line by line in amendment after amendment, he will win the day.  As Deputy Clinton said, our opposition to the Bill and our amendments are put forward because we want to ensure that the powers the Minister seeks will be as limited as it is humanly possible to make them.  We are opposed to a Minister <Col N="309" /> seeking the dictatorial powers he seeks.  We are doubly concerned because the present Minister is, in our opinion, not the type of person to whom unlimited powers should be given to control this most important sector of our agricultural industry.</P>

      <P>The Minister a few moments ago left me and my colleagues under no misapprehension whatsoever as to what he is seeking, particularly under this definition section. It is something we have suspected for a long time; he is seeking unlimited power to control not merely the livestock marts but the entire internal marketing of livestock.  Judging by the mood he was in a while ago, there seems little hope that the Minister will listen to reason but I would appeal to him at this stage to accept this amendment. It is not limiting his powers as much as we might like them limited, had he accepted the earlier amendments, but at least by accepting this amendment, he would be showing some evidence of goodwill, of being reasonable and of a desire to arrive at some type of a formula which might be acceptable.  I trust the Minister will see his way to consider acceptance of this amendment.</P>

      <P>Judging from the descriptions I have heard of it, it seemed to be interesting and possibly even informative.  I gathered the Minister repeated his performance in endeavouring to read this definition section in the context of including in it the various amendments which have been proposed and some of which have been discussed.  Of course, that is not realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Clinton pointed out and <Col N="310" /> as I pointed out earlier, we are moving a series of amendments.  A number of them would not arise if the first amendment which was debated to this section had been accepted.  It is because of the insistence of the Government that this Bill should be so framed that it applies not only to auctions but to any other type of sale of livestock which is involved in the inclusion in the definition section of the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; and because they resisted the amendment proposed in that connection that it then became necessary for us to consider in the light of that attitude, what alternative existed, what other method might be appropriate for mellowing in some way the provisions of this definition section.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary will recall, I have no doubt, that the amendment we are now discussing and the other amendment, Nos. 1a, 2b and 3a, were handed in and tabled only when it became clear that there was no &ldquo;give&rdquo; in the Minister in relation to the first amendment proposed by Deputy Clinton.  There is nothing anomalous, therefore, at all about tabling amendments which give, or are designed to give, alternative reliefs if the one at first suggested could not be availed of.  In those circumstances, the other amendmenrs were tabled only when it became clear that the first amendment would not be accepted.</P>
    <P>All the amendments are designed to limit the scope of the operation of this Bill.  The only way in which the scope of its operation can effectively be limited is by an amendment of the definition section.  It has been pointed out already that this section is an all-important section because it sets out the territory over which the writ of this Bill will run.  The definition section sets out the types of places, the types of transactions, that will be made subiect to the other provisions in the Bill. If the definition section is expanded, then the whole scope of the Bill is ex-Danded. If the definition section is limited or restricted in any way, then the whole scope of the operation of the Bill is likewise limited and restricted.</P>
    <P>We are unashamedly seeking to limit <Col N="311" /> the scope of the operation of this Bill. It has, I think, been made quite clear, and I think it is accepted by both sides of the House, that the second part of the definition of a livestock mart, which appears in the definition section, is open to endless possibilities if it remains unaltered and, in particular, if the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; is allowed to remain in that definition without any qualification or modification whatever.</P>
    <P>Other amendments were designed to bring about a limitation of the section and thereby to bring about a limitation of the operation of the Bill, when enacted.  The amendment we are concerned with at the moment is designed to pinpoint as far as we can the type of place which will be affected by this Bill when it becomes an Act.  It is suggested in the definition of &ldquo;business of a livestock mart&rdquo; which appears in the Bill at the moment that any place which is adapted, and adapted in any way, for the sale of livestock by auction should come within the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>What does coming within the scope of the Bill involve?  I do not want to wander into a discussion which anticipates any of the other sections of the Bill or any of the other amendments, but as the Minister pointed out, it is necessary to have regard in our discussions to what comes later.  It is at least necessary, to drive home the point, to advert to what the scope of the Bill involves.  It involves the necessity of obtaining a licence.  It involves that that licence, the giving or withholding of it, should be within the sole discretion of the Minister.  I do not intend to initiate a discussion on that but when we have regard to that fact, we shall see that the question of what will or what will not be affected by the licensing provisions of this Bill is important and they are defined by the section we are now discussing arising out of this amendment.</P>
    <P>As it stands, any adaptation of a place which renders that place fit or suitable for the sale of livestock by auction is captured, in my view, by this definition.  I know there is the point of view, and I think there is <Col N="312" /> validity in it, that it is captured only if it is more than an isolated incident, if the business of providing such a place is being operated, but the business of providing such a place may be operated in a number of ways which I still believe it was never contemplated should require to be licensed under the Bill.  The most glaring example of that is the case of a man who habitually conducts, or arranges to have conducted, a sale of his own livestock in his own premises.  There seems to be no doubt that if he does that as a course of conduct, does it following a traditional pattern which he has established himself or which has been established by his father or forefathers in relation to that place&mdash;if that is done by auction and if the premises are in any way adapted, such a transaction is captured for licence under this.</P>
    <P>As I say, as long as the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; is not modified or limited in any way, then it does not matter whether the adaptation that takes place is large or small.  It has been conceded that the throwing out of a few bales of straw to make comfortable seating accommodation under cover for people interested in bidding for the livestock comes within the ambit of this definition. That has been made clear through the discussions that took place on other amendments and it is not necessary to labour the point, but when we see that an adaptation as slight as that can bring that place within the ambit of this definition, then surely we can see the dangers involved in allowing this definition to remain unaltered and allowing the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; to remain without qualification.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we made efforts which, without boasting, I would regard as valiant efforts to bring about some changes.  Those efforts have been defeated because time after time the Government have applied the closure to the discussions and subsequently voted down the proposed amendments. The amendment we are now discussing is not an amendment which is going to change radically the position under this definition section.  At least it is not going to bring about changes as radical <Col N="313" /> as those already discussed here, and consequently Deputy Clinton is right when he points to the fact that by reason of the other amendments having been voted down, we are now a stage nearer to the Minister.</P>
    <P>All we are asking in the amendment is to modify the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;, which is an elastic word, by providing that the place in question should be adapted exclusively for the sale of livestock by auction.  We do not like the idea that a place even adapted exclusively for the sale of livestock by auction should require to be licensed or exempt from a licence under this Bill.  We do not like that idea at all but it is better that we should endeavour at least to limit the application of the Bill in so far as we can to such places as are exclusively adapted for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham advised that this amendment should not be accepted.  I do not pretend to recall accurately every word the Deputy uttered but the general idea of his argument seemed to be that he was against this amendment because it would penalise farmers' co-operative societies.  Deputy Cunningham has the wrong idea about this Bill.  He seems to regard it as a Bill which is conferring a benefit on people by requiring them to obtain a licence.  That is poles apart from our conception of this Bill. We do not regard it as conferring any benefit on people to require that they should have their premises licensed. It is much preferable that the situation should exist where they do not require a licence and where they are not guilty of an offence if they do not obtain either a licence or an exemption order under section 4.  Deputy Cunningham seems to think that there is some advantage in making this definition section as wide as possible to enable as many people as possible, as many businesses as possible and as many places as possible, to come within its ambit.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Cunningham thinks about the matter a little more, he will find that the reverse is the position and that the more you confine the operation of this section the more you confine the operation of the Bill, and the more you <Col N="314" /> confine the operation of the Bill, the fewer people are going to be afflicted by its provisions.  Many of the provisions of the Bill are tough.  As the Bill stands, they can lead to fines of £1,000 or six months in jail, or both, on breach of the provisions, so that so far as the ordinary owner of livestock Is concerned, it seems to me to be obviously to his advantage that he should not come within the scope of this Bill.  We are trying in this amendment to exclude from its provisions any place which was not adapted exclusively for the sale of livestock by auction.  If it is adapted exclusively for that purpose, then without any pleasure, without any joy in it, we are prepared to concede to the Minister: in that event let the provisions of this Bill apply, let that particular place be required to get a licence, let the owner be guilty of an offence if he carries on the business of a livestock mart in it without either obtaining a licence or obtaining an exemption under section 4.  We are prepared to give that concession to the Minister&mdash;not because we like doing it but because the votes of the majority of Deputies have rejected what we regard as more suitable amendments, which would have a greater mellowing effect on the section.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton stated that this Bill was unwanted.  He was challenged on that by some Deputies who wanted to know by whom the Bill was unwanted. The difficulty is to find out who wants the Bill, apart from the Fianna Fáil Government.  There is no gainsaying the fact that there has been no outcry in favour of this Bill.  There has been no demand to have a Bill which defines the business of a livestock mart in this particular manner.  There has been no demand from anyone I know of.  It may be that the Minister, or the Deputies who interrupted Deputy Clinton, have more detailed information than I have.  As far as I can see, the NFA, the Council of the Incorporated Law Society, the IAOS, the Cork Marts, the Associated Livestock Marts, and I think I could say two of the national newspapers, the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the <i>Irish Times</i> have <Col N="315" /> all been critical of the provisions of this Bill.  The Council of the Incorporated Law Society have described the Bill as &ldquo;dangerous and possibly unconstitutional.&rdquo;  They have gone on record as giving their criticism of the Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Bill remains unaltered, if the scope remains as wide as it is, then the danger is all the greater.  The more you limit the scope of the Bill&mdash;at least this much can be said&mdash;the more you are reducing the danger that exists. If we could succeed by our efforts in connection with the definition section in reducing the application of this Bill to a large extent, then obviously the dangerous elements in the Bill would be reduced, because we would be confining the operation of the Bill to a smaller section of the community.  I do not suggest that any section of the community should be afflicted in this manner.  That is not our desire.  This Bill has not been introduced by us.  It has been introduced by the Minister for Agriculture</P>
    <P>If we are going to have any reasoned discussion on these things in Parliament, surely it is only on the basis of an exchange of views across the floor of the House?  Surely it can be only on the basis of weighing up the pros and the cons of each amendment as it is moved and discussed?  It cannot be done by endeavouring to make a skit of serious amendments proposed unashamedly with a view to limiting the scope and operation of the Bill.  I could just as easily bulk all the Minister's amendments together and try possibly to ridicule the Bill in regard to what its reading would be then.  For example, at least one of the later amendments I have proposed would involve the deletion of a section of the Bill. Clearly, you cannot look upon that amendment as something to be added to a section when in fact the deletion of the section is involved if the amendment is accepted.</P>
    <P>The main point in connection with this amendment is that its acceptance by the House would enable us to see reasonably clearly to what extent places would be affected by the operation <Col N="316" /> of the Bill.  If this amendment is accepted, the Bill will have application only if the particular place is adapted exclusively for the sale of livestock by auction.  It will not apply otherwise.  If it did not apply, then the other provisions of the Bill would not apply.  That is an important point for Deputies opposite to keep in their minds&mdash;that any place excluded from this definitions section is then going to be freed from the other restrictions in the Bill. It is going to be freed from any requirement to obtain either a licence or an order exempting the licence requirement.</P>
    <P>That could be of considerable importance, as had been pointed out, in connection with country fairs.  There is no doubt that if fairs are held regularly, possibly on a monthly basis, in a particular locality, if that place is adapted in connection with the fair and, having been adapted for the fair, is then satisfactory and suitable for the sale of livestock by auction, that place or the proprietors of that place are in jeopardy under this Bill if they do not obtain a licence or an exemption order.  That is the kind of danger we are trying to avert in arguing out this section and urging the acceptance of this and indeed the other amendments which have been tabled.  I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary has any authority at this stage to indicate his preparedness to accept this amendment.  I hope that, if he is not prepared to accept it, he is at least prepared to report to his Minister that he should have second thoughts about the rejection of an amendment of this sort.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which I suppose could be dealt with in connection with this amendment, or possibly they might be more relevant in connection with other amendments and other sections of this Bill.  But the vital point to bear in mind is the desirability, from the point of view of those who are going to come up against this Bill, of limiting its operation as far as possible. The particular limitation now proposed is, as I said, not as radical an alteration as we would like but at least it would go some distance to make the <Col N="317" /> position clearer and to clip the wings of the definition section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made my case in favour of this amendment and I do not intend to continue speaking on it.  I do not want to be accused by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle of repeating myself and I think I have said all that I wanted to say in direct relation to the amendment.  I rise to challenge the Parliamentary Secretary and, if he does not answer this challenge, I will challenge Deputy Booth who has taken a keen interest in this Bill, to answer two questions.  The expression &ldquo;a place adapted&rdquo; is dependent on a rough specification of what the Minister has in mind as to what a livestock mart should, in fact, look like or what a place adapted for that purpose should look like and it is incumbent on the Parliamentary Secretary on behalf of the Minister, or on some Deputy on that side, to give us a rough specification of what this type of place would look like or what it would require to make it look like that.</P>
      <P>The Minister made another statement which I intended to challenge and to ask him exactly what he meant. He said that all unlicensed mart operations are outside the scope of this definition. What I want somebody over there to tell us is what type of mart operations will be permitted by the Minister without a licence?  The Minister says that all unlicensed mart operations are outside the scope of the definition.  What type of mart operation is he going to permit in future without a licence if he gets this Bill through the House because that could be so limited as to require a licence in every sales transaction that takes place in the country, unless we get a more liberal description of what he means from the Parliamentary Secretary. The other Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;who was here, disappeared when I put him the two questions.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach was very helpful earlier in the day in indicating quite clearly what was meant when we were discussing the other amendment and perhaps he can give us what I am looking for&mdash;a rough specification of what a place adapted for the purposes of a livestock mart would look like and what it would require to adapt it. and he might also tell us what the Minister meant when he said that all unlicensed mart operations are outside the scope of this definition.  I want somebody over there to attempt this because we cannot get very much further with clearing this definition section until we get a clear reply to both these questions and I am quite sure that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach or Deputy Booth would be quite capable of telling us what was in the Minister's mind when he made the statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach intervened in this debate today, I think I was heard to say that a Daniel had come to judgment.  We were then discussing the amendment relative to construction or reconstruction and he went right to the heart of the subject at once by asking: &ldquo;How could you apply these words to a field?&rdquo; Of course, you could not apply them to a field.  That is the very reason why we suggested them.</P>
      <P>I do not see how the Parliamentary Secretary can now have any objection to a proposal to make this definition section read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the business of a livestock mart&rdquo; means providing for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise a place adapted exclusively for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that the section as it stands prohibits not only the sale of livestock by auction but the sale of livestock by auction or otherwise in a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction.  According to the Parliamentary Secretary's <Col N="319" /> expresed anxiety, that means that the definition article covers a field where livestock is sold otherwise than by auction and therefore would be caught by this definition unless the Minister exercises his powers under section 4 expressly to exempt every field in Ireland, but that is a daft way of going about it.  What objection can the Government have to providing that this Bill will operate only on places which are adapted exclusively for the sale of livestock by auction?  Is that not what they want this Bill to operate upon?  Is it not a place where somebody has altered the whole condition in order to adapt it for the sale of livestock?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham is anxious that if this word were inserted, it would not only govern the definition or description of a place but that &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; would operate to prevent people from doing anything else in it.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me that, of course, that is wholly false.  The insertion of the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; in this definition section does not prevent anybody doing anything he likes in the place thereafter but it does ensure that unless it is adapted exclusively for the sale of livestock by auction, there is no need to submit to inspection by inspectors or civic guards or anybody else.</P>
    <P>Is it not reasonable to say that if a man occupies a home or a field or a yard which he does not propose to adapt exclusively for the sale of livestock by auction, he ought to have preserved sacrosanct his right to say to any representative of the Government or to anybody else: &ldquo;Keep out until you are invited in&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I do not suppose the Minister contends that he claims under this Bill or any other Bill the right of entry at his own sweet will on to any man's home or land unless under the code of criminal law, but if, as I think the Parliamentary Secretary must agree, this definition section is passed in its present form, it is open to the officers of the Department of Agriculture <Col N="320" /> escorted by civic guards to enter any man's holding which has been adapted, whether expressly or not, for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach is authorised to make any observations on these amendments at all or not but I would be glad to know if any of the other amendments designed to qualify this part of the definition section on the lines on which this particular amendment travels would be acceptable to the Government.  It is high time, if such be the case, that a Government spokesman should say so.  An important principle is at stake.</P>

      <P>It is important that we should resolve that the scope of this Bill will be settled by the decision of this House and not by a subsequent decision taken by the Minister and inserted here by order.  He says he proposes to limit the application of this Bill by the orders he intends to make. Is it unreasonable to offer him seven options effectively to limit the purpose of this Bill to what is generally under-mart, <Col N="323" /> so that it may be done not by ministerial order but by action of the Oireachtas?  We have a very grave obligation to press the desirability of that course upon the Minister.  We have a grave obligation to bring home, even through the veil of boredom that enshrouds Deputy Booth and Deputy Lemass, that it is the duty of this House to see that Ministers do not seek power or, if they seek it, do not get it to legislate by order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the insertion of the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; limit the Minister's power under any regulation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will explain that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very gladly.  I am much obliged to Deputy Booth for directing my attention to that aspect of the question, because it opens a wide field. The power to make an order under any Act of this House is, fortunately, pretty rigidly interpreted by the courts.  I think the Deputy will find on inquiry from competent authority that if the Minister sought to make an order altering an express decision of this House under a power conferred upon him by this House in a Bill of this kind, the courts would hold the Act was <i>ultra vires</i>, that no Act of Parliament could confer upon the Minister the power to widen the Act himself.</P>
      <P>Does the Deputy imagine that, under his power to make orders under this Bill, the Minister could declare that this Bill applies to every acre of land? I am anxious to know.  The purport of the Bill is to confine it to certain categories of places.  Does the Deputy apprehend that the Minister could completely abolish that restriction, it being an integral part of the Act under which he proposes to make that order?  Of course he could not.  Now, perhaps it is dawning on the Deputy's mind why we want the words put in by the Oireachtas.  It is because if they are put in this Bill by the Oireachtas, then no order of the Minister made under the same Act can operate to take them out.</P>

      <P>How many people have gone swimming, having eaten a full meal, assuring their anxious families that there is no danger and then been caught in a lump of old seaweed and removed to the morgue?  Of course there is danger.  If you leave the section in a state in which the Minister says: &ldquo;I am going to make orders because I recognise the necessity to limit further the application of this definition section&rdquo;, you hand over to the Minister a duty which I suggest is the function of Oireachtas Éireann.  The Deputy asks even if the Oireachtas succeeds in amending this definition in order to restrict it, what is to prevent the Minister making regulations hereafter removing a restriction?  He could not do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

      <P>I understood the Deputy to say that it could be done by order. I said it was for that very reason that we want to put in these amendments, because we want to limit by act of the Oireachtas the scope of the application of the Bill.  And the Deputy said: &ldquo;What is the use of doing that when the Minister by order under the Bill <Col N="325" /> could subsequently undo the limitation you seek to impose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is with Deputy Booth I am concerned.  This is why we are fighting for hours here, trying to get these words inserted by the Oireachtas and not by executive order made by the Minister.  If we get the Oireachtas to insert the necessary words of limitation, it is not within the power of the Minister to take them out without coming back to the Oireachtas.  Suppose we give him this omnibus definition and he then sits down and discusses the matter with the NAG, the IAOS, the NFA, the co-operative marts, ICMSA and the various other agricultural organisations, by his own statement in the House, he is quite likely to come to a conclusion at the end of the discussions, where the wish has become the father to his own thought and he may amend by order, honestly believing that he is meeting the reasonable representations that have been made to him, only to discover the following morning that the NAG, the IAOS, the co-operative marts, the NFA and ICMSA say: &ldquo;That is not what we agreed at all.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am giving the Minister the charity of my belief that he reported truly to the House his previous experience of his discussions with these bodies.  He got up in the House afterwards and having read what these bodies had to say of what they remembered of the discussions, admitted that what he had told the House was incorrect and that perhaps he had allowed himself to be carried away by his enthusiasm for a consensus when he was discussing this matter with these organisations.</P>

      <P>The definition section of the Bill is of course the most important section.  It covers all that is in the Bill.  That is why at this stage we must use every power available to us to ensure that the definition section is as tidy, as accurate and as relevant as it can be made, no more and no less. The purpose of our amendment is to ensure that it is no more.  We sought earlier on to make it less than the Minister wanted to make it.  The word we ask to insert after &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;, for the benefit of Deputy Booth and others who may be in some doubt about it, is the simple word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo;.  I imagine Oxford, Webster, Dinneen and any other dictionary would define the verb &ldquo;exclude&rdquo; as &ldquo;keeping out&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are glad to see some more Members coming in to be enlightened as to what this Bill is all about.  The section to which we address ourselves, about which Members opposite are not aware, is the first section of this most important Bill, An Bille um Margalanna Beostoic, 1967, which will probably become known as the Livestock Marts Act, 1968 and 1969.  We are asking you to direct your attention to this Bill now because what you decide now will be the law of the future and we seek to prevent you doing more than your Minister says he intends to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He wants, we understand for some <Col N="331" /> reason still unknown and yet to be disclosed, to reserve unto himself the right to decide who may and who may not sell livestock, where and when they may do so, and to make it an offence on anybody to do it without his fiat. His fiat means his &ldquo;say so&rdquo;.  We seek to provide, even though this outrageous proposal is being put before us, that it be no more than what the Minister considers to be absolutely necessary. That is why we say if he proposes to consider a livestock mart as a place which is used for the sale of livestock by auction, it should apply only to an edifice, to a building constructed for the purposes of a livestock mart.  It is wrong to say that every farmyard must be licensed, that auction of cattle may not take place anywhere unless in a licensed property.</P>
    <P>The definition section put before us would make it an offence if a farmer sought the assistance of an auctioneer to auction his cattle on his own land. The purposes of Deputy O'Higgins's most reasonable amendment is to provide that such an event would not require the licence of a Minister and would not make it an offence to have such a sale conducted but would make it a perfectly permissible thing to continue operations of that particular kind.</P>
    <P>We seek no more in this amendment than to allow reason to prevail.  It is no answer to our appeal for the acceptance of this amendment to say that what we seek can be provided in a regulation to be made by the Minister, that what we seek may be provided in exemptions which the Bill with certain amendments will give the Minister power to grant.  That is making all these amendments mortal sins and reserving to one individual the right to give exemptions or absolutions in advance to certain people he considers deserving of his benediction in doing exactly the same thing as other people will be doing.  This thing of catching all the fish in the sea by putting in a very fine net and giving somebody power, having caught all the fish, to decide what fish will be dropped back into the sea is extremely wasteful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> That is the kind of thing Professor Parkinson speaks about, this folly of creating offences that they may be exempted, this stupidity of making regulations in order that they need not be enforced in certain circumstances and creating inspectorates to ensure that they are not enforced, that they are recommended for enforcement or non-enforcement, as the case may be. It is to avoid all that folly and to avoid a Parkinsonian institution, and all the rest of it, that we seek to exclude from the provisions of this measure any place which is not generally known and accepted to be a <i>bona fide</i> livestock mart.</P>
    <P>If it is in the competence of the Minister and his advisers to draft regulations and formally to exclude the places we now say should be, and which everybody opposite us believes ought to be, excluded, then we should do it by providing in this Bill the simple word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo;.  To refuse to do so is to continue to fly in the face of all that is reasonable, to continue to declare to the public that the Government will not allow democracy to operate, will not allow legislation by parliament and will not allow the laws of this country to be made by the freely elected representatives of the people.  But the Government want power to have these laws made by persons who have no responsibility to the elected representatives.  It will then become the law of this land to be purchased at additional public expenditure from the Government Publications Sales Office, hidden away so as to trip the unwary, to trip the innocent and to confuse people who have, in this country as in other countries, been carrying on sensible sales of livestock over the years by making <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements in accordance with their own requirements.</P>
    <P>It is well known that in legislation in the past definition clauses have been inserted to define in tight terms, understandable terms, certain occupations and to control those occupations. There are many professions, many industries, many commercial activities, which are caught by a suitable definition section, but I defy any member <Col N="333" /> of the Government to provide any definition section in any Act of Oireachtas Éireann which is so clumsily, loosely and irresponsibly drawn up as the one before us tonight for consideration.</P>
    <P>This is clearly one which was drawn up in haste, without regard to the extent or the damage which will be done by it.  The only answer we have in this particular case is refusal to accept amendments, refusal to speed up the passage of this Bill by accepting these reasonable amendments.</P>
    <P>This is encouraging this spread of disease, the spread of bureaucracy. There is no justification for it and there is no answer to our charge of this irresponsible and unproductive spread of bureaucracy, even though this may be encouraging disease.  We will control it later on by taking certain steps to repair the damage that might be done.  Now is the time to do it and we would again appeal to the Government to exclude what is unnecessary, to shut out what is unnecessary, and to do that by the simple expedient of adopting the reasonable solution in the name of Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, to insert after the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; the simple word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If that is not done, we will continue to oppose this Bill line by line and a guillotine motion which has been threatened on the other side of the House will not deter us from our major objective to amend this Bill at the definition stage, which is the most important stage.  It is, unfortunately, the stage which is all too readily passed over in this House, and in another place, in various Bills that come before us.  It is too casually treated but in this particular instance it is the greatest evil and one which will permit the greatest evil to be done. We can control it by adopting the reasonable amendment proposed by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins.</P>

      <P>At the moment the position is that, with the exception of the intervention of the Minister and, I think, of Deputy Cunningham, no reasons have been advanced by the members of the Government Party as to why this amendment should not be accepted.  There are two Parliamentary Secretaries in occupation of the Government Front Bench. Apparently the position is that neither of them desires to disclose to the House whether or not he agrees with this amendment, whether or not he has any reservations regarding the desirability of the present definition section standing as it is worded at present.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan has quite rightly referred to the importance of this section. It is not possible to deal in any detail at this stage with what follows in the Bill but I think the Parliamentary Secretaries will appreciate the validity of the point made by Deputy Ryan when I point out that in the portion of this section with which we are concerned in this amendment, we are endeavouring to define the business of a livestock mart.  In the next following section, it is provided that no person will be entitled to carry on the business we are now defining, unless that person obtains a licence from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>He cannot carry on that business at any place unless a licence is first obtained from the Minister.  That is the importance of this section; that is why it is important, if we disagree with other provisions in this Bill, we should endeavour to limit this section.  We are endeavouring to <Col N="335" /> do that in this amendment, and we endeavoured to do it in other amendments we proposed.</P>
      <P>I have for some time been trying to get an answer to a specific query: whether it is the intention of the Government in this measure to preclude a man from selling his own livestock, on his own premises, unless he obtains either a licence or an exemption order.  Deputies opposite seem to me to be rather coy about venturing an answer to that question.  On re-examining the definition section of this Bill, it seems to me now to be clear that the sale by a man of livestock on his own premises, by auction, is intended to be covered by this Bill.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretaries appreciate how wide is the definition.  According to the definition, the business of a livestock mart means two things; one of the things it means Is the business of selling livestock by auction.  There the position is simple and clear&mdash;the selling of livestock by auction is the business of a livestock mart.  That applies, irrespective of the place where the sale takes place; it applies whether or not the place is adapted in accordance with the second part of this definition of the sale of livestcck by auction.  The business of selling livestock by auction is brought in as a definition of the business of a livestock mart, and that business cannot be carried on at any place unless a licence is obtained.  The second part of the definition deals with not the actual sale by auction of livestock but with the provision of places for carrying on this particular business and it is provided that the business of a livestock mart means providing for the holding of sales, by auction or otherwise, a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to repeat myself on this amendment but, once more, might I call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the elasticity of the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; used in this particular connection?  Might I call his attention to the fact that any type of adaptation, be it large or small, will be <Col N="336" /> captured under this definition?  In these circumstances, it does seem to be reasonable to try to qualify that word, to try to make the word mean what the House intends it should mean in relation to this measure.</P>
    <P>If the intention is to control and deal with the control of livestock marts, surely what we should be doing in relation to the definition section is trying to get an adequate definition of what constitutes a livestock mart?  We are not doing that.  The Government have chosen to bring in the Bill in its present form, with its present definition, and that imposes on us the obligation of examining their proposals and seeking to amend them, if we think amendments are desirable.</P>
    <P>I would again urge the desirability of limiting the word &ldquo;adapted,&rdquo; of qualifying it, modifying it, by accepting this amendment and inserting, after the word &ldquo;adapted,&rdquo; the word &ldquo;exclusively,&rdquo; so that then the requirement for a licence would be that the place should be adapted exclusively for the sale of livestock by auction.  That would make the second part of the definition at least bear some reasonable relationship to the first part. Remember the first part of the definition of business of a livestock mart is the business of selling livestock by auction; in that part of the definition the sale must be by auction.  If we now provide, in the second part, the insertion of the word &ldquo;exclusively,&rdquo; it will automatically exclude the accidental type of adaptation of which I spoke earlier.  Then the requirement would be that the place must be adapted exclusively for the sale of livestock by auction.  Therefore, while I would not dream of suggesting that the definition would then be perfect&mdash;I do not think it would even be a good definition&mdash;at least it would be an improvement on what is in the Bill at the moment.</P>
    <P>I take the view, rightly or wrongly, that once the House has accepted the principle of the Bill by giving the Bill its Second Reading, whether we like that or not, we must do whatever we can by our contributions here to improve the measure.  I believe that <Col N="337" /> this amendment would constitute an improvement which would be welcomed by the people who are likely to be not only affected but afflicted by this Bill on those grounds, I would again urge that it should be accepted by the Minister.  His Parliamentary Secretary has shown commendable patience in listening to the arguments here.  I hope that the patience he has shown may be taken as an indication that he has been impressed by them and is now reporting accordingly to his Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was introduced, I, and I think every other Member of the House, took it that it was to deal practically exclusively with cattle marts.  It is only when these amendments were brought in that it was brought to light that the Minister will not express himself in such a way as to define what the Bill really means. I think every Member of the House felt this Bill should deal only with actual auctions in marts which take place every week and sometimes twice a week.  Those amendments were brought in and those who moved them deserve great credit for bringing them before the House and having them discussed. As I said, we thought it was intended for an auction mart sale but now the Minister is not going to exclude any other auctions, as far as we know.  He is not going to have the definition confined to actual auction marts, livestock marts as we regard them, but he may take a hand in controlling private sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own county each year farmers in the springtime auction in-calf heifers. They are large farmers and they have quite a number of these in-calf heifers, pure breds, usually Friesians.  They set up a mart for the day in their own yards.  There is a ring but maybe there are no seats.  They employ an auctioneer to auction the heifers for them.  There are several auctioneers in my county, including a Member of the Upper House, Senator Teehan, who organise auction marts each year.  They advertise that there are two or three farmers offering heifers for sale on that particular day and invite farmers in the same district&mdash;Callan, in Senator <Col N="338" /> Teehan's case.  There are several other auctioneers as well as Senator Teehan in the same business.  I would like to know whether these marts are to be brought under the powers of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There have been different words used.  Marts &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo; and the one we are dealing with &ldquo;marts exclusively used for the sale of livestock&rdquo;.  These people have these annual and sometimes bi-annual sales and I would not like to see those people affected.  I would not like to see ordinary farmers having to go to the Minister and beg favours from him to permit them to hold these sales.  I would appeal to the Minister to accept this very reasonable amendment, that is, that this Bill will affect only &ldquo;livestock marts exclusively used for the sale of cattle&rdquo;.  I think it is only a reasonable appeal.  I appeal on behalf of my constituency of Kilkenny so that the people will feel that they are entitled to hold these sales.  It is quite a common sale in our county by the farmers and the auctioneers.  I appeal to the Minister, who should be a reasonable man, to accept it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister, in an intervention and speaking on the amendment under discussion at the time, the one which mentions the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo;, criticised our efforts in respect of that and in respect of all our amendments as lacking effect and said that our efforts, would merely cause imprecision. He chose to use the word &ldquo;imprecision&rdquo; on a few occasions.  This seemed to be the main impact which our efforts made on him and his main objection seemed to be that our amendment would mean imprecisions in the wording of the Bill.  He then proceeded to catalogue the various words which had been used in the amendments: &ldquo;constructed and reconstructed&rdquo;, &ldquo;adapted exclusively&rdquo;, &ldquo;habitually used&rdquo;.  He blocked all these, stuck them in somewhere in the definition and then described it as an impossible piece of draftsmanship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed I agree that if you put an adjective, an adverb, some kind of conjugation altogether after some noun, you will get a pretty incomprehensible sentence but that does not <Col N="339" /> detract from these amendments.  It was impossible for us to deal with this matter in any other comprehensive fashion.  If the Minister is not satisfied with our attempts at defining the application of this Bill, I invite him to help us.  He can do it in a very simple fashion.  He can add a Schedule to the Bill and can write into that Schedule all the forms of trading activities which will be exempt so that they are incorporated in the Bill.  If he wishes, and it might be a purposeful way of doing it, he can write in two Schedules.  I would regard the position to be somewhat like this: Schedule (1) would deal with areas where marts are already present and there he could probably write down a limited amount of activities for exemption.  Then he could write in Schedule (2)&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2b:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 15, after &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment also seeks, as did other amendments, to place some bound, some limit, on the definition section of this Bill.  The House has now decided that we should not qualify the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; used in the definition section in the manner suggested in the other amendments.  The House has just taken the decision that we should not qualify the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;<Col N="343" /> by inserting after it the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting now in this amendment that, after the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; in the definition section, we should insert the words &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo;.  The Minister will probably recall that this was a suggestion made by Deputy Dillon in discussing amendment No. 1 moved some time ago by Deputy Clinton, and a discussion took place in which the Minister participated, as to whether or not the definition of the business of a livestock mart in the Bill now before us could be extended to cover particular cases of a more or less isolated nature, cases where places became adapted by reason of work, possibly of a temporary nature, done to them. Having been adapted, they thereby became suitable for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon offered the suggestion to the Minister that while he did not like the Bill, at least what seemed to be the apparent intention of the Minister could be clarified and crystallised in this section by inserting the words I suggest in the amendment, &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo;, after the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; so that the definition of &ldquo;business of a livestock mart&rdquo; would then read: &ldquo;business of a livestock mart means the business of selling livestock by auction or providing, for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise, at a place adapted and habitually used for the sale of livestock by auction&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If this amendment is accepted it will certainly put beyond doubt the intention of the Legislature in relation to the definition of this particular business.  It will put beyond doubt the fact that we do not intend this measure, if it is enacted by the Legislature, to apply to what has been described here more than once as the farmyard sale, the conducting of a sale by a man in his own farmyard periodically, possibly once a year.  Then, in circumstances where the farmyard attached to the farm or farmhouse is used every now and again for the purpose of conducting <Col N="344" /> a sale by the farmer of his own stock, that place will not come within the definition section.  Clearly it will not, if this amendment is accepted.</P>
    <P>If the amendment is accepted, in order to become involved, to become enmeshed in this definition, it would be necessary that the place adapted should be habitually used for the sale of livestock by auction.  Either the Minister intends what I have said on more than one occasion, I think he intends, that this Bill should apply to livestock marts proper&mdash;either he intends by his definition section to capture all sorts of transactions involving the sale of livestock&mdash;or he does not.  If he does not so intend, now is his opportunity to make that clear.  He can make it clear without embarrassment to himself or to the Government, without jeopardising in any way the controls he proposes to impose.  I urge him to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy O'Higgins for recalling that the substance of this amendment was adumbrated by me during the discussion on the Money Resolution associated with the Bill.  I confess I cannot foresee any legislative proposals coming from a Minister for Agriculture without an instinctive desire on my part to help him to make it better, though it looks incongruous of me to try to help the present Minister.  However, there it is.</P>
      <P>The moment the Bill came before us, I saw the defects of this definition and the manifest fact that its drafting was done under such pressure that the Title brought within the scope of the Bill far more than the Minister needed, or, I believe, intended, to bring within its scope.  There is a variety of devices which could be employed to correct that defect but of them all, the one we now submit is probably the best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In drawing his definition, the Minister had two purposes in mind, according to himself, and I believe it to be true.  First, he wanted to describe what the business of a livestock mart is; but secondly, he wanted, by implication, to provide that if you were running a livestock mart and purporting to sell cattle by auction in the mart, <Col N="345" /> you could not escape from the obligations imposed on you by this Bill merely by saying: &ldquo;I did not sell the cattle by auction; I sold them by hand.&rdquo;  It is to be borne in mind that that is not an impossible contingency. In the Dublin Cattle Market, for instance, there is a situation where auctions occur in one part while sales by hand are proceeding in another part of the same premises at the same time.</P>
    <P>I foresee the possibility that if it were open to a person who wished to avoid the impact of these proposals, he could provide for the holding of sales of livestock by auction in a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction and then claim that though his premises were so adapted, he was not, in fact, selling by auction but by hand.  This is the reason for the insertion of the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;.  What the Minister failed to observe when inserting those precautionary words to prevent people from escaping the liabilities of this Bill by alleging that though they had adapted the premises for auction they were selling by hand was that he has cast the net more widely than he realises and he will have continuous recourse to section 4 for the purpose of exemption.  We think that is wrong.</P>
    <P>I overcame my natural reluctance to help the Minister to improve the Bill, the principles of which I thoroughly disapprove, by pointing out to him that if he puts in after &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo;, he completely, or very nearly completely, removes the objection that has been repeatedly raised here that in his effort to prevent what he would call abuse in an auction mart, he has, in fact, equipped himself with powers he does not want to go into places all over the country and interfere with the normal buying and selling of cattle.  If he does not actually do that, he has created a situation in which the law will be flagrantly and openly broken all over the country because the Minister never intended to enforce it.</P>
    <P>I am waiting to see whether the Minister accepts this amendment. Will he accept this amendment?  If he does, then I think he is entitled to <Col N="346" /> claim that he is bona fide attempting to confine the effect of this Bill to what we in this House and those outside it ordinarily regard as livestock marts: (1) a place equipped to sell cattle by auction and (2) a place habitually used by the proprietor for that purpose.  These are the two inescapable facts upon which the Minister can rest if he wishes to invoke any of the other provisions of the Bill against any particular individual.  All he has to do, if he wishes to initiate a prosecution and the individual concerned raises the defence that the place is not an auction mart at all&mdash;&ldquo;Despite the fact that there are pens there, despite the fact there is a rostrum there and despite the fact there is a ring there, we were not selling cattle by auction&rdquo;&mdash;all the Minister need say is that he has evidence that the place is not only a place provided for the holding of sales of livestock by auction but it is a place habitually used for the sale of livestock by auction.  The moment a man is forced to concede that the place not only appears to be what we ordinarily would regard as an auction mart but that he has habitually used it as an auction mart, then, whether he likes it or not, he will require a licence under this Bill and be subject to all the liabilities imposed by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Note carefully the words in this amendment&mdash;&ldquo;habitually used.&rdquo; It does not say &ldquo;going to be habitually used.&rdquo;  The fact that the premises have been habitually used brings them into this definition section.  If the man concerned has habitually used them, and has got a licence, he cannot escape the responsibilities involved under this Bill without asking the Minister to cancel his licence.  His premises remain a licensed premises for the purpose of this Bill and he cannot raise the defence, if the Minister's officials come in and say: &ldquo;You are operating an auction mart and you have no licence&rdquo;, that he does not intend to do it any more.  The answer is: &ldquo;But you have habitually used it and you cannot sell in this place, because you have habitually used it, without a licence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone here would object, except in so far as there is <Col N="347" /> objection to the principle of the Bill itself, if these words were added and, if they were, the weight of objection to the scope of the definition would be substantially removed.  I wait with interest to hear whether it is the intention of the Minister either to accept these words or to say: &ldquo;These words are fairly reasonable and, if I cannot accept them in the form on the Order Paper today, I undertake to have a look at them and, if necessary, redraft and bring something forward on Report which will meet the point raised and narrow the definition so as to avoid the dangers the Opposition apprehend.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I urge on the Minister that it is not enough to say: &ldquo;Your apprehensions are wholly unfounded?  It is quite possible the Minister honestly believes that, but he is not dealing in this debate, after all, with Deputies who know nothing about this business.  I have been myself a Minister for Agriculture and it will be Deputy Clinton's job to undertake this responsibility in due course, and he is a man who did not come down in yesterday's shower. Deputy Michael O'Higgins is a man not unconversant with the ordinary affairs of the average enterprise in this country.  Our views in this matter are entitled at least to respect equal to that accorded to the views of the Minister. Mark you, in many respects the Minister could claim superior knowledge if we were dealing with day-to-day affairs of the Department of Agriculture on the grounds that he had the information in his hands and the reports of his experts, that he knew the nature of the negotiations proceeding, and had available to him a variety of confidential knowledge which those who are not in the Department cannot have.  But that is not the kind of matter we are dealing with here.  Here we are dealing with the question of definition and there is no special knowledge available to the Minister or, indeed, to his advisers which is superior to that of which we dispose.</P>
    <P>I do not conceal the fact that in some ways I would be disappointed if the Minister accepted this amendment <Col N="348" /> because that would display a degree of reasonableness in him which, I have reason to believe, people no longer discern.  On the other hand, if we can repair what is manifestly a gross error, we will be doing a good day's work.  I remember saying to the members of Macra na Feirme: &ldquo;If you do not agree with what the Minister for Agriculture is doing, attack the Government; do not attack the Minister for Agriculture.  Try to build him up.  Try to make him sensible and worthy to represent agriculture within the Council Chamber of the Government of this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister refuses to accept this amendment, that refusal will, in my view, be a contradiction of his expressed wish to eliminate from the scope of this definition section all occasional or chance sales of livestock. When he last spoke, the Minister set out to ridicule all our amendments to this definition section by incorporating all the amendments in an imaginary Fine Gael definition section.  I explained, of course, in the Minister's absence, that we went to considerable trouble to get him to accept the best possible amendment.  When he refused that, we scaled down our demands so that eventually, if there were any reason at all left in the Minister, he would have to accept some kind of limitation of this definition section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said quite clearly that it was his intention to bring within the scope of this measure and within the scope of this definition section only sales by auction or by hand or, as he said himself, by foot, for that matter.  It might occur at present or in the future in what was well recognised by all of us as a livestock mart that nobody could mistake as being anything else except something that was built and designed to be a livestock mart.  We are helping him to do just that.  If that is his wish, then we are helping him to ensure that his wishes will be carried out.  If his wishes are to be carried out, something like it must be written into the legislation.  If a place adapted and habitually used for the <Col N="349" /> sale of livestock by auction or otherwise is written into the legislation then I think that meets with his wishes and desires.  It did not occur to him, I am sure, at the time that this should be done.  Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Dillon have appealed to the Minister to see reason in this and to see that this is only doing what he himself has said he wants to do if he does not want to catch every sale.</P>
    <P>I know various parts of the country. I want to ask the Minister what he thinks about this in various parts of the country at different times in the year.  In the Dublin district, there are places where, for two or three months, two or three sales of milk cows will take place and they will not take place in a properly-designed livestock mart but in a farmer's yard that is sufficiently equipped to sell perhaps 50, 60 or even 100 cows for two or three months in succession at the time of the year when milk is scarce and when milk is in most demand.  In the Dublin District Sales Area, those months are August, September and October.  After that, no more sales would occur in those places. Now, in parts of the south of Ireland we can do the same thing but the sales would be taking place in perhaps February, March and April in order to coincide with the summer milk production in the creameries in the south of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he wants these occasional sales to come within the scope of this legislation. Does he want these people who are, in fact, providing a valuable service to be deprived of the opportunity of providing that service or does he want to insist that, if the service is to be supplied, they must go to all the trouble of applying for a licence, some sort of qualified licence, some sort of occasional licence in order to cover them for this type of sale?  Is this the type of sale the Minister intends should not require a licence?  If it is, I think the one way to ensure that it is not caught up in this legislation is to include in it the type of amendment that is now offered from these benches by saying that it must be a place that is not only adapted but habitually used for this purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> I take it that the expression &ldquo;habitually used&rdquo; means at least a sale once a month in the 12 months of the year. Sales may occur as they normally will occur, once a week or twice a week for this to be habitual use.  I also take it that sales once a month in each month of the year will be habitual use also. I think a limitation must be put on this. If there are three sales at a convenient time of the year in any part of the country, an effort should be made to avoid the necessity of going to the Minister and looking for a licence and hearing from the Minister all the qualifying things that must be done before it is legal to carry out this business of selling cows for a limited period on a limited number of days at a particular time of the year.  This is a valuable service but it will be eliminated for all time, and the milk producers and the farmers will be deprived of it if the Minister insists on carrying through this definition without any qualification of any kind because in it as it stands, all sales are included.</P>
    <P>It is all right for the Minister to say: &ldquo;They are not; I know they are not,&rdquo; but it is not said here and that is the important thing.  Until the Minister says: &ldquo;This is quite right.  I do not intend to trap these occasional sales or to bring them within the ambit of this legislation but I shall write it in&rdquo; all sales are included.  If he is not prepared to accept the amendment in the form in which we are giving it to him, I think everybody would be quite prepared to accept some similar wording to provide that safeguard which we believe to be necessary to overcome this irritation and this difficulty that will occur unless we make some limitation and definitely decide what wording will in fact ensure that only the livestock mart that is carried on as big business will be involved.  The livestock marts are big business.  It is the Minister's intention that they will be big business and will include and cover quite a big catchment area and that there will not be a proliferation of small marts throughout the country. I hope it is not his intention that these small accommodating sales will be caught within the net of this legislation. <Col N="351" /> I hope that not only will he get up and say that but that he will agree to write into this definition section some suitable form of words to that effect.  We are offering this form of words as a convenient form of words to suit the purpose.  If they do not suit, perhaps the Minister will suggest what he thinks are more suitable words to safeguard the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>My heart goes out to Fine Gael for their efforts to help me with this Bill.  I should love to be able to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, but unfortunately I must say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The reason is that they are habitually used.  We had Deputy Clinton's interpretation of what he felt would be the outside limit in one direction&mdash;once a month.  Deputy Dillon chimes in behind with &ldquo;Let the courts decide&rdquo;.  I think Deputy O'Higgins might say that once a week would be habitual.  Somebody might say, in certain circumstances, that once a year would be habitual.  You see how useless this term is even to the Opposition themselves who will undoubtedly stand up as one man in opposition to me to hold up this Bill but, in their utterances, they have no agreement whatsoever among them as to what it means, and this, of all places, in a definition section.  Surely it is the height of nonsense to talk about something on the interpretation of which they do not agree on among themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Widely different interpretations have come from the few members of the Fine Gael Party who have spoken and I am sure that further variations would be elicited if we heard them all.  If we cannot have from the sponsors of this amendment any concise meaning then to put it into a definition section, is surely absolutely ludicrous.  I do not say that in any spirit of reflecting on the Opposition in this instance.  I become more mellow as the night wears on and I get into much better humour than I might be in all during the day. All I am sorry is that we have not got another four or five hours, up to 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., and I have an idea that then we would make headway.  It is a pity <Col N="352" /> that we are adjourning in the next 20 minutes.  As the matter was presented by the last two speakers, I would very much like to be able to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, but quite candidly, I cannot.  I just cannot say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to this amendment for the reason I have given, that it is an indeterminate term and to put it into the definition section would be wholly contrary to what &ldquo;definition&rdquo; to my mind should and does mean.  To leave the section as it is is far better than to start messing about with it in the manner suggested.</P>
    <P>There is one other observation I want to make in regard to something which seems to be lost sight of, and of course it is difficult not to lose sight of what is intended in this Bill, with the messing around with small, fiddling little amendments which mean nothing except confusion.  The Bill is primarily intended to be of assistance and a help to the farmers.  If this were kept in mind by the Opposition, and all other sorts of motives that have been attributed to the introduction of this Bill removed from the scene, even if the amendments might be poles apart from what I think should be accepted, nevertheless if they could get this into their heads and forget about the allegations in regard to the motives that inspired the Bill, we should really make headway on the Bill.  This is a far better Bill than they give it credit for being and it will do a great deal to help the community which all of us participating in this debate are concerned about, the farming community. This is in their interests.  If we keep that in mind, we will get places and make headway beyond the first section, even before 10.30.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister serious in putting forward those reasons for rejecting this amendment? Is the Minister, who accepts a word such as &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; in the context in which it is used in the definition section, serious about refusing to qualify that by incorporating the words &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo; on the ground that nobody is going to know what &ldquo;habitually used&rdquo; means?  The whole difficulty about this section is that the <Col N="353" /> word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; can be so elastic as to cover practically anything and no one knows precisely what is required to be done in order to adapt a place in the context of this section for the sale of livestock by auction.  The Minister has given his views as to what &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; in this context means.  He may be right or he may be wrong, and that is a matter which possibly will require construing at a later date by the courts, but there can be no doubt as to what is intended by the phrase &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo;.  It means that it has been the habit to use that place for a particular purpose.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the Minister's desire to get from the House a measure with a certain amount of agreement at least with regard to the scope of the Bill.  As I have been at pains to point out, this is the section that settles the scope of the Bill.  The Minister cannot feel very confident in <Col N="354" /> putting forward the kind of case he has put forward for rejecting the amendment. If the Minister has made up his mind that he is not going to consider any amendments to the definition section from these benches, he might be able to shorten discussion by saying that and saying it out bluntly.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is a reasonable case to make that nobody would know what the phrase &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo; means.  It is self-evident and requires no further definition.  The amendment could not harm the section in any way. Put it at its worst, from the point of view from which the Minister put it himself, that there would be difficulty in knowing what the phrase meant&mdash; would it mean once a week, once a month or once a year&mdash;and compare that with the situation that exists if you do not put in the words.  You are in a position where any kind of adaptation can put an ordinary farmer who uses his farmyard for the purposes of a sale in jeopardy of the penalties provided in the Bill.  At least if this modification is made, it will be a guideline, to put it no further, as to the intention of the House and the Minister in settling the framework of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me to be idiotic simply to ask how do you define the words &ldquo;habitually used&rdquo;?  Nobody in this House knows what the true meaning of the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; means.  Is there anyone who does not know the meaning of the word &ldquo;habitual&rdquo;?  If a man goes on a batter once a year, do you call him an habitual drunkard?  If a man is absent from this House for a week because he has a cold, do you call him an habitual absentee?  If a man tells you he has gone to visit a sick friend when in fact he is in the Savoy Cinema, do you call him an habitual liar?  Does not every sane, rational being know the meaning and significance of the word habitual whether you apply it to a virtue, a vice or a practice?  Is there any action of which anyone of us is capable which we cannot segregate in relation to one another by saying: &ldquo;Ah, he only does that once in a while&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ah, that fellow habitually does that&rdquo;?  We are dealing with the daily affairs of our <Col N="355" /> own neighbours.  Deputies are only too prone to forget, in the complexity of dealing with a Bill that we are defining in this section, not the daily activities of an individual which shall make him liable to the criminal law, but what is the business of a livestock mart.  We are defining that because section 2 says a person shall not carry on the business of a livestock mart&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not at section 2 at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what is wrong with this Bill.  The Minister has not realised the effect of his own Bill.  The definition section is not dealing with the actions of anybody; it is defining a category of persons to whom section 2 shall apply.  We make the case all through this debate that the definition section is bringing within the terms of section 2 hundreds of people whom you do not want to bring in under section 2 and an indeterminate, unascertainable category of persons who never ought to be regarded at all as engaging in the business of a livestock mart.</P>
      <P>That, we have submitted, is the case because the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; is capable of so wide a meaning.  How dubious is the meaning of that word has been demonstrated by Deputy Cunningham's intervention, by Deputy Booth's intervention and, most notably, by the intervention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  He was anxious to demonstrate that you could not construct or reconstruct a field.  Of course, I have every sympathy with them.  The word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; is so vague as to create a serious danger of involving a multitude of people in a tangle of litigation in which they do not want to be involved and in which the Department, in fact, ought not to be involved at all.  But, if you put in after the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo;, you instantly contract the whole section to that very limited category of persons who carry on the business of a livestock mart as every Deputy understands those words in their ordinary context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asks: &ldquo;Do you mean <Col N="356" /> once a year, once a month or once a week?&rdquo; Picture a man going into a court and saying: &ldquo;I do not carry on the business of a livestock mart because I hold auctions only once a month&rdquo;. What do you think the court would say to him?  &ldquo;You are crazy.  If that is not habitually using your place for the holding of marts, you are daft.  But if you do not think it is, we will deal with you under the POA.&rdquo;  Certainly, if you are going to allow yourself to get drunk once a month, very soon you will get drunk once a week and later you will be drunk every day.  I do not deny the possibility of a marginal case arising in which a man might say: &ldquo;I hold an auction twice a year in that place for the neighbour's cattle.&rdquo;  I think he is entitled to go into court and argue: &ldquo;In my circumstances, it is fantastic to say that I am conducting the business of a livestock mart. Five or six neighbours of mine, and indeed my father and my grandfather for the last 100 years, have gathered heifers in my yard twice a year and we have a bit of a sale.  Neighbours from around and maybe a couple of dealers interested in this type of heifer come.&rdquo;  Do you want that type of person to be licensed under this Bill?  I do not think any Deputy, including the Minister, wants such a person to be licensed. If the Minister were to prosecute them on the ground that such user of their premises meant they habitually used them for that purpose, he would be laughed out of court.  Is that what we want?  On the other hand, if the Minister is prepared to say that on the first Monday of every month or on every Monday, there is an auction sale held in those premises, the defendant would be laughed out of court if he said holding it once a month or once a week was not habitual user.</P>
    <P>Have we reached the stage where the injection of normal commonsense into the terminology of our legislation is anathema?  That is not an impossible situation.  That is what people describe as the ultimate strangulation of a legislature, never mind Government, by red tape.  Because words are widely comprehensible, they must no longer be used in statute law?  Statutes in order to be good law must be incomprehensible <Col N="357" /> to any normal man?  I suggest that when the Minister gets up and says: &ldquo;Who is to tell what `in habitual use' means?&rdquo; he has become like the most red of red tape Victorian bureaucrats, who says: &ldquo;Unless you can devise a phrase for me to express that which no normal man could hope to understand, it would be intolerable to put such words in an Act of Parliament. The awful thing is to use words in an Act of Parliament that anybody can understand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I admit, of course, there are certain branches of legislation in which certain forms of words have to be used, because those forms of words have had judicial interpretation attached to them in quoted, recorded cases.  But there is no quoted, recorded case which creates the situation that &ldquo;habitually used&rdquo; could create a serious doubt in <Col N="358" /> the mind of any rational man or court of law as to whether a person habitually used his premises in such a way as to justify describing him as being engaged in the business of livestock mart.</P>
