    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if there have been any developments concerning the application of this country to join the European Economic Community; and whether he has been informed by the British Government of any recent developments concerning the application of Britain to join the European Economic Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question, I would refer him to the reply I gave on 8th February to questions on the European Economic Community which indicated the position as of that date.  Since then, there have been visits to the EEC Commission by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Labour, and by officials.  The White Paper on the European Communities will shortly be presented to the House.</P>
      <P>As to the second part of the Deputy's question, the British Government have kept me closely informed on a confidential basis of developments in relation to the tour of the capitals of the Six by the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary.  As this tour has been completed, I expect, as previously arranged, to have a further meeting with Mr. Wilson in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say if the proposed White Paper will indicate the actions it is proposed to take or merely recount the events <Col N="892" /> which have occurred since a similar document was last issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that our application is dependent on whether the British make application to enter or not?  In other words&mdash;may I put it more clearly&mdash;if the British do not make an application to join the Common Market, do we or do we not continue our application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unlikely we would make an application in that event, but we will have to look at the situation, if and when it arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not consider that that is a somewhat likely situation to arise?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the true position not that we are waiting on the outcome of Britain's efforts?  Whatever happens to Britain, we hope the same will happen to us.  If they are accepted, we go in; if they are not, we do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to a statement issued by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries on the 23rd March, 1967, to which I have nothing to add.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach inform us what are the prospects for harmony and a satisfactory settlement of the dispute?  Does the Taoiseach not agree that if he had met those people after December, the whole dispute could have been ended a long time ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer on the basis of any hypothesis, but the prospect of restoring harmony rests entirely with the NFA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt that very much.  Can you prevent the Minister for Agriculture from fomenting strife and class warfare at the present time in this country?  Does the Taoiseach not admit that a settlement depends as much on the Minister for Agriculture as on the NFA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have adequate influence over and harmony with the Minister for Agriculture to ensure he will not encourage any class warfare, but I would appeal to the Deputy not to do exactly what he suggests here he is trying to avoid.  I am suggesting that is just what he is doing.  I want to say further that after our day-long talks with the NFA, the Minister for Agriculture and I put forward certain proposals that I considered perfectly reasonable that might have been accepted as a basis for further negotiations between the NFA and the Government, but they refused to accept them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach and his Minister see the NFA now if they want to see them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Do they want us to perform handsprings or something?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suggest they do.  After all, they are the premier farming organisation.  They have not <Col N="894" /> attended the National Agricultural Council.  You did beforehand have arrangements with them whereby they had a price review before the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not a price review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Did you not agree this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was never a price review as such between the Minister for Agriculture and the NFA. Might I say that, in connection with the Deputy's references to the non-participation by the NFA in the National Agricultural Council, I want to make it quite clear that part of the proposals we put to the NFA was that they might now take part with the other members of the NAC on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis prior to the introduction of the Budget and without any prejudice whatever to their future attitude towards the NAC.  This they refused to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach and his Minister not see them now, before the Budget, and without prejudice, so as to carry out the arrangement made with the previous Minister, which he now denies, to have a price review?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of the concern caused by the recent NIEC Report on Full Employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Industrial Economic Council, in their Report on Full Employment published last month, examined the possibility of achieving full employment by 1980. The Government have welcomed this timely and valuable report.  It is being examined by all Government Departments and, as intended by the Council, will be used by the Government as a long-term frame of reference for successive programmes of economic expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="895" /> The Council hoped that their report, by provoking thought and wider discussion, would bring about a fuller appreciation of what needs to be done to achieve full employment.  To assist in making the important issues involved the concern of the whole community, the Government are arranging to have a popular short version of the Council's report published, free of charge, with as wide a distribution as possible.  This will be published in the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>The numbers on the Live Register at the end of January in 1957 and 1967 were 94,648 and 64,219 respectively.  These figures are not comparable owing to the changes in the content of the Live Register introduced in January, 1966. Claimants to unemployment benefit were not affected by the changes introduced and the numbers in this category for the same dates were 58,285 and 42,137 respectively.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the change in the consumer price index between mid-February, 1966, and mid-February, 1967; and the actual and percentage change of each item included in the consumer price index during the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>The consumer price index to base August, 1947=100 rose from 181 at mid-February, 1966 to 188 at mid-February, 1967 an increase of 3.9 per cent.  With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving (a) the national average retail prices of certain <Col N="897" /> items of food at mid-February, 1966 and mid-February, 1967 and the actual change in each case and (b) the percentage change over the period in the prices of all the items entering into the consumer price index numbers.  In the case of items, other than certain food items, no attempt is made to obtain quotations for an identical quality of the different articles in all areas and, therefore, any average prices computed would not be meaningful.  The correctness of the relative price changes is <Col N="898" /> ensured by the fact that at each source the identical article is priced at successive inquiries.  Price quotations in respect of some items of food are not available from all centres at each enquiry and the figures for the percentage changes in these prices, computed in such a way as to eliminate the effect of differences in coverage, may differ slightly from the percentage calculated from the actual changes.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i> NATIONAL Average Retail Prices of Food items at mid-February, 1966 and mid-February 1967 and the actual change in each case.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that a consignment of shamrock which was being sent to Rhodesia for St. Patrick's Day was impounded by British custom officials at Heathrow Airport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen newspaper reports containing the allegation referred <Col N="905" /> to by the Deputy and have inquired into the matter.  The facts are that for a number of years past Aer Lingus has distributed shamrock to Irish societies and others all over the world for St. Patrick's Day.</P>
      <P>For the third year in succession, Aer Lingus despatched a consignment of shamrock to an Irish association in Southern Rhodesia.  They flew the shamrock to London for onward shipment by another airline but did not advert to the fact that this year under the extended system of sanctions on trade with Rhodesia, an export licence or transhipment licence is required for all goods exported from Britain to Rhodesia.  On 16th March, when this was brought to the attention of Aer Lingus, it was unfortunately too late to acquire the necessary licence.  Aer Lingus therefore arranged for the consignment to be included in their general distribution of shamrock to Irish clubs and other bodies in Great Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use trying to build this up into an important international incident.  There was this change in Britain as far as goods transhipped in Britain or consigned from Britain are concerned.  Aer Lingus did not advert to the fact that there was a different situation in regard to the transhipment of shamrock to Rhodesia until it was too late to get a permit.  If they had adverted to it, I am sure there would have been no difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if, having regard to the number of fatal and other serious accidents caused by faulty electrical fittings and equipment, he will have steps taken to warn the public of the dangers of using unsafe electrical installations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that, despite the substantial increase in the number of electricity consumers and in the <Col N="907" /> number of appliances per consumer, statistics show that from 1951 to 1966 there has been no increase in the number of fatal electrical accidents.  In proportion to the number of consumers, the fatal accident rate in this country compares more than favourably with that in Great Britain.  While reliable statistics of non-fatal electrical accidents are not available there is no evidence that the position differs from that for fatal accidents.  With regard to electrical accidents of the type referred to by the Deputy the position is that they are almost all caused either by extensions to the original installations, of which the Electricity Supply Board have not been notified and which have not been inspected or passed by them, or by appliances, the condition of which has been allowed to deteriorate.</P>
      <P>The Board and their staff are fully aware of the need for constant vigilance in the matter of safety and a Safety Committee investigates the circumstances of all accidents which are brought to their attention.  Safety leaflets are issued and posted to consumers at intervals.  Such leaflets were issued during 1966.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, at the request of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, are considering the preparation of safety standards for domestic electrical appliances including electrical plugs and sockets.  If an order is made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961, prescribing minimum safety standards for electrical appliances, it will be an offence to manufacture, assemble or sell goods of that class unless they comply with the prescribed standards.</P>
      <P>Safety measures in relation to the use of electrical equipment in industry come within the purview of the Factory Inspectorate of the Department of Labour.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that recently in a case which affected a large Dublin suburban <Col N="908" /> area and in which a number of complaints were made concerning the installation of defective electrical apparatus, the ESB, a semi-State body, disclaimed all responsibility for the condition of electrical installations and indicated that their responsibility stopped at the fuse box?  Does he consider that good enough?  Does he not think there should be placed upon the ESB, if there is not, as the ESB claim there is not at the moment, a legal obligation to see that electrical installations are satisfactory throughout a house?  Does he not think that steps should be taken by the Government to place that obligation upon the ESB?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of all the things the Deputy has said, but I would point out that An Foras Forbartha are at present looking into this matter of installations generally, and it is expected that they will make a recommendation shortly in connection with installations of this nature which will have the effect of covering what the Deputy has raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that Dublin taximen are seriously aggrieved by the decision of Aer Rianta to exclude from the airport taxi-rank all taxis save those approved by Aer Rianta; why, having regard to the steps including annual tests already taken by the State to ensure that taxis comply with recognised standards, Aer Rianta has introduced an additional test; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Air Navigation and Transport Acts, 1936 and 1950, the Minister for Transport and Power has power to establish and operate airports including control on the operation of all services therein.  The 1950 Act also provides that Aer Rianta Teoranta act as the Minister's agent for the purpose of the management of Dublin Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a series of complaints last year about the quality of the taxi service at the airport, Aer Rianta are introducing a scheme on lines similar to that operated at Shannon Airport under which permits to operate from <Col N="910" /> the private taxi-rank at the airport are being issued to taxi owners likely to operate an efficient and regular service. The new system is being introduced with the full knowledge of the Carriage Office of the Garda Síochána and in consultation with the taxi owners who regularly use the rank at the airport.</P>
    <P>The use of the taxi-rank is a concession for which a concession fee of £2 per annum is charged.  The remaining £13 per annum paid by the permit holders is not related to the taxi service but to the payment for meals at the airport restaurant.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new system will ensure a better taxi service at the airport in the interest of the travelling public and incidentally in the interest of tourism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it then that the Minister for Transport and Power, whose agent is Aer Rianta, is not satisfied that the test carried out by the Carriage Office in relation to taxis and taximen is adequate?  Would he say what particular test will be applied in the selection of the taximen who are to be permitted to operate from Dublin Airport?</P>

      <P>There is no further test, apart from Aer Rianta being anxious to ensure that the type of taxi or vehicle that is operating and taking passengers from the airport is up to a good standard and is, in fact, a little higher than the standard that normally will pass.  This arose from complaints in connection with service, and Aer Rianta are anxious to have control over any possibility of exploitation of customers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 24 together.</P>
      <P>I have been following very closely the progress of events in Britain since the stranding of the <i>Torrey Canyon</i>, and my Department has maintained contact with the British authorities.  I am advised that the danger of Irish beaches being affected by oil from the tanker is remote.  The nearest Irish beaches are north-west of the oil spillage. The tidal movements in the area of the casualty are predominantly west to east and vice versa.  South-east winds, which might counteract the tidal flow, tend to be short-lived and occur much less frequently in April than in March.  In the unlikely event of the oil reaching our coast in large quantities, the task of preventing or remedying pollution of beaches would not be a matter for a particular agency such as Bord Fáilte, but would call for the employment of all available State and local authority resources.</P>
      <P>With a view to getting all available information about the action necessary in such an eventuality, I arranged for officers of the Departments of Transport and Power, Defence and Local Government to visit the scene and to report back to me.  Inquiries have also been made about the practical measures planned by the public authorities in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.  Because of the unprecedented nature of the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> casualty, there is a general lack of experience as to the most effective and desirable methods of combating the ensuing oil pollution, and it is, therefore, particularly important that all lessons possible should be learned from the course of events in Britain and the thinking of other countries concerned.</P>
      <P>The British Government have asked the Council of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation, known as IMCO, to convene an extraordinary session on this question in the immediate future.  Ireland is a member of the organisation and would, of course, strongly support any practicable proposals which might emerge in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Convention on Oil Pollution was <Col N="915" /> drawn up by IMCO in 1954, and revised in 1962.  These instruments have been accepted by the Government but they do not provide a solution for the present problem.  The Convention aims at reducing the risk of oil pollution by making it an offence for tankers or other vessels to discharge oil or oily waste into the sea within certain prohibited zones.  It provides for the imposition of penalties on masters or owners who deliberately discharge oil, but it does not cover the case of accidental discharges such as the <i>Torrey Canyon</i>, nor does it touch on the problem of how to dispose of the oil once it has got into the water.</P>
    <P>When the Gulf Oil Company's proposal to set up an oil terminal at Whiddy Island in Bantry Bay was first mooted, the question of preventing possible oil pollution in the area was raised by officers of my Department with the company and the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  This matter is still under active consideration and everything possible will be done to ensure the maximum degree of safety from pollution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister for Transport and Power not consider it most essential that all possible steps should be taken, quite apart from the possibility of a disaster like that of the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> occurring off our coast, to ensure that our coast will not suffer from the kind of oil discharges which have been the subject of international complaint over quite a long period?  In view of the fact, as I have indicated in my question, that there will be quite considerable traffic in large tankers in connection with the Whiddy Island project, would the Minister not consider it desirable that some of these tankers should be on the Irish register instead of plying, as most of them do now, under the Liberian flag?  This would have the effect of giving us at least some control in the management and conduct of these ships.  It would also bring revenue to the country in the form of taxation and would provide employment for Irish seamen.</P>

      <P>The <i>Torrey Canyon</i> catastrophe was an act of God and I do not think we should make elaborate <Col N="917" /> plans in the unlikely event of a disaster of this kind occurring again.  In reply to Deputy Barrett, there is no fear of a 200,000-ton tanker going down in the Irish Sea because such a tanker will not be allowed into it.  The question of the danger to Bantry Bay is a far wider issue.

      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary realises that that is a very stupid statement to make, in view of the fact that at night-time the post-office is closed down, that it is closed for a half-day on Saturday and is closed on Sunday and the only people who can use it are the people in the post office?  There is no public telephone within six miles of Lobinstown except that in the post office. Would the Minister not consider putting a public kiosk outside the post office and putting the same phone in the kiosk, as has been done in a <Col N="920" /> number of other places by the Minister's predecessor?</P>

When people in Pearse Brothers' Park go to use them, they find that they are inoperable because they have been damaged by vandals.  In the light of that, and in the light of the fact that this is workingclass area where telephones are needed, and even if it can be proved statistically that the Department will not make a profit on it &mdash; and I know the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is obsessed with the idea of profits&mdash; but that it has still an urgent social purpose, will he have another look at it and provide this service?

We have 1,100 exchanges in the national network and we envisage grouping them into 120 groups.  The Deputy has brought in the Telephone Directory to the House and he can imagine if we have 1,100 exchanges in the front of that Directory similar to the ones he was talking about, how puzzling the Telephone Directory would prove to be.  We are trying to work out 120 exchanges.  As soon as the telephone service becomes fully automatic, it will all be worked through digits without reference to exchange names.</P>

      <P>The staffing of the Central Telegraph Office is under examination at present.  The number of operators on duty in the Phonogram Section is fixed by reference to the traffic normally offering at the particular time and it varies between 24 during exceptionally busy periods and four during quieter hours.  Traffic after 7 p.m. is usually light and on the day mentioned by the Deputy four operators were on duty between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m.  This is adequate to handle the traffic at that time and records show that there was no exceptional pressure on the evening in question.</P>
      <P>Up to 8 p.m. persons dialling &ldquo;39&rdquo; get through within ten seconds if an operator is free; otherwise they get an engaged tone.  On occasions when traffic exceeds the normal level for the time of the day it may be necessary to make several attempts before getting through to the Phonogram Section.  In order to reduce the number of ineffective calls to &ldquo;39&rdquo;, arrangements are being made so that the majority of those who cannot get through immediately will be advised of the busy conditions and will be asked to give their telephone numbers so that they may be called back as soon as an operator is free.</P>

    <Title>Heinz-Erin Ltd. - Statement by Minister for Finance.</Title>
    <Col N="956" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I announced on Monday last, Erin Foods Ltd. are establishing a joint company with the H.J. Heinz Company of Britain to develop and market the products of Erin Foods Ltd. in the United Kingdom.  The joint company will be incorporated in this country, and will be known as Heinz-Erin Ltd.</P>
      <P>Before commenting on this development, I might, perhaps, review briefly the development to date of the food processing project of Erin Foods Ltd. As Deputies are aware, Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta embarked on this project in 1960 in response to the encouragement given to State-sponsored concerns in the First Programme for Economic Expansion to extend their activities to projects related to their main spheres of operation.  The company's intention was to establish, within a reasonable time, a substantial self-supporting food business directed mainly towards export, and so help to expand the income and employment generating capacity of Irish agriculture. The company concentrated on the production of dehydrated foods because it seemed to them that this form of processing offered the best prospects of success.</P>
      <P>In 1962, the Oireachtas approved of the investment of Exchequer moneys in the project, and to date £4 million has been invested by the Exchequer&mdash; £3 million by way of share capital and a further £1 million by way of loan. The total investment in the project has, however, been in the region of £8.5 million; the balance of £4.5 million beyond the Exchequer's investment has been contributed by CSET.  In 1963 Erin Foods Ltd. was set up as a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSET and has concentrated on the marketing side of the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thanks largely to the drive and initiative of Lt.-General Costello, the project has expanded steadily over the past few years and at present gives employment, both in its own and associated plants, to some 1,400 persons.  In 1965-66 wages and salaries paid <Col N="957" /> amounted to over £800,000 while a further £340,000 was paid to growers of vegetables.  Sales in that year totalled £2 million.  In addition to the plants at Carlow, Mallow, Thurles and Tuam owned by CSET and Erin Foods Ltd., vegetable processing plants have been established on a co-operative basis in association with the main venture at Midleton, Skibbereen and Glencolumbkille.</P>
    <P>The difficulties and costs involved in the development of the project have been substantially greater than had been foreseen initially, due in large measure to the intense competition in the British market.  The total losses up to 30th April, 1966, amounted to almost £5 million including approximately £1 million representing research and development expenditure which has been capitalised.  The loss for the year 1966/67 is estimated at £1.3 million on sales of about £2.6 million.</P>
    <P>The Government decided in 1965 that the time was appropriate for a full and objective re-assessment of the position and prospects of the project. Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta and Erin Foods Limited accordingly engaged Arthur D. Little, Inc., international management consultants, to carry out this re-assessment.  The consultants' report was received early in 1966 and was later published.  It put forward a number of alternative courses of action that might be followed. These ranged from discontinuing the food project to an all out attack on the UK market backed by a wider range of products than at present.  This latter alternative would involve a further investment of £15 million and further losses of £5 million before the concern would reach the profit-making stage in 1973.</P>
    <P>In addition to recommending alternative courses of action, the A.D. Little report contained a number of suggestions designed to improve the productive and marketing efficiency of the project.  One of these was that Erin Foods should not be confined to marketing but should extend its responsibilities to all aspects of the food project.  The Government accepted this <Col N="958" /> recommendation and full effect has been given to it.</P>
    <P>As regards the various alternative courses of action suggested by the consultants, the Government took into account the fact that Erin Foods was still in the process of testing its capacity to exploit the UK market and expand its present range of products. It was considered premature, therefore, to come to a firm decision on the alternative which should be adopted and it was decided to defer a decision until the results of the current year became available.  This would also enable the views of the newly reconstituted board on the developing situation to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>One of the possibilities mentioned in the A.D. Little report was a joint venture partnership with a marketing oriented firm already having an established position in the UK.  This was not a new suggestion.  Lt.-General Costello had earlier suggested it as a possibility.  The Government had already approved it in principle as they considered it to be the most feasible and economical way of achieving a speedy advance in export markets. Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta and Erin Foods Ltd. had explored the possibilities of a joint venture on a number of occasions.  On receipt of the A.D. Little report, Erin Foods reviewed these earlier approaches and made a fresh assessment of the possibilities open to it in this field.  They eventually came down in favour of a link with the H.J. Heinz Company which is one of the leading firms in the food industry in the UK with a sales force probably larger than that of any other comparable firm in the UK market.</P>
    <P>It is important to be clear what the Erin Foods/Heinz agreement covers and what it does not cover.  It is not, for example, a merger of the two organisations.  Each company will retain its separate identity.  The essence of the agreement is that a joint company will be formed to promote and develop the sales of Erin products abroad.  Erin Foods will sell its products to this joint company, at a price to be agreed.  Heinz will do the actual <Col N="959" /> selling in the British market.  The joint company will promote and advertise the products sold through it.  In brief, therefore, there will be three functions to be discharged by three separate companies with Erin Foods producing. Heinz-Erin marketing, promoting and advertising, and the H.J. Heinz Company doing the actual selling.  I should emphasise that this position will not be reached overnight.  Initially the joint venture will not cover sales of all Erin products in the British market.  During an interim period, which it is hoped will not last more than a year or so, the joint venture will confine itself to sales in the catering market.  During this period the details of a full-scale attack on the British market will be worked out.  It is intended that after this interim stage the joint company will cover all types of markets in the UK apart from bulk sales which will continue to be serviced direct by Erin Foods.</P>
    <P>An important and indeed essential feature of the arrangement from the Irish viewpoint is that it preserves the identity of Erin Foods in the UK market.  This will be done in two ways. Firstly, all products sold through the joint company will contain an indication that they have been produced by Erin Foods for distribution by Heinz-Erin. Secondly, all catering products and vegetable retail packs will be marketed under the Erin Foods label, though recipe retail products will bear the Heinz label.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What recipe retail products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Made-up dishes. When account is taken of the expected increases in sales of different types of products and in different kinds of markets, it is estimated that up to two-thirds of the products sold through the joint company will bear the Erin label.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint company will be financed equally by Erin Foods and the H.J. Heinz company.  The capital required will be mainly working capital as the joint company will not, of course, be responsible for production.  Profits or losses made by the joint company will <Col N="960" /> also be shared equally by the two partners.  Each partner will have equal representation on the board and there will be an outside chairman to be agreed upon by the parent companies.</P>
    <P>It is the view of Erin Foods, a view with which I fully agree, that a link with the H.J. Heinz company of the type envisaged is a better proposal than any other alternative which is effectively open to them.  While accurate forecasting in this market is difficult, Erin Foods are satisfied that the arrangement will lead to a substantial increase in sales and holds out good prospects of converting present losses into a modest profit after approximately five years of full operation. A joint marketing arrangement with a company of the status and market coverage of the H.J. Heinz company should enable Erin Foods to capture a large part of the growing British market at significantly lower cost than if it tried to go it alone.  While the proposed arrangement cannot fully be identified with any one of the specific alternatives mentioned by A.D. Little, it should lead to increased export sales not appreciably lower than those indicated by any of the alternatives mentioned by the consultants, but at a far lesser cost.</P>
    <P>The increased sales which will be possible under this arangement will be welcomed both by the farmers who will benefit from the greater and more assured market for their products and by the workers for whom employment is provided in the food factories.  The arrangement will also be welcome to the country as a whole as holding out prospects of securing a return on the large national investment involved and of making a welcome contribution to exports.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise, however, that the agreement holds out no automatic promise that all these benefits will be secured.  This is a commercial arrangement between two commercial companies.  Whether or not it will be successful depends on the commercial acumen of the parties concerned &mdash; the English and Irish firms and what I might call their offspring, the joint venture.</P>
    <P>As far as this country is concerned, <Col N="961" /> perhaps the best service we can render the food project at this stage is to recognise the commercial nature of the undertaking and give it a reasonable opportunity to achieve the results we are hoping for.</P>
    <P>It is natural that each party in approaching an arrangement such as this should consider it from the standpoint of its own interests.  I believe that the H.J. Heinz company consider the arrangement to be advantageous from their point of view.  As far as Erin Foods are concerned, I have no hesitation in welcoming and approving the arrangement as being in the best interests of the company and as a definite step forward in the largescale marketing of Irish foodstuffs in the UK.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to commend the directors and officials of Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta and Erin Foods Ltd. for the progressive manner in which they have undertaken these negotiations and brought them to such a successful conclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangement which, as the Minister has mentioned, was mentioned in the Press yesterday, appears to be the best of a number of recommendations which were made in the Arthur D. Little report.  Although I note from the Minister's statement that the arrangement does not conform precisely to any specific recommendation, it would appear from reading it that it conforms most closely to the alternative No. 4, which was suggested there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain matters on which I should like some further information. Initially, when this project was undertaken, there was general recognition that the idea and objective behind it was a sound one in that it would provide a market for farmers which could be exploited and developed by the Sugar Company and the ultimate establishment of the subsidiary Erin Foods.  However, I think sufficient attention was not paid at the time to the problems involved in marketeing <Col N="962" /> and the decision now taken is in line with a precedent which was adopted in the case of the wallboard factory in Athy.  Many years ago, when we were in government, that company had got into difficulties and Bowaters were approached and made an arrangement which has since worked satisfactorily from the point of view of the company concerned.</P>
    <P>On this occasion the marketing arrangement and sales end of it appear to be the responsibility of the Heinz company.  There are, however, certain matters that have evolved as a result of this whole undertaking which certainly highlight the need for a review on a regular basis of the activities of State and semi-State companies.  That review would not be for the purpose of examining or querying or inquiring into day-to-day activities but for the purpose of enabling Deputies and the public to see how public money is being spent.  It is recognised that some of the information which would be of a confidential, commercial nature or which might involve information being given to competitors could not be disclosed generally but at least there would be the recognition by the public that an established committee representing all Parties had available to it facts and figures on which decisions were taken and &mdash; I suppose questions will not arise while concerns are making progress &mdash; in the event of losses, that those elected by the people would have information available to them which enabled a committee of this sort to decide whether the matter should be brought before the Dáil or whether further public discussion should be focussed on it.</P>
    <P>The losses in this case highlight once again the need for that kind of review. It is quite significant that the losses on sales of about £2.6 million amounted to £1.3 million.  I know that this is a matter that gave the Sugar Company and the people involved with it very considerable concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention what the capital of the proposed new company would be.  He mentioned that the capital would be provided on a 50-50 basis &mdash; one-half by H.J. Heinz and <Col N="963" /> one-half by Erin Foods.  I should like to know what the total capital is and what steps will be taken to make future capital available.</P>
    <P>This is hardly the occasion to initiate a full discussion on this matter but at an early date, if not in his comments in reply, the Minister might advert to the choices laid down by Arthur D. Little and referred to at page 43 of the report on the Irish Sugar-Erin Foods project where it is said:</P>
    <P>It is essential to the efficient planning of activities and commitments for the Irish Sugar-Erin Foods project that the Government's position on objectives to be served, financial support and acceptable range of activities, investments and risks be formulated and stated to the boards of Irish Sugar and Erin Foods as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to know from the Minister will the appointment of the directors from Erin Foods be made by Erin Foods to this joint board or be made by the Government as independent appointments and if it is proposed to indicate generally either to the Sugar Company or to the new company what decisions have been taken on foot of the recommendations made in this report and the alternatives laid before the company and before the Government by the consultants.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I will be very brief.  We welcome the steps which have been taken to try to keep this very important industry at least partly under Irish control.  It is definitely a better way of dealing with it than allowing it to pass entirely into the hands of some foreign concern, as so many of them have.  It lends point to a motion discussed in this House some time ago as to whether or not there should be better control over the finances of semi-State and State supported companies and whether or not information in relation to these finances should be available to this <Col N="964" /> House.  It seems that a colossal sum of money has been spent and that more would have been lost but for the fact that something happened.  Great credit is due to the person whose resignation brought this matter to a head.  I refer to Lt.-General M.J. Costello.  I hope the Minister for Finance will ensure, as I am sure he will, that the Irish interest will be protected in this type of merger, which is what I think it is, even though the Minister does not describe it as such.</P>
      <P>That this factory uses the produce of the land is something very important. Again and again in this House I have said that the only industry which has a 100 per cent chance of success is the one based on the produce of the land. Irish agriculture should be able to provide the raw materials for more industries of this kind.  It would be a tragedy if this type of industry had to close down completely.  One thing must be remembered.  This industry cannot be a success unless there is co-operation all round.  There must be full co-operation between the Government, the companies concerned and the producers. We should not be deterred by the fact that we feel we are losing face one way or the other from doing our best to ensure that this industry will receive the fullest co-operation from everybody.  Nobody will think less of the Government if they have to step down on occasion in order to meet the views of the primary producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of money lost has been very high.  Like Deputy Cosgrave, I would be interested to know what amount of money is actually involved in this new organisation.  The Minister should be able to give us that information. I would be also interested to know in what way the directors are to be appointed.  Is there any way of shortening the period during which the industry will not even be breaking even?  I am rather surprised that it will be five years before it can even break even.  Does that mean it will be losing money for the next 4½ years? Surely there should be some other way?  The Government can be assured that every co-operation will be <Col N="965" /> afforded to them to make a success of this.</P>
    <P>This is the one thing that can take the country out of the difficulties in which it is.  We wish the project well and hope that with full co-operation, it will be successful.  We hope that after a short time control will not slip away from the Irish interest and that eventually we will find &ldquo;Erin Foods&rdquo; written in small letters somewhere on the cans and that Heinz will be able to control the entire industry.  I know they are an international concern with enormous distribution possibilities.  For that reason it seems the logical thing to get connected with them.  I think the people who have done this have done a good job.  It is rather a pity that this was not something arranged by the Government, who could say they brought these two organisations together and made a success of the merger.  I would ask the Government to let this House know at once if things go wrong &mdash; I hope they will not &mdash; and not five years afterwards.</P>

We are criticised from time to time for making announcements of this nature outside the House.</P>

      <P>That was inevitable in the circumstances.  There was nothing I could do about that.  This is <Col N="966" /> my first full statement on the project. It is being made here in the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific questions raised by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Tully, concerning the capital of the joint venture, Heinz-Erin Ltd., the capital required will be entirely working capital.  It will be simply the capital required to promote, advertise and market the goods, so that it will not be of a particularly significant nature.  I cannot put it more precisely than that at this stage.  It is certainly nothing we will have to come back to the Dáil about.  Extra working capital for this joint venture will be provided, as I explained, half by Heinz and half by Erin Foods-Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta.  The half to be put up by the Erin Foods-Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta side of the partnership will be available from their existing resources.</P>
      <P>With regard to the directors, the idea is that the Heinz organisation should nominate three directors of theirs and Erin Foods-Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta should nominate three from their side.  Those three directors will be actually directors of the two existing organisations. An outside chairman will be appointed who will be Irish and who will be agreed by the two partners in the venture.</P>
      <P>With regard to the A.D. Little Report and the various alternatives set out therein, I would certainly visualise we would be having a full and frank discussion here in the House on the situation at some stage, but I do not think the time is ripe as yet for such a full-dress debate.  As I have already announced, we are anxious to await some further developments in the organisation before coming down finally and conclusively in favour of any particular recommendation in the A.D. Little report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Tully's question about co-operation, Government control and so on, I want to assure him there is the fullest possible co-operation between all the parties concerned in this venture.  As far as the Government are concerned, we were fully informed at every stage of these negotiations and approved of them at every stage.  In fact, they involved my <Col N="967" /> going to London to sit in on the final discussions.  It can be said therefore that this project is very much a joint co-operative product of the enterprise and initiative of the directors and officials of the two companies, the Irish Sugar Company and Erin Foods Ltd., and of my Department as well.  There is no question of Erin Foods becoming in any way less significant as a result of this merger, this agreement.</P>

      <P>I want to be quite specific that it is not a merger.  It is an agreement to do something in common but the companies will retain their separate identities.  We anticipate that when the operation is fully under way, about 75 per cent of the sales by the Heinz-Erin company will carry the full Erin Foods label and the remainder will carry the intimation that they have been made by Erin Foods for the Heinz-Erin company.  With regard to Deputy Tully's advertence to the fundamental importance of the Erin Food project, I wish to say that the Government fully share that view.  We are determined that this project will succeed and we will spare no effort to ensure that it does.  From the Government's side, it will get all the assistance we can make available to it within the limits of our resources.</P>
      <P>The Heinz company will be doing all the selling in the United Kingdom. To that extent the Erin Foods sales organisation will be considerably reduced in the United Kingdom.</P>

    <Title>Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Bill, 1967 [Seanad]: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill, as Deputies know, has already passed through the Seanad. The purpose of the Bill is to implement the provisions of a number of international conventions dealing with the immunities and privileges of diplomatic and consular personnel and the immunities and privileges of international organisations.</P>
      <P>Ireland, in accordance with the provisions of our Constitution, accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as our rule of conduct in our relations with other States.  We must, therefore, take the necessary steps to implement in our domestic law the same rules of diplomatic law and procedure as are applied in other States.</P>
      <P>Intergovernmental conferences at Vienna in 1961 and 1963 prepared the Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Convention on Consular Relations, to which this Bill seeks to give the force of law.  These important Conferences were convened by Resolutions of the General Assembly of the United Nations and were part of the general movement in recent years towards the progressive codification and development of international law.</P>
      <P>The Conventions reflect the general agreement reached in Vienna as to the appropriate immunities and privileges which are essential for the effective functioning of diplomatic missions and consular offices and they were signed, subject to ratification, on behalf of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> The immunities which we make available to foreign diplomats and consuls in Ireland are the same as our own diplomats and consuls receive in other countries when representing Ireland abroad.  They are generally recognised to be indispensable to enable diplomatic representatives to exercise their functions in the State in which they are accredited.</P>
    <P>The Diplomatic and Consular Conventions stress that the purpose of the immunities which they set out is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions and consular offices.  Article 41 of the Diplomatic Convention and Article 55 of the Consular Convention provide that, without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of persons enjoying those privileges and immunities to respect the law and regulations of the receiving state.</P>
    <P>The First and Second Schedules of the Bill contain the texts of the Vienna Conventions.  These Conventions constitute, in effect, a world code of diplomatic and consular relations.  Deputies will realise that there is great convenience in having available such complete statements or codes of international law with regard to both diplomatic and consular relations.  Where hitherto we had to deal with these questions in the light of international practice as it appeared to us at any particular time, now, when the full texts of these agreements are placed in the Irish statute book, all concerned or interested in any particular matter in this field will know precisely where to find the relevant material.</P>
    <P>Parts III and IV of the Bill are concerned with the United Nations and its Specialised Agencies.  It is desirable that the Government should be in a position to make available, in accordance with its international commitments, to the relevant international organisations and to the persons representing or acting for them in Ireland, the immunities and privileges which they may require in connection with their functions.  Articles 104 and 105 of the Charter of the United Nations, in fact, require that member Governments shall apply these provisions <Col N="970" /> in their domestic law.  As its name indicates, the General Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations refers to the United Nations Organisation itself.  On the other hand, the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialised Agencies of the United Nations refers to the International Labour Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and all the other Specialised Agencies of the United Nations.  The provisions of this Convention are varied slightly in their application to each Specialised Agency by means of an Annex and consequently it is necessary that these Annexes should also be incorporated with the Convention in giving effect to the latter in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The International Court of Justice is also dealt with in Part III of the Bill and the provisions in sections 10 to 15 are taken from a resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations setting out the immunities which the Assembly considered should be made available to the Court, its judges, etc., etc.</P>
    <P>Parts V, VI and VII of the Bill are principally concerned with the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Customs Co-operation Council.  In giving effect to the immunities of the latter two organisations, we have based ourselves upon the General Agreement of the Council of Europe since the provisions of the Agreement and the protocols on immunities and privileges of the other two organisations are substantially the same.  The provisions of the Bill relating to the Council of Europe cover, moreover, the immunities of Irish members of the Consultative Assembly of the Council and their substitutes. The relevant Articles of the General Agreement, set out in the Fifth Schedule, are Articles 13, 14 and 15, as well as Article 3 of the First Protocol to the Agreement, also in the Fifth Schedule.</P>
    <P>Part VIII contains general provisions which are described briefly in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill.  I also introduced <Col N="971" /> an amendment in the Seanad to add an additional section 49 to the Bill so as to put the Government in the same position <i>vis-á-vis</i> persons acting for international organisations as in regard to diplomatic agents under Article 8.2 of the Diplomatic Convention and in regard to consular officers under Article 22.2 of the Consular Convention.</P>
    <P>Briefly, therefore, the purpose of this Bill is to implement by way of legislation our obligations in the field of diplomatic and consular relations and with regard to the international organisations covered by the Bill.  As was indicated in the explanatory memorandum circulated to Deputies, the Bill in most respects confirms the present practice in Ireland concerning these matters.</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil to give its approval to the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised as desirable that the law in relation to diplomatic immunities should be clear and more readily available than it has been up to the present.  Up to now it was necessary, in order to find out what the position was on diplomatic immunities in respect of particular matters, to conduct a good deal of research and inquiries.  Over the years there have not been very many cases in Britain, and so far as we are concerned there have been very few cases; in fact, case law was the only source of determining the extent of diplomatic immunities.  Certain recognised principles operate either through the common law itself or through general acceptance.  However, it has not been a very satisfactory situation, and to the extent that this measure will contain in a single statute the extent and scope of diplomatic immunities, it will undoubtedly be of help to those who are interested in or who may be affected by diplomatic immunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is presumed that the Diplomatic Convention contained in the First Schedule is the document of real significance in the Bill and that section 5 is the important section.  The number <Col N="972" /> of cases in which the other conventions which are dealt with in the Bill will be utilised would probably be very small. It is of interest that it is now over 20 years since the United Nations Convention and the Specialised Agencies Convention, which were adopted, one in 1946 and the other in 1947, are only now being incorporated in legislation.</P>
    <P>In Part VIII of the Bill, power is taken to deal with further international organisations, and while there is no specific reference to the European Economic Community, EFTA or other organisations, I assume that the privileges and immunities which it might be necessary to give in the future in the event of this country becoming a member of the EEC or becoming associated in some way or other with either of them, can be done by order without specific legislation, though in other respects, if we do become a Member of the EEC, it would require legislation.</P>
    <P>Many people may wonder why this legislation is necessary.  Quite recently cases occurred in another country in which diplomats were literally besieged in their embassy.  If international relations are to be conducted on a satisfactory basis, it is essential that the law should be clear and that power be available to deal with extreme situations such as the one which occurred recently, and the diplomatic immunities contained in this Bill are designed for that purpose.</P>
    <P>It is one of the features of international politics in modern times that diplomats are often subjected to attack in the performance of their duties, and while it is outside the scope of our responsibilities here, nevertheless I think it is right that this country, which is so devoted to upholding the generally recognised principles of international law, should ensure beyond doubt that we recognise the inviolability of the immunities traditionally associated with the office and position of diplomats.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it is right that we should look at the safeguards against any possible abuse of their privileges by diplomats.  Indeed emphasis is laid in the Preamble to the Diplomatic Convention, page 13, line 43, on the <Col N="973" /> fact that the immunities are not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions in representing states.  There is this emphasis also in the Preamble to the Consular Convention and in the various provisions of other Conventions, sections 29 and 30 of the United Nations Convention, Third Schedule; sections 22 and 23 of the Specialised Agencies Convention, Fourth Schedule; and article 2, page 75, and article 19, page 79, of the Council of Europe Agreement, Fifth Schedule.</P>
    <P>The waiver of immunities is specifically covered in Article 32 of the Diplomatic Convention.  This is probably a solution to the problems which arise in relation to immunity from the jurisdiction of our courts.  This, of course, is one of these matters to which reference has been made in a number of cases.  Many years ago there was a case decided in Britain in which it was laid down &ldquo;that diplomatic agents are not in virtue of their privileges as such immune from local liability for any wrongful acts.  Diplomatic privilege does not import immunity from local liability but only exemption from legal jurisdiction.&rdquo;  That judgment was subsequently cited with approval in a case in the Court of Appeal in Britain as recently as 1945; the Lord Justice pronounced that &ldquo;it is elementary law that diplomatic immunity is not immunity from legal liability but immunity from suit&rdquo;.  Clearly, this problem does not arise in connection with immunity in criminal matters but, rather, in civil matters.</P>
    <P>There is one particular aspect to which no reference was made and to which I should like to direct the attention of both the Minister and the House.  I refer to the position of cars owned by diplomats or for which diplomats are responsible.  In most cases the owners, or those responsible for the vehicles, insure them, but there is no legal obligation on them to do so. Insurance is a precaution taken by the government or the individual concerned. It might be worth considering whether a legal obligation should be placed on diplomats to insure the car <Col N="974" /> they use here.  There have been one or two cases in which accidents occurred involving cars owned by diplomats and it is important to ensure that no citizen of this country will be without redress.  That aspect might be adverted to and, in fact, the spirit of the Convention suggests that this should be done.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter in connection with the Consular Convention. I should like to know what is the tax position in relation to honorary consuls in this country.  I refer here to Irish citizens who are honorary consuls.  Are they liable to tax here? What precisely is the tax position?  If they are not liable, is that only in respect of functions or assignments undertaken in the discharge of their honorary positions?  Subject to these queries and comments, this measure seems to be in accord with the Conventions in the Bill, which is designed to cover the particular international agencies and organisations concerned as well as including in one statute the law dealing with diplomatic relations and immunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition referred to the prospect of our joining the European Community. He referred, I think, to the correct section which would empower the Government to extend, by order, diplomatic privileges and immunities to the Community.  The relevant portion is Part VIII, section 40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave also referred to the insurance of diplomatic cars and suggested we might make it the law that these cars should be insured.  Even if we did, we would not have the power to enforce the law in the courts. I do not know of any case in which a diplomat here claimed privilege to avoid meeting in a reasonable way a claim made against him as a result of an accident.  It is very necessary, as we know, in these modern days to ensure that people using the roads should be in a position to get compensation if they are injured or their cars are damaged. When we issue diplomatic discs, we have the opportunity of checking if the cars are insured.  If a <Col N="975" /> diplomat did not insure, we would have the right to declare him <i>persona non grata.</i> Even if we did not go that far, we would have the right to declare him <i>persona non grata</i> if he had an accident and did not meet his liabilities.</P>
    <P>The fact is that diplomatic cars are insured.  We insure the cars of our diplomats abroad and I do not know of any diplomat here who has not his car insured.  I do not want to follow Deputy Cosgrave into this legal point. While diplomats cannot be tried in court for offences they may commit, great pressure can be brought to bear upon them to face court proceedings unless that would do damage to their mission.  Any Government would very quickly withdraw or dismiss a diplomat who did not realise that diplomatic immunity was not accorded to him in order that he might abuse it but in order to protect him in carrying out his legitimate functions for his country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst we all welcome the tenor of this Bill generally, there are a few omissions upon which we should comment and there are a few insertions which are quite startling and which also call for comment.  I would have thought, in regard to section 62 in which the Minister seeks power to make regulations providing for the removal of vehicles abandoned on a public road or in a car park, that he would also have sought power to remove abandoned vehicles from a public place.  It is sometimes difficult to differentiate between a public place and a public road and if the Minister would consider it from that point of view, he might come to the conclusion that it would be as well to cover public places as well as public roads and car parks in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the number of tragedies caused by wandering animals &mdash; in my own constituency, a young man was killed by a horse which was the property of an itinerant and another young man had his face kicked in by a horse which was also owned by an itinerant &mdash; I was surprised that the Minister did not take this opportunity to revise the penalties for allowing animals to wander on the road.  They <Col N="977" /> are becoming more and more a menace every day as we have more and more cars on the road.  The Minister might re-appraise the Bill in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is an excellent case to be made for the compulsory insuring of pedal cycles and horse-drawn vehicles.  The Minister in his opening speech did refer to pedal cycles and did indicate that on occasion they could be exceedingly lethal vehicles.  In those circumstances, the Minister might consider whether at this stage it would be wise to make it compulsory to insure these bicycles and horse-drawn vehicles so that people injured or killed by them will not be left without redress.</P>
    <P>Another thing which the Minister might consider is that under existing legislation the only thing for which a motor car owner is liable is the negligence of his servant or agent.  There are many occasions on which the negligence of a passenger in the owner's car causes damage.  A passenger may open the door of the vehicle suddenly and a cyclist or motor cyclist may collide with it and damage may be caused.  At present the legislation does not make anybody other than the passenger liable for such damage and very grave damage can be done in such circumstances. I should like the Minister to consider that particular aspect of road traffic law before this Bill gets the final sanction of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There is another matter, and I do not know exactly how it could be dealt with, but it should be dealt with, that is, that the legislation passed in 1961 created a new offence, not in lieu of but in addition to manslaughter, dangerous driving causing death or grievous bodily harm.  Such cases have to go to the Circuit Court but such is the disposition of the authorities that the result is that the courts are cluttered up with deposition cases.  This is a waste of time and the Minister might look into the matter.</P>
    <P>These are the omissions to which I referred and I have dealt with them rapidly because they might be dealt with in more detail on Committee Stage.  We welcome the main intention of the Bill inasmuch as it is intended <Col N="978" /> to discourage the depredations of the drunken driver in whose defence naturally no voice in this House would be raised but there are other aspects of the Bill which are very distressing and could be very dangerous.  Deputy Fitzpatrick dealt with them already and I want to deal with them because on every occasion on which a Bill comes before the House making unfettered provision for the making of regulations by the Minister, I have always opposed and always will oppose such proposals on principle.  It is true, of course, that legislation of that type is of such detail that it would be difficult for this House to deal with all of it and that is why we have this administrative law.  That is the reason this House surrenders its rights to the Minister and his officials.</P>
    <P>The Minister will make the stock reply and say that regulations made under this Bill will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is no doubt true, but the laying of regulations before both Houses has not the same impact on the minds of Deputies, Senators, or the public, as the actual legislation which is put before the House in a Bill.  For that reason I regret that this Bill makes provision for so many regulations.  Some are startling.</P>
    <P>I hope to deal in detail with the provisions of section 9 on Committee Stage.  Reduced to ordinary everyday language, the provisions of section 9 (2) (b) mean that the Minister may prohibit some citizens from selling specified goods or specified classes of goods, while he may permit other people to sell them.  I cannot understand the intention behind such a proposal.  Goods of a pharmaceutical nature are not referred to in this Bill. Goods such as ordinary equipment for cars are of such a nature that they are fit to be sold either by all citizens or no citizen.  The Minister should explain why he seeks to take power by regulation to prohibit certain citizens from selling certain specified goods or specified classes of goods, while he may permit other citizens to sell them. To say the least of it, that is open to abuse.  In the absence of any good reason being given to the House by the <Col N="979" /> Minister as to why he seeks power to make such a regulation, the House should be very slow to pass this section.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (3) out-does in its daring any effort I have ever seen made by any Department of State in this House to take power to make regulations.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider this matter before he asks the House to pass that subsection which provides:</P>
    <P>Different regulations may be made under this section in respect of different classes of vehicle parts and for different circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have never heard of such a wide proposition being made to this House. I have never before heard it being proposed in this House in such general terms that this House should surrender its rights and, indeed, its duties to any Department of State to make regulations &ldquo;for different circumstances&rdquo;, without any further indication of what those circumstances might be.  I think the House should reject this intrusion on its rights, and insist that the Minister should set out in the Bill the circumstances he has in mind for the making of these regulations.</P>
    <P>The provision of a breathaliser for the purpose of having breath tests is something which, having regard to the experience in other countries, the House will approbate.  I do not think it can be approbated in the manner in which the Minister puts it before us.  It simply says that this is the instrument that is going to be used.  It does not tell us the type of instrument.  It does not tell us about its efficiency or whether it is capable of making mistakes.  This is an instrument which could play an important part in the lives of some of our citizens.  If the Bill passes in the terms in which it is proposed to us, it could have very serious consequences for motorists in general.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to say that is the sort of instrument which is used elsewhere, and that is all about it.  The Minister should tell us more about it.  He should tell us the type of instrument it is.  He should give us some specification and not ask us to give him <i>carte blanche</i><Col N="980" /> to make regulations in respect of this instrument.  I do not think the House should let the Minister do this.  I agree that there must be some sort of breath test but unless the Minister tells us what the experience has been, not only amongst the police forces in other countries but also amongst the motorists in other countries where this breathaliser is used, I do not think we should give him the power he seeks. Incidentally I may mention to the Minister that in the county of Cork there is a tree which bloometh which will defeat the objects of the breathaliser. If you suck some of the leaves of this tree, no breathaliser can find out whether you have an exact amount of alcohol in your blood.</P>
    <P>Similarly we can object to the Minister asking us to give him <i>carte blanche</i> in regard to the procedure which will be followed in respect of the taking of blood and urine tests.  None of us would willingly submit himself to these tests, but if it is necessary for the protection of the citizens that these tests must be submitted to, at least this House should be given the opportunity of having before it in detail the procedure which will be used in the sort of circumstances in which people will have to submit to blood or urine tests.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister should even consider that this is a proper principle upon which to proceed, and say to the House: &ldquo;Look, we are going to take blood and urine tests and we are not going to tell you how we do it.&rdquo;  I do not understand why the Minister cannot tell us.  If this legislation has been on the stocks long enough, and if this sort of legislation has already been implemented in other countries, there is a well tested pattern for taking blood and urine tests, and I do not know why the Minister does not put in green and black what his proposals are in that regard, so that when the Bill becomes an Act, the public will have in one document, readily procurable, the details of their rights and duties as members of the public.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to say they can be found in the regulations. <Col N="981" /> Even for lawyers it is hard to find some regulations which are made by this House.  They can, of course, be found in the bound copies of the Statutory Regulations which are published about five years after they are made. Those volumes are so voluminous that it is quite difficult to find the regulations in question.  I suggest to the Minister that both as a headline to other Departments and as a matter of procedure and principle, he should put into this Bill the exact circumstances and the exact manner in which people will be asked to submit to the very embarrassing tests for which the Bill provides.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the Minister should try to put so many parts of this enactment on the long finger by providing for regulations because, in effect, the making of regulations means that we start all over again in both the legislative and the administrative machinery. I suggest that so far as he can the Minister should avoid making regulations.</P>
    <P>The regulations in the Principal Act of 1961 give the Commissioner of the Garda very sweeping powers in regard to bus routes, bus stops and various matters of that nature.  There is a provision that the Commissioner shall consult with the local authorities before he makes regulations &mdash; but consult only.  Having consulted with a local authority, he can throw all the representations and views of the local authority in the fire and proceed to follow his own sweet will in any way he wishes.  That was in fact the spirit in which the Commissioner approached these regulations.  That was the spirit in which he approached the statutory injunction which was placed upon him to elicit the views of the local authorities. I think it was a very bad thing. I think the Minister will agree with me that it is bad because, when we speak of the Commissioner, we speak of the local sergeant, the local inspector, the local superintendent or the local chief superintendent, whoever happens to be the man who actually looks after the traffic in the area.  I think the only preoccupation of the average garda in that regard is to make the traffic safe and to make it flow <Col N="982" /> just as the preoccupation of the local authority would be to preserve the business amenities and the various things which follow the flow of traffic. I know of grave hardships which have been imposed on industry by reason of the literally unfettered power of the Commissioner to make regulations in regard to matters of that nature.</P>
    <P>There is provision in section 61 of the Bill that the Minister, by order, may pass on to road authorities in their functional areas the functions now carried out by the Commissioner under sections 84, 85, 86, 90, 93, 95 and 96 of the 1961 Act.  Instead of giving to the Minister power to transfer these functions, I suggest that the section should be more explicit and more farreaching and should transfer to the road authorities in their functional areas the powers to make the regulations provided for in these sections.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to section 27 and to the use of the instrument to which I have already referred, that is, the breathaliser.  He said it meant that a garda would not be able to stop individual vehicles at random and require a driver to take the test.  There is nothing in the section to make that plain.  Something should be inserted in the section to indicate to too officious gardaí &mdash; and there are a few &mdash; that they are not given the wide powers by the section that, from my reading, it would appear to give, that is, in relation to the breathaliser the Minister will prescribe by regulation for testing our breaths.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Fitzpatrick said &mdash; I do not intend to traverse the ground he has already traversed &mdash; that refusal to take tests should not be proof but only <i>prima facie</i> proof of an offence.  I press the Minister and I urge the members of the Minister's Party to press the Minister hard in this regard. This Bill cannot properly operate, when it is enacted, unless we have the goodwill of the populace towards it.  I do not think we shall have the goodwill of the populace towards it if we provide too many oppressive sections in the measure.  I think the provision of a section in the measure to make the tests <i>prima facie</i> evidence would be sufficient to deter the would-be drunken <Col N="983" /> motorist from going on the roads and I would press the Minister very hard not to continue with the proposals in the Bill at this stage.</P>
    <P>Another section which appals one is the Minister's proposal to take back power of which he divested himself in the 1961 Act, that is, the power to over-rule the courts in regard to disqualification from driving.  I do not know why the Minister has done it.  In his opening remarks, he gave no good reason why it should be done.  I do not make any specific allegations against the Minister or his predecessors but it is plain to everybody in this House that it is a power which should not be given to a political figure because it is wide open to abuse of every description.</P>
    <P>If a person is disqualified and is dissatisfied with the order of the court to which the disqualification was ancillary &mdash; usually the court which imposes the penalty and orders the disqualification is the District Court &mdash; he has a right to appeal to the Circuit Court.  I do not see why, in these cases, the Minister should say, in effect, irrespective of what the district justice in the lower court might do and irrespective of what the judge on appeal might do: &ldquo;I am going to take power to override the orders of the courts of justice of this country&rdquo;.  It is particularly upsetting in view of the regulations made in this House not so long ago by one of the Minister's colleagues to the effect that people who were friends of his or of the Party would get preference, all other things being equal, and the danger of that is bound to arise in the minds of the public.</P>
    <P>I think it is doing discredit to this House and it is doing discredit to the Minister's office to make a proposal to this House that we should give him back powers of which he divested himself so willingly under the 1961 Act.  If he wishes to take them back, let him give some reasons better than those he gave when introducing this Bill.  Otherwise, I would invite the House to reject the proposals of the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>I might mention that a lot of the damage and the dangers with which <Col N="984" /> this Bill proposes to deal could be prevented by a greater emphasis on publicity along the lines of &ldquo;If you must drive, do not drink&rdquo;.  The minimum of advertising is used.  Space on public hoardings should be used for this purpose.  Newspaper advertising and newspaper publicity generally should be used in this connection.  I see nowhere any official advertisements directed to that end.  There is one advertisement I pass when coming out of my constituency which has kindly been put up by a firm of beer manufacturers and it could refer to this particular matter because it does say: &ldquo;Will you have a harp tonight&rdquo;? That is as far as we have gone in regard to publicity of that type.  I suggest to the Minister that we should use publicity which would indicate to the people that if they are going to drive at dangerous speeds or if they are going to drive when they have too much drink, the very grave possibility is that either they or some of their fellow-citizens will have a harp tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that I am delighted to see this Bill being introduced.  Although I may have some comments on matters of detail to raise on Committee Stage, I have no hesitation in welcoming the Bill in principle.  Before dealing with the Bill itself, I should like to make a few comments on contributions already made in this House by other Deputies. I should like, first, to make some comments on the contribution of Deputy Dillon.  I agree very much with Deputy Tully who, in a later contribution, described Deputy Dillon's contribution as too highly coloured to be taken seriously.  It is a pity Deputy Dillon spoke as he did because, while he had a number of very good points, he did, as Deputy Tully pointed out, overstate the case and thereby ruined it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon stated, as reported at column 207, his profound belief that if we could eliminate drunken driving, we would eliminate 50 per cent of the road accidents in this country.  I think that is no exaggeration.  The statistics are not very helpful to us in this regard because very often an accident happens which proves fatal and no <Col N="985" /> evidence is subsequently given which can establish beyond all shadow of a doubt whether the deceased driver was intoxicated at the time of the accident or not.  Certain doubts may be raised by evidence of his habits in the previous two hours before the accident that there is nothing definite and in all probability, that accident will not be attributed to drunken driving whereas in fact it should be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon did not appear to be happy with the proposal in the Bill to set up a new scientific standard of the alcohol content of the blood in opposition to the old standard of whether the person was or was not capable of exercising proper control over a vehicle.  That is an unreal criticism.  We already have speed limits and all drivers are agreed that a driver can be very dangerous while still complying strictly with the speed limit in operation on the stretch of road on which he is driving.  Speed is not the only factor.  Other factors may come into it, such as position on the road, failure to take proper observation, other traffic, and so on.  Very rightly, we have laid it down that on certain stretches of road you may not exceed 30 miles an hour or 40 miles an hour and in more recent proposals we have some limits of 50 miles an hour also.  If we are going to say, as we have done, that a speed in excess of that specified will be regarded as dangerous, it is perfectly logical for us to go on, in so far as drinking is concerned, to say that we are not concerned with any other test as to a driver's ability to control a vehicle and we will rely exclusively on the alcohol content of the blood.</P>
    <P>This can in certain circumstances be slightly unjust, just as a prosecution for exceeding the speed limit may be unjust.  I have had only one conviction under a speed limit and I am absolutely satisfied that I was not driving dangerously at all.  I was driving at 37 miles an hour on entering a 30 mile an hour limit zone on an absolutely open stretch of road, with no houses or anything else.  I am satisfied that I was not driving dangerously but I am also satisfied that I did technically break the law and I suffered for it.  No great damage <Col N="986" /> was done to me in that regard but I learned my lesson and am a great deal more careful now about entering a speed restricted area at precisely the speed specified on the notice.  Even though it may well be that some drivers could have a higher alcohol content than that specified in this Bill and still be able to control the vehicle, it is in the public interest that we should lay down this standard and make it perfectly clear that if people drink above that level, they will not be tolerated on the public road.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon painted a highly coloured picture of what may happen to elderly respectable ladies, in remarks which he made at column 208.  These ladies to whom he was referring were, in his view, going to be subjected to intolerable indignities and they were also going to be the sort of ladies who would find it quite impossible to give a blood or urine specimen without fainting. That sort of criticism is really harmful.  I only wish that Deputy Dillon had not spoiled his case by going along that line.  To my mind, it is unthinkable that gardaí will stop drivers without having some good reason to suspect that they are not able to control their vehicles properly and an elderly maiden lady driving properly would not be in any danger of being accosted in this way.  If any garda was found to be constantly stopping people, subjecting them to breathaliser tests and subsequently bringing them to the station only to find he had no case to bring against them, I am absolutely certain that he would have his ears pinned back very quickly by his superiors.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully made a very good point when he stated at column 268 that certain Deputies felt that it would be just too bad if these rich old ladies should be put to the indignity of doing certain things which would not be wrong at all if they were to apply to &ldquo;what Deputy Dillon calls a coal heaver from the East Wall&rdquo;.  I think that is very valid criticism by Deputy Tully.  We have got to make it perfectly clear in everything we say that drunken or dangerous driving is a crime against the whole community and it is not a respectable crime either.  It is a dirty <Col N="987" /> rotten crime which is most often committed by people who are bad mannered, impatient and so imbued with the competitive spirit that they are prepared to take almost any risk to show that they can drive faster than anyone else on the road.  Respectable old ladies are not normally in that category.</P>
    <P>It is only right to say that lady drivers generally are the least frequent offenders because ladies do not have the same competitive urge as men have and consequently their accident record is, contrary to public opinion, very much better on a percentage basis than the accident record of men. We men are far too apt to feel insulted if somebody passes us and to swear to ourselves or to those driving with us that we will get that fellow before the next bend or that we will pass him before we get to the next turn.  Sometimes I have heard a man say: &ldquo;I will pass that fellow if it is the last thing I do&rdquo;.  Sometimes it is the last thing he does but he also puts an end to somebody else's life at the same time.</P>
    <P>Let us get it out of our heads that this Bill is something which will cause intolerable hardship to respectable maiden ladies and beautiful girls.  I had a case reported to me only a few days ago by a friend who was driving out of town along the Stillorgan Road. Having passed the TV station at Montrose and the next rather dangerous bend after that, he found himself driving behind a car which was travelling slowly, at approximately 30 miles an hour, although it was a 40 mile an hour area.  He attempted to pass the car.  It immediatelly swung right across him.  He had to fall back.  The car then pulled into the left again and he made a second attempt to pass him and once again the car slewed out across his bows.  At that stage, he very wisely decided he would make no further efforts to pass but just keep his patience and stay behind.</P>
    <P>Another motorist came behind him, passed him, and had precisely the same experience with this slow-moving vehicle going along the dual-carriageway <Col N="988" /> part of the road towards Foster Avenue.  Twice or three times attempts were made to pass this slow-moving vehicle and on each occasion the slow vehicle pulled from the left to the right and very nearly caused an accident.  The second potential overtaker likewise held his patience and awaited developments.</P>
    <P>Shortly after that, the slow-moving car pulled into the left and stopped and the two drivers who had witnessed the standard of driving each pulled in to the left, stopped, had a conference and decided they would investigate the matter further.  They found that the driver was slumped across the wheel.  She was a lady, and a respectable one driving a respectable car, but she was quite clearly incapable of driving.  They roused her and she admitted she had pulled in because she felt she could drive no more.  They asked her what had happened and she admitted, rather sleepily, she had been to a party at the Shelbourne Hotel and had had too much.  They then tried to find out where she was going and she said she had lost herself because she thought she had taken a wrong turning.  After some trouble they found she was trying to reach an address somewhere at the far side of Ballymun.  At that stage she was heading towards Bray.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of thing which is happening time and again.  I was talking to a taximan recently and discussing his hours of work.  He said he was getting more and more work late at night and in the early hours of the morning from people who had discovered their own inability to drive home and who had parked their cars and taken a taxi.  That is a good sign if there were enough people doing it, but I think there are not half enough people doing that.  There are too many people who, out of sheer selfishness or laziness will insist, first, on drinking too much and, secondly, on taking the most incredible risks, both to themselves and other road users, by trying to drive themselves home.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the Bill itself, section 12 makes provision for the inspection and examination of vehicles.  This is <Col N="989" /> something I welcome.  My only criticism is that it does not go nearly far enough.  I know, as a matter of my own business, that the condition of many vehicles on the road today is absolutely scandalous.  I have reported in this House before cases I have known of vehicles being brought to garages with no brakes at all, where the garage owner is unable to restrain the driver from taking the vehicle out.  It is bad enough with a private car, and I have seen them and tested them myself, but I have also seen cases of a heavy commercial vehicle with virtually no braking system in operation.  This is partly due to bad maintenance.  In some cases it is due just to the age of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>Very startling statistics have been produced in Great Britain as a result of the testing system they have there. It is a system which I think is better than ours, but I still think it leaves a lot to be desired.  But over there they have produced a horrifying exhibition of vehicles and parts of vehicles which were spotted when State personnel carried out spot checks of vehicles.  One that comes most readily to mind is a heavy commercial vehicle which had coil springs.  One of the coil springs had broken and this had resulted in the vehicle being rather lopsided. The owner had put the vehicle back on a level keel by inserting a carved wooden piano leg into the end of the coiled spring.  That is what this heavy truck was running on.</P>
    <P>The only thing we can do is to insist that after a vehicle has been on the road for a certain length of time, it shall not be retaxed until it has been brought to a State-controlled testing station for a complete examination of every part of it.  Every part is important &mdash; its electrical equipment, lights, horn, windscreen wipers, steering, transmission, brakes, suspension and springing.  Also there is the condition of the chassis, which may already have been showing signs of strain and be in danger of a complete fracture.  I understand that on the Continent regulations are in force in many countries whereby after a period of two years the vehicle may not be retaxed until it is brought to a testing <Col N="990" /> station for a complete examination. After it has been examined, the State personnel give a list of work which must be carried out and the vehicle may not be driven on the road until that work has been carried out and the vehicle brought back for further inspection.</P>
    <P>In Britain they have a situation whereby certificates of roadworthiness may be given by certain approved garages.  This, to my mind, is very dangerous.  It has already caused trouble.  If you leave it in the hands of a private garage owner, you place him in an intolerable position altogether. When an owner brings a vehicle in and says he wishes to have a certificate of roadworthiness, the garage owner will first have to carry out an inspection of the vehicle and tell the owner what work is required to be done before a certificate can be issued.  If the garage man does his job properly, he will be under suspicion by the owner that he has made work for himself.  There will be certain garage owners who will be tempted to do a cheap job so that they can keep the goodwill of their customers.</P>
    <P>This can only be done by State-controlled testing stations.  I know that this is a very expensive business, but we are dealing with matters of life and death and I do not think we should allow the financial situation to be the final point on which we reach a decision. I can see that under this Bill it will not be possible to go that far but I would at least ask the Minister to keep that matter in mind because it is something we will have to do sooner or later.</P>
    <P>Under Part III of the Bill, I am delighted that the Minister is to take some action as regards controlling the giving of driving instruction for reward. I know there are quite a number of very good driving schools in the city.  I also have found from reports given to me by people who have gone to more than one that the instruction given is not uniform.  I know one person who was told by an instructor that when she stopped at a road junction where there were traffic lights, she must put the gear in neutral and <Col N="991" /> release the handbrake.  She subsequently was unable to carry on with that driving school and went to another instructor who told her that what she had already been told was nonsense, that she should keep the gear in at all times and hold the car on the footbrake.  That is the sort of stupid discrepancy which should not be tolerated.  We should have a standard code of driving practice and that can only be done if the Minister brings in a definite regulation for the control of driving schools.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the question of eyesight is being dealt with.  That is a matter of which individuals themselves are not readily aware.  We always believe we have excellent eyesight but there are many who may have quite good eyesight for straight ahead but who may have a limited lateral vision and may be slow to see traffic coming from right or left.  We have got to regard driving as a professional business and if one is physically incapacitated in any way, one will have to be prohibited from driving.  Bad eyesight is thoroughly dangerous.</P>
    <P>I approve the provision in Part IV with regard to speed limits but I do not think that speed limits are the general answer to our problem.  We have got to make much better provision to make our roads safe at fairly high speeds.  We cannot disregard indefinitely the amount of traffic building up on our roads and we are going to find ourselves locked bumper to bumper if we do not produce a better road system, particularly out of Dublin and several other cities.  I think the idea of overall speed limits for certain periods of the year is worth considering.  It has been tried in other countries with good results.  At periods such as Christmas, Easter and summer holiday periods, there is a lot to be said for a top speed limit on all roads not otherwise under restriction.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the awkward sections of Part V which appear to worry many people very much.  I cannot see any reason why they should.  Breathing into a bag is not going to cause anybody undue embarrassment.  It is an <Col N="992" /> excellent produce because a person may, because of a momentary lack of concentration, appear to be driving dangerously but if, on a breath test being taken, it is discovered that the driver does not appear to have consumed an undue amount of alcohol, it clears the matter up straight away. Rather than bring everyone to a Garda station, I think it wise to have a preliminary breath test so as to give some idea to the garda as to whether there is a <i>prima facie</i> case against the driver. I do not feel that the breath test is to be regarded as final at this stage but if it gives a dangerous reaction and shows the breath to be alcohol laden, then it is right that the person should be brought to the Garda station for further tests.</P>
    <P>It can be embarrassing to some people to have to give a sample of urine on the spot but I do not imagine that anyone would be expected to do that in public.  All the things that have been said about the indignity of having to give a sample of blood is nonsense. I have been a blood donor myself for many years and I have seen men and women giving their blood without any trouble.  I do not see why anyone should try to work himself up into a frenzy or seek to raise constitutional issues on this point.  When we take a car on the road, we are potential murderers and we have to face up to that fact.  If we allow our attention to wander for a moment, we may kill ourselves or quite a number of other people.</P>
    <P>If we go on the road in such a condition that we are not capable of exercising control over a car, we are damnable criminals and should be treated as such.  I have not heard any objections to the method of arrest of persons found breaking into a private house or into a shop.  I have not heard people say that we must be gentle with them, that they may be misguided, that we should not inflict indignity on them. If a person is found in such a situation that it appears that he has been engaging in criminal activities, he has nobody to blame but himself.  Driving a car in a drunken condition is a highly criminal activity and nothing less.  That sort of person has to be put <Col N="993" /> off the road once and for all, if necessary.</P>
    <P>We cannot tolerate the present waste of life and the unnecessary suffering to families.  If there were the same rate of casualty in industry as there is on the road, there would be a scream for increased safety precautions in all our factories.  Somehow we have become so hardened to road casualties that we accept them as part of our ordinary, everyday way of life, on the erroneous assumption that: &ldquo;It can never happen to me&rdquo;.  We fool ourselves on that point.  It could happen to me or to any other Member of this House.  As drivers, we have got to take every precaution we can to see that we will not be the cause of an accident.</P>
    <P>I would be far happier about the general situation of road safety if I felt that this Bill was already an Act and in operation.  It may cause inconvenience but it is an inconvenience that must be borne.  As long as we regard traffic offences as petty misdemeanours, we are going to cloud the issue.  Some traffic offences are petty misdemeanours all right, but many of them are not.  I am one hundred per cent behind the Minister in this proposal. I do hope he will not allow himself to be influenced by these highly-coloured descriptions of unlikely events in Garda stations which will cause embarrassment to eminently respectable people.  Anyone who is found to be driving dangerously has forfeited his right to be called respectable at all.</P>
    <P>There very well may be minor amendments to be made as we go through this measure on Committee Stage, but in principle, I approve of the Bill unreservedly and I hope it will go through as rapidly as possible. There are people who may live a normal life if we pass this Bill, and there are people who will die a premature death if we delay too long in debating it or in putting it into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum to this measure may sound like wishful thinking when it includes among the Bill's main objects the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="994" /> (a)  to ensure a higher standard of roadworthiness of vehicles and their equipment and to improve the effectiveness of enactments protecting public roads from damage;</P>
    <P>(b)  to secure better standards of driving and driving instruction.</P>
    <P>However, I believe the Minister has brought in a very good weapon indeed in order, as Deputy Booth has said, to give people a chance of living.  We face with some complacency the fact that over 300 people a year are killed on the roads, not taking into account the thousands who are maimed.  We are living in a society where each year the number of vehicles increases and where, as we go towards a more affluent society, more people can afford cars.  Therefore our roads will become even more dangerous than they are now unless we take stringent measures to bring some sense of responsibility to many of the road users.</P>
    <P>I do not hold that motorists are always to blame; most people in the country are pedestrians at some time, but taking pedestrians, cyclists and motorists, all road users, together, they make the roads a pretty grim place to try to travel on.  There is just no one solution to this problem.  We can point to some of the continental countries where they have massive road systems and a frightfully high casualty rate on the roads.  One would often wonder why this should be if they have perfect roads and traffic regulations and every other precaution is taken to ensure safety.</P>
    <P>I do not want to sound puritanical but there is a moral question involved. Very few of our people would set out to rob a neighbour or by their carelessness set their neighbour's house on fire, but on the roads it is different. In a 30-mile-an-hour speed limit zone such as College Green, one can see cars and particularly motorcycles travelling around by Trinity College at frightful speeds.  There is no use in blaming the Guards.  They cannot chase everyone who breaks the law. They can catch only the occasional offender and make him pay the penalty so that it will be a deterrent to him and others in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> The proposals in the Bill have been criticised, and will be, but I hope the Minister will stick to the proposals he has outlined, as I feel he will.  This Bill gives an opportunity of taking death off the road to a great extent.  Walking around the city any day of the week one can see vehicles parked and double parked so as to constitute a danger in the streets.  There is an attitude adopted by some motorists that because they are paying road tax, they are entitled to flout the law.  Footpaths are being used for car parking.  Some motorists park on corners and anywhere at all. This may be the fault of the local authority, which does not provide adequate car parking spaces, but even where they are provided, if they are not right outside the place where the motorist wants to do business, meet a friend or do anything else, he will not take the trouble to go to the car park and walk or take a bus to his final destination.</P>
    <P>In the city especially, very stringent measures will have to be taken against motorists and road users in general. There is the problem of the increase in the number of vehicles each year. We can see the time coming when, as motor cars become cheaper, as we are promised, the increase in the number of vehicles will pose an even greater problem for us, so that it may be necessary, apart from issuing a road licence, to put people on a priority list before they can get a car, like waiting for a telephone.  The scarcity in this case is road space and parking places.  Our city was not built to take twentieth century traffic, and we are inhibited by the fact that the local authority has not the money to build super highways and provide all the parking lots we need.</P>
    <P>The question of drunken driving is a very big one, and I support the Minister's proposals in this regard. We will get the usual argument trotted out that what the Minister proposes is an infringement of personal rights. Surely one of the fundamental rights is that a person may walk, cycle or even drive along a road with some degree of safety offered to him.  If this right were recognised by all, we would <Col N="996" /> not have the dreadful toll, year after year, of people killed or maimed through sheer carelessness.  If a person is convicted of driving while drunk, even if he does not injure a fellow citizen, he should be prohibited for life from driving again.</P>
    <P>Our ambition must be to attain the greatest possible margin of safety on our roads.  Every day there are flagrant violation of our road traffic laws.  On building sites, one sees huge trucks pulling out, loaded with debris not properly covered.  Dust blows all over the place and very often obscures the vision of other drivers with the result that these may crash or knock someone down.  We should try to get away from the stupid idea that we are divided into certain classes and that motorists are at liberty to do as they like.  They are not.  Urban motorists in particular have an obligation on them to realise that there are certain disciplines they must practise, remembering that all our citizens have the same fundamental rights.</P>
    <P>With regard to the efficiency of vehicles, I have been told that new cars can be defective.  In one particular car there was a very serious flaw in the steering column.  Luckily the owner discovered it before there was a serious accident.  It is disconcerting to discover that a car can be sold in such a defective condition.  That driver, had he not discovered the defect, might have killed some old person not quick enough to get out of his way or small children going to school.</P>
    <P>Young people can hire cars too easily.  Very often they hire them to go on an outing or to a dance. Naturally they are full of the joys of life.  It is then the tragedies occur.</P>
    <P>The introduction of driving tests must have led to a reduction in the number of accidents and the new proposals here should result in safer roads for all.  The breathaliser test will be resisted, of course, but I believe the number who will have to take the test will be small.  The test is essential to make sure we do everything we can to make people realise the obligations they have when driving cars, riding bicycles, or even walking on the roads. <Col N="997" /> There is a moral obligation on all road users to use the roads with responsibility. When a person is sentenced for breaking traffic laws, thought is always had for his wife and children when he goes to jail.  Imagine the heartbreak of a parent whose child is killed by some careless motorist.  I am always amazed that we have not had more counsel from the churches in regard to this matter.  Why do people turn into maniacs when they get behind the wheels of cars?  The better the road the greater the speed and the bigger the risk they take.</P>
    <P>The roads in our city are as good as those in comparable cities elsewhere, but we will have to improve them considerably. Here, again, it is a question of money.  I hope the Minister for finance will have some big sums for road improvement in this city in his forthcoming Budget.  It is true, as has been said on occasion, that we have no fly-overs.  There are proposals for major roadways leading to and from the city and it is hoped these will help to reduce the accident rate.  At the same time, we must face the fact that in the next three years the number of vehicles on the road will increase tenfold. How will we cope with that situation? At the moment over 300 people a year are killed on our roads.  What will the situation be when the number of vehicles increases?</P>
    <P>I should like to say something now about the careless pedestrian.  At any city crossing one sees pedestrians showing both suicidal and homicidal tendencies rushing across in front of oncoming traffic.  I have a great admiration for bus drivers.  Theirs is a desperate task, trying to keep time schedules without being involved in accidents.  They get very little cooperation from pedestrians.  Where Nelson Pillar used to be, one sees people ignoring the lights installed for their safety, trying to rush across before oncoming traffic.  I do not blame the motorist for all the accidents.  One sees elderly people ignoring the lights.  One sees mothers with young children ignoring the lights.  What is the use trying to train children in road safety?  These mothers rush across with their children and only the expertise of the motorist <Col N="998" /> prevents a veritable holocaust.</P>
    <P>Unless adequate steps are taken we will never reduce the road toll.  In fact, we may even fail to keep it at its present level.  The roadworthiness of vehicles is very important.  Constant checks are essential.  During safety week some garages checked cars free. I think we will eventually come to the stage when the checking of cars will be a public service; a certificate of roadworthiness could be issued.</P>
    <P>With regard to the retreading of tyres, there are some competent firms engaged in that business here.  If tyres are in poor condition and the brakes have to be applied quickly, the wheels will not grip the road and a very serious accident can occur.  In the last year there have been some dreadful accidents. There should be some research into why accidents happen so frequently at certain places to discover whether it is the roads that are at fault or the motorist.  Really we are only making a start in this Bill, a beginning to all we will have to do in future years to make our roads safe.</P>
    <P>I do not think anything in the Bill could be taken as an infringment of personal rights.  It has to be realised that when the motor car was first invented, it was meant to be a benefit to mankind, just as the the aeroplane was, but when people use planes to drop bombs, it is difficult to convince the less intelligent that they are still a help to mankind and if a car is a weapon by which people are killed on the road, it is difficult to convince people that there is not a case for stringently limiting their use.  There would be a great outcry if any government tried to do that but if any government stands by and sees 300 of its citizens killed and hundreds more maimed, it would be failing in its duty if it did not try to deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to congratulate the Minister on the Bill and I hope that it will be enacted quickly with its existing provisions.  At least we can say that we are showing concern for the hundreds who died last year and for the hundreds who will die this year and in the following years unless we take drastic action not only <Col N="999" /> against erring motorists but against erring cyclists and pedestrians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly I misunderstood Deputy Moore's remarks when he was concluding, and I hope I did, because no matter what side of the House we are on, there is some obligation on all Deputies to be particularly careful to ensure that legislation we are enacting does not infringe the ordinary basic human rights of individuals except in the clear category of cases where restrictions or interference with those rights are considered essential in the common good. I take it that Deputy Moore's references to the question of personal integrity and personal rights and to the possibility of interfering with them are intended to be related only to the category of cases where the common good seems to make it incumbent that this interference should take place.</P>
      <P>Discussion of this Bill largely centred around the sections which contain the Government's provisions for dealing with the menace of the drunken driver and it is natural that that should be so.  I imagine that all Deputies will agree that strong measures are needed to deal with this problem but however strong the measures taken, I do not think we can just go overboard on the subject.  There is a problem and it is a menacing problem and a problem the Government for the time being must deal with.  I fully subscribe to that view but I do not at all subscribe to it in the sense of feeling that in order to deal with the menacing problem, which, as I say, is there, we should completely disregard questions of individual human rights.  I am not suggesting that in this measure the Government are completely disregarding human rights but it is proper that the particular sections dealing with this question, dealing with breathaliser tests, with blood tests and urine tests, should be submitted to very careful scrutiny by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view on this question&mdash;in fact, the descriptive phrase &ldquo;slaughter on the roads&rdquo; has become practically a cliché because of common usage&mdash;and I think I am right in this, is that no <Col N="1000" /> matter what laws we pass, no matter what legislation we enact, fundamentally the important thing is that every individual road user, whether motorist, cyclist or pedestrian, must have a sense of personal responsibility for his actions when using the road. Unless we can instil that sense of personal responsibility in road usersa great many of them have it&mdash;unless we can get general recognition of the necessity for this sense of personal responsibility, then no matter what laws we enact, we are not going to get any dramatic reduction in the number of road accidents.</P>
    <P>I hold the view that every person who uses the public roads, whether a pedestrian or the driver of a motor vehicle or a pedal cycle or any other conveyance, has a responsibility to every other user of the road and that it is only by constantly reminding ourselves of the necessity not only for courtesy but care in using the roads, particularly at busy times and on busy roads, that we are going to make any impression on this problem of road accidents.  As I said, I think it right that the House should submit certain sections of the Bill to a very close and careful scrutiny.  Deputy Fitzpatrick and others raised some general matters on this Stage and the proper occasion for the detailed scrutiny I am talking about probably is the Committee State rather than the Second Reading. However, my thoughts are related chiefly to these sections and for that reason I propose to refer to them now.</P>
    <P>One of the main features of this Bill is that it proposes to create a statutory offence if a particular minimum quantity of alcohol in the blood is exceeded in the case of any individual who is driving a motor car or other motor vehicle.  I do not claim to be an authority on this subject but I understand that the allowance being permitted in the Bill is, by standards applied in some other countries, a generous allowance, but I do query the wisdom of making any particular quantity of alcohol in the blood an automatic and absolute statutory offence as appears to be done in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I understand the position, the <Col N="1001" /> Commission which examined the problem of driving under the influence of drink made a clear recommendation that a particular minimum quantity of alcohol in the blood which could be measured should be regarded not as an absolute offence but as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a person's inability to drive because of the consumption of alcohol.  The Minister apparently has not accepted the point of view of the Commission in that regard, and instead of providing that a particular minimum quantity of alcohol in the blood shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of incapacity to drive on account of drink, he has chosen to provide in section 28 for a particular quantity.  He has provided in the Bill that once there are 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood it becomes automatically an offence.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate to some extent the reasoning behind that proposal.  Obviously it makes matters a lot easier for the authorities.  If evidence can be given that a particular level of alcohol in the blood has been exceeded, and that evidence can be given to the court, obviously it is much easier for the authorities and much easier to secure a conviction.  It is simply a question of measurement.  The measurement is there; evidence of that can be given; and a conviction will follow automatically.</P>
    <P>Many people will feel that the Minister should not be faulted for adopting that point of view, and that something stringent and dramatic is necessary to reduce the incidence of accidents occurring by reason of drink.  On the other hand, I think it is true to say that different individuals can react differently so far as alcohol is concerned, and that even though the particular allowance permitted by the Bill may be generous, you cannot say with any certainty that all individuals are drunk &mdash;even drunk in the statutory sense provided in the Bill&mdash;when their alcohol content exceeds what is permitted.</P>
    <P>The main point is that the Commission sat and studied this question very seriously, at some length, and reported their findings to the Government.  They made a particular recommendation <Col N="1002" /> which presumably satisfied the members of the Commission who had considered the matter thoroughly.  Their recommendation was that instead of being an absolute offence, the alcohol level in the blood should simply be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of drunkenness, that is, drunkenness in the sense we are talking about in relation to this Bill. The Minister should make it very clear to the House when he is concluding what his reasons were, and what the Governments reasons were, for rejecting that proposal and deciding to opt for making it an absolute offence.</P>
    <P>With regard to the section dealing with the breathaliser test and the blood and urine tests, several questions also arise.  So far as I can see&mdash;and I think I am correct in this&mdash;refusal to take a breathaliser test again is made an absolute offence under the Bill.  Speaking personally, for the life of me I cannot see any reason other than a guilty reason why a person should refuse to take a breathaliser test.  However, in certain cases there may be perfectly valid reasons.  Personally I cannot think of them, but if there should be valid reasons for refusing, it is a bit dangerous simply by an Act of Parliament to make a person's refusal to take a breathaliser test absolute evidence, consequent on which penalties are going to be imposed.</P>
    <P>Between this stage and Committee Stage, the Minister should consider the possibility of writing in some saving provision in the Bill which would provide&mdash;something on the same lines as he has adopted in relation to the blood test&mdash;that where for special and substantial reasons the court finds a refusal justified, that is a good defence. There should not be any question in those circumstances of an offence being committed.  That is a matter that the Minister should consider.  The penalties provided in section 29 (3) for a person who refuses to take a blood test under that section are extremely heavy.  I am aware of the fact that in the course of the Bill it is provided that while refusal to allow a blood test to be taken falls into the category of an absolute offence, there is a saving provision such as I am talking <Col N="1003" /> about in section 35 which provides:</P>
    <P>(1)  In a prosecution for refusing or failing to permit a designated registered medical practitioner to take a specimen of blood, it shall be a good defence for the defendant-</P>
    <P>(a)  to show that, when required to permit the taking of the specimen, he had not been cautioned in the prescribed terms of the possible effects of his refusal or failure, of</P>
    <P>(b)  to satisfy the court that there was a special and substantial reason for his refusal or failure.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I think some uneasiness has been ceated by the manner in which these particular aspects are dealt with in the Bill.  When the Minister is replying, I hope he will go very fully into the reasons which motivated the Government to opt for these measures and this type of legislation with regard to the breathaliser test and the blood and urine test.</P>
    <P>The only other matter to which I want to refer is one which has also been referred to here already, that is, the provision in this Bill which is designed to restore to the Minister for Justice the power to interfere with the suspension of a driving licence. Possibly there has been some misunderstanding about this.  Some people seem to have read the Bill as giving the Minister for Justice power to interfere with any suspension of a driving licence imposed by the courts, including a case where the suspension is automatic, as for example, in a case of drunken driving.  Of course that is not so, as I understand the Bill.</P>
    <P>In effect, what is happening is that the Government are proposing that the Minister for Justice should have power to restore driving licences in cases where the suspension of the driving licence is a discretionary penalty which has been imposed by the court.  Notwith standing the fact that the proposal in the Bill does not go as far as some people may have thought, nevertheless it does seem to be very undesirable and a rather retrograde step that, within five or six years of that particular <Col N="1004" /> power being taken away from the Minister, the Government should now propose its restoration.</P>
    <P>Again, I can see the arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> in this.  I can see that an argument can be made that a particular case or some cases of a definite miscarriage of justice might occur and this might not be ascertained until the resources of the court had been exhausted and, for that reason, there should be a residual power vested in the Minister for Justice to remedy the miscarriage of justice and to restore the driving licence, but, on balance, I think that that possibility is so slight as not to warrant serious consideration by this House.</P>
    <P>After all, if a licence is suspended by one court, an appeal can lie to the next court and the defendant whose licence has been suspended will have the opportunity of a rehearing.  If he has in any way slipped with regard to the presentation of his evidence in the lower court, he will have a further opportunity in the higher court to remedy the error.  The danger of a miscarriage of justice being perpetrated in a lower court and being furthered in a higher court seems to be very slight. Consequently, on that particular basis, I do not think that this proposal to restore these powers to the Minister can be justified.</P>
    <P>I understand that the real argument in favour of this proposal is as follows. In a certain number of cases where a conviction is made in a lower court and part of the penalty imposed by the court is the suspension of the driving licence, in some cases the district justice refuses to lift that suspension pending an appeal being made to a higher court and a situation can arise that the appeal goes on but the unfortunate defendant is, in the meanwhile, without the authority to drive his car because his licence has been suspended.  Then, when the matter comes to the appeal court, the conviction is reversed.  A situation then arises where a person has, on appeal, been found innocent and been found subject to no penalty whatever but has, in fact, at that time suffered the penalty of the suspension from the time of the <Col N="1005" /> original District Court hearing to the time of the Circuit Court appeal.  I can appreciate that kind of argument.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick of Cavan pointed out very strongly that surely such a situation can be remedied quite simply by providing that, where the suspension of a driving licence has been imposed by the district justice, and where an appeal is taken, the suspension should automatically be lifted pending the hearing of the appeal.  That would completely remove the type of difficulty I have referred to and the type of difficulty which, I understand, is the basis of the Government's recommendation of the restoration of this power to the Minister.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Minister for Justice, I should like to know from the Minister for Local Government whether or not the Minister for Justice or the Department of Justice have urged that this power should be restored.  It seems to me that it is not a move than any Minister for Justice would welcome.  At the moment, the Minister for Justice at least has the protection and the buffer against pressure that he cannot interfere, that only the courts can restore the licence and that he cannot do it.  If this power is restored to him, as the Government now suggest we should do, the Minister for Justice will be open to the full force of pressure on him to restore driving licences.</P>
    <P>When a petition is made to the Minister for Justice, I have no doubt he makes his inquiries from the Garda and through the courts and gets his reports in order to enable him to assess the situation and to come to a decision on it.  However, he will not be in the same position, or in anything like the same position, as the judge or the justice hearing the case, seeing the witnesses, hearing the evidence, able to make up his mind, from seeing and hearing the witnesses and from the evidence given, on an appropriate penalty.  If, in these cases, where a court has discretion to impose what is very often the harshest penalty that can be imposed, the suspension of the driving licence, if a court in that position, able to hear the evidence at first <Col N="1006" /> hand, able to see all the witnesses concerned, able to have the full facts threshed out before the court, and if, in that situation, the court decides to use its discretion and to impose as part of the penalty a suspension of the driving licence, it seems to me that any Minister should be very slow to interfere if he had the power to interfere and it would seem to me that it would be the desire of a Minister not to have the power to interfere and not to be subject to the kind of pressure to which he may be subject if that power is there.</P>
    <P>In any event, in so far as any substantial argument exists on this, it is only on the basis of protecting the person who has had his licence suspended wrongly and who subsequently has his position vindicated on appeal and who, in the meanwhile, between the hearing of the case initially and the hearing of the appeal, has been at the loss of his licence.  That situation can be dealt with amply by the suggestion made by Deputy Fitzpatrick that there should be this automatic lifting of the suspension pending appeal.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge the Minister between now and Committee Stage to give very careful consideration to that suggestion.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of it but I think it is true to say that there is no section of the Bill that has aroused greater misgiving and unease in the minds of the public than this section whereby the Government seek to restore that power to the Minister for Justice.  I appreciate the reasons advanced for it but it does seem to me to be unnecessary and I would ask the Minister to reconsider it very carefully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I fully subscribe to the Bill as presented by the Minister.  There are three main factors in the Bill: the person, the vehicle and the services provided, each of which is of equal importance and should receive the same detailed consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, in connection with the person, we hear a great deal about the rights of the person who is questioned or apprehended because of drunken driving.  I fully subscribe to the section <Col N="1007" /> in the Bill and all the implications of the Bill dealing with this matter.  A motor car is a lethal weapon in the hands of a drunken driver.  Many drunken drivers have no regard for other users of the road.  For that reason the law in respect of them should be applied in full so that people will be able to move about in a reasonable manner with reasonable safety and that this hazard that has cost the lives of so many, recorded and unrecorded, will be removed.  Possibly many of the hit-and-run accidents occur as a result of drunken driving and drivers leave the scene of the accident because of fear of conviction of drunken driving.</P>
    <P>Whatever the consequences and whatever the demands may be, every effort should be made to ensure that persons who are apprehended will be prepared to meet whatever type of test may be applied.  The right of the ordinary citizen who walks along the road and crosses the road or uses a bicycle in a responsible manner has to be considered.  In many parts of the country where there are licensed premises which are open to a late hour which attract various groups, the roads are a hazard at night.  In many cases quite convenient to where I live a responsible parent would not allow his children to be on the road at night because of the traffic there.  In places perhaps removed some distance from a town groups of one type or another, beat groups, are attracted to a particular sector and there is a large accumulation of people who drink until closing time and then rush out along the roads, without regard for other users of the road and probably, in many instances, full up with drink. Whatever tests are required should be rigidly applied.</P>
    <P>The question of the vehicle is of great importance.  At present cars are done up by groups who spring up for the purpose of selling cars and very soon afterwards substantial defects are found, possibly in the steering and the brakes, but by the time the purchaser calls to complain the group has disappeared. A certificate of roadworthiness would be necessary and desirable, <Col N="1008" /> just as aircraft have to have a certificate of airworthiness.  It is essential that in the case of used cars a certificate of roadworthiness should be demanded so that any car that is on the road will be in a reasonable condition and, from the point of view of steering, tyres, lighting and so on, will conform fully with the law.  I hope the Minister will give full consideration to the question of used cars.  Possibly that could be dealt with by licensing the sale of used cars so that only those people who act in a responsible manner and give a reasonable service will be allowed to sell them.  That is a matter that is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of the services provided by local authorities. Many roadways are unsuitable for speeding traffic.  Nevertheless one sees &ldquo;no speed limit&rdquo; signs which indicate to the driver that he can put down his foot.  It is accepted that when one passes a &ldquo;no speed limit&rdquo; sign, one can drive as fast as one likes, irrespective of the condition of the road and that one is within the law. Some fresh thinking must be done on the question of the roads.  Where &ldquo;no speed limit&rdquo; is indicated, the roads should be serviced properly so as to meet the requirements.  In many cases the local authorities have not measured up to their responsibility in this matter. Whether the responsibility rests with the central authority or the local authority, it must be discharged.</P>
    <P>On the question of drugs, drugs are being prescribed and dispensed that have a far more dangerous effect than drink.  In some cases the drugs are prescribed for the prevention of blackouts. I know a driver who has to take drugs every time he gets into a car in order to prevent a blackout.  This is a very serious situation which requires detailed attention.  It is a question of how far one can go.  I understand that in this case the drug prevents the blackout but makes the person drowsy. New thinking will have to be done on the question of drugs taken on prescription or as &ldquo;shots&rdquo; and which are being doled out in some parts of the city from time to time.</P>
    <P>The question of the driving licence is also of great importance.  Prior to <Col N="1009" /> the introduction of the compulsory test, there were queues ranging from one-quarter to one-half mile on many occasions outside the motor tax office when persons were getting driving licences in advance of the period when tests would be compulsory.  I am quite sure that there are statistics to show the large number of driving licences that have been issued to persons who have not yet used them, some of them in no fit condition to drive cars.  These people are now legally empowered to drive a car which is taxed and insured.</P>
    <P>We should look into the case of people with severe physical defects who have obtained driving licences but who are not using them and are keeping them for a time when they may have a car. I understand it was mainly people with defects who applied for licences before the test was compulsory, people who felt they would never pass a driving test but who obtained permission to drive.  They are as dangerous as the person who drives under the influence of drugs or drink.  Unless the driving licence already issued is for a disabled person's vehicle, some checks should be made from time to time to ensure that these people are physically able to drive.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of tyres and other factors.  I fully subscribe to the provisions of the Bill, particularly in relation to tests to ensure that a person is fit to drive.  I feel it will have an effect on those people who drive under the influence without regard for anyone else, whose main concern is to get home as quickly as they can after a heavy night's drinking so as to ensure they are not long enough on the road to be caught.  I hope this Bill will be the answer to the problem. The rights of drivers and individual road users are important.  We should not make it easy for one person and leave the other person to the hazards of the road.  We should make it as difficult as possible for people who drive under the influence of drink and drugs, particularly those who drive away after an accident.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure every aspect of this Bill has been covered by the <Col N="1010" /> legal gentlemen on both sides of the House, who will probably make a large part of their salaries from debating the various sections in the courts, I want to make a few general remarks from the point of view of the man in the street.  The Minister is to be complimented on introducing this Bill.  We all know there is a necessity to introduce a measure to attempt to prevent the appalling casualties caused in various ways on the roads of Ireland today.</P>
      <P>While there may be arguments as to whether or not the amount of alcohol consumed in a certain length of time will register on the apparatus called the breathaliser in such a manner as to make a man guilty or whether the fact of a man walking straight out of his house after a glass of brandy will register in a greater fashion than if he waited for half an hour and then went out are questions which I am not competent to answer and questions which, it unfortunately appears, nobody is competent to answer.  The man in the street is asking: &ldquo;Is this apparatus foolproof?&rdquo; If it is going to result in a man committing an offence by refusing to take this breathaliser test, it is necessary that this apparatus should be foolproof and above suspicion.  I am sure those factors have already been discussed by many speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other factors besides drunken driving that possibly have not been emphasised as much as they should.  Drunken driving appears to be the major offence, the one that carries the greater ignominy in this country. Unfortunately, we have not statistics to tell us whether drunks are mainly responsible for the accidents that occur on our highways.  We know that district justices impose various penalties for various offences under the Road Traffic Act.  One man decides that the fellow with bald tyres is the one who should be put off the road.  A guard finds a stationary car with bald tyres and the owner is heavily fined.  Some of the guards in the district love to have a crop of bald tyres for this man when he comes down.  He feels he is doing an excellent job by cutting out every <Col N="1011" /> fellow on the road with bald tyres.  It has never been statistically proved that any certain percentage of accidents is caused by bald tyres.  Until we can arrive at the stage where we have statistical information about every accident, whether it is caused by drunken driving, defects of eyesight or reflexes or other physical defects or whether it is caused by bald tyres or bad brakes &mdash; until we arrive at that stage nobody will be able to say with confidence that drunken driving is the worst type of offence or that accidents were caused purely because a person had consumed a certain amount of alcohol.  I know that the Bill, when tested over a period of years, will give certain results.  There is, of course, always the possibility that any Act can be amended if certain sections do not achieve their purposes.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Dowling said there should be some test of cars sold to the public.  Nobody should be allowed to sell a car with defective brakes, dangerous tyres or other mechanical defects.  The Minister might examine this and see that some standards are laid down to prevent the sale of secondhand cars which are not roadworthy and which may be a danger to other road users as well as the people who drive in them.</P>
    <P>Another matter which should be tackled on a national basis is the question of roadsigns and roadlining.  By road signs, I mean those that tell about hazards on the roads.  I am not talking about directional signs at the moment.  In some counties you find that wherever there is a hazard, whether it is a narrow bridge or a greasy stretch of road, they are very well covered, but in other counties they are not so well covered.  Some standard should be prescribed so that where hazards exist, there will be some competent authority to decide on the type of sign, the distance it should be from the hazard and also the colour and type of paint to be used.  That is something we can do inside our own country.  I know the international signs here and in Europe are good in their own way, but there are hazards they cannot deal with, such as hazards <Col N="1012" /> caused by work in progress on a road or where oil is spilled on a road as a result of some accident.  Where you have very twisty roads you cannot put up the ordinary type of sign.  Such sign cannot be seen by the motorist at night because it must be above the line of light as well as other factors.</P>
    <P>A circular should be issued to county councils explaining the difficulties and telling them that the Minister has adopted certain standards and that he expects them to keep to these standards.  The centre lining of roads is being neglected and the Minister should compel every county council to line its roads wherever there are bends, corners or any hazards that lining would help to eliminate.  It is long past time that these things were done.</P>
    <P>I suspect that if we had statistics in respect of the causes of accidents, we would find that a great many people who are driving suffer from bad eyesight.  This is dangerous particularly at night where you have the glare of lights and boorish individuals who insist on going on, first, after dimming their lights and then switching on full lights.  Regulations with regard to lights on cars should be drawn up and strictly enforced.  These should have regard to the type of light, the manner in which it is mounted on the car and also to dimming which is very important.  There should also be some penalty for people who refuse to dim.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is attempting to do his best to ensure that this legislation will be used for the safety of drivers and also for the safety of all users of the road and the public at large.  I do not make any excuse for the drunken driver &mdash; there is no excuse that can be made &mdash; but I think that until we have statistical evidence as to the cause of accidents, so that we can pinpoint the reason for them, we will never tackle this problem in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>Some speakers in this debate mentioned the delay in driving tests.  There is considerable delay which should not be allowed to continue any longer. Today a motor car is a necessity for many workers.  It is no longer a status <Col N="1013" /> symbol and it is wrong that a person, when he buys a car to take him to his work, should find that it may be a year before he can get a second test. It seems in practice that a person, aspiring to drive has to stand at least three tests.  In order to avoid this, many additional inspectors should be employed to get over the backlog of people waiting impatiently to be told about the day when they may enter the ratrace on the roads of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not have anything more to say on this matter except to appeal to the Minister to do the thing that can easily be done with the county councils, to see that the road signs are properly located, that the lines on the roads are properly put down and I would also appeal to the Minister to be charitable to all offenders but also to ensure that no killer will be allowed to continue to drive on our roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel obliged to speak briefly on some matters in this Bill which have caused some concern in my constituency.  The Bill deals mainly with proposals to meet the problem of the drunken driver.  Like Deputy Lyons, I will accept the Bill in good faith and reserve my judgement until I see it in operation for a year.  It is not easy for the ordinary layman to understand the working of the breathaliser test and so we will wait to see how it does work, but I would appeal to the Minister to keep the matter under close surveillance for the next 12 months to see how it will affect the ordinary rights of the individual which we always wish to protect.  We are now interfering with these rights only in the interests of the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter which has puzzled me is that of speed limits.  With the passage of time, more and more legislation will be introduced in efforts to stop the accidents which are causing so much death and sorrow in our country.  The number of statutes and regulations with this purpose in mind is growing and will continue to grow. When speed limits were first introduced, they were welcomed and it was recognised at that time that they would have to be reviewed from time to time but it is strange that it should <Col N="1014" /> have taken two years to make certain changes in the speed limits in Galway. The last time the signs were moved was in June, 1965.</P>
    <P>Part of the anxiety which has caused me to speak here today has been stilled by the intervention of the Minister for Local Government who, this morning, told me that he is going to use his power to have the speed limit signs which caused so much anxiety in Galway resited.  These speed signs led to another serious accident recently resulting in the death of a young man and I am grateful to the Minister for acting so quickly.  I understand the position will be rectified on 14th April and I hope the Minister will see that this will be done.  It is strange that the Department, which has shown its interest and goodwill in helping to keep road accidents to a minimum, should take two years to make these changes, despite the constant agitation for them. It does not seem in character that the Department should have taken so long to deal with the matter and I trust that in future they will be quicker off the mark.  I wish to thank the Minister for the action he has taken in this very serious matter which affects so many of my constituents.</P>
    <P>Another matter in which I am interested is the use of safety belts.  In Britain they have introduced a law which makes it compulsory on everybody to fit safety belts but I can see that it would be difficult to make it compulsory to use these belts.  At least it goes part of the way to ensuring that each car will be fitted with this very essential mechanism.  It strikes me as rather strange in regard to our State cars that the Minister has a safety belt but that the driver is not provided with one.  The Minister for Local Government might look into this and give equal protection to the drivers of our State cars who have such an important function to carry out, sometimes in the most trying conditions, driving long journeys and having very little sleep on some occasions.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that possibly the next legislation he might introduce to minimise death on the roads and to make our roads safer is to <Col N="1015" /> make compulsory the installation of safety belts in motor cars.  I am certain the House would give the introduction of such legislation every support.</P>
    <P>I should also like to suggest the introduction of a national speed limit of 60 miles an hour after lighting-up time.  Deputy Lyons referred to statistics of accidents, of which there are not very many; nevertheless, it can be easily proved that the vast majority of serious accidents take place after lighting-up time.  Although I would be slow to recommend a national speed limit, as has been mentioned by some, I certainly would not hesitate to recommend that it be operated after lighting-up time, which is the time when there is most danger on the roads, when headlamps have to be used and when there are headlamps facing the motorist, and some drivers are careless about dimming their lights which has been the cause of many accidents.</P>
    <P>Another factor which I feel contributes to the terrible slaughter on the roads is something which seems to be introduced in this country more and more, that is, the laying of this carpet roadway known as tarmacadam. Galway County Council are using it extensively.  The main road from Galway to Dublin is getting a major repair at the moment and this is the type of surface that is being put down. This surface is all right after being laid and possibly for some years, but then it becomes a terribly even, fine surface which if it collects any small amount of water, as any experienced driver will tell you, will very easily send a car spinning within its own distance, because there is no grip on the surface once it gets wet.  I do not agree with the use of this type of road. I prefer the old road with the chips which provide a greater hold on the road for cars.  This is a matter to which a lot of attention has not been paid.  We have engineers to go into these problems and I would request that special attention be paid to the hazard this tarmacadam carpet, as it is called, becomes after three or four years of use.</P>
    <P>On the question of remould and <Col N="1016" /> retread tyres, I understand that in the United States the sale of such tyres is banned.  I shall never again use them on my car because from my experience of them, I know they are not safe; they are liable to blow up without any warning because their life has been well spent. It is no saving to the motorist to use remould or retread tyres.  There should be some investigation into this whole question in order to see whether this might contribute to some of our accidents, and especially to find out why it was found necessary in the USA to ban the sale of these articles.  Maybe it would be a good thing if we introduced the same type of legislation in this country.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the driving test was welcomed by the country generally, but with the passage of time one sees some snags in it.  One of these small things, which nevertheless is causing great inconvenience in my constituency is the fact that the only centre in the constituency of West Galway in which one can have a driving test in the city of Galway.  As we know, this is a constituency which stretches 50, 60, and 70 miles in places.  I would suggest to the Minister the setting up of a driving test centre in the town of Clifden or some other suitable location to serve the whole of Connemara.  It is very difficult for a man who is living in the rural areas and who must purchase a car to bring him to his work to have a driving test in these circumstances.  Most of such men who are able to get employment cannot always find it on their doorstep.  If they require a motor car to get to work and if they are working five days of the week, they cannot do the test.</P>
    <P>I have made representations to the Minister's office on certain occasions to try to facilitate people who are working during the hours they were being requested to do the test.  I am afraid that they were not met in any way and they were forced eventually into taking a day off from their labour and losing a day's wages, which is not a very fair thing to ask a man who is rearing a family of seven or eight children in the heart of Connemara. It would be reasonable to expect that the driving tester could attend in the <Col N="1017" /> town of Clifden on certain occasions, possibly once every two or three months.</P>
    <P>As I said in the outset, I feel very strongly about the Department's delay in dealing with obvious problems, hazards to life.  I know these conditions exist in areas other than Galway.  We still have very well-known driving hazards where people have lost their lives and where accidents are taking place week after week.  Especially coming into the tourist season, when there will be many motorists passing through our towns and along our roads, we cannot but expect, unfortunately, that there will be more accidents in certain areas.  These problems have been well aired by me and by other people in other places and at other times; yet no action seems to be taken.  Greater and more rapid attention to the more obvious danger spots would be greatly appreciated by the general public.</P>
    <P>In supporting this Bill, I would urge that the situation be reviewed after 12 months and that we get an opportunity of discussing it again, knowing how the legislation has worked out.  I congratulate the Minister on taking this forward step.  I trust some of the improvements I have suggested will be adopted and will be embodied in legislation at some later stage.  I do not wish to choke up the country with laws and regulations but we have a moral obligation to do the best we can to protect life and to make our roads safe for our people to travel on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to say that there was general agreement on the purposes of the Bill, and, indeed, I think I can also say on the main principles of the Bill.  I was obviously right in my opening statement in assuming that the provisions in the Bill dealing with the consumption of alcohol by drivers would figure most prominently in the debate here on Second Reading. Deputy Larkin, usefully and appropriately, prefaced his remarks by pointing out that, even if we were to succeed in eliminating this contributory cause of accidents on the roads, it would not prove to be a cure-all for the problem of accidents on our roads.  With this, I, of course, agree.  There are many other <Col N="1018" /> factors which cause or contribute to accidents but the consumption of alcohol by a driver has in it some degree of culpability; the consumption of alcohol can easily be avoided and it is reasonable to insist that it must be avoided.</P>
      <P>Accidents arising from other causes within the control of the driver are usually due to some momentary failure or some indecision on the part of the driver.  An accident caused or contributed to by drink happens, however, because at some time prior to the accident, the driver concerned decided to take the risk of impairing his proficiency as a driver by the consumption of alcohol.  The community, individual members of which are endangered by decisions such as that, is entitled, I think to insist that such risks should not be taken.  Unlike accidents which are caused by other factors, accidents which are caused or contributed to by the consumption of alcohol can be avoided and, as a Legislature, it is our duty to provide that they must be avoided.</P>
      <P>We must, of course, deal as far as it is possible to do so with other causes of accidents.  I suppose some momentary aberrations are inevitable, but these other causes of accidents are in a different category from driving when affected, however slightly, by the consumption of alcohol.  I agree with Deputy Larkin, however, that we must do everything possible to avoid all accidents.  Even if it is a fact that world statistics tend to show that accidents and fatalities on the roads are, in general, proportionate to the level of traffic, that does not mean that we must accept that it is inevitable that the number of accidents must go on increasing.  We must adhere to the belief that all accidents can be avoided and we must try to ensure, so far as it is possible for us to do so, that they will be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no cause to be complacent or to congratulate ourselves if our accident rate happens to be lower than that in other countries.  We must believe that, if all drivers exercise proper control over their vehicles, there will be no serious accidents at all.  Given the goodwill of the people, this should be an attainable target.  If <Col N="1019" /> it appears to be unattainable, then that is a reflection on our own attitude.  We must not get into the position of accepting that road accidents are inevitable.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera asked two specific questions.  The first was: Is drinking before driving so big a problem that this Bill is needed now?  He pointed out that other things may be more important contributing factors or there may be other factors which cause more accidents than does the consumption of alcohol.  That may be so.  There are many other factors contributing to accidents on the roads and I have no doubt that some of them probably contribute more to accidents than does drink.  We must, as I said, try to deal with this problem as well as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>Many of the other factors were referred to, such as the mechanical and otherwise general roadworthiness of vehicles, wandering animals, tiredness on the part of drivers, the state of the driver's mind when he may be affected by business or domestic worries, what Deputy Larkin referred to as the transformation of character which takes place in some people when they get behind the wheel of a car and even such comparatively small sources of distraction as advertising signs and car radios.  All these can provide sufficient distraction to take a driver's attention off the road for a split second, not to mention another matter referred to here by several speakers, namely, driving at a speed which is excessive in the particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>Most of these contributing factors arise from momentary loss of concentration or some inadvertence on the part of the driver but the consumption of alcohol involves a definite decision by the driver.  In answer then to Deputy de Valera's question as to whether this is so big a problem that this Bill is necessary, my reply is definitely &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The danger to the public is of sufficient magnitude to warrant the law circumscribing in this way the permission granted to people by the licensing authorities to drive mechanically propelled vehicles on the public road.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> In this respect I must take the stand that there is no inherent or fundamental right vested in anybody to drive, any more than there is an inherent and fundamental right for anybody to posses a firearm.  If there are any fundamental rights involved in this matter, it is the right of the community to be protected from unnecessary danger to life and limb in our citizens' normal everyday activities.  It is only fair that only those who are licensed to use the roads in this way should be permitted to do so.  It was inevitable that it would be decided that people would have to be licensed before they were allowed to use the roads in this way.</P>
    <P>I do not for one moment think that all the talk here of the alleged unconstitutionality of some of the proposals in the Bill is anything other than nonsense. Even if it were not nonsense, however, and if we found that what is proposed in this Bill was unconstitutional, it would surely be justifiable to make it a condition for the obtaining of a licence to drive that the applicant agree to allow his fitness to drive to be tested in the manner laid down in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass and other Deputies referred to what were described as statistics of accidents arising from the consumption of alcohol.  Deputy Treacy also referred to this matter but not in the same trusting way, not placing such implicit confidence in the accuracy of these figures.  The figures quoted here could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as statistics.  In my opening statement, I pointed out, as did a number of other Deputies subsequently, that because of the obvious difficulty of determining whether a person who has been injured in an accident had his driving capacity adversely affected by the consumption of alcohol or not, the figures quoted were meaningless and without any value.  There are no reliable statistics available on this matter and, in my opinion, it would not be possible to compile reliable statistics.  It is, however, common knowledge which cannot reasonably be doubted that a great number of accidents are caused, or are partly caused, by the consumption of <Col N="1021" /> alcohol and everyone who has driven himself after only a moderate intake of alcohol, or who has been a passenger with a driver in this condition, or has driven behind somebody in this condition, knows that one's driving can be affected even long before becoming drunk in the normal sense.</P>
    <P>This is a serious danger on the road and it is the easiest such danger to deal with.  Even if there are more important causes, there is no reason why we should not deal as effectively as possible with this particular cause of accidents.  It is only by a process of attrition that all the causes of accidents will be eliminated or reduced to a minimum.  It is feasible to make consumption of a dangerous level of alcohol a specific offence and public interest demands that this should be done.  There is no reason why the consumption of alcohol to a dangerous extent should ever occur unless an individual decides to commit this new offence which I am asking the Dáil to create.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera pointed to the obvious fact that it will not be possible to test everybody in every pub and therefore there is likely to be evasion of the law when it is enacted. This, of course, is true, but at least everybody in every pub will know that this crime exists and that he is liable to a penalty if he commits it. He may be caught and he may not; it depends on the degree of responsibility of the public, and indeed on the weight of public opinion, whether the disregard of the law will be widespread or not.  It may be that comparatively large numbers of people will decide to take the chance of breaking the law in this respect and it may be that a number of them will get away with it, but some will be caught and even if it is only, as Deputy de Valera suggested, one in 100, they deserve no sympathy when they are caught.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick, who, I thought, made a reasonable contribution to the debate, said that he hoped to give adequate power to deal with the drunken driver, while at the same time amending the Bill substantially.  This is not enough.  I am asking for power to deal with more than the drunken driver.  I thought I made it clear at <Col N="1022" /> the outset that the intention was to create a new offence.  I want the Dáil to give me power to deal with the driver who is not drunk, as we all understand the word, who has not in fact been infringing the law up to now by driving after a certain consumption of alcohol.  The drunken driver is the only type of case which conceivably can be caught by the present clinical examination.  I maintain, and I substantiated it in my opening statement, that it has been scientifically established that in almost all, if not indeed in all cases, long before the stage of what we know as drunkenness is reached, the ability to drive with normal competency has been seriously impaired.  I am asking the House to create this new offence and to enable it to be dealt with.  In other words, this is not dealing with drunken driving as we know it.</P>
    <P>I say that practically all and very probably absolutely all people who acquire this specific level of alcoholic content in their blood are impaired in their driving capacity.  Even if it did happen on occasion that by a fortuitous combination of circumstances, some individual raised his blood alcohol content to the level specified in this Bill and still retained his capacity to drive unimpaired, it is still reasonable and justifiable to convict him of the offence of taking the terrible risk of making himself unable to avoid a fatal accident due to the selfish, reckless and inconsiderate consumption of alcohol.  It is dangerous to the general public for a driver to raise the blood alcohol level to this degree.  That is a scientifically established fact.  We all know the terrible record of death and injury on the road and I ask the House to make this dangerous practice illegal and in itself an offence against the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick asked me to give his method a trial and if it was found to be unsatisfactory after a few years, to come back and amend it, but the question is how are we to decide if it has been satisfactory?  Are we to accept the number of deaths or maimings or disfigurements as a measuring stick and if so, how many <Col N="1023" /> accidents involving these things are we to accept as satisfactory?  This is serious enough to warrant the Dáil giving this new power which I am asking for in this Bill.  There were a number of criticisms of what I am asking the House to do in regard to the blood tests, and the urine tests in particular, and also in regard to the breathaliser test.  Despite the fact that I thought I explained that the breathaliser test was not looked upon as a conclusive test and that I also explained why it was I felt I could not take it as a conclusive test, it did not seem to get home to all Deputies who spoke.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear again that the breathaliser test is taken only to enable the Garda to decide whether the other tests which are the conclusive ones should be carried out. I also want to repeat that the reason the breathaliser test has not been provided for on the same basis as the other tests is that it is not a reliable one, in its present state of development at least.  It may be that in the future there will be further development which will make it possible to use the breathaliser test in lieu of the others and, if so, I certainly will be only too happy to bring in an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies objected to the making of the blood alcohol level conclusive evidence of an offence.  In my opening statement on the Bill I explained at some length the reasons for which it was decided to make a specified blood-alcohol level conclusive evidence of a separate new offence and not <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the offence of driving while unfit, as recommended by the Commission.  Deputy O'Higgins and a number of Deputies referred to the fact that the Commission which reported in May, 1963, recommended that this should be used as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of driving while unfit.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that the course proposed in the Bill is the right one and that the considerations I mentioned in my opening statement constitute an overwhelming case for a departing from the recommendation of the Commission in so far as the use to be <Col N="1024" /> made of the blood-alcohol level is concerned.  I should like to point out that the Commission did not rule out the introduction of a system under which the blood-alcohol level would be accepted as conclusive evidence at some future date.  They merely considered at the time they reported which was May, 1963, that this was unlikely to be acceptable.</P>
    <P>Since May, 1963, I think public opinion regard to this matter has become more intense.  Accidents on the road have continued unabated despite all efforts to reduce them.  It is my opinion, at any rate, that the creation of this specific new offence is called for, and that in view of the undoubted fact that it has been scientifically established that driving in practically all cases is impaired with the blood-alcohol level at this degree, it is certainly justified and necessary to make this blood-alcohol level conclusive evidence of the commission of this offence.</P>
    <P>There were some criticisms also of the fact that refusal to give a specimen will be an offence which will carry with it the same penalties as committing the basic offence.  I think there is every reason for this.  If a refusal to provide a blood or urine sample is to carry a smaller penalty than the penalty for having the actual blood-alcohol content of 125 mg., there is obviously an incentive for someone who knows well that his blood-alcohol content is over this level to take the easier course, the course carrying the lesser penalty, and refuse to give a specimen.  I indicated in my opening statement that it was necessary to keep the penalty for this at the same level for that reason.  Otherwise we would have the situation that those who were really bad cases, and knew they were, could opt for the lesser penalty.  They would have this way out, whereas borderline cases who genuinely believed they were not infringing the law in this regard would, if they were found to have a blood-alcohol level over the specified amount, suffer the major penalty.  I think it is fully justified that this should be done.</P>
    <P>As I said, a number of Deputies queried whether the provision in regard to blood testing and the treating <Col N="1025" /> of it as conclusive evidence of an offence was in accordance with the Constitution.  Deputy Dillon, in particular, who is, of course, known to be such a great admirer of the Constitution, was particularly vocal in this respect.  The Article of the Constitution which was quoted is Article 40, section 3, which reads:</P>
    <P>The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.  The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.</P>
    <P>I have sufficient confidence in the courts to believe that they will not consider it a right of an individual to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle after he has raised his blood alcohol level to a degree which makes him, while driving, a danger to himself, his passengers and other road users.</P>
    <P>As I said already the community as a whole has rights.  I believe the community has a right to protect itself from the dangerous activities of individuals. I am confident that there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent this.  I agree that the interpretation of the Constitution is a matter for the High Court, and ultimately for the Supreme Court, and it would be a matter for those Courts to decide whether the provisions of the Bill are repugnant to the Constitution, but this threat of Deputy Dillon's to have this Bill, if enacted, declared unconstitutional does not impress me.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that it is justifiable to circumscribe the licence that is given to people to drive on the roads in the same way as it is to circumscribe the licence that is given to some people to have possession of firearms by such things as preventing their discharge within a certain distance of the public roads. The legal advice available to me is to the effect that it would not be an undue interference with personal rights to provide for the taking of blood <Col N="1026" /> specimen even to the extent of authorising the use of force, if necessary. The provisions of the Bill in relation to the taking of specimens and the consequences of a refusal to provide a specimen implement the recommendations of the Commission. The Commission itself &mdash; the members of which included the President of the High Court, a district justice and the Chief State Solicitor &mdash; believed that its recommendations were in consonance with the letter and the spirit of Article 40.  They stated also that they would see nothing unconstitutional in legislation under which even the forcible taking of a blood specimen from a person who refuses to give one voluntarily would be authorised. I am not going nearly that far in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Commission stated &mdash; and I am sure every Deputy will agree with this &mdash; that every citizen who makes use of the streets and roads of this country is entitled to expect that the State shall, by its laws, make adequate provision to ensure that his life and person shall not be endangered by some other person driving a vehicle while he is unfit to do so.  I am perfectly satisfied that the enactment of this Bill is essential if we are to be able to say that we are defending and vindicating the personal rights of our citizens and, by our laws, protecting as best we may the lives and persons of our people from unjust attack.  In these circumstances, it is my view that the provisions of this Bill are not in any respect repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As I said, references were made here to causes of accidents other than driving when the capacity to drive had been impaired by the consumption of alcohol.  There was, for instance, reference to the dangers created by animals wandering on the road.  I quite agree that wandering animals are a menace and that we must do everything possible to ensure that animals will not be allowed to wander without control on the road.  However, we must remember that animals have to be moved in pursuance of farmers' normal operations and that it is not always feasible for a farmer to have <Col N="1027" /> such control over animals as a person who wants to drive at a rapid rate along the road would desire.  Motorists will have to accept this and arrange their method of driving accordingly.</P>
    <P>I agree that animals must not be allowed to wander uncontrolled but, with the best will in the world, it is not always possible for a farmer to ensure that his fences are impregnable.  It is much more difficult for the farmer to ensure this than it is for the motorist to ensure that he will not have an accident.  I agree that it is my duty to do everything possible and reasonable to ensure that animals will not wander uncontrolled on the road and that it is the duty of land-owners to try to ensure this also.  However, fences will deteriorate imperceptibly and eventually, on occasions, despite the best care of the farmer, will succumb to the continuous probing of farm animals.  It can often be through no culpable negligence of the farmer that such animals do get on to the public road.  In these circumstances, it is right to expect that the motorist should always be in a position to avoid accidents just as, in the same way, children will occasionally avoid the most meticulous and vigilant parental control and wander or dash on to the road.  I think we are entitled to expect that motorists should always have such control over their vehicles as to be able to avoid accidents in these cases.</P>
    <P>I have no sympathy at all with the attitude &mdash; which, I am sorry to say, was more evident on my own side of the House than on the other side of House &mdash; that roads exist for the convenience of motorists and that it is the job of the Legislature to keep them clear and in such condition that motorists can use them in the most efficient way possible from their point of view. I have no sympathy at all with that point of view.  I agree that we should do our best but that the primary duty is on the motorist to avoid accidents. I think we must continue to place that primary responsibility on them.</P>
    <P>Speed, as a cause of accidents, was also referred to.  A number of Deputies suggested that there should be a general speed limit either all the time <Col N="1028" /> on the roads or in some cases after lighting-up time.  I am inclined to agree, in principle, with this.  Even if speed itself cannot be shown to cause accidents &mdash; nobody can say with certainty that it does not cause a great number of accidents &mdash; it is beyond doubt, I think, that speed does cause many accidents that otherwise might not be so serious or even fatal.  Therefore, if it were possible to enforce an over-all speed limit it might be justifiable to do so.  I have not any immediate intention of doing anything like this but I certainly do intend to give it serious consideration.  It is a fact that people, particularly if they are in a hurry, will tend to drive as fast as is convenient in the particular car which they are driving, as fast as they themselves believe to be reasonably safe.  This immediately raises the problem of the enforcement of any such regulation.  The problem may be so serious that it might even be justifiable to try to provide that it would be an offence to manufacture a car capable of going over a certain speed but that would have to be done at international level rather than by anything that we could do here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made some suggestions which I think he did not really seriously believe in himself.  The suggestion that people who require hospital treatment would be brought, instead, to the Garda station is, as I think he probably knows himself, nonsense. I have never heard of a case where even an obviously drunken driver who was injured was brought to a Garda station rather than to a hospital.  I am sure that if such a case ever occurred, it would not go unnoticed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also ignored the fact that a doctor will have to be called to take a specimen and I for one cannot imagine any doctor consenting to the taking of a specimen from a person who is obviously in need of urgent medical attention.  I do not think the Garda really deserve the opinion that Deputy Dillon seems to have of them.</P>
    <P>In this respect also I might refer to Deputy Lemass's allegation that the powers in this Bill are likely to be used in a vindictive way by gardaí.  I do <Col N="1029" /> not think this Bill presents any greater scope for victimisation than a great many other measures which have to be enforced by the Garda.  I do not say it is impossible that some cases of victimisation may arise.  I do hear allegations of this occasionally, but very seldom &mdash; and I do not think there is a lot in it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also dealt at length with what will happen to a person who drives home at 11 o'clock and after he arrives home takes a few drinks.  He seemed to think that a garda could forcibly enter that person's house at I a.m. and require him to undergo a preliminary breath test and possibly even arrest him for this offence of driving while under the influence of drink although it was two hours previously that he had, in fact, driven home.  This, of course, is completely out of the question.  A person can be required to undergo a preliminary breath test only if he is in charge of a vehicle in a public place.  A Garda, therefore, cannot come to a man's house some hours after he has been driving and ask him to undergo this preliminary test and, in fact, in such circumstances a garda would not have any power forcibly to enter the man's house.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully believed that it was unfair to treat a man who goes into the back of his car to sleep off the effects of alcohol as committing an offence.  I must say that I agree with him.  That, in fact, will not be the position under this Bill.  Under section 50, subsection (4), of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, a person who is charged with being in charge of a mechanically-propelled vehicle while under the influence of drink or a drug must show, <i>inter alia</i>, that he had not driven the vehicle between his becoming unfit and the time he came under the notice of the Garda.  Otherwise, it is presumed that he has committed an offence under section 50.</P>
    <P>As I said, I quite agree that the person who recognises that he is unfit and stops his car until he is fit to drive again should be able to do so without fear of being prosecuted for being in charge of a car while unfit.  Section 31 of the Bill deals with this problem and, <Col N="1030" /> I think, removes the objections against the present section.  Under section 31, the onus on the defendant will be to show only that he did not intend to drive or attempt to drive.  It will no longer be necessary for him to show also that he had not driven between the time he became unfit and the time he came under the notice of the Garda. I think, therefore, that that difficulty will be adequately dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also mentioned the question of hand signals being required in the driving tests and said they were out of date and should not be included in driving tests.  My own personal view about hand signals is that they are very important.  Mechanical signalling devices can go out of order.</P>

      <P>There are other examples. We see cars driving along the road with the signals going, although the driver has no intention of turning. While we can provide that it is an offence not to have signals in working order, we still know that they can go out of working order without the driver being aware of this and the mere fact that it is an offence to have them out of order is not any great consolation to somebody who is involved in an accident because the driver was not so aware.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully also argued that it was ridiculous that persons should be refused certificates of competency on successful completion of a driving test because the application for the test was not signed by the applicant himself.  There is an obvious reason for requiring that the signature on the application for the test should be the same as the signature of the person actually performing the test but I am aware that cases have occurred in which applicants for driving tests, for no ulterior motive, just have not themselves signed the application forms.  As a result, the position was <Col N="1032" /> that tests carried out in such cases were regarded as invalid and where certificates of competency would otherwise have been given, these were withheld and the people concerned were required to do a further test.  I have had this problem under consideration having regard to the fact that the majority of cases of this nature which arose appeared to me to be genuine and to have caused considerable inconvenience and additional expense to the people involved.  Early in February last I directed that a revised procedure should be operated which will, as far as possible, prevent these cases from occurring while continuing to a large degree the safeguards against &ldquo;substitutes for tests&rdquo; provided by the system of signature checks.</P>

      <P>That is not a sufficient check.  In these cases it is believed that some people may have gone so far in their efforts to get a certificate of competency as to get people to substitute for them.  But I agree that in the majority of cases which came to my notice that was not the position.  There was no attempt to obtain a certificate by fraudulent means.  It was just due to a habit that exists in many places of there being only one member of the household who fills up forms and a lack of appreciation of the difference between a signature and just putting down a person's name.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally agreed that it is desirable to have a driving test, that it is desirable in present circumstances to establish that any person who wishes to be awarded a driving licence is competent to drive a car. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the person actually applying for the licence should undergo the test.  These safeguards are necessary.</P>
      <P>The other point which attracted most criticism was this proposal to restore power to the Minister for Justice to remit ancillary disqualifications. This generally seemed to be considered undesirable.  I quite agree no Minister for Justice would be particularly anxious to have this power, but I made it clear in my opening statement it was only in the particular circumstances of ancillary disqualifications that this power was being sought.  I have noted, however, that there seems to be a general opinion that, despite the fact that some unintended hardship may be caused in some cases, this power should not be taken and I will reconsider the matter between now and Committee Stage and see if there is any other method by which this can be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> The method suggested by Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy O'Higgins has some objections, that is, that it should be made automatic, that when a person appeals against a disqualification on his licence, the disqualification will not operate until the appeal is heard. Obviously, that could be used in some circumstances by people to postpone the inevitable date of coming into operation of the suspension.  But it may be we will decide that that disadvantage is more than compensated for by the removal of the unnecessary hardship that would be caused.  I will consider that between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There were a number of other points raised which could possibly be left over to be dealt with on Committee Stage. Deputy Barrett, for instance, raised the question of compulsory insurance and suggested it should be extended to cover the actions of passengers in vehicles.  The major difficulty here is that this would involve the insurers becoming liable for the actions of a wide range of people, people completely outside their control and selection. To secure this would involve an increase in premiums that might be quite substantial.  It is open to a person to secure, if he likes, extra cover for the actions of passengers.  Deputy Barrett wanted to make that compulsory. I do not know that that would be advisable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> If the Minister looks into the matter, he will find the law on the subject is in a state of uncertainty at the moment. Even the Supreme Court, by a recent decision, seems to suggest that in certain circumstances the owner of the car might be liable for the negligence of passengers.  Some insurance companies seem to accept liability; others seem to refuse to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the difficulty of making it compulsory, that the insurance companies would be taking on more than they believe they take on at the moment and would probably adjust their premiums accordingly. Deputy Barrett also referred to the offence of dangerous driving causing <Col N="1035" /> death or serious bodily harm and contended that the State tended to send all cases of this kind to the Circuit Court and that this involved a waste of time of the courts.  Sections 48 to 50 are intended to deal with this matter.  It should be possible to deal with cases of this kind under section 49.  However, we will probably deal with this and most of the other points raised on Committee Stage.</P>

It is quite obviously a matter of major importance to us in Ireland.  Apart from the proposal which has taken shape at Whiddy Island, the danger of pollution of beaches, particularly in the South and West, which would seem to be the most vulnerable areas, is agitating the minds of all people who think not only of tourism but of the existing amenities of the country generally.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I want to raise is one of a number which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister had the responsibility of answering today. It is a matter of some regret to me that the Minister is not present to deal with the matter personally but I understand that he cannot be present. That does not mean that I am taking from the ability of the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with the matter but I wish to avail of the opportunity to point out certain urgent steps which I think should be taken so as to ensure, in so far as it is humanly possible to do so, that oil pollution will be safeguarded against.</P>
      <P>We have seen in the case of the <i>Torrey Canyon</i>, which many will look upon as an isolated disaster, what grave consequences may flow from incidents of that kind.  Quite apart from the <i>Torrey Canyon</i>, which is the incident which led up to the whole question, there is the fact that in whatever waters tankers may ply, there have been for years complaints about the irresponsible discharge of oil into the sea and the pollution of beaches.  This has been the case in Britain and the papers have been full recently of many examples of why and how this has happened.  They are concerned about the Clyde area and I understand that when the proposal to facilitate the Gulf Oil Company at Whiddy was first brought forward, Cork County Council did, in so far as this was feasible, write into the conditions governing the permission to go ahead with the project whatever clauses it was open to them to write in, to ensure that this matter of pollution would be dealt with as it would arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fact that so far as is known, there is no international Convention in existence at the moment which effectively deals with this matter.  If there is one, it has not been made known to us and we do not know if we are associated with it in any way. <Col N="1037" /> I speak of an effective international Convention.  There may be some loose expressions of what is undesirable but there does not seem to be in existence machinery to deal with the problem. I want now to put some suggestions to the Parliamentary Secretary for his consideration, particularly in relation to the project at Whiddy which is the most obvious one to present us with problems for the future.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Gulf Oil Company, one of the world's largest companies, have ordered six tankers of 300,000 tons each and it is proposed that these will carry crude oil from the Middle East and Africa to the Whiddy Island terminal.  From there it will be shipped in smaller tankers of 85,000 and 100,000 tons to the company's European refineries. This means the transhipment of oil in immense quantities.  While it has been said, and probably with understandable justification by the representatives of West Cork, that the operation of this project will be of benefit to the people there, it can also be said that this country has conferred a benefit on the Gulf Oil Company in providing them with this terminal.  I do not suppose there are many places in Western Europe which can compare with Whiddy Island in the provision of berthing for large tankers.  It would seem to me that the Government are in a position to make certain preconditions with Gulf Oil before the project goes into full-scale operation.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of the existence of a body of opinion in Cork and throughout the country which objects on purely artistic grounds to the existence of an oil terminal of any kind. We will always have the conflict between the need for employment in areas which have been regarded as depressed and the preservationists who feel that the beauty of the southern and western coasts should be preserved regardless of the cost.  That is not a problem with which I wish to concern myself here now because it is outside the scope of this question; it is too big a question and one which I would prefer to leave to the Deputies who represent those areas.  Sentimentally, I would naturally incline towards <Col N="1038" /> the preservationists.  However, Connolly said that Ireland, apart from its people, meant nothing to him, and I think that is the realistic view we all have to take.  The first essential is that people get employment in their own country, and anything which we can do in that direction without despoiling the countryside we must encourage.</P>
    <P>Therefore, looking at what is a <i>fait accompli,</i> now that Gulf Oil is here, let us see what the Government can do to ensure that pollution will not become a problem for us.  There is no guarantee, of course, no matter what they do, that there will not be a recurrence of the disaster that overtook the <i>Torrey Canyon.</i> We sincerely hope and pray that it never will happen, but nobody can foretell what the future holds.  However, it has struck me, and it has been suggested to me by seafaring men with long experience of the sea, by men who have been masters of ships on the Seven Seas, who have had experience of tankers and who know what they are talking about, that one very obvious step which the Government might take with a view to getting some degree of control in the future is to insist upon Gulf Oil putting at least some of these tankers on the Irish register.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  I understand it means that a considerable income in the form of tax would accrue to this country.  At the moment it appears that most of these tankers sail under the Liberian flag and, indeed, because of that, it has been suggested that the kind of crew which they get &mdash; most tanker crews, I understand, are made up of sailors who sign on in various parts of the world &mdash; is different from the crews we find on nationally established lines; they have perhaps a dozen different nationalities in these tanker crews.  If some of these tankers were on the Irish register, it would mean, No. 1, that they would have an Irish crew.  The question of employment comes in here, and it is a pretty big question. No. 2, I suggest to the Government it would give some degree of control over the activities of the management of the tankers.  If there is no control, if the Government have no say in the management of these colossal <Col N="1039" /> ships, there is nothing to prevent the discharge of oil waste outside Bantry Bay.  There is nothing to prevent pollution on a considerable scale.  That is the very simple answer to at least part of the problem.  It is not an unreasonable proposition, and it is one with which, perhaps, Gulf Oil might fall in readily.  I do not know.</P>
    <P>I am also informed that in the berthing of these ships, it is proposed to employ British tugs.  It would be a big job berthing these ships, as can be easily imagined.  Is there anything to prevent the Department of Transport and Power taking the initiative in the creation of a company or some organisation for the provision of Irish tugs to berth these ships?  These are things I suggest the Department should consider because they do bear upon the problem of pollution.  I am not suggesting for one moment that this problem is easily solved.  If it were easily solved the vast resources of Britain and other countries would have been employed to solve it long before now, but we should do anything which lies reasonably in our power to tackle it and that is one possible way of getting our foot in the door by getting some say in the management and control of these big boats.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration of national advantage which has nothing to do with pollution but is something to bear in mind, that is, that Irishregistered ships at a time of national emergency are subject to Irish law and, indeed, become Irish property.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in Britain that some form of international insurance scheme should be set up to pay for pollution, but the question of paying for pollution is, I would think, a very vexatious one and one which requires long and careful consideration.  How is the damage which pollution may cause to be calculated?  If say, a great stretch of our southern or western coastline were polluted and had the effect of preventing many thousands of holidaymakers from going there in a season or maybe in two seasons, how is one to estimate the loss of income to the many hoteliers and the many hundreds of people who make <Col N="1040" /> their living by tourism in those areas? It is a very difficult question.  We should concentrate, therefore, as we have the opportunity now before the problem becomes acute, upon prevention. I was glad to hear that we have sent some people to England to see what their experience there has taught them.  At least it shows that we are, to that extent, aware of our responsibilities in the matter.  I noted with interest that the manager of Cork County Council said that before granting permission for this project on Whiddy, he himself went to Milford Haven, which is one of the biggest oil ports in the world, and found there that, on average, 15 seepages occurred every month.  If that is so in Milford Haven, it is only commonsense to expect that we shall have the problem here.</P>

      <P>No, but the Minister may be here tomorrow.  Up to the time of the disaster involving the <i>Torrey Canyon,</i> there was no great worry about the kind of pollution that might <Col N="1041" /> arise from a disaster of this kind.  Over a long period, we have had discussions with regard to the normal run of pollution. In connection with the Bantry Bay and Whiddy Island development, oil pollution is something which has been engaging the attention of the Department for quite a considerable time, so much so that the Department endeavoured to get, and succeeded in getting, the most far-reaching guarantees from the Gulf Oil Company with regard to preventive measures to avoid pollution.</P>
      <P>While I sympathise with those involved in the recent disaster, those engaged in the tourist industry and in the fishing industry in that area, from the point of the Whiddy Island development, this may serve as a blessing in disguise because it has brought attention to the fact that regulations laid down with regard to the transport of oil do not cover every type of eventuality. There is no regulation controlling oil seepage and water pollution as a result of the kind of disaster which occurred off Land's End.  Our experience of this recent disaster has made us fully aware of the positive problems involved for this country in relation to the transportation of oil.  While that disaster occurred because a tanker was grounded on the rocks, there is no guarantee, though we have to accept that it is unlikely, that something might not happen to a tanker out in the Atlantic which might result in oil being discharged.  Even though the sea lanes are so far apart, one could perhaps, visualise a collision at sea in which a tanker might be damaged.  Because of the tidal flow, the coast around the entire island could be affected by pollution. The only thing that can be done is to try to make the best possible arrangements we can through this international get-together to protect our shores.  I am satisfied that the lesson learned from the recent disaster will be invaluable to our representatives at the next IMCO meeting.</P>

    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned Bantry Bay today; he hates to think what it will be like in ten years' time.

      <P>I cannot see how this particular question of Deputy Dunne's covers the matter of our prevailing upon the Gulf Oil Company to put some of their tankers on the Irish register because there is no relationship between possible pollution and whose tankers deliver the oil.  Deputy Dunne endeavoured to make a connection by suggesting that the crew of the Gulf Oil tankers are not as good, or as careful, or as well selected as they might be.  This is a type of allegation upon which I do not feel free to comment.  However, the lesson learned from the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> can prove very useful from our point of view.  I was hoping, when Deputy Dunne decided to raise this matter on the Adjournment, that he would come up with something more helpful than a suggestion of changing the flags on the tankers.</P>

      <P>I agree.  As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, some short time ago I had a certain responsibility with regard to the development of the West and, quite honestly, I was very pleased when this decision with regard to Bantry was taken.  This project will make this port one of the world's major terminal oil ports and that must confer great benefit on Bantry and West Cork.  The responsibility of the Department of Transport and Power in this particular connection is to take all steps possible to further this project.  That it has done, is doing, and will continue to do.  It will also take all possible steps to ensure that the effect of oil pollution in the area will be kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6th April, 1967.</P>
