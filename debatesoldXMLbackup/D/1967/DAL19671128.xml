      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>It is estimated that in the year 1964 the imports of commodities of a type used in the building and construction industry from non-sterling countries amounted to about one-fifth of the total supply, that is to say, imports plus home production less exports, of such commodities.  The corresponding proportion for imports of these commodities from countries which have devalued their currencies this month is estimated at about onesixth. The countries concerned are: The United Kingdom, Cyprus, Fiji, Hong Kong, Israel, Malawi, Malta, Mauritius, Spain, Guyana, Jamaica, Gambia, Ceylon, Denmark, New Zealand and Iceland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if his permission was sought or obtained by any of the Irish shipping companies which increased their freight charges as from Monday, 20th November, 1967; and if he will now ensure that the increases are withdrawn having regard to the <Col N="792" /> serious precedent which such action has undoubtedly created.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated previously, there is no statutory control over sea freight rates nor, in view of the international character of shipping, would it be possible to exercise control unilaterally.  Freight rates are, accordingly, left for settlement between importers and exporters on the one hand and shipping companies on the other.  I have, however, had inquiries made in the matter of the principal shipping companies concerned and these companies have represented that the increases imposed are adequate only to cover the extra costs involved as a result of devaluation and that the increases in freight charges would not increases the profitability of the services operated.  They also state that an immediate increase in the rates was necessary because outstanding nonsterling accounts became payable at the new rates of exchange.</P>
      <P>The increases in freight rates between this country and the continent are in line with increases which have been made generally in freight rates between devaluing and non-devaluing countries.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that freight rates represent only a small fraction of the value of the goods concerned and the increases will, therefore, absorb only a similarly small fraction of the benefit of devaluation to our exports.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question from Deputy O'Donnell on 18th October last in which I gave an outline of progress under the brucellosis eradication scheme.</P>
      <P>Eradication measures are in progress in Cavan and Monaghan.  These measures will be extended in stages and it is hoped to include Louth before the end of 1968 and Meath and Dublin in 1970.  In the meantime, a herdowner in the counties in which full eradication measures have not been introduced who, through his own efforts, has cleared his herd of the disease may participate in the Brucellosis (Certified) Herds Scheme under which he may qualify for free testing and the purchase of reactors by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Forestry workers are one of several analogous groups in casual employment in the public service, who are non-pensionable, and it would be clearly impracticable to single any one group out for special treatment in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider that men who in the main have been employed <Col N="800" /> from ten to 30 years are in a casual group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidently the situation is that there are other workers in other Departments working under the same conditions.  It would not be possible or practical to make an arrangement in relation to one single group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that, if it has been the practice in other Departments to employ casual workers for short periods, that cannot be used as an argument for the Government not granting a pension scheme to people employed continuously over a long number of years, many of whom have spent all their working lives as forestry workers?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary ask his Minister to have another look at this aspect of the case?</P>

      <P>In view of the exceptional circumstances in which the workers in this factory lost their jobs, the Government have decided that special payments should be made to alleviate the hardship for the workers concerned. The Supplementary Estimate necessary to enable the payments to be made will be introduced as soon as possible and I hope that it will be possible to make the payments before Christmas.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle applied in Rawsons is the principle of sudden destruction by fire in a disaster.  Any argument to bring this to bear on other situations would be an argument against helping the workers in Rawsons.</P>

      <P>That is very good on the Minister's part, but he will not accuse us of trying to get rid of the compensation for Rawsons' workers, when what we are seeking is to extend the Minister's mercy.  We are seeking to get equal treatment for those workers declared unemployed because their employers do not wish to come under the provisions of the Minister's Bill in January.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made regarding suggestions as to sex discrimination in employment in semi-State bodies.  The position in regard to access of women to such employment is that, in general, they are eligible for appointment to recruitment grades and for promotion to higher grades.  There are, however, some exceptions where recruitment grades, from which higher grades are filled by promotion, are confined to men.</P>
      <P>As regards pay differentiation, the position of women in semi-State employment is broadly similar to that in employment generally in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that semi-State bodies have a considerable degree of autonomy in determining staff recruitment policies and the remuneration and other conditions of their staff.</P>

      <P>When I set up the Landlord and Tenant Commission I asked them to prepare, as a matter of urgency, an Interim Report on the working of Part III of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, which relates to occupational tenancies.  Subsequently, in response to representations made during the passage of the Ground Rents Bill through this House, I asked the Commission to take up the question of extending rights of purchase to other categories of lessees as soon as they had completed their report on occupational tenancies.  I recently received this report, which is a comprehensive document.  It is now being printed and will shortly be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The capitation rate payable by health authorities in respect of patients sent, or deemed to have been sent, by such authorities for treatment in general voluntary teaching hospitals is 64s 6d a day.  This charge covers maintenance and treatment in public accommodation.  Where a patient exercises a choice and obtains treatment in a voluntary hospital in lieu of that made available by the health authority concerned the liability of that authority is 44s 6d for public accommodation and 40s 0d for private or semi-private accommodation.  The corresponding rates for general non-teaching hospitals are 34s 4d, 24s 4d and 21s 6d.</P>

      <P>I have met the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union jointly on two occasions to discuss the reorganisation of the general medical services, as proposed by the White Paper.  It has been arranged that detailed discussions on this reorganisation are to continue with officials of my Department.</P>
      <P>Discussions are being held concurrently with the various pharmaceutical interests regarding the proposed new system for providing drugs and medicines through retail chemists for persons eligible for general medical services.  The Irish Pharmaceutical and Allied Industries Association, the Wholesale Drug Federation, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the Irish Drug Association have been involved in these discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to dental care, precedence is being given to the improvement of the present services for children and others now entitled to treatment.

    <P>The planned development of the district nursing services, which is now in progress, was earlier discussed with the Irish Nurses' Organisation and I have been in correspondence with that organisation regarding some other aspects of the White Paper proposals about which they wrote to me.

If further discussions with the organisation should be necessary I shall, of course, arrange them.</P>
    <P>Progress in the discussions with each of these interests is generally satisfactory but a number of issues remain for clarification and decision.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £966,700 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1968, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Finance, including the Paymaster-General's Office, and for payment of a Grant-in-Aid. </P>
      <P>Most of the services in this Estimate are by now well-established.  I would, however, like to say something on two important items which were first introduced by way of Supplementary Estimate in 1966-67.</P>
      <P>The first of these relates to western development.  In 1966-67 a supplementary provision of £5,000 was taken for Special Aid to Projects in the West.  In this year's original Estimate the provision was for £20,000.  I announced in my Budget statement, however, that this provision of £20,000 would be increased to £250,000 in order to create a fund, to be known as the Special Regional Development Fund, out of which payments would be made to assist worthwhile projects in the West.  I am taking a Supplementary Estimate along with the Main Estimate for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting up of the Fund has given a great impetus to the efforts of the County Development Teams and <Col N="819" /> the Team Secretaries and will, I hope, go a long way towards furthering the Government's policy of revitalising the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>To date over £125,000 has been committed by way of assistance from the Fund to 11 projects in nine counties.  In addition agreement in principle has been given to the issue of over £30,000 in the case of three projects on which further investigation has to be carried out.</P>
    <P>The second item to which I would like to refer is the Public Services Organisation Review Group.</P>
    <P>This group was set up in September, 1966, with the following terms of reference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the growing responsibilities of Government, to examine and report on the organisation of the Departments of State at the higher levels, including the appropriate distribution of functions as between both Departments themselves and Departments and other bodies. </P>
    <P>The Chairman of the Group is Mr. Liam St. J. Devlin.  The other Irish members are persons prominent in business and the public services.  A member with special experience in the organisation field has generously been made available by the Norwegian Government.</P>
    <P>The Group began their activities in October, 1966, and have been very active since that date.  To help them in their deliberations they have, with my approval, engaged the services of an international firm of management consultants. The main charge against this provision is the cost of these consultants. I hope to have the report of the Group next year.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, it has been arranged that devaluation and its effects will be discussed in this debate and I now turn to this subject.</P>
    <P>On 18 November the British Government announced the devaluation of the pound sterling by 14.3 per cent.  Under the Currency Act, 1927, the Irish pound is statutorily linked to sterling and a devaluation of sterling is automatically <Col N="820" /> followed by a devaluation of the Irish pound unless amending legislation is passed.  Such legislation could, of course, be enacted at very short notice but the Government deliberately made no proposal to this effect.  Having weighed all the pros and cons of alternative courses of action, they had decided that it would be seriously disadvantageous to the economy to disturb the existing parity with sterling.  The Irish pound was consequently also devalued by 14.3 per cent on 18 November.</P>
    <P>Some people profess to interpret the fact that our currency was devalued at the same time as sterling as meaning that we are utterly dependent in monetary and economic affairs on Britain. This idea, of course, does not stand up to objective examination.  The decision to devalue was a free choice of the Government after a careful consideration of the various alternative courses of action.  It was a business decision based solely on an assessment of how our national advantage would best be served.  A number of other countries, including some who are not members of the sterling area, such as Israel, Denmark and Spain, also decided that it was in their best interests to follow the British devaluation and I do not think any one accuses them of lacking monetary or economic independence. On the occasion of the last sterling devaluation in 1949 the present Opposition were in office and they decided not to establish a different rate of exchange with sterling.  They considered that the course of least disadvantage was to maintain parity.  We have taken the same decision on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Anyone who now wishes to criticise the Government's action in devaluing should bear in mind that they could have raised the question of a change in our exchange arrangements well in advance.  The possibility of a devaluation of the pound sterling has never been very far from the surface in recent years.  On 13th July, 1965, the Taoiseach, when Minister for Finance, in answer to a question by Deputy Cosgrave (Dáil Debates, Cols. 1008 and 1009) intimated that if the pound sterling was devalued the Irish pound <Col N="821" /> would be devalued as well.  Nobody asked for reconsideration of this reply.</P>
    <P>The idea that we should have given ourselves a competitive advantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> the British and other devaluing countries by devaluing by a greater amount than these countries has nothing to recommend it.  Since all imports would be dearer, and not just those from non-devaluing countries, such a step would have led to substantially higher prices and costs than are likely to result from the moderate devaluation which has actually occurred.  A higher rate of devaluation than that of Britain would tend to raise doubts in the minds of foreign investors about the basic soundness of the economy and cause fears of further devaluations.  The consequent loss of confidence would be a serious blow in view of our dependence on the capital inflow for the financing of an important part of our development needs.</P>
    <P>In any case, since we are in balance of payments surplus at the moment a drastic step of this kind would be unnecessary.  It would, apart from anything else, be impossible to justify to the International Monetary Fund whose Articles of Agreement provide that a member shall not propose a change in the par value of its currency except to correct a fundamental disequilibrium in the balance of payments.  In view of our close economic ties with Britain, the Fund have accepted a devaluation of sterling as adequate justification for a corresponding devaluation of the Irish pound.  They could scarcely be expected to accept in our present circumstances the need for a greater devaluation than that of sterling.</P>
    <P>Not to have devalued at all&mdash;which is the only other possibility&mdash;would have been an indefensible decision in view of the close trading relationship between Britain and ourselves.  It would have meant, in effect, the imposition of a tariff of 16.7 per cent on all our exports to Britain.  The result may be gauged from our experience of the harmful effect on our industrial exports of the levy of 15 per cent imposed by the British authorities in November, 1964.  The higher cost of holidays in Ireland would have had <Col N="822" /> detrimental effects on our tourist trade. Adherence to the former exchange value would have raised barriers against the export expansion on which we rely for disposal of most of the increased production needed to provide new jobs and higher living standards.</P>
    <P>It is too early to weigh up exactly the impact of devaluation on our economy.  Certain disadvantages obviously follow from it&mdash;in particular, all purchases from the non-devaluing countries now cost more&mdash;but there are some compensating benefits.  The extent of the price and cost repercussions of devaluation will be mainly determined by the amount of goods which we continue to import from non-devaluing countries, although there will also be a small indirect effect resulting from purchases of goods from Britain and other devaluing countries which have utilised raw materials from non-devaluing sources.</P>
    <P>In the first eight months of 1967 merchandise imports from non-devaluing countries amounted to £115 million or about 45 per cent of total imports. If imports of all goods and services are taken, the proportion is about 35 per cent.  In view of the price differential which now exists, it is clear that a demand for a certain amount of these imports will be diverted to Britain and other devaluing countries.  To some extent also, demand may be met from Irish sources where the Irish goods are now cheaper than the imported articles.  Even where goods continue to be imported from countries that have not devalued it is by no means certain that the suppliers will continue to market at full pre-devaluation prices.  They may have to absorb some of the price rise themselves in order to hold their positions.  The net result is likely to be a more moderate rise in the value of imports from non-devaluing sources than the pattern of existing trade would suggest.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the external trade accounts, there should be considerable gains as a result of the devaluation, particularly as we still have unused capacity which will enable us to increase production quickly to take advantage of the improved opportunities. Of our total exports 20 per cent <Col N="823" /> go to non-devaluing countries, particularly the United States and the EEC. The volume of manufactures exported to these countries is growing.  Provided our industrialists are prepared to seize the opportunities offered and our additional competitiveness is not eroded by domestically initiated cost increases, the next year should see substantial increases in exports to these markets.  Besides the actual direct gain to the balance of payments resulting from such an increase, this trend will also have the advantage of diversifying our exports.</P>
    <P>Besides an expansion in merchandise export trade with non-devaluing countries, there can be an increase in exports to devaluing countries, particularly Britain, provided Irish goods retain a competitive advantage as against goods from non-devaluing countries.  In addition, tourist receipts should be significantly increased.  The American and Continental tourist markets have been showing a very good response recently to our promotional work in these areas.  They should now receive a further stimulus. Tourists from these areas will now find costs in Ireland more attractive in terms of their own currencies and British tourists will find Ireland cheaper than the Continent.</P>
    <P>Striking a balance between the effects of devaluation on the import and export sides of the external accounts, one can say that there need be no substantial alteration in the balance of payments position as a result of devaluation.  Even if some disimprovement takes place, this can be faced since we are at present in surplus.</P>
    <P>Among the principal commodities which we import from non-devaluing countries are crude and partly-refined petroleum, wheat (imports of which vary according to our own harvest experience), coal, fertilisers and certain animal feeding stuffs, tea, tobacco, certain fresh and dried fruits, wines and brandy and various raw materials. In some of these cases, such as tobacco and oil, the greater part of the retail price is accounted for by taxation, the basic import cost being relatively low. <Col N="824" /> When allowance is made for purchases at pre-devaluation rates, it should be quite a while before prices of some commodities have to be raised because of devaluation.  The position in the case of all the major commodities is under close examination.  The circumstances vary from case to case and I cannot usefully do more at present than to reiterate the policy statement already made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to emphasise the moderate extent of the overall effect on the price level which devaluation of itself can be expected to have.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has stated that he will require to be satisfied under existing price control arrangements that any proposed price increase is not intended to be applied until it is clear that devaluation is, in fact, affecting current costs.  He has made it clear that he does not consider that there is any justification for increased prices where the goods themselves, or the raw materials for them, had been paid for at pre-devaluation rates.  Importers will be expected to take all steps open to them to avoid or mitigate the effects of devaluation, such as switching to other sources of supply.</P>
    <P>As to the overall effect of devaluation on the price level, it is reasonable to calculate that it should not be more than about two per cent.  Imports from the non-devaluing countries represent about 14 per cent of GNP.  If we continue to import the same amount from these countries and prices rose by the full amount of the devaluation, the price rise in respect of these imports would be 16.7 per cent and the consequential general price increase would be 2.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>However, this calculation assumes that the entire effect of the rise in price of imports would be concentrated on domestically-used goods whereas a proportion of imports is later exported in some form.  While allowance for this factor reduces the general price increase, this reduction is offset by the likelihood of some increase in the cost of goods imported from Britain owing to the effect of devaluation on Britain's own purchases of raw materials, oil, etc.  On the other <Col N="825" /> hand, there will be some switching of purchases from the non-devaluing countries to cheaper sources of supply and, moreover, the non-devaluing countries will not in all cases be in a position to allow the prices of their goods to rise, in terms of pounds, by the full amount of the devaluation.</P>
    <P>To sum up then, the direct effect of devaluation on our general price level may be expected to be of the order of two per cent and this will appear only gradually according as stocks have to be replaced.  The effect on the consumer price index, which covers a narrower range of goods, may be somewhat different but cannot be other than moderate.</P>
    <P>In view of the moderate effect which devaluation is likely to have on prices and the spread of the increase over a period, there is no ground for suggestions that there should be immediate compensation to recipients of social welfare.  It can be taken that, should there be significant price increases from whatever cause, the Government will give careful consideration to the position of the Social Welfare recipients. The Government have a good record in this respect.  Improvements in social welfare in the past have by no means been confined to compensation for the rise in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>On the question of demands for income increases at this juncture, whether or not they are associated with apprehensions about the effects of devaluation on living costs, I would like to explain the position as I see it.</P>
    <P>The Government's general attitude to income increases has often been stated.  The Government favour a progressive increase in workers' real incomes according as national production rises and Government policy is directed towards raising national production &mdash; and with it individual productivity&mdash;as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>So long as the international trend is for money incomes to rise faster than productivity, a rising price level in the world is inescapable.  The Government, in common with other Governments in Western Europe and North America, want to restore price stability so that <Col N="826" /> money will hold its value but this cannot be done unless the rising trend in incomes is more closely aligned with improvements in productivity.  When money increases are backed by a corresponding rise in output, they yield genuine improvements in living standards, whereas artificial and swollen increases are inevitably cut down to size by a rise in living costs.</P>
    <P>If in Ireland prices and costs rise faster than in competitor countries, we harm our export trade and make it easier for foreigners to take even the home trade from Irish manufacturers. In other words, those who insist on excessive increases in incomes are damaging the country's prospects and condemning more of their fellow countrymen to unemployment or emigration.</P>
    <P>Industrial workers in general have recently been making a big contribution to increased industrial output and this has been matched by improvements in their real earnings and conditions. Allowing for the 3.8 per cent increase which has occurred in consumer prices, the real earnings of industrial workers rose by 6 per cent in the first half of 1967 as compared with the same period of 1966.  This is higher than the rate of increase in national output as a whole.  Apart from actual increases in pay additional to the £1 a week increase of last year, there have been reductions in working hours, longer holidays with pay have been granted, service pay has become more general, and pensions schemes have been negotiated in a number of industries.  All these have given a real increase in the reward for work.</P>
    <P>New arrangements for training have been introduced under the Industrial Training Act of this year and the Redundancy Payments Bill recently passed by the Dáil offers further protection to industrial workers.  It is estimated that about 250,000 workers have obtained reductions in working time averaging two hours a week and that a similar number will benefit progressively from longer holidays until, in three years' time, paid holidays will extend to three weeks.</P>
    <P>I want to make clear that the <Col N="827" /> Government are glad to see improvements occur and wish to see the trend continue according as the national economy progresses.  But some words of warning against undue expectations are necessary, particularly in the light of the implications of devaluation.</P>
    <P>Devaluation means that our domestic money has lost a certain amount of purchasing power over the products of the countries which have not devalued. We have to produce more to earn the same amount of these foreign currencies as before.  We are, of course, helped by the fact that there will be a bigger foreign demand for our products, now that they are cheaper in foreign money, but it remains true that we must produce more to earn even the same foreign income as before and more still to increase our earnings of foreign exchange.  Productivity efficiency is, therefore, more important than ever and no less essential is the preservation of the relative cheapness and attractiveness of our products in order that we may be able to sell more of them abroad.  In Britain, the Government have emphasised that cost increases due to devaluation must not be used as a justification for wage increases and the British TUC have said that &ldquo;they will not regard increases in prices arising from the reduced external purchasing power of the pound as constituting in themselves justification for increases in wages&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For us, however, the essential thing is to preserve and, if possible, improve our competitiveness.  This means that any income increases during the year ahead must at least be covered by increased productivity.  We must do everything possible to keep our unit costs from rising.  It is, indeed, only by holding them behind British costs that we have a good prospect of continuing to do well in industrial exports to Britain during this period of severe restriction of the British economy. This is also the key to success in exploiting, for the benefit of employment in Ireland, the opportunity we now have of increasing our merchandise exports to, and our tourist income from, Continental Europe and North America.  I would hope that no section <Col N="828" /> of the community would be so impatient or so selfish as to imperil what is so obviously in the national interest.  Instead, let us concentrate on improving our incomes through increased productivity, so that the advances in income made possible by a continuing upward trend in production will hold their worth and be consistent with a general expansion of employment.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that devaluation, together with the effect of the higher interest rates resulting from the increase in British Bank Rate, will depress the economy.  I do not accept that view.  The growth rate at the moment is in the region of four per cent.  This rate of expansion is substantially export-led.  In the first six months of 1967, industrial exports were 28 per cent higher than in the first six months of 1966.  Provided we keep our costs stable&mdash;covering any income increase by at least equivalent increases in productivity&mdash;devaluation will provide a further boost to exports and therefore to industrial expansion. Diversion of demand from foreign sources to cheaper domestic suppliers should also provide some stimulus to domestic production.</P>
    <P>The measures introduced along with devaluation in Britain are likely to have a restrictive effect.  They may postpone the upward trend in consumption which had been visualised for the British economy over the forthcoming months.  While this is regrettable from our point of view, it is not a reason for dejection.  It has been our experience, particularly emphasised this year, that growth of our exports and production is not closely related to the trend in Britain.  In the first half of this year, despite static conditions in Britain, with both &ldquo;squeeze&rdquo; and &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; in operation, our industrial exports rose substantially while our overall growth rate recovered to four per cent.</P>
    <P>Granted that the British market may continue depressed in the short-term, Continental and American markets are likely to be much more buoyant over the next year than at present.  A growth rate of almost four per cent is <Col N="829" /> projected for European OECD countries for 1968, compared with two per cent in 1967, while the United States growth rate should be five per cent, compared with 2½ per cent in 1967.  It is precisely in these expanding markets that devaluation will give us a substantial cost advantage&mdash;and it is up to us not to throw it away.  The consequent rise in exports and production should compensate for any temporary loss of momentum in sales to Britain.</P>
    <P>There is one further point about the situation in Britain which I think should be stressed.  The sterling devaluation and Britain's deflationary measures are intended to transform a chronic balance of payments deficit into a surplus and thus allow her to resume stable growth.  We have a pronounced interest in the success of this objective.  As long as Britain remains in large deficit on her external account our external trading position will continue to have an element of uncertainty in it.  A strong Britain and a strong pound mean a strong market for our goods.</P>
    <P>About 90 per cent of Irish official external reserves are held in sterling. In view of the large proportion of our trade which is with Britain and other devaluing countries it is the sterling value of the reserves which is of most account; the reduction in their value in terms of non-devaluing currencies is an unwelcome but inevitable result of devaluation.  So also is the increased liability in Irish currency related to our dollar and deutschemark indebtedness.</P>
    <P>A beneficial side-effect of devaluation will arise in regard to the capital inflow.  Investment from Continental Europe and the United States should be stimulated both because of the lower cost, as a result of the devaluation, of setting up new factories and of the new opportunities for industrial exports which have been created.</P>
    <P>To allay doubts raised in the minds of the public by Opposition spokesmen, I wish to make it clear that there is no intention whatsoever of our copying the British credit squeeze and other deflationary measures in this country.  Our internal and external circumstances <Col N="830" /> are much different from those of Britain at present and the Government do not consider that deflationary action is needed.  In this the Government are, of course, exercising their freedom to formulate financial and economic policies most suitable to this country's needs.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that our savings, in the form of bank deposits, will continue to be available to finance domestic development needs, it has been necessary to raise our interest rates.  Here also there is no question of slavishly following the British example. Some increase is necessary but it has been kept to the minimum and, indeed, overdraft rates here, while unfortunately high, have been kept at a full one per cent below those in Northern Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>We hope that the increase in interest rates will soon be reversed.  The present level of Bank rate in Britain is necessarily of a temporary character, designed to safeguard the new exchange rate by attracting short-term funds back to Britain.  We can expect that it will be reduced in the near future to a more normal level.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered the questions which Deputies have asked about devaluation and its effects.  If other points are raised by Deputies, I shall deal with these in replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, I issued a booklet on decimal currency in June last inviting views as to the choice of system for this country.  I had a good response to this invitation.  A number of important representative organisations have recommended that we should adopt the same system here as in Britain and Northern Ireland while others favour one or other of the alternative systems.  Similarly there is a variety of views in the replies received from firms and individuals.  It was to be expected that there would be a conflict of opinion on this controversial subject.  I am at present considering the replies and I hope to be in a position to make a recommendation to the Government early in the new year.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to refer to decentralisation. The House is already aware <Col N="831" /> from the Taoiseach's announcement on 16th November, 1967, that it has been decided that the headquarters work of the Department of Education be transferred to Athlone and that of the Department of Lands to Castlebar.</P>
    <P>This decision was taken in the wider context of the Government's policy for regional development.  The decentralisation of the administration, commerce and industry of the country to the greatest extent possible has always been an essential part of the programme of the present Government and their predecessors.  The Government are determined to do whatever is feasible to redress the imbalance of population in the country.  They are particularly concerned to revitalise the west of Ireland by action on a wide and imaginative scale.</P>
    <P>It will take a number of years to give effect to the Government's decision, which will involve the erection of modern office blocks in Athlone and Castlebar and will also give rise to many other problems.  These will include human problems which the Government intend to have treated with the utmost understanding and consideration.  The staffing of the new offices will be effected as far as possible on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>I have already met representatives of the staff organisations and I will be available for further meetings, if necessary. Detailed consideration of the whole matter has commenced at the General Council under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the civil service.</P>
    <P>This is an important national project and it is vital in the national interest that it should succeed.  There will be difficulties but I am confident that, with the co-operation of all the interests concerned, they will be overcome.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have sought this debate and proposed the referring back of the Minister's Estimate because as the Opposition Party of this country we <Col N="832" /> felt that the manner in which this announcement of devaluation was conveyed to the people was unsatisfactory. We were not satisfied with the Minister's assurances as to the minimal effect of devaluation on the cost of living and on the lot of the poorer sections of the community.  Secondly, we felt this entire matter should be debated and discussed here in the Dáil, the people's parliament.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that of all the countries affected by devaluation we are now, some ten days later, only discussing this matter in the parliament of the people.  Even in the other part of this island the matter has been discussed fully.  It was discussed within two days in the British Parliament.  But because of the way in which we manage our affairs, there has to be a concession by the Government to enable a debate to take place here on something which may have a very serious and widespread effect on the lives of the ordinary people of the country.</P>
    <P>However, that is by the way.  Our primary concern was the display of Ministerial complacency which was communicated to our people last Saturday week; and indeed the complacency that the Minister gave expression to on television and radio a few minutes after the British announcement runs through his speech and his remarks here today.  We have had far too much of this complacency on the part of Fianna Fáil Ministers in recent years.  No matter how difficult things may have been for ordinary people, there was always a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance or a Fianna Fáil Leader of the Government to stand up in the Dáil or elsewhere and tell the people that good times were coming, that they were just around the corner. But they never come and the problems continue to remain and to grow and our people continue to find employment difficult to get and have to continue to emigrate.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that from Fianna Fáil Governments during the past ten years we have had a plethora of promises and plans, an abundance of Ministerial assurances, but in fact the old doctrine has been preached to the <Col N="833" /> people: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass.&rdquo; The plain fact is that now in 1967, whether we are on the threshold of Europe we do not know, we have a growing unemployment problem, continuing emigration, a rising cost of living, rising taxation and mounting discontent among most sections of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Devaluation has come about and this we were to accept without question following a bland Ministerial announcement, given in a post-prandial vein, that really it will not do anything to anyone, that it will not affect the people very much. This decision of the Government was announced by the Minister a few minutes after the British decision to devalue had been announced in London.  The Minister made his announcement with a flourish, with a certain amount of drama.  The Minister, having delivered himself of his remarks to the bankers, then received the intimation and proceeded to tell the people about it.  The suggestion was that this was the Government's decision.  In fact, I assert, by reason of the Government's inaction, that it was nothing of the kind.  This Government, among other things, have failed to expand the policy initiated by Deputy Sweetman as Minister for Finance ten years ago, have failed to expand our holdings of external assets in the form of non-sterling securities.  Today these assets stand at something less than the £10 million figure they stood at ten years ago.  That is one thing.  I do not suggest that a continual expansion of these holdings would have prevented the necessity for devaluation but it might have been some shield, some source of confidence at a time of difficulty for our currency, and I agree with the Minister that it is our currency and that it should be so treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is in relation to the position the Minister and the Government found themselves in on Saturday week.  Though the Central Bank of this country 2½ years ago indicated the need for a reform in our banking law, the Government have <Col N="834" /> done nothing whatsoever about it.  The Government have continued the legal obligation contained in our statute law of maintaining parity with sterling.  Of course it can be changed, but we have the Minister here telling us that under the provisions of the Currency Act the statutory link with sterling had to be maintained.</P>
    <P>In view of these facts&mdash;the failure to expand the holdings of the Central Bank in non-sterling securities, the failure to change the statutory obligation to maintain the link with sterling &mdash;when we hear the Taoiseach, as we did during the week, and the Minister for Finance today saying that devaluing the Irish pound by the same amount as the British devalued sterling was the best course to take, we listen with amazement.  Was this course taken because no other course was possible? Was this decision taken because the Government had failed to foresee the likelihood of this development and had failed to initiate the necessary joint studies by the Department of Finance and the Central Bank to determine the best exchange rate for the Irish pound? Did the Government neglect these obvious precautions and, in doing so, leave themselves with no effective alternative to following Britain blindly?</P>
    <P>I want to say, in so far as we are concerned, we can accept that the decision to devalue the Irish pound at the same rate as the British have devalued sterling may have been the right course for this country.  It may even have been inevitable; but we are concerned that this decision should be taken freely by our Government here in the light of our circumstances&mdash; freely in the sense that our currency is an independent currency, not subject to decisions taken outside&mdash;and entirely in the interests of the Irish people.  So far as this Party are concerned, we do not relish the spectacle of an Irish Minister for Finance reporting to the Irish people here at home decisions already taken in relation to their interests in London.  We deprecate a situation in which the Irish Minister for Finance is in effect like a puppet on a string, a string held by <Col N="835" /> the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that two and a half years ago this Party&mdash;not any other Party&mdash;this Party of Fine Gael in our policy document <i>Towards a Just Society</i>, called for an effective national credit policy.  We demanded in the interests of the people at that time that the Central Bank of this country should be an active, effective agent in defining and distilling the necessary credit policy to finance the undertakings of our people.  How was that policy greeted by the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;I am glad to see Deputy MacEntee in the House&mdash;and Deputy Lemass and the rest of them?  They started a scare throughout the country that we were out to do down the banks.</P>
    <P>There was derision and implacable hostility from Fianna Fáil two and a half years ago because we advocated a progressive measure that was already being applied in every other country in the world that fairly regarded itself as independent and entitled to decide its own destiny.  No, it could not be, according to Fianna Fáil, in the general election of two and a half years ago; our credit policy was something that could not be tolerated, and the object was to cause uneasiness and anxiety and worry amongst those who were fortunate enough to have investments or money on deposit.</P>
    <P>The general election is over.  It is true to say now that within the following couple of months our policy was adopted in full by the Fianna Fáil Government and is now fully and properly in operation.  The Minister can take pride in the fact that today in this country our Central Bank is acting as it should act, as a central bank advising and seeing that credit is controlled here in accordance with the interests and the requirements of our people.  That was Fine Gael policy announced by us and derided by Fianna Fáil two and a half years ago. It is now in operation.</P>
    <P>With that as an example, may I suggest now, on behalf of this Party, this decision having been taken either here or elsewhere, in the light of the <Col N="836" /> appropriate facts, or otherwise, that the Government now introduce into this House the necessary amending legislation to give it the power possessed by every other European Government to determine the exchange rate of our currency in accordance with our own requirements and our own circumstances. I make that suggestion now when it can cause no panic anywhere. Devaluation has already come.  Had we made that suggestion some time ago, no doubt we would have been met with cries from the Government of: &ldquo;They are after the banks; they are out for your £&rdquo;.  Now that devaluation has come, now that no issue of confidence can arise, the time has come to remove an out-of-date obstacle to the determination of our exchange rate.  The ties by which we have bound ourselves to sterling, regardless of our economic and financial interests, must now be broken so that our currency may be seen to be, as it undoubtedly is, an independent currency and so that the Government can have the necessary power to decide these matters independent of any outside decisions.</P>
    <P>That I say by way of introduction. However it came about, and whatever the merits of the decision, devaluation has taken place.  I do not know of my own knowledge and, therefore, I must accept the Minister's word, that to devalue at the same rate as Britain devalued was the proper thing to do. Certainly I agree with the Minister that the alternative&mdash;doing nothing&mdash;could cause and would cause considerable difficulty for our country and could cause and would cause wholesale unemployment for our people.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, devaluation is an ugly word.  It implies many things that affect people badly.  But we have an open economy.  We are subjected to many forces, many influences, many stresses which arise outside the country and which we cannot control.  In regard to the British decision to devalue, obviously a situation was created for us in relation to which action had to be taken and in respect of which a decision had to be made.  The decision was to devalue at the same rate as Britain.  I wonder if I were to say in relation to that decision:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> Devaluation is a tricky business and one by which every honest, industrious, thrifty man is a loser.  On a short view it may appear the State gains by it, but on the long view, it loses; for devaluation is destructive of the public morale.  By devaluing its currency, and forcing its citizens to accept something less than their original 20/- in the £ for their just claims upon it, the State becomes nothing better than a shyster debtor and weakens that public confidence in the integrity and capacity of its administration which is the basis of public credit.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that the Coalition by its policy has done grave injury to our people, to their standard of living, to our social and economic structures, to credit and to public confidence.  Devaluation has made us all very much poorer than we should have been and this country of ours much more difficult to live in.</P>
    <P>Had I said that in relation to the Minister's decision, the Minister would cry &ldquo;Sabotage&rdquo; and accuse me of irresponsibility.  If I went on to say that this decision was cutting every old age pensioner in his pension, every widow and every orphan in their pensions, every social welfare recipient in his benefits, no doubt the Minister would say, as he said last Wednesday: &ldquo;It would be very wrong and irresponsible that it should go out from this House that people's pensions will be worth less.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Finance&mdash;God bless the mark&mdash;who wrote an article entitled &ldquo;Diddlumdandy&rdquo;. It took the entire half page of the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 13th November, 1949.  Do not be bashful, Deputy MacEntee, take a bow.  This was the Fianna Fáil reaction to the decision to devaluate in 1949&mdash;&ldquo;The Government was a shyster debtor: grave injury had been done to the economic and social fabric of the State: the country was so much worse&rdquo;&mdash;but, <Col N="838" /> leave it.  It ends with this wonderful stinging sentence: &ldquo;The Government is dooming the Irish people to go down with the British ship.&rdquo; I am not reacting in that way&mdash;because that was Deputy MacEntee and that was Fianna Fáil in Opposition, and irresponsible, trying to cause a panic and a chaos among the people and suggesting that pensions actually were being cut and that the Government at that time, in the face of a 30 per cent devaluation, were running away from their liability to meet just claims.</P>
      <P>Now it is different.  Deputy MacEntee now sits up there on the back bench of Fianna Fáil.  He will support a decision to devaluate taken in different circumstances and different times because this is a Fianna Fáil decision, we are to be told, and now how different is the outlook.</P>
      <P>It is not being suggested now that the economic and social fabric of the country has been ruined, that people's lots have been made worse, that everything will be cut and that people will suffer.  No.  It is a different story now. Following the announcement, the Minister spoke on television and on radio, subsequently giving press interviews and one here today.  He had a number of things to say.  He was reported in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 19th November, 1967, as saying &ldquo;he could see no reason why the cost of living should be affected here as a result of devaluation&rdquo;.  He could see no reason why the cost of living should be affected here as a result of devaluation ! He went on to say: &ldquo;our exports, both visible and invisible, will be stimulated by this course&rdquo;.  Then he adds: &ldquo;in the main our imports from non-sterling countries were of a capital nature, and, not being consumer goods, will not directly affect the ordinary citizen&rdquo;.  Finally, he said: &ldquo;in so far as we would be using our reserves, we would be using them inside the sterling area&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I started by saying that our patience with regard to ministerial complacency is beginning to be exhausted.  I am going to assert that those four statements by the Minister were not only complacent but misleading and inaccurate and do not bear any examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> The cost of living will not be affected, said the Minister last Saturday week. Today, at least he says it is too early to weigh up exactly the impact of devaluation on our economy.  The cost of living was not to be affected.  In the ten months or so, since October, 1966, our imports from non-devaluing countries amount to £160 million and that is 15 per cent of our national expenditure which is forecast by the Economic and Research Institute this year at £1,130 million.  Fifteen per cent comes from devaluing countries.  An increase of one-sixth, which is roughly the devaluation figure, in 50 per cent of national expenditure means at least a 2½ per cent increase in the cost of living and that is in so far as we buy from non-devaluing countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is mixing up two things.  He is mixing up GPL and the cost of living: they are two separate indexes.  The general price level and the cost of living index are two separate things.  The Deputy should read my speech again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I am.  I shall study it later.  Secondly, in so far as our purchases from Britain are concerned, British production costs will increase and there is, in addition, the removal of British export rebates. This must have an effect in pushing up the cost of British exports to us and British exports to us represent one-quarter of our national expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest that, following devaluation at the import stage, we face at least a three per cent increase. Goods will come in here.  I think they will have a three per cent effect on the cost of living&mdash;and what will happen inside?  We have an ineffective price control operated by the Government.  I have little doubt that we shall have a three per cent increase in cost.  With our ineffective price control, I think that will very easily swell to four per cent as a factor in the cost of living.  I see that at least one person said recently that the total increase may be of the order will very easily swell to four per cent as of five per cent.  However, be it three per cent or four per cent, if such an increase takes place it takes place in <Col N="840" /> the circumstances obtaining here, under Fianna Fáil, because there always is an increase, each year, under a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>It is not unfair to say that, just taking the period between August, 1963, and August of this year, the cost of living has advanced by 21 per cent. In other words, it has increased at the rate of five per cent annually.  If you go back further, if you want to go back to 1957, when the present Fianna Fáil Government came into office, the total increase has been over 40 per cent and it has gone up steadily five per cent each year.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say: &ldquo;Two per cent, 2½ per cent, a three per cent increase in the cost of living or even a four per cent increase does not matter.&rdquo;  If it is to be added to the yearly increase, which has been our experience in the past few years, we may find rapidly, from this position, an advance in the cost of living this year of eight to nine per cent&mdash;and that is not unlikely. What is going to happen to bread?  Is it not perfectly clear that bread will go up in price and the decision to increase the price of bread has nothing to do whatever with devaluation?  The plain fact is that an extra £3 million which is now being given to the industry has to be found and it is going to be found by increasing the price of the small loaf of bread by 1d per lb. I suppose it will be announced as one of the unfortunate, unavoidable effects of devaluation.  It will have nothing to do with devaluation and the fact is that any factor which advances our increase in the cost of living can have a frightening and disastrous effect on our economy.  We depreciate our real earnings each year by an increase in prices and two per cent or three per cent or four per cent may bring about a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that our exports both visible and invisible will be stimulated by this course.  He did not say that that remark could only apply to one-quarter of our exports, the one-quarter that goes to the non-sterling area countries that have not devalued.  The balance of our exports, three-quarters, will continue to go to Britain and from Britain we will continue <Col N="841" /> to get the vast bulk of our remittances, our dividends and interest payments. Britain now, however it came about, whatever wrong policies they adopted, or whatever ill-luck they may have run into, is a depressed market. It is going through a definite inflation. The result of this decision is that we must continue to sell three-quarters of our exports in a market which is depressed, to people who are suffering from government imposed financial restrictions of one kind or another. When the Minister says this decision will stimulate our exports it can only affect one-quarter and the Minister is not even telling a half-truth, it is a quarter truth at the most.</P>
    <P>In relation to our imports from non-sterling countries, the Minister goes on to say that, in the main, our imports from these countries were of a capital nature and, not being consumer goods, would not affect the ordinary citizen. I do not know where the Minister gets his information.  So far as I can ascertain, and I take it by capital goods the Minister means, in effect, machinery, last year our total imports of machinery amounted to £58 million and of this amount 60 per cent was imported from the United Kingdom.  Our imports of capital goods from countries other than the United Kingdom, including countries that have devalued, came to something between £20 million and £25 million and our total imports from non-devaluing countries amounted to £135 million.  Therefore, the fact is that only one-sixth of these imports from non-devaluing countries consists of capital goods but the Minister says that &ldquo;in the main&rdquo; they consist of capital goods.  Am I being unfair in suggesting, if my figures are right, that either the Minister did not read his brief or was indulging once more in complacency of a kind which cannot be tolerated?  The Minister goes on to say: &ldquo;In so far as we would be using our resources we would be using them inside the sterling area.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In so far as we would be using our reserves we would be using them inside the sterling area.&rdquo;  Again, maybe the Minister attaches different meanings to these words from what I do, or maybe he does know the facts of life.  Our balance of payments with the sterling area at the moment is in credit, we have a surplus of £50 million.  For the past ten years we have had a surplus every year with the sterling area of at least £20 million but with other countries outside the sterling area we have now a deficit of £60 million.  If our reserves are to be used, they would be used to meet that deficit, the deficit created by our trade with countries that have not devalued.  In the light of that situation, I cannot understand how the Minister can blandly say our reserves would be used only inside the sterling area.  We have a surplus with the sterling area but we have an enormous deficit with non-sterling areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We cash our reserves.  I am going to suggest that every statement made by the Minister was misleading or was inaccurate and untrue.  The time has come to put the record right.  I believe devaluation of the Irish pound <i>vis-à-vis</i> the currency of other countries in the immediate future will do more harm than good. We have got to face that.  In the long term we may be able to get over initial disadvantages, but immediately there is no good trying to fool ourselves or deceive ourselves. Problems are created for us and our people and we have to look at them, face them and have a policy to deal with them.  Our imports from non-devaluing countries are 50 per cent greater than our exports to them.  This means that even if our trade with them benefited, even if we expanded our trade with them, we would still have to pay more for a larger volume of goods.  This must have a further adverse effect on our external balance of payments.  We <Col N="843" /> should recognise that.  The immediate effect in relation to our trade with non-devaluing countries is that our people are going to have to pay more.  It may be we will advance our trade with them.  That is a long-term factor.  The immediate effect is that we are going to have to pay more to countries from which we buy 50 per cent more than we export to them.</P>
      <P>Secondly&mdash;this must be faced&mdash;the effect of this decision of devaluation is clearly deflationary and is meant to be such.  The Minister said today he has no intention, and I am sure the Government would not have any intention, of following the British line in relation to the restrictions imposed by Britain on her internal economy.  But the plain fact in regard to this decision, whether it was inevitable or not, whether it could be avoided or not, is that its effect is going to be deflationary on our economy, the cost of living is going to go up and many effects will follow.  As far as the economy here is concerned, we have been in a period of deflation for far too long.  If living costs now advance, if we have to pay higher prices to people outside, this is bound to have a depressing effect.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, if price increases take place, as I believe they will, they are going to cause hardship to unemployed people, to old people, to widows, to pensioners, to workers and to people generally.  There is no good saying that a cost of living increase of two per cent may take place, or for the Minister and me to argue whether it is going to be two per cent or four per cent.  The plain fact is that immediately people are going to find themselves paying more for coal, petrol, wool and for a whole lot of other things.  That is going to affect the lot of the under-privileged and the less well off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view you are going to have these three effects.  You are going to have an adverse effect on our external balance of payments, a deflationary effect on the economy and, in particular, hardship caused to poorer sections. If that is a fair assessment of the effect of devaluation, it seems to me that, whatever other countries may be able to shrug it off, a small country like this <Col N="844" /> cannot afford to brush aside a situation of this kind as if it never happened and as if it is not going to affect us. New measures are now urgently required to get the economy moving again.  I have read carefully and listened carefully to what the Minister had to say.  I detected in the Minister's statement no sign whatsoever of any policy or any proposal to deal with the present state of our economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a moment.  It is not, in fact.  It is two per cent.  The balance is gone in discharging a deficit on our external payments which we might not have suffered.  The position is that the Minister is a member of a Government that have a great deal to answer for, a Government that by sheer incompetence brought this country on the appalling spending spree of 1964.  That was the period in which a home grown, fashioned and designed inflation was brought about by the Fianna Fáil administration.  That was followed by the panicky decisions taken in 1965 by a team of frightened Ministers who were appalled by the results of their own incompetence and took fright. They proceeded in 1965 to depress business, to bring about unemployment and to make the poor people pay for their mistakes.  That is what deflation means.</P>
      <P>The decisions taken in 1965 had their effect.  By the summer of 1966, the balance of payments had ceased to be the problem.  By 15 months ago the purpose for which the restrictions of 1965 were introduced had been accomplished.  Our balance of payment problem had ended.  Nevertheless, for the past 15 months, by inaction, by lack of leadership, by lack of a policy, this Government have allowed the economy to drift along stagnated and depressed.</P>

This body of economists, who have no axe to grind, made an objective study of the situation, and they indicted the Government in the clearest possible terms for the mistakes they have made, the mistakes they were making and for their failure to disclose any policy. They refer, on page 7, to the unstable boom which was allowed to develop in the early part of 1964 and to continue into the middle of 1965.  They go on to say that the increase in money earnings, the ninth wage round, could not be regarded as the sole cause of the boom:</P>
      <P>The very rapid rise in the Retail Sales Index in 1964 took place because Consumer Credit was allowed to rise <i>pari passu</i> with Industrial Earnings.  Had hire purchase controls been tightened and the growth of personal and professional advances been checked early in 1964, the rise in Personal Consumption as measured by the Retail Sales in that year would have been much more modest.</P>
      <P>They go on to refer to the deflationary measures then taken, which they say were too vigorous.  Then they criticise the Government not only for the steps that were taken which were too vigorous but for the fact that they were kept in operation too long, and they suggest that some easing was necessary.  This is an unbiased, unprejudiced, objective view of our economy by economists.  They end up by saying that official mistiming has aggravated if not indeed caused the economic difficulties of Ireland since 1964&mdash;official mistiming, mistiming in 1964, mistiming in 1965 to secure a deflation kept in operation too long, mistiming since.  Here we are at another juncture in our affairs.  Will there be more mistiming?  Will we look back at this decision in relation to devaluation and pass it by because the Minister is complacent about it, has no policy to pronounce and nothing to say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" /> The Minister talks about a 4.3 per cent growth rate this year.  I wonder how real that is.  We have converted an external deficit into an external surplus. It may be that in our present circumstances this was unnecessary and possibly undesirable.  However, I think it will be found on examination that the conversion of that deficit into a surplus absorbed whatever improvement in national output has taken place this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in national output has been absorbed in paying that deficit.  Now what should be done?  When we were still importing too much, when there was no devaluation, when things were difficult from a trading point of view, much more so than they are now, they called for a stimulus.  Nothing was done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What had been done?  Hire purchase restrictions have made no difference.  The removal of consumer credit has made no difference. There is now the added fact of devaluation, and in these circumstances, we feel that whatever case may have been made for a stimulus earlier than this, now it cannot be avoided.  Positive steps must now be taken and a definite stimulus must be given to the economy.  What should be done?  In our view, what is desirable from the economic point of view and what is socially necessary, in fact, coincide.  In our view, there should be an immediate decision to reduce taxation in relation to commodities and goods affected by increased prices. There should be an immediate decision to increase social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We urge the Minister to reduce forthwith the duty on petrol and hydrocarbon oil.  We think this is worth <Col N="847" /> doing.  If it is done, it will prevent an increase in costs going into distribution and will possibly prevent a dislocation in our whole cost structure.  Secondly, we believe the duty on tobacco should be reduced forthwith.  Tobacco is an element in the cost of living.  A reduction in the duty on tobacco could be made without prejudice to any longerterm policy in regard to tobacco.  Certainly this step should be taken to prevent an otherwise unavoidable increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we think the Minister should reduce interest rates.  For reasons which the Minister implied. and which are obvious, there is nothing very much the Minister can do about interest rates.  They have to be accepted.  But there can be no doubt that high interest rates and dear money will have an immediate effect on building costs and will put up the cost of building and, in that sense, make living costs dearer and higher.  Again the people affected will be those who have no bulwark, no defence.  We therefore suggest as a temporary measure that, while high interest rates continue, the Minister should subsidise interest rates in relation to housing.  It could be done.  It is not a very extreme step. It could be done either by utilising the money available at the moment for housing grants.  It has not been altered since 1948 when it stood at £275.  In fact £150 is taken in wholesale and turnover tax.  It does not go in most cases to the person for whom the house is being built but to the builder.  We suggest as one expedient that the interest rates should be subsidised in the interests of preventing a vast increase in building costs.</P>
    <P>I am reminded that in relation to building at the moment one-fifth of the materials for ordinary houses come from non-devaluing countries so there is urgency in that.  We urge the Minister to take his courage in his hands and to do this as an initial step to prevent devaluation corroding our economy at a time when we cannot afford it, and to prevent a ripple of a fresh increase in the cost of living causing more serious economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="848" /> Reduce the tax on petrol, reduce the tax on tobacco, and subsidise the interest rates&mdash;these are three things which could be done and which would have an immediate effect.  In addition, we believe the social welfare benefits should be increased forthwith by at least five per cent.  That should be done and it is necessary, because otherwise many poor people will feel the pinch and will be hurt.  We are aware that what we advocate is a reduction in taxation and an increase in Government expenditure.  We appreciate that if the Minister wished he could say: &ldquo;That cannot be done.&rdquo;  I do not believe the Minister will or that he should.  The time has come when we must be far more flexible than we have been with regard to economic policy.</P>
    <P>What we are advocating we believe to be necessary and desirable now, even if it will cost money, and even if it will reduce revenue and increase expenditure.  It is worth doing to tide us over the present situation.  It may be that in six months time the difficulties will have been overcome.  It may be that in six months time, we will have reached the situation in which devaluation has helped us and that we have got into markets with which we are increasing our export trade and costs have not gone up.  As the Minister pointed out, there is a real danger in the present situation.  If our costs go up, and if as a result of that, other things happen, our economy will suffer grievously.</P>
    <P>We suggest, therefore, that these measures should be taken, and that in the face of this kind of situation, it is essential to have a flexible approach. The idea that taxation and social welfare benefits and other things should be decided every 365 days, at every Budget, and that in between nothing can be done, is outmoded and no longer suited to the requirements of our situation.  The Government should be prepared to take a decision this month and to alter it, if necessary, next month.  A situation must be taken on the hop.  We cannot have a continuation of a situation in which the Research Institute can say that official mistiming has aggravated, if not caused, the economic difficulties of Ireland since 1964.  &ldquo;Mistiming&rdquo; is a <Col N="849" /> polite word for &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo;.  We cannot afford that.  We are in a grave situation now.</P>
    <P>I believe that we, as a small country, face fierce and growing competition from powerful economies in England and on the Continent that will tend to suck our people from us into their factories and elsewhere.  I believe that that is happening and continuing to happen; our people are being sucked away because we have not been flexible enough in our approach.  We have not had the kind of leadership we should have had; we have not had a Government that had courage and an honest dedication towards providing what should be the ultimate aim of any Government here&mdash;more jobs at home for Irish people and a better standard of living and better social conditions. We have had chops and changes by successive Fianna Fáil Governments; programmes announced and torn up; promises made and disregarded.  The result has been that year after year we slipped further and further down.  We are having more and more people unemployed and there is a general lack of confidence in the country.</P>
    <P>Let us not make a further mistake. Let us not allow this decision in relation to devaluation further to complicate our vulnerable economy.  I feel it can be avoided by a Minister and by a Government who know their minds and are prepared to act with courage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I say what I have noted here, I should like to say that all of us would go along with what Deputy T.F. O'Higgins has said in regard to a reduction of taxation on certain commodities, if we knew from what source the moneys were to come in order to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government must share a certain amount of blame in this whole matter of the devaluation of the pound and the confusion that undoubtedly exists in the minds of some people.  My view is that the fact that they did not initiate a debate in this House is an admission, possibly an unintentional admission, of our dependence on Britain because it is contrasted not alone with the announcement, <Col N="850" /> because they had an initial announcement by the British Government, but the speed with which they came before the public to talk to the public about devaluation, the necessity for it and the possible effects on the economy.  I do not know whether or not it was a coincidence that the Minister for Finance happened to be at a dinner of the Bankers' Institute on that particular night.  I suppose it would be fair to assume that he had information about this decision of the British Government to devalue early in the morning or at least early in the afternoon of the night on which he spoke to the bankers.  It was a pure coincidence that the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis  happened to be on some day last week where the Taoiseach made his comments about devaluation. Again, I say this is a reflection on the Government, something that they, for their own protection, should have been very, very careful about in coming immediately before the Irish people, not on the programme &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; to which I presume the Minister was invited.  He did not ask Telefís Éireann for time to talk to the Irish people.  It was the initiative of Telefís Éireann which was responsible for the various comments made by the Minister on that occasion.  I can quite understand, having been subjected to interview by different people on Telefís Éireann the difficulties of the Minister. I suppose he could only answer directly the questions he was asked but let me repeat&mdash;and I said this on another occasion&mdash;I do not say it with any venom or spite, he did appear to be casual.  It was not so much that he did not care but he appeared to minimise and to play down to the utmost extent devaluation and its effects on the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and I put down Private Notice questions for last Wednesday. I wonder whether, if we had not put down those questions, we would have had this discussion on devaluation.  It is regrettable and indicative of the attitude of the Government towards this House and towards the problem of devaluation to see that it is simply lumped in with the Estimate for the Department of Finance, while conativ <Col N="851" /> ceding that the major portion of the Minister's speech has been devoted to this particular subject.</P>

      <P>I have told the Minister about that and said that he had my sympathy more than anything else because, with all due respect to the programme, I do not think it was the proper programme for the Minister for Finance to talk to the Irish public on such an important subject as devaluation and its effects.</P>

      <P>When talking about the devaluation of the pound we should also be concerned with the devaluation by the Government of this House.  It seems&mdash;and this complaint has been made many times particularly in recent weeks&mdash;that all the important announcements are made outside the House.  I know Fianna Fáil are pretty comfortable and to a large extent smug in the majority they have at present, but it does not do the Fianna Fáil Party any good and it does not do our political institutions any good to make all those announcements outside the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that the Minister should have made a statement to the House, not necessarily even with discussion, on last Wednesday to acquaint the Members of this House, who are the public representatives, with the situation as he saw it and with regard to the possible effects of devaluation. However we seem to be complaining many times about this attitude, this disrespect for the House.  We do not seem to get anywhere, but let me say that this may be all right for a Government that have a majority but it is not doing the political institutions of this country any good and in the long run&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe as far as the Minister's speech is concerned that he did give all the information which I am sure he must have with regard to this problem.  We have been subjected&mdash;I suppose of necessity&mdash;to a lot of financial jargon by economists in the newspapers and by financial experts, jargon that means nothing to people who will be affected by devaluation.  I trust that the Minister in his reply and those who contribute to this debate will seriously discuss how this is going to affect ordinary <Col N="853" /> people and so far the effects have not been made known to them fully enough.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say as he said last week&mdash; this is something which impresses the ordinary people but which unfortunately is not true&mdash;in an interjection to somebody on this side &ldquo;Shut up&rdquo; or &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; or words to that effect.  I am not quoting him exactly and I withdraw that, if you like.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it is. The plain fact of the matter is that the purchasing power of the £ is very much diminished and anybody who would suggest that it is not is talking through his hat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that devaluation does not apply to everything.  There was a suggestion that our £ was worth 14.3 per cent less. That is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that suggestion was made.  I am talking about what the Minister is on record as saying&mdash;at least what I heard him say.  He will have an opportunity of <Col N="854" /> correcting what he says.  The fact is that our savings have been devalued.  Our external assets have been devalued to the extent of some millions of pounds. This is something, again, which will affect the way of life of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that is not right.  I did not interject when he was speaking.  I could have interjected when the Minister made certain comments about wages and said what I consider to be a stupid thing in his brief.  The Minister should not be interrupting me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not interrupt you again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, as far as I can calculate, and I have not the same financial advisors as the Minister, our external assets are now worth £70 million less <i>vis-à-vis</i> non-devalued countries.  If the Minister accepts that, there is no reason for me to explain why.  Our external assets in April, 1967, were worth approximately £260 million. It is very difficult to assess what private investment would be but one could agree that it would be between £300 million and £400 million, if we are to relate this to the private investment interest as disclosed to us.  As far as I can ascertain, in 1965, those amounted to something like £20 million. Therefore, it means that two weeks ago we had £700 million in external assets.  This is now devalued to the extent of £100 million to £70 million, as related to the countries who did not devalue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was the Minister, or some political correspondent in one of the British newspapers, who said that the Labour Party were against devaluation. We have to accept the inevitable and say that in the circumstances in which we are, the Government and the Minister had no option but to devalue.  If we had not done so, as has been described by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins and the Minister, we would have suffered grave consequences, particularly as far as my Party are concerned, in the matter of unemployment because we buy&mdash;again this may appear <Col N="855" /> to be repetitious&mdash;from non-devalued countries commodities which have been mentioned such as oil and tea and this means that our Irish £ is certainly worth less and this must affect our economy.  It must affect our wages, our incomes and our savings.  They are all worth less now.  There is no doubt in my mind about that.  I do not know how the Minister can prove otherwise.</P>
    <P>It has been assessed that there will be an increase of two per cent.  I do not know who made that assessment but devaluation will certainly mean an increase above two per cent in the cost of living.  Sometimes when figures are given by people who are supposed to be experts they are not correct.  In such things like the gross national product, in respect of forecasts in regard to increases in the cost of living and as regard forecasts in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion in terms of increased employment they have been just all wet.  We were told that there would be an increase in employment figures but it turned out in the first year that those figures were completely wrong.  I do not want to be pessimistic because it affects those who support me and it affects the whole Irish people.  I know the economic experts who advise the Department of Finance say that the increase will be two per cent but I would regard that as a very conservative figure indeed.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of debate in which the emphasis should be on our dependence on the British economy.  I do not think we should fool ourselves in this respect.  While accepting in the special circumstances we have to do what the Minister for Finance and the Government think, there was no alternative for us but to devalue.  We could have taken the same decision as New Zealand and devalued to a greater extent but that would have brought more difficulties for us.  We had to devalue at the same rate as the British Government.  In any case, as the Minister pointed out last week, it would have meant new legislation because we are committed to parity with the British £.  Therefore, we devalued one minute after Great Britain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> The tragic thing about all this is that we talk about an Irish Republic and freedom in this country.  We had no decision to make except the one we did make because we are bound by this statute of 1927, or whatever year it was.  In any case, it is there in the legislation of Dáil Éireann.  It is only a cod for anybody to assume that when Mr. Wilson decided to devalue there was a great huddling by the Irish Cabinet and we had to make this decision.  There was no other decision which we could make.  We had no choice in the matter.  It should be emphasised in this debate that we had no choice either but to increase our bank rate to 8½ per cent and also to adjust our lending rates.  Therefore, what is abundantly clear, and what should be brought home to the Irish people, is that in those two vital matters we are absolutely powerless.  If Great Britain devalues we have to do likewise, and if Great Britain reduces her bank rate we have to follow suit.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to reconcile or to relate the action we had to take when Britain took it, particularly with regard to devaluation.  The Minister can educate me on this in his reply and I shall be glad to listen to him. Great Britain is in grave difficulties, on her own admission.  Her balance of payments has been wrong since the war.  She piled up debts during the war years and could not pay them and this has been the problem of British Governments since 1945.  The British economy, it appears, is no longer competitive enough to correct that sort of situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find ourselves with the Minister telling us that our economy is booming, that we have no problem as far as our balance of payments is concerned, that we will have a surplus at the end of this year, our gross national product will increase by&mdash;and I can only take the statistician's word&mdash;4.1 to 4.3 per cent.  We were supposed to thank a booming economy when we were supposed to have an increase in overall employment in the past year or two of 3,500 persons.  All the signs are right for us.  All the signs, on their own admission, seem to be wrong for Britain and when they devalue the £, we have to follow suit.  There were the physical restrictions we experienced up to a few years ago.  British import rates were deliberately deflated.  We all agree with the Prime Minister that devaluation in their circumstances was <Col N="858" /> the best thing for them.  This, as far as Britain is concerned, will make imports dearer and exports cheaper.</P>
    <P>Let me say that these two decisions that have been taken can have a tremendous effect on the whole of our economy and on industry.  It can have an effect on housing through interest rates, on industry as far as investment is concerned, and I am talking about Irish industry, and on agriculture, not alone on credit, because I assume that the Agriculture Credit Corporation can increase their rates, but on the purchase of raw materials and fertilisers which are needed to get increased production.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for a layman, particularly on reading the financial experts, to understand that devaluation by Great Britain is the chance of a lifetime.  We are told it will mean more employment arising from manufactured exports.  We are told there should be an export boom and an end of the balance of payments crisis.  This will mean cutting the balance of payments by £500 million. not alone on devaluation but on all other restrictive measures which they have taken.</P>
    <P>What does it mean for us since we are depending on Great Britain in those matters which could, I suppose, mean more success for us?  I think the Minister was remiss when he did not explain to the House, so that the ordinary man in the street will understand him, how this could mean success for us, particularly in the matter of industrial employment.  That is why I say that the Minister did not do justice to himself and certainly did not do justice to the subject about which he was speaking when he stated on television, or in some speech, that we would take all this in our stride.  If the example of the Government in their approach to this is taking things in their stride, we will not get very far indeed.</P>
    <P>We all will agree that this is something over which many people have no control.  The inevitability of our economic dependence on Great Britain comes from their political and economic dominance of our finances for so long.  That is why our finances and economies are so closely linked.  In all <Col N="859" /> these years, we have had free movement of cattle and goods which is to our advantage but, unfortunately, we have also had free movement of labour in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>I do not know how true it is to say that the banks in this country are independent. They are independent to the extent that they are established as Irish companies.  Still they maintain large balances in Great Britain.  Many have head offices in Great Britain.  They maintain these large balances for trading purposes.  In 1928 we went through the process of issuing our own currency.  This was a departure that was clearly akin to post offices being green instead of red.  As far as this country is concerned in finance, the Bank of England is the boss.  We established a Central Bank which in recent times got a little more responsibility and control, only very little control, over the issue of credit.  There is still only one money market as far as these two countries are concerned, and that is London.  It is only foolish to pretend otherwise.</P>
    <P>Dependence, therefore, arises by reason of the fact that our trade is primarily, or to the greatest degree, with Great Britain.  One-half our imports are from Great Britain and threequarters of our exports are to Great Britain.  The Irish pound, prices, wages and profits all seem to be related one way or another to British rates.</P>
    <P>In view of all this, a decision not to devalue would result in increased unemployment because British imports would replace home-manufactured goods because these could be sent into this country at something like ten-15 per cent cheaper, and then you would have those engaged in the manufacture of similar articles in this country out of a job.  Our exports to Great Britain would be somewhat changed as well.</P>
    <P>There has been a litany, and I do not want to plug this litany any more, with regard to the effect of devaluation on prices.  This inevitably occurs.  It is suggested that there will be an increase of one penny on cigarettes and the price of petrol will go up&mdash;and this will affect our economy&mdash;we are told, by 2d. per <Col N="860" /> gallon.  These may be specific examples, but these are the things the people should be told so that they will know what the real value of their pound will be.  Petrol going up 2d per gallon will, in my view, affect all production.  It will affect generation of power and will be reflected in various ways, in bus fares or in transport of goods or livestock, or whatever you care to mention. It will have a cumulative effect and will be represented in many more ways than on the ordinary increase in the price of petrol.</P>
    <P>One can talk about electricity in the same manner.  I was surprised to learn that one-half of our electricity is generated by oil.  Electricity is used in a widespread way, in transport and so on, and this will have an effect not alone on the price of electricity but on other commodities as well.</P>
    <P>Coal has already been increased in price and one wonders whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce has sought an investigation into this increase to find out whether it is justified. We get 60 per cent of our coal from the USA and I understand a diminishing amount from Great Britain.  Therefore, the bulk of our coal will come from a country that has not devalued and this must have an effect on the cost of living.  Even though people say the effects will not be known until five or six months have passed, unless the Government are very careful and diligent in price control matters we shall see the effects in a very short time.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, there is a high amount of Irish wheat in our bread but this item will also be increased in price and will have an impact on the cost of living of people in the lower income bracket.  Freight charges have already gone up and I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce has satisfied himself that these increases were justified.  The price of cloth will be affected because bulk wool for the manufacture of our clothing comes from Australia which has not devalued even though it is one of the Commonwealth countries.</P>
    <P>I must speak about fertilisers, <Col N="861" /> whether they be nitrogenous or otherwise. All the raw material comes from countries other than those which have devalued.  This is an important factor. When people say that we get a lot of our raw materials from Britain they forget that these, in turn, are imported by Britain, again from countries that have not devalued.  People are concerned about mortgage rates, about interest on loans they have negotiated for house building.  Will these be increased and if so by how much?</P>
    <P>If somebody suggests that even these few items will increase the cost of living index figure by only two per cent, I shall find it extremely difficult to believe him.  The Minister was vocal today&mdash;he did not shout; he was his usual calm self&mdash;about wages and though he did not use the drophammer like his friend the Minister for Labour did during the weekend, there was the suggestion that there should be restraint as far as wages are concerned.  I am sure he knows the association between the trade union movement in this country and Britain. In his statement, the Minister used a press release on behalf of the British TUC, which I quote:</P>
    <P>They will not regard increases in prices arising from the reduced external purchasing power of the pound as constituting in themselves justification for increases in wages.</P>
    <P>I do not know how far the Minister depends on that as an exhortation to Irish workers, not to seek to compensate themselves for increases arising out of devaluation but for increases that may have happened since the last rise.  The Minister's quotation from the British TUC statement may not have been given in full and it certainly does not suggest to me that there will be a voluntary wage freeze by the British trade unions.  I am not one who wishes to provoke or to promote any discord. I know the trade union movement in this country, perhaps not as well as my colleagues behind me, and I am aware that they know their business well; and if the Minister for Labour, Deputy Hillery, is to approach the trade union movement in the way he did last week, by way of personalities, <Col N="862" /> the trade union movement will find it very difficult to co-operate with somebody who, from what he said, appears to be completely antagonistic to the movement.</P>
    <P>The Minister today spoke about wages and said there should be restraint. He did not threaten a wage freeze or a standstill, but has he thought about the freezing of profits to pre-devaluation levels?  This is something the Government should consider if they are seriously concerned about holding the line and about exhorting the workers not to seek increases.  It is true to say that there has been an increase in production and consequential increases in incomes.  This is so but we should not be ostriches and bury our heads in the sand from the fact that there are people working for £8 and £9 per week and that there are many thousands who have not the £12 10s 0d per week which one of the leaders of the trade union movement has suggested should be a minimum wage.</P>
    <P>It is useless to talk about a blanket freeze in this country while there are people living on sub-standard wages which certainly do not give them a decent standard of living.  We should be concerned in this debate about the effects of devaluation on the man with a wife and one child who can get only 30/- a week home assistance.  I am sure Deputies, particularly those who are also local representatives, know that in this country there are families living on a couple of pounds a week.  This is not entirely the fault of the Government: to some extent also it is the fault of local authorities.</P>
    <P>These are things we prefer to sweep under the carpet.  They are problems we should consider when talking about incomes and the depreciation in the value of the pound.  I am not satisfied, and neither are my Party, that the price control machinery established under Act of this Parliament by Deputy Hillery as Minister for Industry and Commerce, is absolutely effective.  I do not know what was in the mind of the Government when they introduced this machinery.  We had been urging them for a long time to introduce it and everybody in the House was not <Col N="863" /> enthusiastic about price control.  However, we got it but I do not think the section in the Department are sufficiently equipped with officers to do the work efficiently.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I wish to emphasise at this stage, that is, that I am very suspicious about this two per cent increase.  Maybe as it is calculated, it should only be two per cent, but, when these little traders put on their mean increases, it will be found that the cost of living creeps up by three to 3½, four to 4½ or five per cent.  We believe there should be stricter penalties for overcharging.  The Minister for Finance talked about freezing wages, and about restriction on dividend payments, which is something the Danish Government have done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Be that as it may, the people who will suffer most are those in receipt of social welfare and local authority assistance.  Immediate steps should be taken to compensate these people.  The people on the £2 12s 6d a week and the people with four or five in family in receipt of £7 or £8 a week should be helped at least to the extent of compensating them with an extra 3/- or 4/- a week.  Mark you, I say &ldquo;at least&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was, I think, thinking <Col N="864" /> in terms of exports when he talked about taking this devaluation in our stride and the advantage it would be to us to have exports to countries which have not devalued because they would get the products at a much cheaper rate.  Are we certain this will be accepted by Irish industry?  Are we certain new markets will be exploited by Irish industry?  We had an example in recent years when Irish industry would not even bother to apply for the various grants offered in order to rationalise industry or to improve their premises.  There must be an urgent drive, in my opinion, to ensure that this new market, this new outlet, will in fact be availed of by Irish manufacturers and Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>We must remember, too, that there may be a slight recession as far as the British market is concerned because Britain has imposed certain credit restrictions.  We must remember that they hope to cut down on their unfavourable balance of trade by about £500 million.  I do not think they will make any particular exception of any country.  That could mean that we may suffer a diminution in our exports to the British market.</P>
    <P>Again, with regard to the Minister's reference to new outlets in Europe and in the United States of America, unless we reorganise our whole marketing system and our whole approach, we will not get any part of these markets. We do not, I believe, make sufficient use of our embassies.  This has been referred to on previous occasions.  It may seem to be something of a chestnut, but we do not believe it is.  I will criticise neither our embassies nor our ambassadors, but I think they could be better engaged.  It is difficult to know exactly what they are doing, beyond collecting information for the Minister for External Affairs to enable the Government to make certain judgments and decide on our position <i>vis-à-vis</i> various world events.  If necessary, we should enlarge our embassies in certain selected areas to ensure that new markets are found for Irish products and that these Irish products are pushed in those markets.  Córas Tráchtála, too, should be employed to a far greater extent in this direction.  We now have <Col N="865" /> a chance to diversify our trade and, in my opinion, a greater diversification of our trade would lessen our dependence on Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We are caught up now with Britain because economically we have to live with it.  If we could get into other markets, we would not be dependent upon Britain to the extent that we must send 70 to 75 per cent of our goods there and must take in return a certain amount of her exports. This is the root cause of all our ills and, unless we make a serious effort to diversify our trade, then, if Britain devalues in five, seven or ten years time, we shall likewise have to devalue.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned some time ago the establishment of an Irish money market.  I do not know a great deal about money markets.  Indeed, this is something that has bewildered people in the past few days.  They have been puzzled by the frantic buying and selling of gold.  They have been mesmerised by what has gone on.  It seems to me that most decisions are made in the money markets of the world.  It is in these markets the economy can be affected by a move this way, that way or the other way.  The concern of the Central Bank for the establishment of an Irish money markets was brought to my notice.  There may be such a market, but it is a very weak one.  I do not know what impact it has on Government decisions or on the economy generally, but it seems that the Central Bank are concerning themselves with the possibility of the creation of an Irish money market. They have established a committee to examine the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should seriously concern himself about this matter.  I am told that he is not particularly pally with the Economic and Social Research Institute to which Deputy T.F. O'Higgins referred earlier; I believe the Minister had occasion to rap them. However, that is neither here nor there, but in one of their articles in January, 1967, a gentleman by the name of John Hein gives very good reasons why <Col N="866" /> there should be an Irish money market; he points out the enormous advantages there would be in the establishment of such a market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh yes.  This is arising out of the recommendation of the Central Bank?  Yes.  That is true.  It does seem, in any case, rather silly that Irish Institutions, industrial and commercial concerns, should have to go to Britain to borrow money, sometimes large sums of money, in one case up to about £3 million, while, on the other hand.  Irish banking institutions, insurance corporations and so on invest money in London.  Therefore, we borrow in a London money market and invest in a London money market.  I do not know whether or not it would be possible to establish a money market that would be concerned with shortterm loans.  In any case, the time has come for us to try to be a little more independent than we are and not to be always dependent on the London Stock Exchange or London money market.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether or not this is the opportune time to talk about various other things but there have been boasts recently by the various Ministers and by the Taoiseach of the progress we have made in this year, 1967.  Again, let me say, as I always say on occasions like this, this is not reflected in employment.  It certainly is not reflected in the unemployment figures published from week to week. We are now in the funny position that the First Programme for Economic Expansion is over and done with&mdash;I do not know that it completed its term&mdash; the Second Programme has been abandoned&mdash;that fell flat on its face and as far as plans or programmes for jobs were concerned it failed dismally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, about this Third Programme, we are told that it will be framed in <Col N="867" /> accordance with the effects of Ireland's membership of the European Economic Community.  I do not know for how long or how many times the General has to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach today said that this was not the end, that there is still going to be discussion before Christmas and then we will know whether or not we will get into the EEC or whether or not France will allow us in.  I think the Taoiseach still clings vainly to the wish expressed by his predecessor and by himself that we would be a member of the Community by 1970.  Now we have the diversion of devaluation.  It used to be the Second Programme for Economic Expansion; then it was the EEC. It is very difficult to know what road the Government are travelling as far as general economic and social development is concerned.</P>
    <P>It has been correctly stated by Deputy Dunne in a recent television discussion with the Minister that programmes are no good without plans. This is where the Government have fallen down with their First and Second Programmes.  With the best intentions in the world, they wanted these things to happen but it was presumptuous on their part to have a programme without a plan.  This Government have never had a real plan for industry, agriculture or social welfare.  Even if their programme succeeded and productivity were to arrive at a certain figure and there was a certain amount of accumulated wealth, the Government did not have a social plan, and in their First and Second Programmes they did not state in any sort of detail what exactly was their plan for housing, education and the various other facets of our society.  They will fall down again in connection with their Third Programme unless it is a programme with a plan.</P>
    <P>I do not think they should wait for de Gaulle to change his mind.  It is very difficult to know whether this is de Gaulle's mind, the mind of the French Cabinet or the mind of the French people.  I assume that General de Gaulle is interpreting the mind of the French Government and people.  It <Col N="868" /> seems to me that we are not going to be a full member in the near future.  I do not know what the Government's attitude is to a form of association or what the attitude of the British Government is to the suggestion that there should be a form of association.  Again, the House has not been properly informed on all this and the debate that we asked for and got in July last with regard to our application for membership of the EEC was very unsatisfactory in that the Taoiseach did not tell us what we believed he knew.  Therefore, I think we should go about our Third Programme in an independent way in order to try to get the things the Second Programme failed to achieve.</P>
    <P>I know the difficulties of the Government. If we are offered associate membership and Britain is offered associate membership and Britain refuses to accept associate membership, what do we do then?  Do we have to negotiate a further trade agreement with Great Britain whilst also maintaining some sort of association with the six or seven countries in Europe?  I believe also that in the framing of this Third Programme&mdash;I presume it will be called &ldquo;for Economic Expansion&rdquo;&mdash;the Government will have regard to the NIEC Report on Full Employment.  There the problem is detailed very well.  Here is the problem for the Government as far as full employment is concerned.  It is not unreasonable to say that it is the responsibility of the Government to produce, not alone a programme, but a plan in order to ensure that we will have full employment in the foreseeable future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It was arranged that this debate would cover the events that took place some ten days ago but before going on to that general matter I want to refer to one thing that the Minister mentioned at the outset of his speech, indicating the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate of last year and what is required this year.  It seems to me that the special regional development fund <Col N="869" /> is merely another name for a thing introduced before and called a national development fund, which, as the Minister knows, sounded very well and, in fact, won for Fianna Fáil a by-election in East Galway and thereafter failed miserably to live up to the promise that was given in relation to it by the then Taoiseach one night in Ballinasloe.  I find it difficult to see in relation to the fund that is now being indicated any substantial difference.  As far as I can understand the Minister's point of view, and I looked at him on Sunday evening week on television and listened to what he said in this House by way of answer to questions and have read his speech with care now and have read his other pronouncements&mdash;I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I think that any Government must stand to be judged, and must accept judgment, on the basis of an examination of how it treats the least advantageously-placed of the citizens of the country it governs.  By this yardstick, the present Administration must surely, before any tribunal of public opinion, offer no plea to the charge of neglect other than &ldquo;guilty&rdquo;. Last week, we had the Minister for Labour dilating at some length upon his concern for the disabled and, before him, we had, I think, Deputy Moore. Many months ago, in the spring of the year, when I first introduced this Bill. we had a procession, a somewhat small procession I will admit.  one might almost call it a picket, of Fianna Fáil Deputies contributing to the debate and displaying an attitude of mind on this question of the treatment of the disabled which can be summarised only as patronising.  The word &ldquo;charity&rdquo; was bandied around amongst them.  If there is one thing which emerges from life's experience it is this: always distrust a man who talks about charity because the charitable man does not talk about it.  But we had that word and we had a lot of explanations on behalf of the disabled as to why they would prefer&mdash;this was the proposition &mdash;that there should not be any State regulation in matters concerning their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;pride&rdquo; was used.  It was reiterated that disabled people are proud people.  It was a misuse of English but one knows that what was intended was that they are a dignified people, as every human being is&mdash;and <Col N="871" /> they no more, nor would they claim to be, than any other.  They have a natural desire to be regarded as what they are, human beings.  They have a natural desire for what is mentioned in that document which is framed a few yards down from us in the hall wherein is proclaimed the right of people to equal rights and equal opportunities.</P>
    <P>It often strikes me, and I am sure it strikes many others, that these phrases have been reduced to mockery and have been employed simply for the purpose of maintenance in power of privilege and selfishness.  This thought is driven home every day in the mind of every person who thinks of the way the disabled people of Ireland are being and have been treated by this Government.  I was going to use the <i>cliché</i> of &ldquo;successive governments&rdquo; but any governments which have been in existence here since 1932 have been of a very short-lived and temporary nature.  We have had almost continuous autocratic single-Party rule since 1932. It may be argued that that has been by consent of the people.  It has, of course, been by consent of people misled, persuaded, cajoled, bribed, intimidated and generally led astray by one means or another.</P>
    <P>I have glanced through the expensively-produced document which I hold here in my hand and on which the members of the Government Party will have cast an eye during the past week &mdash;the clár of the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis. I have sought in the clár through every sentence, every clause and every phrase to discover some mention of concern for the disabled of our country. I failed to find, in this glossy, Madison Avenue production, anything to that effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Ceann Comhairle so rightly says, we are dealing here with the serious matter of disabled persons and, indeed, with the Bill which I have been trying to persuade the House to accept, to improve their conditions.  I merely mention the complete absence of any reference to these the most distressed of our people from the list of matters discussed at what I suppose might be called the &ldquo;father organisation&rdquo; of our Government. It might be called that but, of course, it is not.  However, we will describe it as such.  I notice, too that there was a reference to creating a Fianna <Col N="873" /> Fáil youth organisation, which must have sent shudders down the backs of a few members of the Cabinet.  Nothing at all in that and nothing in the Minister's speech last week to give any hope to these people that they could look forward to a better life.</P>
      <P>While I criticise what the Fianna Fáil speakers said on the matter, I do thank them individually for contributing to the debate.  I thank each and every one of the handful of people who found the time to say a few words about this important question of the treatment of the disabled.  Whether they accept my ideas or not is irrelevant in this connection.  They showed some concern and in some cases where perhaps they made use of the debate to boast a little bit about their own activities that was forgivable and at least they took the trouble to come in.  Of the 140 Members of this House it is a pretty poor reflection of the concern of the Dáil as a whole that only 15 had anything to say.  This, too, reflects a general malaise throughout the whole of society and it is not peculiar to Ireland so far as my reading can discover. It is common to Europe that Parliaments or Governments do not seem to want even to talk very much about disabled people or their problems or about plans about how their difficulties can be met.  In a way it is a kind of evidence of the growing selfishness which seems to be a concomitant of affluence or the approach of affluence, a disregard for the conditions of other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate may be summed up as a discussion on the conflict between the principle of organised State regulation of employment to ensure that disabled people will get a living in their own land, in other words, socialism, or the welfare State, between that idea and that of the flagday mentality.  I know that every effort will be made to depict me as somebody attacking the voluntary organisations.  I want to say that I have no such intention. I know a bit about the voluntary organisations.  I have seen some of the work some of them do and I certainly feel a personal debt to such people for the difficulties they face and the courage <Col N="874" /> and tremendous humanity they bring to the job.  I am not attacking the voluntary organisations in any shape or form nor will I accept that impeachment from any source, although I know those who are ill-intentioned will try to make this point in their attack on the Bill.  In fact, the Minister by inference almost suggested that; he talked about compulsion as against voluntary effort.  I am concerned with a principle here, the principle of whether or not society is going to accept its obligation to do what should be done for the most necessitous section of the community or whether we are going to leave that to chance, to goodwill, to use the Minister's word. Goodwill is all right, a wonderful thing, but much more beneficial legislation has been brought into existence by public indignation than by goodwill. One would wish it could be otherwise but the history of every country proves the contrary.  It is only when people become incensed at injustice and laws are brought in to prevent that injustice, that some approximation of equity is achieved.</P>
    <P>I am not claiming for this Bill that it is going to answer all the problems of disabled people nor do I say that it is within the competence of the human mind to produce laws which will solve every human predicament, nor will it ever be.  If such a state of affairs were achievable life would have no meaning whatsoever.  We will always be faced with challenges even if we do, eventually, not perhaps in our time, but in times to come, even out all the various economic problems that bedevil our society, we will still have vast and troublesome problems to be solved, problems relating to health, mental illness and the various ills of that nature which will constitute a challenge to be met.</P>
    <P>Here we have an immediate problem, a relatively simple one, that of asking whether we should go on with the old haphazard method of letting the night fall, as it were, upon the disabled any way it likes and mouthing platitudes about our concern for them, leaving it to a few well-intentioned people to face what are, in fact, insurmountable <Col N="875" /> odds by establishing homes and workshops and so on and by gathering money by any means which come into their heads and whether we should do so as a conscious act by using the tools of social organisations at hand so readily for us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton, in a brief intervention at the start of our discussion, said:</P>
    <P>There is not much charity in industry and commerce today, either here or elsewhere, because industry has to compete and it can only compete without raising prices if it gets the same output from the disabled person and gets that output at the same price as from the ordinary fit employee. </P>
    <P>Unwittingly or not, Deputy Clinton in that sentence summed up and &ldquo;kernelised&rdquo;, as it were, the difference of approach which distinguishes those of us here from the rest of Dáil Éireann.  We do not consider it is good enough to say that an employer's social responsibility ends with securing an answer to the question: Will this man make money for me or not?  That is the bald, naked and cruel stand taken by the apologists for the <i>status quo</i>, for having things as they are; by the &ldquo;gradualists&rdquo;, such as the Minister, who say: &ldquo;Take it easy and voluntary effort will solve everything in the sweet bye and bye&rdquo;; for those who say: &ldquo;It is not fair to an employer that he should be compelled by law to take into his employment a person who manifestly will not be able to make as much money for him as an ablebodied man.&rdquo;  This is a man-made concept which has no basis in justice.  It is a selfish attitude and absolves completely the individual who has the fortune, and it is largely fortune, to be in the position of having a lot of other human beings working for him.  It may be argued, and I have heard it argued on television, where we hear practically every darn thing argued nowadays&mdash;&mdash;</P>

You have very successfully put me off a fruitful train of thought.  I feel very deeply about this superficial notion which has no basis in common humanity.  I do not appeal any higher than that. Unlike others, I am not going to quote from Papal Encyclicals, nor am I even going to quote from that dull old ham, Charlie Marx, who is beating all others as a bill-topper in the Montrose Follies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be put in the position of castigating any free expression of opinion at Montrose. It is only right that there should be. I am not going to lean on those arguments for what I have to say here.  I am basing it upon consideration of pure and simple humanity, which is what I find most abundant around this city.  There should be a little thought given by the Minister and others, including possibly Deputy Clinton. However, Deputy Clinton's contribution was not long enough to make it clear how he stands on this proposition I have been attempting to adumbrate: that the sole test of an employer's position or worthiness should not be his ability to employ people out of whom he can make money.  To put it another way, if a man or woman is fortunate enough to have a number of other human beings working for him or her&mdash;I emphasise &ldquo;fortunate&rdquo;<Col N="877" /> because there is a great deal of luck in this game&mdash;if such a person has achieved the position of being an employer by his or her own efforts, in the society in which we live it simply means they have been cleverer than other people perhaps.  If they are cleverer than other people, it is not of their own creation.  They were born that way.  It comes to them from countless generations.  There is luck in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More of them make money simply by speculation, which does not require a great deal of grey matter but invariably requires, it seems, an unlimited supply of ruthlessness and disregard for others. More of them are born with not only silver but golden mink-covered spoons in their mouths&mdash;a very unpleasant experience, I am sure, for any infant but nonetheless they seem to get over it.  Many of them have accents which clearly betray that that was their origin. However, they come to be in the position of being employers; I am not making any criticism of the fact that they find themselves in that situation. No matter what sort of society we have, we will have the managerial class anyway. It will always be with us.  I do not hold with the notion that all they have to do is be what is known as good business men.  I have often seen the term &ldquo;good business man&rdquo; used to describe somebody who is just slicker than somebody else.  This is the stage at which the Government must make their presence felt by saying to employers as a body: &ldquo;Perhaps conditions have so formed you that you see it as your sole duty and responsibility only to employ people so that they will make money for you, and that you have no other responsibility in life but that.&rdquo;  The Government, no matter what Government and no matter in what country, surely should in such circumstances act as the social conscience of the nation and say: &ldquo;There is more to life than this.  The people who are born disabled are entitled to live the same as people who have the good luck to be born with all their faculties.  It is not just because we cannot make money out of them that they are to be denied a job.&rdquo;  What the Government are saying is: &ldquo;Let us see <Col N="878" /> if we can persuade those by voluntary effort to take up the tremendous amount of slack that there is in this country in regard to the numbers of disabled people who have no work and who face utter despair.&rdquo;  We have all known moments of depression in life: that is human nature.  I am sure the Minister for Labour will tell us it is a necessary part of the human make-up that we should.  We cannot be high all the time, though judging by the activities of some members of the Government, one would think that not everybody is persuaded of that, but the sensible people believe it.</P>
    <P>Let us think of what must face the average person who is disabled, who has no prospect of a job, who is compelled to wear his disablement like a badge, if it is obvious.  Every time he goes out, he is seen and known.  If he goes looking for a job and there are others offering, it is a sure thing that he will not get it.  As for the person whose disability is not apparent, his case may be even worse, because few will have sympathy with him, whether it is a physical disability or a mental one.  In fact, it was the common comment of employers until the advent of the great trade union movement that such people were malingerers, until &ldquo;Jim&rdquo; came here and taught them the difference.</P>
    <P>Look at the despair disabled people face and visualise their reaction when the Government say: &ldquo;We are going to encourage voluntary effort to get you placed in jobs, but we are not going to take any steps to compel anybody to make vacancies available for you.&rdquo; The Government must be aware that in the Civil Service there are countless jobs of a clerical, semi-clerical or manual nature, which could be filled by people who are, on the face of it, disabled.  Surely the Minister could have met me at least half way by saying: &ldquo;All right; we shall make this progressive step at least.&rdquo;  Members of his own Party speaking in the House recommended it to him.  I think Deputy de Valera gave favourable mention to the idea of making employment at certain levels in the Civil Service available to a percentage of disabled people.  However, <Col N="879" /> the Minister did not say that.  What he did say in the course of his intervention last week was that he had set up a committee of a number of prominent people&mdash;very worthy people they are, may I say, because I happen to have the fortune to know one or two of them, experts in their field&mdash;to investigate this thing.  This thing does not need investigation.  What investigation is necessary?  He set up the committee in May and we are now coming up to Christmas.  What revolution would it cause in the Irish Civil Service if you were to give three or five per cent of certain types of jobs to disabled people who would qualify for them? Does this need a committee?  For so young a man as the Minister to apply such a brake to a simple idea like this betokens ill for this country.  The Minister did not make that offer.</P>
    <P>At the moment disabled people get 47/6d a week, after a means test, and that applies to all classes of disabled people, impossible for me to enumerate.  The Minister, as a medical man, would be far better able to instance the various forms of disablement than I would.  However, looking at a list one gets the impression that the kinds of ailments that can cripple people and make them fall into the category of being disabled are countless. Not the least worrying or troublesome to any social worker would be that of the mentally handicapped, which is a subject the fringe of which we have only touched so far, but happily we seem to be making some progress now in that matter, because we have an excellent man in Dublin in the person of Dr. Ivor Browne; and let me say also in this field we have working a man with a very keen social conscience, of which we in this House have reason to be aware, in Dr. Noel Browne, as well as, of course, Dr. Moore of St. Patrick's, who has a wealth of experience behind him and who is well known as an expert in this field.  There is some hope that we are beginning to examine this problem, because no matter what we try to do in our time in the provision of the first essentials, the tools for the job, namely, the provision <Col N="880" /> of proper buildings for the mentally ill, the solution of that appalling social problem is something which, while we would hope to see it, we shall not see in our time.  However, with the advance of knowledge and enlightenment, please God, we shall move towards it.</P>
    <P>As regards the number of people in this country who are getting 47/6d per week and living on it, it was said in reply to a Dáil Question early this year that there were 18,699 disabled people, and of those, only 161 undergoing rehabilitation.  One of the difficulties which those of us who are on health authorities come up against is that we find that deductions are made from this miserable allowance&mdash;it cannot be described in any other terms and this is a devalued 47/6d now&mdash;when such people are confined to hospital.  To my mind that is cheese-paring of a most unworthy kind.  However, that is a matter for Social Welfare.  We were told that the price of coal has gone up. It has yet to be seen whether this is justified.  I want to take every step open to me to get the Minister for Industry and Commerce to go into the matter of whether it is justified.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>After Deputy Clinton had concluded his kindly contribution we had Deputy Wyse of Cork who said in his first sentence that he agreed with the principle of my proposal and then proceeded to attack the proposal with all the weapons at his command.  One of the troubles about politicians, and especially less experienced politicians, is that they have the illusion that they can ride two horses successfully.  Unless you are an accomplished circus hand <Col N="881" /> such a feat is impossible, as they will find in time.  You cannot be for the principle of a Bill, and be against it at the same time.  I notice how skilful they were in the course of the contributions which were made by those members of the Government Party who found themselves in the dilemma that their hearts were, as they say, in the right place, and were persuaded that it was only right and proper that this should be done, and managed by a process of inverted reasoning to twist the whole idea of the Bill into something which was at no time intended.</P>
    <P>At column 249, volume 227 of the Official Report of 8th March Deputy Wyse said:</P>
    <P>It is like going to a physically handicapped person, who is a very proud person, and saying to him: &ldquo;Look, it is hopeless; we cannot find employment for you; we will just have to compel an employer to employ you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know if they order things that way in Cork.  We do it with more grace in the capital city.  Anyone who would entertain that attitude of mind, let alone use those words to a handicapped person, is not fit to talk to such people. You see how the intention can be twisted just the same, or an effort can be made to twist the intention of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Gibbons made a very good contribution to the discussion and being a medical man he would have an insight into the problem.  At column 258 of the same volume he said:</P>
    <P>I indicated my interest in this problem last year when I spoke on the Estimate for the Department of Health.  I mentioned that I thought the Government should make a start on employing disabled people and I suggested some of those people should be taken into the Civil Service. I then thought, and I still think, that there are many people rejected for various jobs in the Civil Service because of health conditions, particularly heart and chest conditions, which would not prevent them from working efficiently there.</P>
    <P>That is a very useful contribution to <Col N="882" /> the discussion.  Was it taken up by the Minister?  Again, it was brushed aside. I wonder why does the Minister adopt this attitude?  Is it that he has fallen a victim to the dread disease which was so obvious in all his predecessors of thinking that nothing good may appear to come out of Dáil Éireann unless it bears the imprimatur of the Fianna Fáil Party?</P>

In order to put it on the record that someone was doing roughly the same thing as the Minister is allegedly doing, the Minister for Industry and Commerce could be described as the Minister's predecessor. Is that his attitude, because it seems to be?  Over the weekend he even sought to interfere with the rights of trade unions to take steps to ensure that their interests are looked after in Dáil Éireann.</P>

In any event, will the Minister say to me now that he will do this simple thing, I wonder?  It is simply a question of making available for disabled people a percentage of employment in suitable jobs in the Civil Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister is misinformed. That is completely in conflict with what I am told by an authoritative organisation.  If you say trained and awaiting a job, of course, the numbers may deliberately be kept down by not training people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is ridiculous. If it needs training and it does need a certain amount of training these people are peculiarly adaptable to this kind of work, as the Minister knows, and they make a great success of it.  I understand that the total number of blind people is 7,000 and out of that we employ 16 in the Government service as telephonists.  It is not good enough.  I think we should make a better effort.  I am not suggesting there is anything like 7,000 capable of the work but certainly a much better effort than that is called for.</P>
      <P>We had some discussion last week on the National Council for the Blind. My information is that those are well-disposed people and some of them, in fact, employ handicapped people themselves which is all to the good and a very excellent thing.  I would not want to take anything from it or from anyone entitled to any credit.  However, the National Council for the Blind is in a somewhat different position to a trade union for the blind.  It is largely composed of people who are in a position to employ others and there is a slight trace of paternalism about their activities.  Many people say there is nothing wrong with that but that would not be my view.  I mean it is not sufficient just to leave it at that.  I am not saying that the National Council for the Blind should be abolished, but it is not sufficient that the whole thing should be left at that stage, a sort of <i>laissez faire</i> attitude, leave it to those people and they will do the job.  As time goes on things will improve.  As time goes on they will not, they will disimprove.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to bring something to the Minister's notice.  Up to, I think, four years ago in Britain the placement of blind people in this kind of employment was looked after by a royal <Col N="885" /> society whose functions roughly coincided with those of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland.  In over 20 years they placed in employment 2,000 blind people&mdash;not a bad effort for a voluntary organisation, quite laudable.  However, in the four years since this function of placing blind people in this kind of employment was taken over by the State in Britain, 5,000 people have been placed. That is more than twice the number. Therefore, the argument about the effectiveness of voluntary as against what the Minister chooses to describe as compulsory activity is loaded in favour of the State taking the initiative.</P>
    <P>There is an awful lot of codology talked about compulsion.  One of the most popular public house discussions is that you cannot compel Irishmen to do what they do not want to do.  I think this is a myth.  I am not arguing that there should be compulsion, but this idea of compulsion being particularly distasteful to Irish people is not true.  Irish people find it just as distasteful as the people of any other country, no more and no less.  Compulsion is a dirty word.  It is associated with making people do things they do not want to do.  As I mentioned previously, if one took out of the whole corpus of law any mention of sanctions how many people would obey the law? How many do so voluntarily?  Is there not some form of penalty inherent in every law that is passed&mdash;that if it is not observed then the person who does not observe it will, in some way, have his liberty curtailed or suffer financially or otherwise?  Is this to be described as compulsion?  I do not think that is the proper term to apply to it at all.</P>
    <P>In any event, laws which are made are made to meet the wishes of the majority of the people and the majority will, very often, has to be imposed by using means which are loosely described as compulsion, very often unpleasant means.  You may find the minority in violent opposition to the will of the majority as has been known in our history.  Those who are compelled to obey the law describe the law as compulsion and describe it in derogatory terms.  Those who have to <Col N="886" /> implement the law on behalf of the majority of the people invariably describe it as taking the necessary steps to make the law effective.  Playing around with this emotional word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; is really dodging the issue.  If there is all that goodwill the Minister was talking about amongst employers, so far as the treatment of the disabled is concerned, it would never be necessary to invoke the law against it, because the number of people, the number of employers who would be affected, in the first instance, by the Bill, would be limited and the number of disabled workers that such employers would be required by law to take on could surely be absorbed by the goodwill, of which the Minister claims there is a wealth floating about so that talking of compulsion <i>versus</i> the moryah of free society which is a laugh, is really very irrelevant and simply shows to me at any rate that the Minister was hard put to get an argument against this Bill of mine.</P>
    <P>State interference, of course, is another phrase which was used by Deputy Barrett.  You do not hear of private interference.  If it is done by private employers, that is initiative or enterprise.  All those terms are, as I say, used purely towards an end, the end being to, I do not say consciously, do harm to disabled people.  It does in the kind of society in which we live, where some people do extraordinarily well and others do extraordinarily badly.  The resistance towards any change in such a society is the provocation for those remarks by people who talk of State interference and such like.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera in one of his customary long and laboured contributions spoke very much as a lawyer with considerable knowledge of court actions as they related, although he did not mention it, it was obvious to anybody who knows the Deputy, to disabled people.  His speech is a very good example of why lawyers as a class should be kept as far away as possible from the areas in which the law is made because they are liable to complicate it and confuse issues because of the very nature of their calling and because of the particular <Col N="887" /> thought they bring to the consideration of any simple question.  He said at column 555, volume 227, of the Official Report for 14th March:</P>
    <P>This is the great difficulty of the socialistic approach&mdash;it hurts so many individuals although it does so much for the community at large.</P>
    <P>That to me is one of the best arguments that ever was made in favour of a Bill of this kind or of socialism.  Surely the Dáil must be concerned with the community at large.  If we are not going to make laws, if we are going to refuse to make laws, because the privileged position of some individuals will be impaired, we have not any right to call ourselves a Parliament and we certainly have not got a right to say that we represent the people of this country.</P>
    <P>I know there has not been a great deal of publicity about this Bill nor has there been a great deal of interest shown in it in the House but the basic thing is that if one could consult&mdash;I am convinced of this&mdash;the ordinary people of Ireland on the merits of this Bill they would be overwhelmingly in favour of it.  It is being held up because it is an assault on the citizens' privilege, because it is initially asking, demanding, making it imperative on a privileged group to sacrifice some of their accumulated status and wealth in society for the benefit of the less fortunate.</P>
    <P>The Dáil should legislate for the community at large.  It is impossible for it to legislate for everybody or to pass legislation which will be acceptable to everybody.  No human institution ever succeeded in doing that and despite the efforts of certain noted Members of this House, not even individual TDs have succeeded in doing so, although some of them, God knows, have made fairly valorous attempts at being all things to all men.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera went on so much that he took up nearly the whole of Private Members' time, which he was entitled to, of course.  That is the great beauty of a private Bill.  One can talk on it for hours or days or even months. A further interesting remark by Deputy <Col N="888" /> de Valera at column 838, of Wednesday, 15th March, volume 227, of the Official Report was:</P>
    <P>If we are going to arrange statutorily that people in a certain category are to get a certain type of employment, percentage-wise or otherwise, this seems to me to be taking the first step towards the regimentation of all labour in industry.</P>
    <P>That is one of the strangest arguments I have heard in this discussion against this Bill.  Anybody who could possibly think that the employment of a minimum number of disabled people in industry is a first step towards regimentation of workers portrays a most extraordinary mind.  At column 840 he says the same thing:</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that the acceptance of a proposal of this nature is bound to upset the balance.</P>
    <P>We want to upset the balance.  Deputy de Valera does not and the Minister does not.  We find that the balance is all wrong.  The balance is all in favour of the privileged and all against the helpless.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Compulsorily installing certain people in privileged employment would deprive an industry of the elasticity which is so essential. </P>
    <P>The elasticity seems to be interpreted in this context, I have no doubt, as meaning that there should always be a queue outside the gate, as God knows there used to be, or outside every job which the Lord and Master created, specially for the purpose of exploiting other people and giving a right of entitlement, in his own mind, by reason of his birth as a superior being to come out and make his selection.  &ldquo;The elasticity which is so essential&rdquo;&mdash;this elasticity is just a cover word for unemployment and we, of course, have had unemployment as part of our social set-up, part of our economic set-up, since this State was founded.</P>
    <P>We never achieved full employment. Even when highly monopolistic capitalists had full employment in time of war, we were not able to achieve it. We were not able to achieve it during the last war.  It defeated our economic <Col N="889" /> genius apparently to find employment for our people.  That was the war we kept out of, and we sent over half a million people to England, to Coventry, London, and so on, to be bombed to bits to keep John Bull and the factories going.</P>
    <P>That was the war we were kept out of: it is a good job we were not in one.  Full employment has never yet been achieved, except in those booklets which pour out from the Government presses, green-covered, of course. Naturally they must be covered in green.  We get a supply of those.  I have said in another place at another time that I wondered how many people read and studied these booklets.  How many people read that on full employment?  I think the people generally are disenchanted with this long-term, large-scale confidence trick which has been proceeding on the matter of full employment.  Full employment has defeated the nimble brains of the Fianna Fáil hierarchy.  It will always do so because there is no other organised society in which full employment can be had than a socialist society.</P>
    <P>When Deputy de Valera was putting the view that if employers were compelled to take on even a fractional percentage&mdash;and that is all I was looking for and am looking for, a fractional percentage of the labour force of those employing 20 people; one-in-twenty should, if suitable, be a person suffering from a disability&mdash;he said, amongst other things, that it would be the first step towards the regimentation of all labour.  It would upset the balance.  The balance of course would be upset as they would rock the boat.  The boat is all right for those who are sitting up on the bridge sending the orders down a pipe.  It is not so happy for those down in the bowels of the ship who when anything goes wrong with the boat never get out with their lives.  They are the first to go to the bottom.</P>
    <P>He also went on to say that this modest proposal of mine would deprive an industry of the elasticity which he said is so essential.  Most of the contributions, it must be said, if not helpful to my case, were well-intentioned for various reasons; that is, <Col N="890" /> most of the contributions on the Government side.  Of course, we had to await the arrival of Deputy Michael Carty complete with cap and bells to reduce this very serious matter to something approaching a joke.  Among other things, he accused me of all sorts of Machiavellianism in this matter and claimed inevitably that anything good that ever came to this country came from the perfervid brains of the Fianna Fáil leadership and also insinuated that this proposal of mine was initiated in a far eastern country without identifying geographically its location.</P>
    <P>A time there was when that kind of manoeuvring paid electoral dividends in this country but that duty was executed by a master of the technique, to wit, Deputy MacEntee who was well-known as a researcher into the past of the most obscure people.  He was able to establish connection and modifications which were truly appalling, but he did it with a certain grace. One can say about him now that at least he was literate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>If he knew I was beaming on to him he would be down. He is probably not around at all.  He knew nothing whatsoever about the Bill.  He came charging in here like a bulleen in a china shop and proceeded to talk the greatest ráiméis and triviality for one purpose, to tear the Bill apart.  That was last March.  It was evident that the Government did not want to be embarrassed at that stage by having to decide whether or not they would vote on the Bill.  It was subsequent to the adjournment in March that the Minister set up that <Col N="891" /> committee upon which he now lies so heavily in regard to the employment of disabled civil servants.  It was a result, I claim, of the pressure of this Bill that that was done.  There have been other instances of similar activities of the Government but I shall not go into them now.  Perhaps I shall do so later, when a suitable opportunity offers.  I wish to deal with Deputy Carty and I want to resume tomorrow evening on Deputy Carty, and I hope, Sir, he gave you notice of my intention.</P>

      <P>I am very anxious he should be.  I should not like to say behind his back the things which are in my mind now, except that all of the time-wasting performances we have witnessed in this House&mdash;and God knows I have suffered in silence here for many years listening to the repetition of boring platitudes and banalities that would bring one almost to tears&mdash;Deputy Carty's has ranked very highly in that classification.  They say that down in the West of Ireland the people are very charitable, as my Fianna Fáil colleague from County Dublin is wont to remark.  They must be, if the kind of thrash Deputy Carty poured out in relation to this Bill is the sort of stuff he trots out to them in his after-Mass talks when he reports on his stewardship in his constituency.  If that is the stuff they have to listen to, the people of the west must have a forbearance that passeth all understanding.</P>
      <P>I am certain that if the constituents of Deputy Carty knew his real sentiments and had the opportunity of reading them as I have had&mdash;as they were reported verbatim in the Official Report&mdash;on the matter of the employment of the disabled, they would have things to say to him he might not like to hear.  One of his remarks concerning the Labour Party, one of his allegations&mdash;and this is the level at which he approached the whole discussion was as follows, reported at column 857 of the Official Report for 15th March, 1967:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> They&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I need not say that time and the voters will give him his answer.

The disabled person is not regarded by Deputy Carty as his brother in misfortune because, of course, Deputy Carty is not in misfortune.  Any effort to help &ldquo;that <Col N="893" /> kind of person&rdquo; is like throwing coppers to somebody who is begging. Later, Deputy Carty said:</P>

      <P>I am glad to know that I am not the only person codded by the clocks.  As I was saying when the debate was adjourned, I watched the Minister for Finance on television last Sunday night week and I read the various statements he has made since and the statement he made today.  First of all, may I say that on television he gave a very bland, calm performance but it was as far divorced from the realities of the situation as anything <Col N="894" /> could be.  I shall not for a moment take the line the Minister's colleague, Deputy MacEntee, took on a previous occasion, of accusing the Minister of being a shyster debtor, of referring to devaluation by him as being a dubious transaction or suggesting that this action was taken by the Minister deliberately because he jumped at the chance of manipulating the currency. Those statements that were made by Deputy MacEntee on a previous occasion were as irresponsible and as slanderous of the country as they would have been if they were made in the rougher terms to which we are more accustomed in this House from Deputy Corry.  But, at the same time, one must accept that in considering the action of the Government and the manner in which the Minister for Finance endeavoured to put it across, we did not see the approach to reality that we were entitled to look for and that should have been the keyword. The Minister, particularly on television that night, tried to give us the impression that devaluation was a good thing. Of course, that is nonsense.</P>

He may not have been trying to do it but it was most certainly the impression he gave &mdash; that and the impression of complacency.</P>

      <P>There were other people in other countries&mdash;and I heard Deputy Corish refer to them earlier today&mdash;who tried to suggest that devaluation was a good thing.  It was suggested that perhaps it was the panacea for all the British ills.  Of course, that is nonsense.  It may have been the only possible course which the British Government could have taken. It is not for us to comment on whether it was or not.  That is their business and it affects us only in so far as sterling is our reserve currency.  It seems clear enough that there would be a simple <Col N="895" /> and a facile answer to that, that if it was this wonderful panacea for the ills of Britain, why was it not taken long ago?  Of course, that was merely hindsight by certain people trying to defend the decision they had taken.</P>
      <P>The plain fact of the matter is that the necessity to devalue for the sterling area and for us here was disastrous.  It does not follow that it may not have been their only choice, our only choice; it may have been Hobson's choice, but it was a disastrous decision to have to take and it had the effect of shaking public confidence all over the world or rather, perhaps, may I put it this way? the impact of the things that led up to the decision on devaluation shook public confidence not only in Britain, not only here, but all over the world.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the thing that worries most people at the present time is not whether it was a good thing or a panacea but whether in fact the devaluation that took place was enough to ensure that sterling, in which we have such an immense stake, would be sufficiently strong to stand in future and whether&mdash;to put it another way&mdash; devaluation of sterling at 14.3 was enough.  Would it get Britain out of her problems?  There is considerable doubt, to put it no stronger than that, on the part of some people as to whether it will.  If it does not it will certainly have effects here which cannot be other than very hurtful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may well have been that in the events in which the Government found themselves the other day, par devaluation, as I may describe it, was the only course open to them.  Personally, I think there was no other course available but I do feel that it is wrong to say, in the arguments that have been put publicly by the Government, that this was the only course available. There was far too much assumption and far too little frankness in the approach to it.  It is no answer to say that the provision of the 1927 Act bound us to devalue in exactly the same rate.  The Minister for Finance knew when he made that statement in the first couple of days that it would have been quite simple to have deferred taking a decision if he wanted to on <Col N="896" /> that Saturday and to have had the necessary legislative change before a decision had to be taken if that was felt by the Government to be the right course.  It would have been much better and much more honourable to make it clear that it was the right course to take and, indeed, the Minister has gone some part of the way today to correct that first impression of his.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong argument, however, to be considered, that it is not right that we should be statutorily bound as we have been since 1927.  At any other time than this for there to be any suggestion of any change in that statutory position would undoubtedly create rumours, would create, perhaps, panic, would undoubtedly create uneasiness, to put it no stronger, but at this particular point of time that would not be the position and at this particular point of time there is a very strong argument to alter the statutory position and to give the Government of the day the discretion to decide whether at any time it is desirable to devalue with sterling, to depreciate in value or to devalue even further.</P>
    <P>That flexibility is something that I can see every Government would be anxious to have but it is very, very seldom that the opportunity arises for a Government to take the chance of getting that flexibility without bringing dangers in uneasiness in public confidence. This is the opportunity for the Government to take and to make it clear that in taking it we are not taking any decision other than the present one in the present circumstances but that freedom in relation to decisions of this sort is something that it would be desirable for a government to have.  We would, perhaps, have had some other choice were it not for the economic factor in relation to our trade.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the reserves in the Central Bank is one that was felt some ten or 12 years ago to be something that should follow completely the 1927 Act.  It was, I think, in 1955 or 1956 that, for the first time, some part of the legal tender note fund was transferred to be held in dollar securities.  That was expanded by subsequent Ministers for Finance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> The initial transference was some £4 million into dollar securities of the United States of America.  It was later expanded and I think the present figure is in the region of £10 million.  I do not know if Ministers for Finance have in the last ten years been restricted in any attempt to diversify that legal tender note fund, the backing for our currency, or whether it has been by deliberate choice that the expansion did not go beyond the £10 million mark.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether it was a deliberate choice or whether it was something we had to accept as part of the unwritten rules, shall I call them, of the sterling pool.  In that respect there was, I think, at one time a move towards switching by Burma which resulted in that country being no longer a member of the sterling pool. It may well be that Ministers for Finance in the last ten years, and, in particular, in the last five years, found that they were not able to get that diversification because of similar unwritten rules to those which governed the Burmese situation.  I say that deliberately because the Minister for Finance today made it clear in his speech that, in his view, everybody has been thinking about devaluation for a considerable time.  If he was thinking about it for a considerable time, then it is clearly one of the ways in which diversification might have been dealt with and we might thereby have avoided a situation in which we had, so to speak, all our eggs in one basket.</P>
    <P>One of the principal things one has to remember in this discussion on devaluation is the fact that devaluation so far as Britain is concerned is only one part of the story and it is only one part particularly in so far as it affects us.  Restriction on credit, high interest rates, restrictions on hire purchase, reduction in governmental expenditure are all part of the same package deal they have adopted&mdash;perhaps I should say they have had to adopt&mdash;in Britain. We should certainly consider how those other parts of the package deal will affect us and how far we can or are able to move away from them.</P>
    <P>It is desirable to refer, I think, to a comment in the <i>Financial Times</i> of <Col N="898" /> 20th November in so far as Ireland is concerned.  The following passage appears:</P>
    <P>It appears unlikely that in the immediate future the price advantage that Ireland will gain in respect of £105 million of its 1966 external receipts will secure a sufficient expansion of trade and it appears to me to offset the 14.3 reduction in the external purchasing power of these receipts and the increase of one-sixth in the cost of its import bill from these countries.</P>
    <P>Further on, the article states:</P>
    <P>These measures of themselves are unwelcome at a time when efforts are being made to reflate the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>That was one of the early comments by a financial journal and it was in very sharp contrast, indeed, to the impact and effect the Minister for Finance sought to put over on television.</P>

      <P>Only the Minister knows what impression he tried to create, but it is quite certain that the impression he created was that devaluation was not a bad thing for us, that there would be no change and that everybody could be quite complacent. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.  Let us look at the other parts of the package deal on the other side.  The first thing that hits us in importance here is the high interest rates.  Interest rates have, of course, world-wide implications.  We would all dearly love there to be no possibility of a disease like foot and mouth spreading across the Irish Sea.  I include the Minister in this; we would all dearly love a situation in which we would be the sole arbiter of our own interest rates.  The effect of interest rates in New York, in Germany, in France, in London is bound to affect interest rates here, but it is possible to effect some amelioration of the position marginally to prevent the same evolution when it is desired to reflate here and to restrict and deflate further in England.  It is only a marginal change. I accept that, without question, but it is a marginal change that was considered possible for the first time, again, only about 12 years ago.  It is one that arises not entirely because of our geographical position but in respect of which our geographical position has a very great amount of influence.</P>
      <P>Whatever about the rates of interest themselves, the availability of credit is something over which we are entirely our own masters.  I think it is much more important that there would be adequate supplies of credit for productive purposes, adequate supplies of credit to stimulate production in agriculture and in industry, than even the rate at which such credit would be available.  I know that, in all of our personal lives, the question of the rate of interest may seem of greater importance but that is human nature.  However, it is the availability of credit for agriculture and for industry, for the expansion of production, that will ultimately affect our future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> I should like a categoric assurance from the Minister for Finance in this debate that, in our present circumstances, with, as he says himself, a small surplus in our balance of payments position, far from our following the British moves in this respect, all the credit that is required for productive purposes, for the expansion of production in agriculture and in industry will be made available and particularly, as I say, will be made available by the banking system.  In that respect, it is something which we can govern here without interference from outside.  It is something that is governed by our balance of payments position and not by any question of outflow of funds due to an attempt by us to maintain low interest rates while there are high interest rates in other parts of the world.  Equally, I think, we are in a position here in which there is no necessity at all to have the same restrictions as there are on the other side.</P>
    <P>We suffered here, in 1965, from an inflation that was imported by the Government alone.  Perhaps &ldquo;imported&rdquo; is the wrong word: &ldquo;generated&rdquo; would perhaps be a better word. We suffered here, in 1965, from an inflation that was generated by the Government alone, generated because they would not accept the discipline on the lines that had been laid down and generated because they deliberately moved away from the programme that had been set out.  When, as a result of that inflation, that was deliberately generated by the Government, they found themselves in the position in which they were later that year they then jumped from one extreme to the other, somewhat panicky in the end. In that respect, they were, to put it mildly, helped by the lack of statistical information and by the delay with which that statistical information came to hand.</P>
    <P>On many occasions in this House I have made it clear that one of the difficulties there must be for anyone sitting in the seat over there which is occupied by the Minister for Finance is that we have not got anything like sufficient statistical information and that it comes much too late.  As an aside to <Col N="901" /> that, may I say that a statistical service &mdash;I am not in any way criticising the <i>bona fides</i> of those concerned&mdash;which is wrong to the extent of about 24,000 people in employment figures, an error of about 2½ per cent, as was indicated by the Minister in the earlier part of his speech at the Bankers' Dinner&mdash; which, obviously, was smothered by what happened later on&mdash;is not something of which we have any right to be proud.  No matter who is sitting in the chair as Minister for Finance, he will have to face the situation that we must pay more money to expand our statistical service so as to make quite certain of a wider scope in it and, above all, a more speedy service by it for the purpose of being able to advise the Government of the day and, indeed, the public as a whole.  Perhaps the computer that is being put in for the Revenue Commissioners will not only succeed, when it has found its feet and got over its teething trouble, in extracting more money more speedily for the Minister for Finance, but might be able to do something to ensure that we will get our statistical data on foot of which policies should be framed and implemented, more quickly in the future.</P>
    <P>It is commonplace that governments, again in the old-fashioned way, merely set the pattern once a year at Budget time for the economy for the whole year ahead and sit back and wait until the next period of Budget time comes around to take whatever steps may be necessary to assist the economy in one direction or another.  But they cannot do that without the appropriate information.  The fixation of a date every year for the Budget has been dealt with not merely, as most people think, because of the ending of the financial year on 31st March but because it takes at least up to the begining of April to get the end of year statistical returns required for the proper thought and proper determinations for the Budget itself, most particularly when the Budget is to be utilised, as it should be utilised, as an instrument of economic policy.</P>
    <P>As I say, at the present time I do not think it is necessary nor do I feel that the Minister would think it is necessary to take any restrictive action <Col N="902" /> at all.  On the contrary, I think he would feel as certainly as we feel that some shot in the arm at this time is perhaps the most desirable thing for the economy as a whole.  I had two questions down today dealing with prices and the duty content.  The first dealt with petrol, light hydrocarbon oil. It appears that the duty content of a gallon of petrol is roughly 3/9d, that the price of that petrol varies from the standard grade at 5/7d to the premium grade at 6/-.  I am ignoring the fractions of a penny involved.  In other words, the approximate average cost for the petrol itself, for distribution costs and for profits all along the line, for everything other than the grab of the Minister for Finance&mdash;and which I will say he accepted frankly enough on television&mdash;is approximately 2/-, 2/-for all the other costs involved.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that in present circumstances it is quite vital to the economy that the cost of distribution, of the transport engaged in distribution, should not be increased.  It is equally a time when the economy does need a shot in the arm to push on towards reflation with the restrictions all around us.  The best way that could be done, I would suggest, as Deputy O'Higgins has already suggested, is that the Minister by a rebate in duty should make up the increase, make good the increase that there otherwise may be or will be in the price of petrol by reason of devalued costs.  As far as we can gather from the returns coming in at this time in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> returns which it was impossible for us to compare with last year up to the end of September because of last year's absence of returns in the bank stoppage, it would look as if the Minister has got that margin, or would have that margin easily enough with the flip to buoyancy that a shot in the arm at this juncture would give him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a neat turn of phrase, &ldquo;a flip to buoyancy that a shot in the arm at this juncture would give.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister likes it.  The other part of living costs which will undoubtedly be affected at a very early date by devaluation <Col N="903" /> costs is in relation to tobacco. Here again it seems clear from the reply given to my question today that about 2/9d of the packet of tipped cigarettes which cost 4/3d is duty and the balance of 1/6d is in the cost of the article itself, the profit and distribution margin all along the line.  In relation to the ordinary cigarette which is not tipped the duty content is about 3/6d out of the cost of 4/10d, leaving about 1/4d for the costs of the tobacco and the distributive margin.  It is interesting that it is the ordinary cigarette that seems to have the smaller content in it for the price of tobacco and the retail costs down the line.</P>
      <P>There may be differences there in relation to the effects of tobacco about which the Minister for Health has been speaking but there can be no such thoughts in relation to the price of petrol and the most injurious effects that an increase in distribution costs would have all through the economy. It seems to me that it is clear, notwithstanding what the Minister said, that there is bound to be an immediate impact on certain people.  Everybody knows that the older and poorer sections of the community consume much greater quantities of tea than the average person in the community as a whole.  Tea is one of the things that must be hit in the pretty near future by devaluation and for that alone a concession should be made by the Minister in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impression that the Minister created&mdash;and in this respect I am going to make it quite clear, tried to create on television by his speeches from the very beginning&mdash;was that on our prices here the effect of devaluation would be negligible.  He is wrong, of course, in that regard.  He is wrong not merely from the point of view of our own costing and the direct increase in deflation in our payments in devalued sterling to those countries where there has been no devaluation, but he is wrong also because a very large part of our imports from Britain are imports that are based on raw materials that they have to buy with under-valued currencies and we are, of course, going to get the same effect as <Col N="904" /> if we were buying them with devalued currency direct.  Coal, other than British coal&mdash;and it seems from what one reads, that we are dependent to a large extent on coal from Poland, America and elsewhere&mdash;is going to get a knock at once.  Electricity in so far as it is dependent on oil fired stations will also be affected.</P>
    <P>I wonder how far the Minister for Finance has examined, with his colleague the Minister for Transport and Power, the possibility of providing electric power from atomic reactors.  Of the present consumption in Britain about ten per cent is produced by atomic reaction, by nuclear power, call it what you will.  If they are getting ten per cent of their total power, not ten per cent of their electric power, from nuclear reactors, surely there is a very strong case for our examining the immediate prospect of providing power here in that way, an examination that should take place in conjuction with the Government of Belfast because, in relation to that aspect of the provision of power, it is something that clearly should be considered for the island as a whole.</P>
    <P>The effect of devaluation on fertilisers is something that could hurt production.  I sincerely hope that we will be able to ensure that any increase that there may be through devaluation in fertiliser costs will be something that can be surmounted because of the inestimable damage that a decrease in fertiliser usage would do to our agricultural production.</P>
    <P>All this discussion in relation to devaluation must be seen in the context of what I have described as the package deal introduced on the other side.  Most people believed prior to last Saturday week that devaluation was the last shot in the British locker, the last piece of armament for the British to surmount French objections to their entry to the Common Market.  It seems quite clear now from the utterances of General de Gaulle yesterday that that shot has had absolutely no effect.  I was never very impressed by the case made here by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in relation to the great welcome they were supposed to have got in Paris and in relation to the expansion <Col N="905" /> in the mind of the Taoiseach about the reception they received in France.  It seemed to me perfectly obvious even before they went there that they were going to be received on the surface with open arms.  It was obvious from the pattern of our trade that without the admission of Britain to the Common Market any promises or suggestions to us were utterly meaningless. In those circumstances one of the ways they in France could get a side swipe at the British was to be more than courteous to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  There was nothing more in it than that.  That, if anything, appears clear from the statements made yesterday.  It is now crystal clear that all the nice things said from the teeth out to our Government's delegates in Paris were merely for the sake of having a clatter as a kind of side swipe at the British.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in present circumstances we have to consider how this package deal is going to affect the whole future of our economy.  We accepted, and I think it was generally believed, that the Free Trade Agreement with Britain was going to be one step towards the Common Market for Ireland.  It looks now that the prognostications, the anticipations and the timetables that have been continually produced by the Government for Common Market accession for Ireland are going to have to be lengthened very considerably. Where that is going to take us is another question.  Where we are going to get the expansion and growth, both in industrial and agricultural production, without being part of a larger unit is something that has to be considered very carefully indeed.</P>
    <P>Unemployment figures this year have risen over those of last year by some 5,000, even with the statistical correction of 24,000 in the employment figures following the preliminary analysis of the census of population of 1966.  This all points to the fact that we are not going to get that increase in employment in industry and services which we must have if, in the words of the NIEC Report, emigration is to be limited to 5,000 a year.  There has to be some very considerable new thinking in relation to the matter.  There <Col N="906" /> has to be some very considerable re-appraisal of policies which might have been sufficient if access to the Community was around the corner.  But certainly in present circumstances they are far from sufficient.</P>
    <P>We all want to see not merely an increase in employment but an improvement in living standards.  Some of us sometimes on all sides of the House are inclined to forget that a reduction in hours of work can very often be exactly the same, economically speaking, as an increase in wages and earnings.  A reduction in hours of work is something that may put up the costs of our products just as much as an increase in real earnings.  I wonder whether in present circumstances we would not be wiser as a people and as a nation if we concentrated, not on any reduction in hours of work, but took a leaf out of the Germans' book after the end of the war when they were considering not any reduction in the hours they had to work but all the time trying to improve their living standards in terms of the consumption they were able to afford.  Certainly, there has been too little consideration of the exact comparison there is between an increase in monetary incomes on the one hand, and a reduction in hours of work on the other.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient merely to say there must be a standstill here or there or no increase here or there without serious consideration.  We must try to set our sights on the realities of the situation. This is where I think the Government have completely failed to give the lead and the frank and true expression to the country they should have given.  We have to accept that in relation to devaluation there is bound to be quite a substantial increase in prices, without that increase bringing in any way any profit for employer, management or worker.  We have to ensure, in order to keep our incomes worth what we want them to be worth, that we can have an improvement in real standards for all the people.  We have to set that in its proper perspective and ensure in so doing that the people are frankly given the answer.  It was in relation to that lack of frankness, to that impression and presumption the Minister succeeded in giving, initially on television <Col N="907" /> and in all his announcements, that I think this Government have failed signally to live up to their responsibility over the events of the past ten days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate so far has been kept on a very narrow basis mainly, I think, because the Minister in his opening speech set the theme to try to keep it as narrow as possible.  As a result it appears that the devaluation of the £ is taking up the main part of the debate, with references to the EEC and a few other minor references being made as well.  Deputy Corish for the Labour Party made most of the points which could usefully be made, and, therefore, I shall be pretty brief in dealing with those aspects of the Estimate.</P>
      <P>The Minister has, in my opinion, understated the position, and the Opposition are, in my opinion, overstating it, and somewhere between the two the truth must lie.  I quite agree that, as things are, the Government could do nothing else but devalue when Britain devalued, and there is no point in the Minister's making excuses for doing it and the Opposition saying it should not have been done, because the facts are that, tied as we are to sterling and having previously accepted a similar, even worse, position, then it would be entirely unfair to say that the Government should not have done now what they did, although when the Government were in opposition&mdash;and Deputy MacEntee's half page in the <i>Sunday Press</i> in 1949 has been quoted across the House&mdash;not alone Deputy MacEntee but responsible representatives of the Fianna Fáil Party did say that devaluing the £ in 1949 was a treacherous thing to do, that it was taking away the value of the £ to the people living in the country, that it was lowering the purchasing value of the £ for pensioners, workers and so on.  If he had headed his article &ldquo;Bunkum&rdquo; instead of what he did call it, he would have been a lot nearer the truth.  However, in the present case, the British £ having been devalued, we had no option but to follow suit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We then come to the question as to whether or not the action of the <Col N="908" /> British Government in devaluing the £ was the most severe action which could have been taken against this country. Anyone who knows the facts of the increase in tariffs in 1964 will agree that a tariff increase on certain goods would have been far more disastrous as far as our exports to Britain are concerned.  The unfortunate position is that it is what happens following the devaluation of the £ that will cause the big trouble in this country.  I am quite sure the Minister for Finance will be able to justify, for instance, the action of the banks in increasing the bank rate, although he did not seem to have thought of an increase in the Post Office interest rate, because he has not referred to it in his speech at all.</P>
    <P>Consequential on the increase in the bank rate the cost of many things in this country must rise substantially, and this is where we shall run into trouble.  Those of us who have been interested in housing over the years know the cost of money borrowed for this purpose and the effect that has on repayments on houses.  I believe that this is one of the side effects that will be felt not so much now but in the next six, 12 or 18 months, and it will grow as the years go by. Goodness knows, housing is dear enough.  The repayments on a £2,000 loan at the present time run pretty close to £4 per week for the average person.  If the interest rates are to increase now&mdash;and they do not go down nearly as quickly as they go up &mdash;the responsibility for housing will fall back again almost entirely on local authorities, because the ordinary working class people who have been attempting to build their own houses will find it is no longer possible to do so.  This is an aspect of the matter which has got very little attention in the Minister's statement.  On the question of what will be increased in price as a result of the devaluation, the Minister gives a rough list.  He says:</P>
    <P>Among the principal commodities which we import from nondevaluing countries are crude and partly-refined petroleum, wheat <Col N="909" /> (imports of which vary according to our own harvest experience)...</P>
    <P>I should be interested to know in what way the increase in the cost of wheat will affect the price of bread, because if my memory serves me correctly, the difference between the cheaper foreign wheat and the cost of Irish wheat is not passed on either to the miller or to the taxpayer but is held in the Government coffers.  If that is so, while it would mean a reduction in the income of the Government, it should not bring about an increase in the price of bread. Perhaps the Minister would comment on that when he is replying.  The Minister's statement continues:</P>
    <P>...coal, fertilisers, and certain animal feeding stuffs, tea, tobacco, certain fresh and dried fruits, wines and brandy and various raw materials.</P>
    <P>As regards coal, I had a question down for the Minister for Industry and Commerce a few days ago about the items for which he had given authority recently for increased prices.  He gave me a list in a tabular statement, and I asked him if coal was included.  He was not sure.  He had a look and said: &ldquo;Yes, it is, but that is quite some time ago.  Coal prices have not been increased recently.&rdquo;  I am aware that coal prices were increased recently, and I am also aware that coal is now being increased again.  The coal merchants say that because the £ was devalued and the fact that, according to themselves, they do not pay for the coal according as they receive it but get it on a credit basis and pay afterwards, at quarterly intervals, the money which they have to pay is already devalued and, therefore, they must pay a higher cost even though that coal is stockpiled with them and they have not yet sold it.  That is their excuse for now increasing the price of their coal. While the increase has been mentioned as being a pretty small one to cover the cost, I am aware that already coal is being retailed to poor people who cannot afford to buy any more than a hundredweight at a time, if they can afford that, at an extra 2/- per bag.</P>
    <P>This is something in which the Minister <Col N="910" /> for Finance might be interested if he does not already know it, and this is the sort of thing we are going to have as a result of devaluation.  It reminds me of the time the Suez crisis was on and I heard an old lady who was selling carrots looking for an increased price because of the Suez crisis.  When one finds that sort of argument being put up, it is easy to understand how those people who want to get a few pounds pretty quickly and pretty handy, will use this argument that the £ has been devalued and, therefore, they must get an increase, and those who are selling to the poor in small amounts, feel for some extra-ordinary reason they are entitled to a higher rate of increase than those selling in big lots.  This is the sort of thing to which the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, might very usefully direct the attention of his officers in order to prevent it going too far.</P>
    <P>In regard to tobacco and oil, the Minister says that the greater part of the retail price is accounted for by taxation, the basic import cost being relatively low.  I presume he means that the possibility of an increase or a substantial increase in the cost of these commodities is slight.  However, I am quite sure the Minister is aware that already transport costs are going up on the argument that there is an increase in the cost of fuel.  This is the sort of thing of which people are prepared to take advantage very quickly, and the result is that it gets out of control.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will require to be satisfied under existing price control arrangements that any proposed price increase is not intended to be applied until it is clear that devaluation is, in fact, affecting current costs. I wonder what evidence he got before he allowed the coal merchants to raise their prices?  I wonder will he allow other people to increase their prices in the same way, without going very closely into the matter?</P>
    <P>I find myself at variance with the Minister on his estimate of what the <Col N="911" /> effect of devaluation will be on price levels.  He said:</P>
    <P>As to the overall effect of devaluation on the price level, it is reasonable to calculate that it should not be more than about two per cent.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert but I have taken advice from a number of people who claim to be experts, and they feel that a figure of five per cent is more likely to be correct than two per cent.  Perhaps when the Minister is replying, having had an extra couple of days to evaluate the situation, and having heard the comments made by Deputies, he will be prepared to comment on that situation.  It was publicly stated by the President of the Congress of Professional and Services Association at their annual conference last week that five per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A totally disinterested source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe not totally disinterested, but I am sure the Minister will agree that the people who advise him have a slight interest in the matter too, and that if he wants to get a totally disinterested source he will have to go somewhere else other than to the advisers to the Government or the people I have quoted.  A figure of five per cent has been thrown up, and the Minister says two per cent.  I should hate to think that we would have to wait for another 12 months to be able to tell the Minister on his Estimate next year that his figure was wrong.  I trust and I know that we will be able to find out long before that.</P>
      <P>The Minister made this bland statement:</P>
      <P>In view of the moderate effect which devaluation is likely to have on prices and the spread of the increase over a period, there is no ground for suggestions that there should be immediate compensation to recipients of social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already said that coal will cost social welfare recipients an extra 2/- a week because particularly those people who live alone will have to burn at least a bag of coal to keep them warm as they are unable to buy the proper <Col N="912" /> type of food to keep them warm with what they are getting.  For those living in one room or in a small house the only way to keep reasonably warm during the winter is to buy coal, and that coal is going to cost them an extra 2/- per week.  Will the Minister agree to have investigations made to ensure that this thing will not recur again and again with 2/- here and 6d there coming out of old age pensions and widows' pensions resulting in great hardship, because that can happen? There is no point in saying afterwards that it should have been foreseen.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the question of income increases and said:</P>
    <P>On the question of demands for income increases at this juncture, whether or not they are associated with apprehensions about the effects of devaluation on living costs, I would like to explain the position as I see it.</P>
    <P>The Government's general attitude to income increases has often been stated.  The Government favour a progressive increase in workers' real incomes according as national production rises, and Government policy is directed towards raising national production&mdash;and with it individual productivity&mdash;as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>Lovely big words, lovely phrases, but they are of little use to the man who is finding it impossible to live and rear a family on the income he is getting at present.  Would the Minister not agree that even now there is a definite demand, that there was good reason for a substantial increase for lower paid workers before devaluation was ever introduced, and that there is a set of lower paid workers-who should be paid very much more at present?  Many of those workers are employed by the State, by semi-State bodies, and local authorities.  Their wage increase must be sanctioned by a Minister of State before they can get it, and the result is that they do not get it at all.  Deputy Sweetman talked about reduced working hours and wages and what they did in Germany.  This is not Germany, thank God.  It ill-becomes people who work about 30 hours a week to talk about the necessity for continuing to <Col N="913" /> make people who are already working a 45 hour week or a 42½ hour week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I guarantee that I work not less than a 50 hour week and usually a 60 hour week&mdash;much more than the Deputy, if he wants to make a personal comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see Deputy Sweetman's rate per hour compared with that of the people he was talking about a few minutes ago. Talking about working hours, many of those who wish to work on their own and work hard make darn sure that they are well paid, and they have the satisfaction of knowing that they are bringing home a decent wage packet. In regard to the unfortunate men employed by the State, by the local authorities, or by unscrupulous employers&mdash;and there are hundreds of them&mdash;to suggest that there should not be a reduction in their working hours is an insult to the intelligence of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be better advised to look for more wages rather than a reduction of working hours.  That is what I said and that is what I meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a personal comment.  I am sure Deputy Sweetman meant what he said.  I have been a trade union official for 21 years and the only time I hear increased wages mentioned is when we look for reduced working hours.  When we change it to increased wages we find we cannot get that either.  That is the sort of thing we have to live with and those of us who have been negotiating for a long time have come to realise and recognise the system.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Sweetman is aware that while we have 54,000 unemployed, there are employers in this State who are doing everything possible, and spending endless amounts of money, to reduce the volume of manpower employed in their factories.  It was found in other countries where there was full employment that because of the introduction of this type of system if there was not a reduction of working hours the people concerned would be out of a job before very long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> We have reached the stage here where even though we have a big number of people unemployed there are still people who are prepared to spend £10,000 trying to see if they could do without five extra men, rather than employing those men over a long number of years by paying them a decent wage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know more of them than Deputy Sweetman or anybody else.  There are decent employers and not-so-decent employers.  One thing they will not do&mdash;and it is not their job I suppose&mdash;is worry about the standard of living of their employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I can name one who does not and that is the State.  The Department of Finance does not and the Minister for Finance, who is in charge of it, must take responsibility. His employees are not getting a fair deal and he knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have improved their conditions very considerably in the last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Improved them to £9 a week, men who are up to their necks in water and mud all day.  Is that considered a Christian approach to the way these people should be treated?  I think we have got our priorities wrong when we start talking about these people and it is about time somebody started looking at the other side of the coin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for devaluation.  I am not prepared to go the whole way with either the Minister or the people who spoke before me but I will say that it appears that the Government did what any Government who were here would have done.  The position is bad.  I think it is an awful mistake to try to understate it and say: &ldquo;It will not be <Col N="915" /> so bad.&rdquo;  It will be bad and we might as well face up to it and make some effort to cure it or do something about it.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the Minister's speech to decimal currency. According to the report it appears as if a lot of people are coming down on the side of the 10/- unit.  I want to give a warning to the Minister. We have had a situation in this country when the farthing was no longer being used as a unit of currency that many people, when there was a farthing increase put on in the Budget, put a half-penny on.  If there is not a very small unit of currency in the decimal currency there is a grave danger that we will find ourselves in the position that the least increase that can be imposed on anything will be about 2½d because the smallest coin in our currency will be the 2½d one.  This is something which I am sure the Minister's advisers must have noticed before now and must have advised on.  I want to give a warning that it is not good enough to suggest that for handiness sake we should not have too small a coin.  Other countries have found it necessary to have a very small unit of currency.  I suggest we should be very careful before we put into the hands of anybody the right to increase by substantial amounts because of the fact that the unit of currency we have is of such a size that a small increase is not possible.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things in the Minister's Estimate which have not been touched on.  I do not propose to go over all of them but I want to refer to a few of them.  One is the question of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I mentioned a number of items on another Estimate and was told they were proper to this Estimate.  The first one is the question of accommodation. The Minister knows that when the new building was being erected it was arranged that there would be adequate accommodation for the Members of this House to do their business in the House.  The Government made sure&mdash; and they did the right thing&mdash;that they would get adequate accommodation in <Col N="916" /> two floors.  Am I in order, a Cheann Comhairle?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, since we are discussing all the Votes I take it the Deputy is in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody interrupted you to ask a question.  I think the people who run this House should know what is in order and what is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, we are only discussing the Vote for the Office of the Minister.  I may be wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole group is being discussed.  The Labour Party have rooms on the fourth floor.  May I point out as I did before, and I understand in the wrong, that we have a number of Members of both Houses with three or four in some rooms attempting to work and the rooms on the other side of the corridor being occupied by civil servants who must work in the House I know and who must be convenient to the Chamber and must do their business but should not use accommodation which was intended for Members of the House. There is a suggestion made that the older portion of the House should be renovated and that these people should be moved to it.  I would like to see them get excellent and adequate accommodation but I want to protest as the Whip of my Party, not for the first time, that this thing has been long-fingered and that we can see no reason why we should be confined to one side of the corridor while empty or almost empty rooms on the other side of the corridor are either reserved for officials of the House or not being used at all except for an occasional meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the right side of the corridor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, funnily enough we are on the right side of the corridor.  We are usually to the left but we are on the right side of the corridor. <Col N="917" /> I feel that this is something which should be attended to.</P>
      <P>I want to refer&mdash;if I am in order and this is something I am not clear on and would like your guidance, a Cheann Comhairle&mdash;to the question of restaurant accommodation.  There used to be an arrangement whereby the reporters of the Press Gallery used the same accommodation for meals as Members of the two Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always felt that these matters were for the committee of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a reason for raising this.  I am informed on inquiry from our Member of the committee that the matter was not raised with that committee and the ruling was given by a Member of the committee which I think he had no authority to give.  For that reason I feel that there is only one place to have this cleared and it is with the Minister for Finance who is responsible in the main for the accommodation.  The complaint is&mdash;I shall make it very brief&mdash;that this accommodation which was always available to the Press Gallery should still be available for them if they wish to use it.  Those of us who are in this House are not so naïve as to believe that we can exist without publicity, good, bad or indifferent and for a Member of this House for some reason of his own to tell members of the Press that they were not entitled to eat in the same restaurant as Members is, in my opinion, a little bit stupid.  It appears that we have reached the stage where the only people who are allowed to eat there are Members and their friends and the ushers.  This is a most extraordinary thing.  The ushers, at one time, were given one free meal a day in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely these are details that could be threshed out at the committee which looks after those things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried and my Party have tried to have these matters aired elsewhere and we have not succeeded.  Ultimately there is only one place where they can be cleared and that is across the floor of this <Col N="918" /> House.  Unless I am ruled out of order I believe I am in order in putting the matter to the Minister.  He will then have our side of the story and if he wishes to have it further investigated he can do so.  It was a Minister for Finance I understand&mdash;I do not know to which Government he belonged&mdash; who changed by order the system whereby the ushers were entitled to a meal per day in the House free of charge.  They got a substitution of 3/-per week.  We now have a situation where ushers and messengers of this House who are required to be on duty sometimes from 10.30 a.m. until after 11 p.m. have to buy two meals in our restaurant at the same prices as we pay. The meals may cost them over a £1 a day out of their wages.  I am quite sure they are not being paid enough to compensate them for that kind of thing.</P>
      <P>I want to compliment the Minister. I approached him some time earlier this year on the question of the way the pensions for the members of the staff were made up.  When the facts were put before him he had no hesitation in altering it to the benefit of the people concerned.  On their behalf&mdash;they have already done so&mdash;and on my own behalf, as I made a personal approach to him, I should like to say &ldquo;thanks&rdquo;. He met the matter in a very fair way.</P>
      <P>I should now like to refer to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and here we have a very fruitful field. The position about the Revenue Commissioners is that they must collect money, otherwise the State cannot be run.  Since PAYE was introduced a very substantial volume of money is being collected under that heading.  I asked the Minister earlier this year if there was a possibility of extending the income level of those who were working, particularly those who were badly paid, before PAYE deductions would be made, and the Minister said at that time he felt there was a case for increasing the allowances but if the allowances were to be increased it would be an awful lot of trouble to do what I suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that when the general level of wages in regard to rural labourers in <Col N="919" /> Ireland was £5 10s a week income tax was not deducted until they earned £6 5s.  Now that the general level is somewhere between £9 and £10 a week the income level is still £6 5s. I am sure the Minister will agree that is most unfair.  In addition to that there is a situation in which many things which should be considered for income tax purposes are not considered. I refer particularly to the question of people who have to travel long distances to work and have of necessity to use motor vehicles to do so.  They could stay at home and draw unemployment benefit for six months if they wanted to do so but they do not wish to do that.  Most people would prefer to go to work.</P>
    <P>It is a bit ridiculous when we find people who travel distances of 30, 35 and 40 miles to Dublin who get a week's wages and find, because they are single, even though they may have a mother housekeeping at home and younger brothers and sisters living with them they must pay tax on anything they earn over £6 5s. 0d.  Such a person gets no allowance for the motor vehicle which he must use or he gets no travelling allowance.  I am not going to delay on this because I feel the Minister will look into it.  He may not be able to do anything about it now but when the next Budget comes along I am sure this matter will receive attention.</P>
    <P>People who are maintaining a relative only receive a very small allowance. There is no point in saying that the allowance has been raised to £2, £2 10s or £3 a week.  Those people have to pay income tax at 7/- or 5s 3d, according to the way they are being taxed.  This is something which must be increased substantially.  Obviously the reason why it has not been increased up to now is that most of the income tax collected is being collected from the lower paid workers and for that reason the loss to the State would be substantial.  That should not be used as an argument for grinding them into the dust.  That is exactly what this is doing.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I mentioned to the Minister, which is something he should pay attention to, is the question <Col N="920" /> of State employees.  I do not know whether he knows that State employees are not on PAYE and they are not entitled to have deductions made weekly, the same as any other worker in the State.  Some time during the year the Department of Finance check up on those people in regard to income tax and the result is that they get bills for £60, £70, £80 and even £100, which it is alleged they owe.  This usually happens in mid-November and up to Christmas.  They are told that all this money must be cleared by 31st March. Those people pay income tax at the rate of 7/- in the £.  They cannot get the deductions which other people get. When I speak of State employees I include the Army, forestry workers and all such people.  They should all be on the same PAYE system.  The money should be collected weekly from those people and there would be no complaint that they were being asked to pay very substantial amounts of money when they cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the question of the accommodation in the income tax offices to the Minister.  He was courteous enough to write me a letter saying that he had the matter investigated and gave a reply.  The matter I raised was that if anyone went into one of the income tax offices in O'Connell Street in Dublin to have a form filled up the next door neighbour could be one of the biggest gossips in the country.  Such a person could be standing next door to the person filling up the form and could know all that person's business.  The Minister said at that time that the accommodation was very limited and that if it was possible to improve it at some time it would be done, that if the person requested he could be taken into a private room and answer the queries which have to be put to him.  It is not right that people should have to give information of a private nature while some other person can hear them.  The Minister asked at that time if there was a notice on the wall.  I knew the answer to that was that there was no such notice.  There are two slots there, such as you would find in an old-fashioned public house. When you inquire there you are not asked how much whiskey you want.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> You are asked how much you have and you are asked to hand it over.  This is something which is resented by a lot of people.  They do not want to tell the world what they have, and more important, what they have not got.  The Minister should make every effort to try to have a little more privacy for the people who go to transact their business there.  Those are all publicspirited people, who are not trying to defraud the State, but are going to make arrangements to hand over some of their hard-earned money to the State.  I am not saying that those people are not treated courteously by the staff there.  They are treated very courteously, but I believe they should be treated in a more private fashion than they are at the present time.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the Civil Service Commission, of which you, a Cheann Comhairle, are now the Chairman, on a number of occasions.  I am not going into detail about this now, but I want to make one point in regard to it.  I cannot understand if somebody goes forward for a job, is notified that he or she has passed, and is then notified that he or she is not suitable why this has to happen.  It is not fair that that system should be allowed to continue. Unless the Civil Service Commission are prepared to say why the person is not considered suitable, the person should be accepted.  I had a particular case recently of a postman who had been for years a temporary postman, and is still acting in that capacity, who was an applicant for a permanent position in the same town.  This man's medical record was all right.  He got seventh place in the examination but yet the Civil Service Commission decided that he was not suitable for the job.  His wife and himself had told everybody how lucky he was to get such a high place and they had to go back and tell those people that for some extraordinary reason he was not being accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>His Irish was not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It was good.  He could deliver letters in Irish and he could deliver them in English just as <Col N="922" /> well.  This is something which should be looked into.  If somebody is rejected after passing an examination and is refused appointment by the Civil Service Commission, they should tell the person why such refusal takes place.  It is not good enough just simply to say that such a person is not being accepted.</P>
      <P>Vote No. 12, Superannuation and Retired Allowances, is something which should receive attention from this Minister or from some Minister.  The retirement allowances for civil servants who retired a number of years ago are scandalously low.  Some adjustments have been made.  The former Deputy Dr. Ryan promised that they would get parity eventually but suddenly there was a stop and they have not succeeded in getting any further.  The cause of most of these problems is that employers whether in the Civil Service or anywhere else do not realise that the worker of today is the pensioner of tomorrow.  If they did there would be a much greater interest in the pension rights building up to which workers will be entitled when they eventually retire.  There is a story told about a trade union official who has now gone to his reward&mdash;to heaven, of course&mdash; who regulated in his own union an arrangement whereby nobody was entitled to get any higher than a certain rate of pension.  He did this rather vindictively because of someone who was going out before him and he wanted to ensure that that person would not get too much.  His own vindictiveness prevented him from getting a pension he normally would be entitled to.</P>
      <P>This has happened in the Civil Service for a different reason.  The Minister might think we are looking at this because the older people are gradually dying out and the older civil servants are becoming tired of the fact that they are not being treated fairly in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Secret Service generally.  I do not know what amount they get but the amount is getting smaller and smaller.  The story is that if you look around a parish and see a fellow drinking all day and who never works people come to the conclusion <Col N="923" /> that he is paid by the Secret Service.</P>

      <P>On this question of the Secret Service if, as was the general idea some years ago anyway, this money was being spent on people to simply give information to the guards, the less of it there is the better.  It is getting smaller but the smaller it is the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other matters which come up under different headings to which I do not wish to refer. However, I should like to refer to decentralisation.  There is apparently a school of thought in this country that Dublin is over-spilling, that there are too many people living in Dublin and we must do something about moving them out.  While there may be a certain amount of justice in the suggestion that something like this has to be done, the statement which is made by the Minister in his opening address here and the reason why it is suggested that the civil servants will be moved to the West, which is a different thing, is hardly one which we <Col N="924" /> would be prepared to consider.  The third paragraph on page 15 says:</P>
    <P>This decision was taken in the wider context of the Government's policy for regional development. The decentralisation of the administration, commerce and industry of the country to the greatest extent possible has always been an essential part of the programme of the present Government and their predecessors.  The Government are determined to do whatever is feasible to redress the imbalance of population in the country.  They are particularly concerned to revitalise the west of Ireland by action on a wide and imaginative scale. </P>
    <P>There was not very much imagination in a Minister of State deciding that he would move his Department with the assistance of his colleagues down to his own town which is hundreds of miles away from where the centre of Government is.  I do not think anybody would suggest that moving a Department of State to Castlebar, to take one case in point, will make up the people of Castlebar.  These Civil Servants will have to be housed, offices will have to be provided and schools will have to be provided.  I do not know whether the Minister realises this or not.  When a big number of people move into an area there is a social problem involved because the youngsters growing up will require some type of employment.  We had an example of it when the trek was the other way, when Ministers for Lands from Connaught moved hundreds of families from the West into County Meath.  Every one of them I met told me they were promised that as soon as they arrived, apart from houses and farms, there was to be plenty of employment for their children. The only jobs there were those the natives of the place had and the only way the migrants could get these jobs was by the natives becoming unemployed. The same situation is bound to develop if a big number of families move to Castlebar and attempt to live there and get jobs, because they can only get the jobs there from the people who are already working there.  I understand work there is not as plentiful as it might be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> The biscuit factory which Mr. Lemass was to send has not arrived yet.  Perhaps he will send it down with the Department of Lands.  If industry were started in the area I could see some reason in it.  But, I frankly cannot see any reason why it should be decided to move so far from the centre of Government an entire Government Department.  It must mean that a certain part of that Department will have to remain in Dublin and there will be numerous trekkings backwards and forwards from Dublin to the area and I can see no reason why this type of exercise should be entered into.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why they should go because many of them have paid for their houses and many are paying in instalments, and they should not be put in the position of having to sell their houses and attempt to restart their lives again particularly among strangers. Children going to school will have to be taken from their schools and children in jobs will have to go into digs or leave their jobs.</P>
    <P>A statement has been made by the Minister that there has been consultation. This is the point I want to get at. Consultation is, I find as a trade union official, with a representative of a Department of State, a one-sided discussion. You can go and report to an official of the Department; you will be listened to very patiently and that is it. They then make a unilateral decision and you get no opportunity of appealing. There is no system of appeal. There is nothing you can do except take what they give and this is the sort of consultation, I understand, which has been given to certain of those people who are threatened with removal to Castlebar.  Others, too, including Deputy Richie Ryan, and I am not stealing his thunder on this, made reference to it in the House today when he referred to a section of the lower paid workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>I have seen the Minister and his Government looking after certain poor people before.  I know what will happen.  We saw what happened when the Land Commission offices went on fire in the middle of the night when a couple of old ladies who were cleaners saved thousands of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt they are.  The trouble about it is that these old ladies were offered about 50/- apiece, and they were supposed to have been offered a wonderful amount.  If that was the type of consideration they got then does the Minister suggest he will bring them to Castlebar or pension them off?  Perhaps they will be offered a little office somewhere else if somebody dies in the meantime.  I have seen too much of this in my time and I suggest the Minister must think up a better answer than the one he has just given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to Athlone.  I know Athlone pretty well.  They have got a housing problem there, too, and they have got a job problem there, also. What is it proposed to do about them? What will these people who go down do?  It has been suggested that most of them are junior officers, young boys and girls.  Must they stay in hotels and pay there all they get in wages?  Some of them had to do it in Dublin when they first began.  The whole thing would need to be looked at very carefully. Taking in a few representatives of the association, listening to them and then letting them out and taking a decision without further reference to them is not any type of consideration.  It is not sufficient and it will not be accepted.  I know the Minister and the Government can wave the big stick and say if they do not go they will lose their pensionable jobs.  The Minister will be <Col N="927" /> amazed at the numbers who will opt out of the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>I am not.  I am sticking to one.  I am challenging the Ministers for Lands and Education to take the people of either town and see if they are prepared to give the wonderful welcome to the idea it has been suggested will be given.  I wonder if either Minister has ever considered that there are people in every county who have got used to the idea that the centre of Government is in the capital city&mdash; that that is where they expect to find it; and that people coming to the city to call at one Department will, during their day in Dublin, call to other Departments.  Is it suggested now that they should come to Dublin to call at the Department of Health, then travel to Castlebar to call at the Department of Lands and on the way stop at Athlone to visit the Department of Education?  In Brazil they moved the House of Parliament to a new city which they built.  They moved the banks and they arranged for planes to go out every 20 minutes from Rio de Janeiro.  They found it more difficult to get quorums than we do in this House.</P>

      <P>Then the Minister must have moved in the same circles he moves in in Dublin.  I went <Col N="928" /> out there and I went to see the people. I can produce evidence from people who have returned recently.  Of course, Sir, this is not on the Estimate.  I shall conclude by saying that the decision taken by the Government in regard to devaluation was one which in my opinion they could not have avoided taking.  However, saying that devaluation will not mean a substantial increase in the cost of living, that it will not disrupt trade and commerce, is not facing facts or telling the truth, because it must be obvious to everybody that it will have very serious effects.  Therefore, the Minister and the Government must make up their minds that not only will they have to alleviate the conditions of the social welfare classes but that they must also be prepared to give to their own employees, whose incomes are subject to Ministerial sanction, substantial increases.</P>

      <P>I thought he was very much his old self&mdash;calm, cool and confident.  Of course, impressions differ, but Deputy Sweetman was of the same impression.  The Government were criticised for not having rushed the debate.  I take the reverse view.  They waited until the facts were better known, until the effects could be appreciated fully, until they could be assimilated. I regard that as a prudent attitude. They have been accused of following the British line slavishly. This is a rather stupid attitude to take when we know that so many of the world exchanges also re-adjusted themselves with Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sterling is a reserve currency in world trade so why many of the other countries did not re-adjust beats me. Certainly this country must have taken notice, seeing that Japan and many other countries saw fit to do so. Devaluation is only one of the facts of financial life.  It is what somebody in some other exchange is prepared to <Col N="929" /> pay for unsupported sterling at its normal rate.  It is a reflection of the competitive ability of England and ourselves to participate in world markets: it expresses our competitive efficiency.</P>
    <P>Goods leave the factories at certain prices.  They arrive in Germany or Italy at another price and the difference between the factory prices and the prices in Italy is the measure of the margin of the wholesaler and the retailer.  If that price has gone up it must be devalued.  That is the essence of devaluation.  There has been discussion here about the rise in the cost of living but I do not think some people have got the right end of it.  The average hard currency import content of the total product in England is 25 per cent.  In terms of the 16.7 per cent dollar charges, it represents a rise in England of three to four per cent in prices all round.  In other words, the products would be three or four per cent dearer because of the impact of the hard currency imports on the total product of the country.</P>
    <P>I have not got the figures.  Possibly the Minister has them.  In a country like England which imports vast quantities from hard sterling countries the impact is far greater than it is here.  I would hazard a guess that in this country where the gross national product is made up of agricultural items grown on the land the overall increase would be in the region of the two to three per cent envisaged by the Minister. By any calculation, that is all I can see in it.  It is all right to take individual items where the difference might be two shillings but these do not add up to an overall rise in the cost of living.  I would assess the increase in our case as being in the region of two per cent.</P>

      <P>I am reasonably satisfied from my own independent deductions, by comparisons with figures I have got, which can be read in any economic journal, of the possible increase in English consumer prices and English export prices, that in our case the figure would be two per cent.  These increases, provided there is no vast cashing in on stocks, take some time to come into effect. We have been very fortunate in that our exports went up by 30 per cent in the first nine months of this year. That is extremely good in a country exporting mainly to an economy which was in certain difficulties.  This 14.3 per cent devaluation will not affect our trade with England in the slightest.  It will help our trade with foreign countries.  We are not going to get the 14.3 per cent but will be getting two per cent or three per cent and there may be other factors.  No exporters can hope to get the full amount.  There is a calculation that for every one per cent decrease in the price of exports there is a two per cent increase in volume.  That is the stimulus.  That is the shot in the arm.  Devaluation like this will have eroding effects in other quarters.</P>
      <P>There is one warning that I could give which is contained in that Left weekly called the <i>New Statesman.</i> Any of the Labour front bench would know where the <i>New Statesman</i> stands.  In the <i>New Statesman</i> of 24th November, 1957, it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important task in the next few months will be to keep the <Col N="931" /> rise in prices within reasonable limits and to prevent any rises in wages from wiping out the competitive advantage that devaluation has secured for our exports.</P>
    <P>It does not preclude increases in wages. It says &ldquo;to prevent any rises in wages from wiping out the competitive advantage&rdquo;.  To my mind that is the problem that is before us, now that devaluation is a fact of life.  We have to have it like any other country.</P>

      <P>Diogenes, be silent.  An improvement in real wages does not necessarily mean very much higher wages.  Greater productivity is the key to the matter.  One statement has been made which is worth repeating, that is, that this devaluation as far as we are concerned should be accompanied by a certain measure of reflation, a certain loosening of bank credit to producers, agricultural and industrial. In that way the volume of exports can be increased so as to take full advantage of the present position.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> We have to agree in general with the necessity for devaluation when Britain devalued last Saturday, for two very special reasons: first of all, the economic reason, the fact that 75 per cent of our trade is with Great Britain; and the second reason, a financial one, that 90 per cent of our external reserves are in sterling currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our economic or trade dependence on Britain is something for which, I suppose, nobody can be blamed.  All of us here would like to have our trading position more diversified and, indeed, efforts have been made since the State was founded to do that, to secure markets elsewhere and not to be entirely dependent on our trading position with Great Britain.  In the event, that has not transpired and we are now very much in the same position as we were many years ago, not very much advanced in securing <Col N="932" /> alternative markets although at one time there were people who seemed to think that if they shouted long enough and loud enough alternative markets would be found overnight. These men have become older and wiser and now realise that getting alternative markets is not as simple a process as they professed to think.</P>
    <P>As regards having our reserves 90 per cent in sterling, the point has been made today from this side of the House that we should have diversified these sterling assets over the past few years, that we should have taken the necessary legislative power to do so.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> She has become orientated to the orient as regards her trade over a number of years and her exports and imports with Britain have fallen.  Even allowing for the fact that 75 per cent of our trade was with Britain, apparently, there has been no very substantial reason why we should not have rectified that position before now.  I am not going to go as far as Deputy MacEntee went, apparently.  Some years ago when he spoke of shyster debtors, describing the devaluation of 1949.</P>
      <P>Devaluation, whatever way you look at it, is unpleasant.  Any country which practises a reserve currency, and which devalues, is welshing upon those countries which placed their trust in that currency as a reserve currency. Whether or not they should be blamed for that trust is another thing.  The point is these countries have been deceived and their currencies, if they did not devalue, must be written down.</P>
      <P>I do not know what determined the rate of devaluation, the 14.3 per cent. It could have been 13 per cent, 15 per cent or 17 per cent.  It was presumably based on some piece of arithmetic by some economist or some civil servant behind the scenes.  I understand the International Monetary Fund had a round figure of 13 per cent and I fail to understand why the British should have decided on a figure of 14.3 per cent in this metric system age.  There may be some specific reason for it.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I do not know whether our devaluation should have proceeded on lines exactly similar to those adopted by the British. I do not believe our figure should have been something under the British figure but it might have been better to devalue at slightly over the British figure. However, these are technical points.  We have devalued.  We had no alternative because of our economic and financial dependency on Britain, and now we must live with it, so to speak.</P>
      <P>With regard to diversification of our reserves, sterling has, in my opinion, received a severe blow because of this devaluation.  Two devaluations in a space of 18 years are a bit heavy.  There was another devaluation in the early 1930's.  I believe sterling will continue as an international currency and the London money market will continue to give the service, perhaps in an attenuated form, that it did in the past, but it is open to doubt whether sterling will ever again come back as a reserve currency. Gold or the dollar is the more likely.  There is a war between the dollar and gold at the moment and it is difficult to see what the outcome will be, but sterling has received a severe blow to its prestige, a blow from which I do not think it will recover in our lifetime.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister, when he comes to reply, to give us some concrete figures.  I should like to know what this devaluation will cost us in foreign borrowings, the Reichsmark and the dollar.  What will be the net loss on these borrowings as a result of devaluation?  The Minister should be able to give us some fairly accurate figures on that.  He might be able to give us approximate figures on the losses that may arise from purchases in non-devalued countries.  In the first seven months of this year 35 per cent of our imports were from countries which have not devalued.  What will we lose in our having to pay higher prices from our external reserves for our imports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be some confusion about the effect of devaluation on the <Col N="935" /> cost of living and on prices generally. I have not been able to follow the discussion.  Neither did I understand the discussion on television.  It is claimed that the cost of living will not increase by more than two per cent.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister in his television interview gave a very simple little formula.  He said the 35 per cent of our imports were from the non-sterling area and he took 14 per cent of that and he arrived at a figure of two per cent.  I do not know how accurate his calculation was. Economics is a dismal science and these figures very often turn out in practice to be completely wrong.  The Second Programme for Economic Expansion is a classic example of that and no doubt the Minister will in future eschew any reference to quantitative projections or prognostications. Obviously, he has lost faith in economists' calculations and prefers to deal now with things in rather general terms.  However, if we accept the claim that the cost of living will rise by only two per cent, I cannot reconcile that percentage with the Minister's own brief.  He says in his brief:</P>
      <P>Among the principal commodities which we import from non-devaluing countries are crude and partly-refined petroleum, wheat (imports of which vary according to our own harvest experience), coal, fertilisers and certain animal feeding stuffs, tea, tobacco, certain fresh and dried fruits, wines and brandy and various raw materials.</P>
      <P>In regard to some of these commodities, such as tobacco, the greater part of the price is accounted for by taxation. I do not know if the Minister proposes to reduce the tax on petrol in order to keep down the price.  With regard to tea, Ceylon has devalued while India has not.  It is difficult to know what the position will be.  Tractor fuel and machinery in general will cost more whether or not they come from non-devalued or devalued countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not do the ostrich and maintain there will not be a cash outflow from this country.  On another occasion when there was a big difference <Col N="936" /> in the bank rate here and in Britain there was not a substantial cash outflow, but we are today living in more sophisticated times and, while it is possible the present rate is temporary, there is a substantial difference between 4¾ per cent here and six per cent in Britain.</P>
    <P>At a time when it is possible that there may be a more severe outflow of capital from here than obtained in previous times, that nearly two per cent of a difference is something that may influence people to remove their capital from here to Great Britain and that will give us scarcer money here.  He did not mention the cost going up in such matters as Aer Lingus, where already it has gone up, the ESB or CIE nor did he advert to wage demands and their inflationary effect over the next 12 months or so.  It is a situation which we must face as being likely to arise.  Already the rumblings are there of increased demands to meet increased costs.  All of these are factors, accumulating factors.  I do not know how, by a simple mathematical formula, the Minister can tell us that the cost of living will not increase more than two per cent.</P>
    <P>When the last devaluation took place, I understand that prices did not increase for about a year but other factors may have been operating as well.  I do not know if food subsidies were in operation at that time.  That would be a substantial factor.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> There was also the fact that a different Government were in office.  We can only hope that this Government will be able to hold our rising cost of living to that two per cent.  If we add it to the rate of cost of living increase which has been going on now for a number of years we shall probably have a fairly substantial increase in the cost of living.  If we add three per cent or perhaps four per cent to the basic increase which, all along the line, has been accruing, it is very doubtful if the Minister's notion of two per cent will, in fact, hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested, as one of the benefits arising from this devaluation, <Col N="937" /> that there may be improved investment possibilities here.  That is a difficult question to judge because we have to consider the situation that exists in countries which are not devaluing.  I do not know what conditions might arise in a country such as Germany or France.  I very much doubt if, by virtue of our circumstances, there is a great possibility of improving investment from America in the next 12 months.  She is passing through her own difficulties.  She has a Vietnam war on her hands.  She has a rush on her gold reserves.  She has balance of payments difficulties.  Congress has proved very sticky about giving President Johnson any tax increase.  Therefore, she will have to withdraw her reserves and her money from abroad and will probably have to pursue a policy of cutting down on investment outside her own country.  On that basis, although financial investment in this country would seem only a drop in the ocean to the United States, the possibilities of American investment here might not be too favourable in the coming year.  I do not know what the position might be as regards other non-devaluing countries such as Germany but that would seem to be the position as regards the United States.</P>
    <P>It is claimed that this deflation will help our exports.  That may be so, if we are able to grasp what limited opportunities are provided.  This 14.3 per cent devaluation means that we shall be selling at £86 and buying at £116.  Roughly, that is what it means. It is not a clear equation.  That refers to countries which have not devalued and, of course, most of the bigger countries have not devalued.</P>
    <P>Against that, these advantages arise only in respect of countries which have not devalued.  Three-quarters of our business being with the United Kingdom, we shall be trying to export to a country which is deliberately deflating because, devaluation plus the other credit mechanisms which she has put into operation, will clearly be deflationary.  The removal of our export subsidies, and general measures which she has taken, will deflate the British economy.  We must face the fact that <Col N="938" /> our greatest customer in respect of our exports&mdash;Great Britain&mdash;will be a depressed market for probably a considerable time to come.</P>
    <P>Consider our exports to non-devaluing countries such as the United States and EEC countries.  If our exports are, say, 25 per cent, or perhaps the figure the Minister gives of 20 per cent exports to the non-devaluing countries, we must remember that, in respect of all of these countries, we have had, I think, a continuous negative balance of trade. Therefore, we are trying to improve our position with countries where we are selling cheaper and buying dearer and, at the same time, we have had a negative trade balance with those countries.</P>
    <P>I do not see how that type of trading will help us until such time as we get over the summit&mdash;if we can&mdash;until such time as we run at par in terms of trade with them or until such time as our exports to are greater than our imports from those countries.  If that should happen, we will benefit.  That is a long-term view.  In the short-term view, I believe it is quite likely that we shall have a very difficult time.  There is the added factor that in our exports to the devalued countries, like Great Britain, which as I have mentioned, will have a depressed economy, we will be trying to export goods in which we will not have that 14.3 per cent advantage.  It is estimated in respect of Great Britain, and this I believe is a very firm figure, that all she can hope for as an improvement in her exports is an eight per cent advantage when everything is taken into account, the increased cost for raw materials, increased transport and so on.  That eight per cent might be eroded if she is not able to resist price and wage demands towards the end of the year. If Britain can only expect an eight per cent advantage through her industrialists, can we expect that our industries will have more than eight per cent?  With our relatively undeveloped industrial arm it is doubtful if our industrialists will have even an eight per cent advantage accruing to them from devaluation.</P>
    <P>Again, in the first eight months of this year our imports from the non-devaluing <Col N="939" /> countries, according to the Minister, were 45 per cent of our total imports.  Even allowing for switching of our imports to Great Britain, or even to some home manufacturers here, and even allowing for a certain reduction which foreign manufacturers might make to improve their competitive position to combat devaluation, we will still have to pay more for our imports. The remainder of our imports will have to come chiefly from Britain.  As I said already, British industrial costs will go up, they will go up by the difference between this eight per cent and the 14.3 per cent which she gets by devaluation. It is probable that the full costs will go up by six or seven per cent by virtue of the increased prices she will have to pay for her manufactured goods and so will ours.  Therefore, both from the countries which have devalued and from those which have not devalued, we will pay increased charges for our imports.  These considerations are enough to show that devaluation is going to put considerable strains upon our economy.</P>
    <P>There is a further factor arising when you come to examine the countries which have devalued and those which have not.  The position would seem to favour Great Britain.  If there is any advantage tradewise in devaluation for Great Britain she has it with the big industrialised countries which have not devalued.  We are not in the same strong economic position to take the same advantage as Great Britain.  On the other side of the picture, there is agriculture in which we would be interested.  It should be noted that two countries which have devalued are two important suppliers of agricultural goods to Britain, Denmark and New Zealand.  The fact that these have devalued is not so nice for us and it would have been better if Denmark had not devalued even though it was only by eight per cent.  New Zealand has devalued by 19 per cent.  Admittedly we do gain a little from the Argentine and a few other places but the two serious competitors we have, Denmark and New Zealand, have devalued.  New Zealand has devalued even more than we have.  As I said already, if there had <Col N="940" /> been any question of what level we should have devalued to I would have said 15, 16 or 17 per cent rather than 10 or 12 per cent.  New Zealand has seen fit to devalue to 19 per cent and Denmark, whose economy is more diversified and is not so dependent on Britain, has devalued to eight.  These are important considerations and nullify considerably any advantage which otherwise we might have in the British market as regards agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is one point which the Minister might clarify for me.  It is in regard to agricultural exports to the continent, to the EEC countries.  It would seem that here now is an advantage, that a 15 per cent devaluation would be practically equivalent to the Kennedy Round, that here we are in the Common Market without getting in, and despite de Gaulle, but I understand that this is not going to be the position and that they have some system of adjustable levies in regard to agricultural products and that it would seem we are not going to gain anything in particular as regards our continental agricultural exports through devaluation.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> If I have criticism to make of the Government and the Minister it is on two grounds.  The first I have mentioned, their failure to diversify our reserves and the second is their failure to loosen up our economy.  We have sustained two long, sad years of economic depression since 1965, a depression induced by ourselves.  We have nobody to blame on this occasion.  We cannot blame John Bull.  We have to blame the mismanagement of our affairs which led to quite unnecessary inflation followed by very necessary deflation and so panic-stricken have our Administration <Col N="941" /> become that they have allowed deflation to carry over too far.  This is particularly apparent now when the home-grown Lemass deflation, or the post-Lemass deflation, is to be followed by an imported Wilson deflation. We have got one dose of deflation and I do not think our economy can be improved by the second dose of imported deflation from Great Britain. Therefore, I think there is considerable merit in the case being pressed by Fine Gael that every effort should be made now to offset as far as possible the impact which the deflation of the British economy will have on us.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that British devaluation was never very far from the surface in recent years.  In other words, the Minister has said he was aware that devaluation was just around the corner. He has been so aware, and presumably so have the Government, for many years.  I realise that this Government in 1965 had to introduce deflationary measures because expenditure had outrun productivity, mainly due to the intervention of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, who for base political reasons some months before two important by-elections, started the merry-go-round which led to the economic difficulties&mdash;economic difficulties which were not evident until after the general election.  Neither people nor countries get poor overnight.  We were suddenly faced with the austerity measures of June and July, 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having carried through the corrective measures necessary then, surely it should have been obvious to the Government and their economic advisers that if Britain devalued, apart altogether from the other package measures introduced with devaluation, it set a climate for deflation.  Irish economists and the Government should have foreseen that.  It should have been an incentive to them to refrain from deflating our economy for two and a half years longer.  Precautions should have been taken at least 12 months or one and a half years earlier.  If that had been done, the deflationary dampening down of our economy which will now occur &mdash;it cannot be altogether avoided because of the deflation Britain finds it <Col N="942" /> necessary to introduce&mdash;could be over-ridden.</P>
    <P>It is a question of too late and too little.  The Government were in a panic and, having once put on the brakes, they were afraid to let go lest they might find themselves in a second cycle of inflation and panic.  If they were as wise over the past three or four years in respect of devaluation and knew it was coming, they should have foreseen its effects and should have immediately relaxed in some measure the deflationary measures here, so that now they would not be faced with the position of a foreign introduced deflation following on the home-grown product sown here by Deputy Lemass three or four years ago.</P>

      <P>In this debate we are seeking to bring to the floor of the House some of the problems that should be discussed at this time in regard to the devaluation of the British pound.  Many people in the present Government are critical of the attitude of mind which would have Dáil Éireann discuss such matters.  There are many people who would say that in the higher realms of finance the State has civil servants better qualified than the average Deputy to deal with such arcanal matters.  Possibly such people can do the necessary things for us, but those of us concerned about democracy in this country would like to see the importance of this Legislature emphasised at such times and, as far as possible, the deliberations leading to such important decisions brought to the floor of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kind of debate which has gone on in the country in regard to devaluation has centred around its inevitability. There has been a remarkable absence of discussion of alternative courses, or even a suggestion that any other course was open to the Government.  While the decision of the British Government to devalue has been met by the Tories in Britain with complete criticism, there has not been in this country a great volume of opinions which has discussed this matter in any distinct fashion from the way Government spokesmen have.  All of this is eloquent evidence that the utter dependence of <Col N="943" /> this country's economy on the British is now accepted on all sides here.  So much so, that it was accepted implicitly in the Minister's statement from the very first line.  In the modern world nobody denies the interdependence of one economy on another.  With larger world markets this is an important and unavoidable fact.  But the whole question turns on the degree of dependence of any economy on another.  I do not know of any other example of a country of our size, in any part of the developed world at least, in which that economy is so utterly and cravenly dependent as we are on the British economy.  Nobody looking at the Irish situation would have said we needed devaluation.  Nobody looking at the facts of our economy would have said we needed deflation.  Both these steps and, indeed the deflationary measures the Government have taken over the past two years, have been brought about by policies that were necessary to the British economy.</P>
    <P>The latest devaluation step has been brought about by the international sickness of sterling as a currency and not by any domestic circumstances in this country.  It is extraordinary to find a Minister defending the step of devaluation as though in fact it had been a creation of Government policy in this country.  I feel sad that the Finance Minister of any Irish Government should have won the international race for devaluation as we did, stepping in one minute after the British Chancellor had given us his orders in this respect.  It is an unenviable position that we should have been first in this respect.  I do not know if the Fiji Islands followed after us, but we were 60 seconds after the British Chancellor in our declaration of devaluation.</P>
    <P>It is important that this matter be discussed now in view of the fact that there will be very severe repercussions arising from this decision on events next year and the year after.  From what I can see of the position it is not in accordance with the facts to suggest that the cost of living arising out of devaluation can be limited to a mere two per cent.  While one may prove to one's satisfaction statistically that <Col N="944" /> the cost of living will rise by two per cent, we have suggested here in these benches that we shall not be at all surprised to find that this cost-of-living increase in the months ahead amounts to something like six per cent; certainly the figure of a two per cent increase in prices put forward by the Taoiseach is not a realistic forecast of the price increase in the cost of living in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>In this situation the Minister makes the point that if we are to enjoy the full advantage which he claims arises for this country as a result of devaluation, unit costs must be kept down, and, of course, the unit costs that he may try to keep down are wages.  Here we must point out that the pendulum is swinging towards a demand by people who earn wages and salaries for a compensatory increase in their earnings to offset the obvious increase in the cost of living which is coming.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the existing legislative machinery on prices will be strong enough to control price increases in the months ahead.  We shall need to be extremely vigilant to see that there is not an extremely vicious race between prices and wages.  If there is to be a movement on the wages front we must see to it that the major part of this movement does not result in a vicious circle, with rapidly increasing price rises following on wages increases.</P>
    <P>Devaluation has undoubtedly brought problems to our economy.  It has brought losses to many people in this country; we have lost a great deal of our investment abroad.  The argument has been made that we are being given a certain amount of export competitiveness.  However, such competitiveness can in many ways be exaggerated.  In Britain manufacturers are crying out that they do not see how this great competitiveness can be fully exploited.  We can see ourselves that it will not be a great advantage in regard to certain exports.  For instance, there will be increased freight charges between this country and overseas. That is one element on the prices front that is already moving ahead very rapidly.  I hope the Minister will be able to give some of his ideas on these increases in freight charges, because <Col N="945" /> undoubtedly freight charges have a great influence on our export competitiveness.</P>
    <P>If we are entering&mdash;as I think we are and as the Minister must be aware we are&mdash;a period of agitation on the economic front arising out of the increase in the cost of living, one may well ask and, I suppose, in vain: what exactly has happened to the policy enunciated at the time of the last wage agreement, when the Government claimed that an incomes policy would bring some kind of stability to wages and prices?  I suppose one may look for the re-emergence of this idea in Government circles and we shall discover that they still have a mysterious incomes policy.</P>
    <P>One regrets that in the years since the last movement on the wages front nothing whatever has been done on the NIEC suggestion of the full implementation of an incomes policy. We therefore are in the same position as we were some years ago when in their pamphlet <i>Closing the Gap</i> the Government indicated their attitude towards wage increases.  We are in the same position today that we must protect our unit costs; in other words, hold wages at their present level when prices are moving away, and when other items, dividends and so on, are also moving away from their moorings at a very rapid pace.</P>
    <P>One of the things one regrets in this devaluation question is the almost total absence of any financial control by means of a monetary policy by the elected authority of this State.  I know this is an old chestnut, but it is regrettable that there appears to be so little we can do by way of adopting a distinctive monetary policy that would suit conditions in our country.  One can exaggerate the importance of a monetary policy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the general economic policy, but undoubtedly it has a part to play in the creation of full employment, and it is regrettable that this great weapon is not at the disposal of any Minister for Finance in this State.  It seems that our Minister is merely the caretaker for the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Whatever one's <Col N="946" /> politics it is regrettable that this should be the situation.</P>
    <P>Since it appears to be accepted conventional wisdom that the most healthy future for this country is to be one capital market with Britain, one labour market with Britain, one wage market with Britain, one price market with Britain, there is very little one can do to influence matters of a monetary or fiscal nature in any direction that would benefit the domestic circumstances of this country.  As long as we accept this utter dependence of our economy on that of the British&mdash;I do not say connection but utter dependence&mdash;there appears to be very little we can do about the level of our bank rate.  It appears to have to keep in extremely close step with that of Britain, and the rate of interest in general also has to keep in step and in close unison with that of Britain.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that our problems are completely different, that here we have had a unique position.  For a great many years now we have had a very large pool of unemployment, far more percentagewise than would be tolerated in Britain.  In fact, as we know, devaluation was forced on the British Government in an attempt to escape increasing the percentage of unemployment, a percentage which had brought that Government to defeat in several by-elections. We can understand that in an attempt to save the percentage of unemployment from growing in Britain the decision to devalue was taken. Whether that decision to devalue will in fact save them from further severe financial measures is an open question. Certainly whether stability will be reached in the international money markets is an open question from the evidence this week-end.  It would be extremely imprudent to suggest that is the end of a series of economic actions on the part of the British Government.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it appears that we accept willingly, and without any criticism, and without any feeling that we are tying our hands to a great degree, the inevitability of our being tied hand and foot to Britain's <Col N="947" /> economy.  It is evident from the lack of comment on this move that this is being more and more accepted by economists and people who generally comment on economic matters in the press.  We have had a great deal of literature and a great deal of economic planning so far as text books are concerned. There has been a great deal of paper planning but I suggest that we will lose a great wealth of management in our modern economy if we do not examine once more the question as to whether we are wise to abdicate responsibility in matters of monetary and fiscal policy, and whether we are wise in the long run if the Minister for Finance is in the position of being the manager of a branch bank who receives orders from head office.  That, I suggest, is the position of our Minister for Finance.  He is the branch bank manager of the Twenty-Six Counties for the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Bank of England.</P>
    <P>This interdependence between one economy and another is, I suggest, an extremely unhealthy state of affairs when we see the British economy embroiled in such difficulties, difficulties which are not of our making, difficulties which are substantially created by the international commitments <Col N="948" /> of sterling as a reserve currency. We are willingly putting ourselves at the mercy, at the second remove, of the speculators and so-called gnomes of Zurich by accepting uncritically our complete and utter dependence on Britain's economy.  I do not see how a full employment policy can ever be brought about if we do not re-examine this presupposition on the basis that one does not have to accept the political ideology of the left or the right to agree that one should have some control over one's fiscal and monetary policies.  We should consider whether the time has come when this is no longer to be regarded as a sacred cow and when our dependence on Britain's economy should be re-examined. Has the time come for us to consider in our changed circumstances what the minority report of the Banking Commission had to say? Has the time come to question the wisdom of people like Professor O'Brien on the Banking Commission in relation to sterling being tied to gold and tying our pound to Britain's pound in complete parity?</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 29th November, 1967.</P>

      <P>There is no record in my Department of the receipt of a completed form of application for a grant in respect of the heating and cleaning of the school in question for the year 1966-67.</P>
      <P>Forms of application for this grant were issued to school managers, for completion, towards the end of the school year.  Communications dated 24th October, 10th November and 15th November, 1967, were received from the manager of the school concerned regarding the non-payment of the grant.  On 15th November a duplicate application form was sent to the manager for completion.</P>
      <P>The grant will be paid without undue delay when the completed form has been received.</P>
