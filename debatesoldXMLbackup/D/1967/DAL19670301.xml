      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The County Leitrim Tourist Development Association recently asked me to receive a deputation to discuss the expansion of tourist development in that county.</P>
      <P>I explained to them in reply that under the Tourist Traffic Acts the provision of financial assistance for tourist development is entrusted to Bord Fáilte, that I do not intervene in regard to the allocation of funds between particular areas and that it would be most undesirable that I should make an exception in the case of any particular area.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied from discussions held at regular intervals with the Board of Bord Fáilte that the funds for area development, accommodation and other purposes are being allocated to the areas of tourist interest on a reasonable and fair basis.</P>
      <P>The Association should take up their problems with the North-Western Regional Tourism Organisation and with Bord Fáilte, as appropriate, from whom, I am satisfied, they will receive all possible assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2112" /> For the foregoing reasons, I do not consider that it would be either useful or appropriate for me to receive the proposed delegation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the number of postmen who have become redundant following the introduction of the motorised postal delivery service; the total cost of the reorganisation to date; and whether it is proposed to pay any compensation to the redundant postmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of postman posts suppressed to date under the current scheme for the motorisation of rural delivery services is approximately 190.  The men displaced were either taken on in a temporary capacity pending the introduction of motorised services or were over 65 years of age.  The question of redundancy payments would not therefore normally arise.  However, as indicated in a previous reply to the Deputy, this question is being considered in conjunction with proposed legislation for redundancy payments and resettlement allowances generally.</P>
      <P>The total cost figure requested by the Deputy is not readily available. However, the bulk of the cost of a capital nature involved has been incurred in the purchase of vehicles. This has amounted to £115,000 approximately since 1st April, 1963. The saving on the schemes introduced since then, on the basis of average costs over a number of years, is estimated at over £40,000 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell us the approximate length of time the temporary postmen were employed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a number of them, stretching from months up to about six years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that, as a <Col N="2113" /> result of this scheme, a number of people have failed to secure employment or have been thrown out of employment?  I refer to such persons as small farmers, small shopkeepers and others who had part-time employment as postmen at wages of £6, £7 or £8 a week, which was a very useful supplement to their income from their small business, holding or other occupation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not necessarily quite so.  The position is that no appointed person has been thrown out of employment due to motorisation. It is only when permanent vacancies arise that motorisation is introduced and, in fact, temporary jobs over a very short period are held down on a part-time basis until motorisation is introduced.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the society received a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited, but the relevant legislation precludes disclosure of the affairs of individual borrowers.</P>
      <P>The annual report of An Foras Tionscal for the year ended 31st March, 1966, indicates that a grant of £35,325 to the society had been approved by An Foras, of which £25,000 had been paid by the end of that year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that the effect of certain circulars issued by his Department recently will be either to increase the rents of local authority houses to an unbearable level, or to increase rates beyond the capacity of ratepayers; if he will make a statement on the matter; and whether he favours meeting any deficit arising by greater subvention from his Department or by increase of rents and rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent circular letters from my Department have emphasised the importance of ensuring that rent schemes are framed in such a way that no one in need of re-housing is refused it, or should suffer hardship because of inability to pay rent; and that tenants should pay rents related to their family and financial circumstances and the standard of the accommodation provided. The manner of application of these guide-lines is a matter for each housing authority in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The maximum subsidy from my Department towards the cost of a new serviced local authority house is at present equivalent to a capital grant of £1,100 or, at the current Local Loans Fund lending rate, to an annual payment of £87 a year for up to 50 years.  About 90 per cent of all new local authority houses qualify for this maximum subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2119" /> The subsidy paid from the rates by a local authority, in addition to the State subsidy, varies widely depending on the rent scheme adopted by the authority, but in most cases ranges from £40 to £70 a year, with a capital equivalent of from £505 to £881.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that rent schemes on the lines indicated would have the effects suggested by the Deputy.  The levels of subsidies from State and local sources must be determined with reference to the desirability of securing equity as between tenant, ratepayer and taxpayer.  It is only in this way that the maximum number of new houses needed can be financed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the total sum on which we pay subsidy is now £1,650 notwithstanding the fact that houses have been built in the past year which cost as much as £2,600, and more in Dublin?  The effect of this circular has been to create a state of affairs which is quite intolerable. Formerly the Central Fund paid subsidy on the full cost of the house and there is a difference now of £950.</P>

      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>It is assumed the Deputy is referring to grants under the Housing Acts.  My Department has no knowledge as to the membership of the NFA.  As I explained last week, where there is evidence of an illegal no-rates campaign by the NFA the inquiries which are now being made as to whether particular applicants for grants have paid their rates will almost inevitably result in delays in the payment of grants in certain cases.  Supplementary grants may not be made until the relevant State grant has been paid.  Local authorities have adequate statutory powers to deduct outstanding rates from supplementary grants payable by them.  The question of an instruction to county managers in this regard does not therefore arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available in my Department relates only to roadworkers employed by the county councils.  This information, in the form of a tabular statement, will, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, be circulated with the Official Report.  With regard to the second part <Col N="2122" /> of the Deputy's question, there is no formal machinery whereby local authorities could be required to negotiate collectively on a claim for a uniform rate of wages for their roadworkers. Each local authority is a separate employer and the negotiations of wages agreements is a matter in the first instance between them and their employees.  Local authorities, however, represented by the City and County Managers Association, do negotiate collectively on matters of common concern. The decision to adopt the terms of any agreements made on foot of such negotiations would, however, be a matter for each local authority and the decision in each case would be subject to my sanction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 to 38 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer Deputies to my reply yesterday to a question by Deputy Clinton in relation to unfounded allegations that prisoners were required to sleep in unheated cells.</P>
      <P>As I have already mentioned, none of the prisoners in question made any complaint to the Prison Governor or to the members of the Visiting Committee as to the prison conditions although each prisoner was informed of his rights in this regard.  On the day that the allegations were published by an NFA visitor to the prison a member of the Visiting Committee spoke to a number of these prisoners and recorded that he had found them happy and that he was satisfied that there was no foundation for the allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the allegations which I refuted yesterday, further allegations were made that the cells were dirty and that the food was served in unhygienic utensils and was so unpalatable <Col N="2138" /> that the prisoners were unable to partake of it.</P>
    <P>There is no truth whatsoever in these allegations.  Prison cells are in spotless condition when prisoners are allocated to them and it is the responsibility thereafter of each prisoner to keep his cell clean and tidy.  Fresh bed-clothes including four blankets are issued to each prisoner on reception and the bed linen is changed every week.</P>
    <P>As regards food the prison dietaries are prescribed in Appendix 1 of the General Prison Regulations 1953 and these dietaries are varied from time to time on the joint recommendation of the Governor and the Prison Medical Officer.  The present dietary provides for four meals a day.  The Rules require the medical officer to make frequent inspections of the food, both cooked and uncooked, and they also require the Governor to carry out daily inspection of the kitchen.  I may add that the bakery and kitchen have modern equipment and are kept in spotless condition.</P>
    <P>Members of a Visiting Committee of 12, appointed pursuant in statute, have a right to inspect the prison at any time, either individually or collectively, to examine the conditions including the cell accommodation, the dieting and cooking arrangements and to consider and report on any complaints of prisoners.  I am happy to say that the Members of the Mountjoy Visiting Committee are most conscientious in the discharge of their duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand considerable improvements have been made since this matter has been publicised. However, I understand the Minister to say yesterday that if he had an application from any of the Members of this House to inspect the cells he would gladly give that permission.  As he is aware, Deputy Esmonde and I went there yesterday and were refused permission to see the cells.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the grounds of courtesy, I gave permission to four Fine Gael Deputies to go to Mountioy yesterday to visit friends or constituents. <Col N="2139" /> I understand that the demand made by one of them on presenting himself was to see the prisoners at large and to inspect their conditions.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get this matter into perspective.  Deputies have no further rights than members of the public in regard to permission to visit Mountjoy or any other prison. I am certainly anxious to facilitate members and, very promptly yesterday, I acceded to a request from Deputies, but my confidence in that respect was not honoured.  I am prepared to facilitate any Member of this House in visiting relatives or constituents or going into the prison on genuine grounds.  At all stages I would take every humanitarian and logical factor into account in making such facilities available.  But I am not going to allow a prison of this State to be used as a centre of agitation by mischievous Deputies or mischievous members of the public.</P>

I understand that on his arrival there he wanted to present himself to the prisoners at large presumably with a view to organising some sort of group agitation or something of that kind.  This appeared to be the only purpose of his request, to interview the prisoners at large, and this I will not tolerate.</P>

I am quite prepared to accept, if that does not correspond with the Minister's recollection, that there may have been a misunderstanding as between them; but that is clearly the recollection of these Deputies and I think the Minister should accept it. While I am on my feet, might I ask the Minister if he is making arrangements to facilitate Deputies who wish to visit prisoners in Mountjoy, members of the NFA, will he ensure that similar facilities are extended to clergy who wish to make visits?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported last evening, I was speaking of the effects of certain factors on wage structures which invalidated wage increases. I pointed out that wages were affected by such things as the cost of living, tax increases and rent increases. If there are increases in the cost of living, in taxes in a Budget or an increase in rents, such as that which the Minister for Local Government has directed the city and county managers to put into effect, they take from the value of a wage agreement.  Therefore, it is only commonsense to expect that people on a low average basic wage&mdash; perhaps £9 a week might even be high &mdash;will seek some readjustment of their wages.  There is nothing the Minister or any Government can do to prevent that natural desire to retain at least as much purchasing power as they had at the time of the last agreement.  Telling them that there has been an increase of only two per cent in production and that they cannot expect to get more is not much use if the factors I have <Col N="2149" /> indicated have reduced their wages by four or five per cent.</P>
      <P>This question of production is not a one-sided matter.  I would say that the workers' part in increased production is the lesser factor.  Surely good management and good tools are required before production can be stepped up?  In my experience as a trade union official, I have always found that, provided there were the proper tools in the shape of improved machinery and so long as there was incentive, the management were well able to step up production, and indeed take a share of the profits arising from that increased production.  In the <i>Sunday Times</i> of a few weeks ago, there was the case of a shipbuilding yard in the north of England which over the past 15 years was blacklisted as the worst shipyard in Great Britain for strikes.  They fell so low that they were pretty well unable to complete a ship in anywhere near the regular period.  There were demarcation disputes between the various craftsmen. However, a new manager was brought in.  The first thing he did was to take out the filthy old tables and benches from the canteen.  He changed his foremen.  He brought representatives of the workers and trade unions for discussions weekly.  Now that yard is the best run shipyard in Great Britain. That had nothing to do with the workers, but was brought about by the manager.</P>
      <P>I suggest the Department of Labour would be doing much better if they endeavoured to promote between trade unions and employers such long-term agreements as the four year agreements signed between the unions and Aer Lingus and the unions and Messrs.  Guinness instead of threatening the unions that unless they did something even union leaders could not do&mdash;compel workers to accept unlimited restraint &mdash; he would be forced to introduce legislation to compel them.  The threat of the big stick will not be effective, but his Department have a useful part to play in the negotiations for long-term agreements between unions and employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trade unionists will admit that <Col N="2150" /> there is a multiplicity of unions catering for the one type of worker.  In that problem, too, the Minister has a function.  He will get co-operation from the unions.  I am sure he is aware that at present negotiations are going on between at least two unions to see if some form of federalisation or amalgamation can be effected.  Whatever difficulties there are&mdash;neither is my unions and I have no personal knowledge of this beyond what I read in the newspapers&mdash;I would suggest his officers would do well to approach these unions and offer their services to help bring about the proposed amalgamation at an earlier date than might otherwise happen.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party &mdash; and I think I can speak for the trade union movement also&mdash;welcome the establishment of this Department and the appointment of the present Minister. All I am afraid of is that he will allow his understanding of the problem, as indicated in his speech of 12 months ago, to be undermined by some people either inside or outside the Cabinet who would appear to be forcing him to take a tougher line and who hope it will be effective.  I do not believe it will.  Nobody wants a head-on clash with the Government, in particular workers endeavouring to do their jobs and to get the best pay possible.  We realise as well as anybody that any industry can pay out in wages only as much as will permit it to operate at some profit.  Industrialists do not run factories for fun; they run them for profit.  But it is understandable that workers, realising a firm has given increased dividends to directors and shareholders as a result of increased profits, would also seek their share of the increase.  As Deputy O'Leary said, the Minister and his Department should approach the unions and employers as a neutral, a go-between.  I think that should be the effect of his Department on the economic life of the country.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding with my remarks.  I want to say that I agree with Deputy Kyne so far as this is the responsibility of management and workers equally.  I think the Minister <Col N="2151" /> adverted to it at column 1431 of the Official Report, Volume 226, when he said that it was quite as much the responsibility of the employers as the workers.</P>
      <P>I think it is fitting to recall that the First Dáil in 1919 had a Minister for Labour.  I think the Second Dáil also had, and that Dr. Hillery had as one of his predecessors, Countess Markievicz.  It is right and proper that Fianna Fáil should resurrect this Ministry because the Dáil in 1919 was very forward-looking and had a fine social outlook.  The aims and the thinking of Connolly and Pearse are, I hold, inherited by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fitting that the Fianna Fáil Party should resurrect this Ministry of Labour.  Fianna Fáil have always introduced the most fruitful legislation with the help of Labour and I am sure that with their help, they will always bring in fruitful legislation. Now we come to the legislation concerning redundancy and resettlement, the Industrial Relations Bill and the Trade Unions Bill.  It is an impressive code of law and keeps up to date the work Fianna Fáil started in 1932 and which was envisaged in 1919 with the institution of the Ministry of Labour. Viewed in its proper perspective, it shows the continuity of thinking of Fianna Fáil on labour matters and confirms its right to be called a workers' Party&mdash;I am not saying &ldquo;the workers' Party&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We need not assume that this legislation will solve our employment problems.  The purpose of the agencies to be set up by the Minister is to fit and refit men and the placement services will strive to train available men for available jobs.  Legislation will not create jobs.  To use the Minister's words, and they are worth repeating:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of jobs depends on the acceleration of the rate of economic development which, in turn, depends on a variety of factors, including industrial peace, a sense of <Col N="2152" /> community responsibility and a realisation that costs must be competitive with costs elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Acceleration of the rate of economic growth is not exactly germane to this Estimate but it is sufficient to say that if any economic progress is to be achieved, it must be done by realising the basis of our economic situation now.  We are an open economy and exports are our livelihood.  In that connection, I should like to read the remarks made by Mr. Michael Stewart, Minister of Economic Affairs in England.  If one did not read the heading, one would think it was Dr. Hillery speaking.  Mr. Stewart said that time and again in the years since the war, growth had been halted by crises in Britain's balance of payments.  He said:</P>
    <P>If we are to break this shackle, we must produce more efficiently and we must ensure that there is not a sharp increase in wage costs which makes it impossible for us to sell abroad.</P>
    <P>That is very important for an open economy like ours.  He asked delegates to remember what happened in the first six months of 1966 when the wage and salary bill was 7.5 per cent higher than in the previous year but production of real wealth had risen by only 1.5 per cent.  He said:</P>
    <P>We all know in our hearts that our real standard of life depends on what we produce, but we cannot go on trying to enrich ourselves merely by paying each other higher money wages and charging each other higher money prices...We need not, we shall not, live always under standstill and severe restraint but we shall have to recognise as a permanent truth, that incomes, prices and productivity go together, and when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I do not mean merely the Government, I mean the whole nation.</P>
    <P>We could take those words for ourselves, words spoken by a Minister of a Labour Government in England where they are tackling the problems of their country with vigour and decision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2153" /> Class war was being preached by a good many speakers on the other side. I call it class war because organised labour as well as organised employers have as much economic power as anybody else.  The employer has the right to hire and fire, it has been said, but very often he has not the right to fire.  We are a small nation.  Everyone here is a worker or consumer or owner.  We are all in the one boat in a small homogeneous society and it is no use preaching class war.  I hope we are a sophisticated society and when the Minister speaks of a sense of community responsibility, I hope our education and sophistication will lead us to recognise what guidelines are and what the facts of life are.</P>
    <P>To come back to Mr. Stewart, he says:</P>
    <P>We must be certain that those efforts are not frustrated by small groups of people whose bargaining power is greater than their public spirit.  I know that a Labour Government will never be insensitive to the feelings and aspirations of the trade union movement.  I believe too that the trade union movement will realise that because it is now so great and so powerful it has responsibilities even wider than its responsibility to its own members&mdash; a responsibility positively to co-operate in making the whole economy work satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>He speaks about British economy lagging behind in production per hour and per week compared with the much more sophisticated and advanced American economy and how much Britain lags behind even Europe.  We are behind England and we also live by exports.</P>
    <P>Another criticism which was made here is what I call the Fine Gael criticism, the horse and water one: you can bring the horse to the water but you cannot make him drink.  I think that is hardly valid here because at column 1428 of the Official Report, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I have permitted these discussions to proceed at what has appeared to some to be an inordinate length.... I am now satisfied that the complete <Col N="2154" /> agreement of those interests cannot be reasonably be expected&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I do not see any threats in this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;I have therefore decided to propose to the Government the preparation of an Industrial Relations Bill and a Trade Union Bill which will reflect, firstly, the highest common factor of agreement reached and secondly, my own proposal on the matters on which agreement is not practicable but on which it is nevertheless necessary to promote legislation.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Tully will agree that the Minister must come up with his own proposal and would be failing in his duty as a member of the Government if he did not act and give a clear, unequivocal lead.  Collective bargaining has been criticised on both sides of the House.  I doubt if there was ever such a thing as free collective bargaining.  Take the case that happened in England where employers and employees, regardless of public interest, agreed on certain wages and terms and conditions of employment recently and then Mr. Jones's Prices and Incomes Branch had to declare invalid several of the agreements made by them, the two great believers in collective bargaining.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we cannot take a lesson from our neighbours, and from a Labour Government, we are sticking our heads in the sand.  The Minister has to have regard for the community interest and this legislation will reflect that end.  The goodwill must start in this House.  It is our job to see to it that the legislation finally passed does reflect the thinking of responsible people in this country.  Each one of us is a worker, a consumer and an owner of our house or of whatever else we may own.  This is where this House should reach that consensus of opinion. Let us not play politics with this legislation: it would be fatal to do so.  All this is useless, however, without growth and restraint.  It will be useless unless we can have a growth in our rate of economic development and unless restraint is shown in guidelines and accepting community responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to turn now from the general remarks I have made to the details of <Col N="2156" /> the Minister's speech.  I do not understand why there are not safety committees in every factory.  When the Act was passed in 1955, I was in charge of a factory where there were two joint chairmen, one of whom was the engineering foreman in charge of the factory.  When the factory inspector came, he asked for the members of the factory committee.  These safety committees can be very valuable from the point of view of increasing production.</P>
    <P>With regard to the training and retraining section of the Minister's speech, I am quite sure he is keeping in touch with the technical schools who are doing an excellent job by way of giving publicity to the careers boys can follow by going to the technical school &mdash;apprenticeship courses and, generally, guiding them in their careers.  Retraining is a difficult problem.  It will depend a lot on the age of the person and on his basic training.  However, in the years to come, young entrants to industry, even those now going through their apprenticeship courses, being guided in their careers, who lose their employment and have to be retrained will be better adapted.  Deputy Treacy said there will be no jobs for them but that is rather a nihilistic attitude.  We have to prepare for economic growth and educated workers.</P>
    <P>It was inevitable that the placement services had to be put in the employment exchanges.  The Minister said that a list would be kept of the attributes and skills of the various workers and that contact would be kept with employers.  It is not quite enough to keep contact.  The Minister cannot undertake to give jobs to people.  If we could get a few good public-spirited companies or employers who would make sure they would get the workers they need through the placement services and at the same time get their junior workers through the postprimary courses and technical courses, then, in time, we should find a well-educated industrial corps and this Department of Labour would be well integrated with industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>There is a bias at the present time against employment exchanges.  Employers should be encouraged to consider them not as unemployment <Col N="2157" /> exchanges but as employment exchanges. They would need to be redecorated and brightened up somewhat. Let us ensure that a person will have some hope when he enters a suitably decorated employment exchange rather than the down-at-heel type of place they are at the moment.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with the collection and dissemination of information is welcome but please let us have facts and statistics quickly rather than receive them after the horse has bolted.  As regards the use of the section for a development unit, it is difficult to imagine such a unit developing within the Department.  They might need to have the help or advice of some outside organisation or research body.  It is often difficult to organise oneself.  An information officer is a &ldquo;must&rdquo; to keep the lines clear between the Department and the public.  There is no doubt whatever about the functions of the Department or its standing in any particular matter.  I congratulate the Minister on this new Department.  He was accused today of being arrogant.  Well, arrogance sits easily on Deputy Dr. Hillery. The main thing before us is to await these two important Bills, the Industrial Relations Bill and the Trade Union Bill, and to see that they will leave this House as a reflection of the responsible and intelligent opinion of this country and that they can work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there are very many in this House who would agree with Deputy Treacy in his speech last night that new legislation would be out to abolish free bargaining.  We would all regret very much that there should not be free bargaining between employer and worker in industry.  After all, we have a free democracy here.  It is part of our way of life that we should have free bargaining.  Apart from that, my feeling, to a great extent, is that the Labour Court as it is set up and as it has been functioning during the past year or two is regarded by many as only a step in negotiations.  I feel the attitude in some instances may be: &ldquo;Send the dispute to the Labour <Col N="2158" /> Court and see what happens.&rdquo;  The Labour Court, then, is often used by some as just one step in trying to improve the claim.  I am sure this is borne out by the number of cases&mdash; 124 cases heard during the past year and 47 not settled.</P>
      <P>There should be more authority for the Labour Court.  It should appear as coming nearer to one of our own courts.  Nobody wants coercive measures but if both sides have full confidence in the Labour Court, there should be no necessity to refer the decision of the Court back either to the employers or the workers.  If either side is not satisfied with the case made by the representatives&mdash;whether employers or workers &mdash; then these representatives should be changed. That is where the main business comes in.  If those who send them there to represent them are not satisfied with the way they put up the case, then change the representatives at an opportune time such as a general meeting or some other time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said very recently that employers are inclined to be too soft and I understand that, the other night in Cork, he said that the avoidance of trouble can be purchased at too high a price.  I wonder if the Minister should reverse his face when giving his advice and turn instead to his own Government and not to employers?  Does the Minister think that any industry wants a strike?  If the Minister had experience as a member of a board of directors, he would know that the last thing in the world any industry wants is trouble.  Quite a number of them cannot afford trouble in their industry. If they have trouble in a particular industry that is not spread out over all the factories dealing with the commodities produced by that particular industry, then they may suffer through loss of trade, loss of profits, due to non-completion of orders.  During the past year when the workers in one of the leading firms in this country were demanding altered conditions the matter went to the very day on which strike action was to take place before it was settled.  This firm could not afford a strike, not from the point of view of <Col N="2159" /> loss of profit, but from the point of view of having their market captured by some other firm.  They settled.</P>
    <P>There was a ten or 12 per cent increase in wages, not alone sanctioned, but invited by the Government, when much less would have done.  When that was given, the Minister advised employers not to follow the Government edict but to take a stronger line.  If anyone is in a position to take a strong line, it should be the Government.</P>
    <P>Throughout this debate the unemployment position has been played down.  The previous speaker, Deputy Lenihan, suggested that the unemployment position has nothing to do with this Minister, that he is more concerned with the Training Bill and the legislation he proposes to introduce. The people will look to the Minister for Labour to promote employment. The figure of unemployment is very high&mdash;70,000.  Deputy Treacy put it as high as 100,000!  I do not know.  I feel that 70,000 would be the true figure. Be that as it may, the question of unemployment has been left out of this debate.  It is a nice thing, in a crisis position such as we are in today, to speak about new legislation in order to divert attention from the unemployment position.  It is our duty as an Opposition to direct the Minister's mind to the unemployment position and to ask him if he can do anything about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had very responsible positions in Government.  There are methods of relieving unemployment which he could influence.  For instance, last week I asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs about the telephone position in Kilkenny.  The Minister's Parliamentary Secretary said that there were 190 applications for telephones and that 60 had been outstanding for over a year.  We are quite rightly advised by the Government to streamline business.  Is it any indication of streamlining that these applications are outstanding?  The Minister for Labour could advise the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that more men should be employed in the telephone system.  This would provide employment which is <Col N="2160" /> badly needed and would avoid applications for telephones being outstanding for over a year.</P>
    <P>The same applies in the case of the ESB.  A very successful loan was floated by the ESB to which people subscribed very generously and filled the loan within a short time.  Subscribers felt that the money would go to development.  What happened?  The money was taken over very shortly afterwards by the Government and there has been practically a closedown of development by the Electricity Supply Board during the past year.  The loan was not devoted to the purpose to which the subscribers believed it would be devoted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned ways of relieving unemployment in connection with which the Minister could use his influence.  It is very difficult to know with regard to the Minister for Transport and Power, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Labour where one starts and the other ends.  It is not easy for the ordinary Deputy to discover.</P>
      <P>I had a letter from the supervisor in Waterford in December last stating that it was hoped to re-open work on rural electrification and to supply outstanding applicants.  The Minister could use his influence in that respect.  I am sure that the Minister's experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce of the closure of the Castlecomer mines should be of some use to him in his present position.  The Minister at that time had arranged for the closing down of one industry and the transfer of workers to a similar industry 30 miles away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely pointing out that the Minister for Labour had the experience at that time.  The arrangement was made with the owners <Col N="2161" /> of the two concerns that one would close down and the majority of the workers in the industry in Kilkenny would be transferred to a similar industry in Ballingarry.  Not many of the workers availed of the opportunity to transfer&mdash;about 23 out of 200.  There was no housing or living accommodation available for them.  The Minister could not expect that workers would travel 30 miles twice daily to and from work.  That may not be any part of the function of the Minister now but he was concerned with it at that time, and the experience he obtained should stand him in good stead now when he is responsible for replacement of workers.</P>
      <P>I was in New Ross last Monday.  I do not intend to discuss the upset there but I was impressed by the industrial expansion in New Ross.  Some years ago the present Minister for Transport and Power referred to the number of unemployed persons coming off the land and put the figure at 6,000.  The Minister's surmise was quite right.  He gave an assurance that industries would be set up in towns and villages to absorb these people.  That has been done in New Ross.  There are being absorbed in New Ross both local men and men from outside.  The Government have moved away from the line suggested by the Minister at that time. Now the idea is that all industries would be based at Shannon or I see a suggestion that the ex-Taoiseach is to start a new industrial estate in Finglas.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to use his influence with the Government to encourage the establishment of industries in the country districts.  There are development associations in very many towns making strenuous efforts to have industrial development in these towns, apparently with very little result.  I would appeal to the Minister to use his influence to have industries started throughout the country.  The majority of the unemployed persons are people coming from the land, sons of farmers who are not able to purchase farms for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to keep the unemployment figure in mind.  Not one <Col N="2162" /> of the Deputies on the opposite benches has referred to the unemployment position.  If we have a Minister for Labour, his first duty should be to reduce the number unemployed through the establishment of industries rather than through emigration.  Conditions of employment, settlement of strikes and other matters must receive his attention but his first duty is to reduce the number unemployed.  No doubt as long as unemployment is as high as it is at present you will have people emigrating. People will not remain unemployed in this country when employment is available in Britain.  I would appeal to the Minister to use his good offices with his Cabinet colleagues to relieve the incidence of unemployment as much as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary duty of the Department of Labour is to protect and foster the interests of our workers, to ensure as far as possible that employment is there for them all and to ensure that they are properly trained and put into the proper trades. I have listened to some destructive criticism as to what has been attained, and especially to Deputy Tully's references to the closing down of factories, so I am not surprised that it is difficult for groups to come together and work out solutions for their problems. However, there are plenty of so-called experts who devote their attention to fixing strikes and solving industrial problems, so I will try to keep away from that aspect in my remarks.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's decision to increase the factory inspectorate from 22 to 28.  We can interpret this extension as a desire by the Minister to achieve the most accident-free position possible in our factories and to his desire to ensure that all adequate protection will be provided for the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a great leap forward, an increase of six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dunne that it is not enough.  I am sure the Minister also agrees with me, but it is a step in the right direction.  The factory inspectorate has been enforcing <Col N="2163" /> safety laws and promoting safety devices since the foundation of the State and, as Deputy Lenihan has said, a department of Labour has been in existence since the beginning of this century.  We all agree with the setting up of a Department of Labour and we all agree with the interest the Minister has taken in the promotion of factory safety.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne was right when he said that the increase in the number of inspectors was not a great leap forward and a glance at the 1965 figure for factory accidents shows that there is no room for complacency.  These figures are worrying and show that a lot more needs to be done.  The total number of accidents in that year was 2,329, of which 14 were fatal.  It is no consolation for us to realise that there was also a number of non-reportable accidents in industry.  I am sure that these are substantially higher than the figures quoted.  Whatever else is to be said about these accidents, there is no doubt that they have a most depressing effect on workers' families in terms of human suffering, wages lost and the cost to industry.  The tragedy of these accidents can be great indeed and should arouse in all of us a determination to prevent a recurrence of them.</P>
      <P>So far as it is practicable to organise the factory committees which the Minister has advocated, every one of us who has any contact with industry, and especially with the workers in industry, should encourage the setting up of these committees and endeavour to bring home to the workers the dangers of not having them in operation. The number of workers now covered by safety regulations has almost trebled in the past 16 years and the extension of the Act to building, civil engineering works and construction has also extended the role of the inspectorate.  So it is difficult to visualise how these 28 inspectors can keep up with the demands on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1965, they made a total of 6,748 visits to factory premises and this includes nearly 2,000 inspections of building operations.  These figures show in no small way that they are attending <Col N="2164" /> to and organising their work to the best of their ability.  There is much more urgency required today than here-to fore in the implementation of safety regulations due to the new technological and industrial hazards.  The old traditional hazards are still with us but many new operational hazards have come about in manufacturing and processing plants.  There is tremendous danger involved in the use of chemicals and chemical materials and also by the expanded use of ionising radiation about which Deputy Wyse asked a question recently.  None of us can be complacement about the dangers involved in these matters.  New safety hazards have been introduced by the extended use of ferrous and non-ferrous materials and resins.</P>
    <P>When we refer to safety, we should be concerned not only with freedom from fatal injury, or from injury generally, but also with damage to health.  New, complex, modern machinery and modern processes all require new technical protective measures and safety engineering specialists must continue to pay attention to the machines of various types which are coming on the market at present. They must know as much as possible about all imported machines from the Continent and ensure that they comply with all our safety regulations.</P>
    <P>The inspectorate should also ensure that all dangerous or potentially dangerous parts are properly fenced. I should like to make some suggestions in regard to meeting these stringent demands.  There is at the moment a feeling for international recognition of the need for uniformity in the fencing and protecting of dangerous machinery parts.  As a matter of fact, the International Labour Office have already accepted a Convention regarding safety devices for such machines so that we should ensure that no potentially dangerous machinery is allowed to be imported without inspection and without ensuring that the safety devices come up to our standards.  If they do not, they should not be let into the country. The present safety measures should be extended in order to prevent, as far <Col N="2165" /> as possible, further tragedies from occurring.</P>
    <P>In addition, the factory inspectorate have a very important function to perform in educating all factory personnel in the importance of utilising the information that is available from the Department of Labour.  It goes without saying that the factory inspectorate should be kept up-to-date with all technological changes.  The only way in which this can be achieved is by giving them every facility to attend international seminars abroad and by letting them have close contact with their fellow-workers in other countries.  In that way they can see what is being achieved by other members of the International Labour Organisation.  I do not want to detain the House too long.  I could speak at length about safety within the factory, but I know that the Minister would like if possible to conclude. I will finish up by congratulating him on the diplomatic and sincere way in which he has handled his Department up to the present.</P>

      <P>That might put me off. In the course of the debate yesterday, some remarks were made which were published today and which through inadvertence have been misunderstood. In case there be any misunderstanding about the correct attitude to the problem, I should like to deal with the remarks made yesterday concerning the appointment of an Information Officer in the Department of Labour.  The report as published would appear to query whether a sports journalist was a person qualified to be the Information Officer in the Department of Labour.  It is important that the fact should be put on record that the person in question is not and never has been a sports journalist.  A journalist is a person whose livelihood depends on journalism; he is not a person who occasionally contributes articles on a particular topic, and one does not become a journalist by being an occasional contributor of articles to newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the conditions under which the advertisement was put out must not have been fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where applicants for posts are invited on the basis of qualifications relating to journalism, it is very important that only persons with those qualifications be considered.  Lest there be any misunderstanding, it is also important that we would recognise that a sports journalist is as well skilled and experienced in the arts and crafts and sciences of journalism as any other journalist and a sports journalist is certainly as well qualified for a position of information officer as any <Col N="2167" /> other journalist who might be preoccupied with some other field of reporting. Sports journalists are people who concentrate perhaps on sports reporting and on sports affairs, but most of them, if not all, will have had experience in other fields of journalism, and they are certainly well qualified to be information officers.  I think journalists by their very profession must be expert in collecting and disseminating information.</P>
      <P>The only other matter to which I should like to refer is the problem of the mobility of labour.  One of the disadvantages from which we may suffer in the event of our becoming associated with any greater European community, will be that we will be subjected to the same disciplines associated with the mobility of labour as operate within the European Community. To the extent that we may wish to get positions for our own people abroad, this will be beneficial, but it will also create difficulty here at home if it becomes possible for people whom we now regard as foreigners to come in here, willy-nilly, without having to get employment permits.</P>
      <P>At the moment employment permits have to be applied for, and they are not usually given unless it can be established that the person on whose behalf the permit is sought has skills which are not available within the country.  Certainly there are people with skills that cannot be provided by Irish citizens.  I do not know to what extent the Government have concerned themselves with this problem, but it is one of the terribly important problems in relation to association with Europe which we here will have to consider, if necessary, to ensure that there is as much protection for our people in that field as there may be in relation to tariffs and quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should like to endorse all that has been said about factory and building site inspections.  It is common knowledge that the standards of safety in the building trade are not what they ought to be.  Employees in the building trade are at a serious disadvantage <Col N="2168" /> because they seldom get an opportunity of making their complaints heard where they would be attended to.  If they voice their complaints to their superiors, because of the uncertain nature of their employment they can be let go.  It is very necessary that the Department of Labour should carry out more frequent, and surprise, inspections of building sites, and particularly of sites where demolition work is taking place.</P>
    <P>There is a temptation, perhaps, in demolition work to demolish with speed and at less cost, and to disregard the safety factor.  As the amount of demolition in this city in particular is growing, it is very important that the Department should carry out inspections very frequently.  It is not sufficient to carry out inspections subsequent to accidents happening.  I would plead with the Minister to ensure that frequent inspections are carried out on all building sites, be they sites on which demolition or construction is taking place.</P>
    <P>My information is that a large number of inspections contain no element of surprise, that the employers are aware before the inspections take place that they are about to take place and, as a result, steps are taken to ensure that the sites are in a satisfactory condition before the inspectors arrive. That is an atrocious state of affairs, if it be so.  I have heard this complaint voiced by so many people from different fields of operations that I believe there must be something in it.  I would earnestly urge the Minister, as I have done on previous occasions, to take steps to ensure that the element of surprise in inspections is preserved. That is the only way to ensure that the regulations are being complied with.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I think many of the regulations are now outdated.  The amount of machinery in use has increased, the height of buildings is increasing, and the amount of demolition is increasing. The regulations while they are not adequate enough, should be enforced. This at least would provide some degree of protection for people in the very hazardous field of building.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2169" /> The State itself is a large employer, and it is regrettable that employees of the State are not given the same rights to compensation at common law as are available to employees in other walks of life.  It is utterly intolerable that we have preserved here the doctrine that the State cannot be sued in respect of the State's negligence.  There are innumerable cases of people who have been maimed while in the employment of the State who have received nothing other than statutory workmen's compensation because no right of action lay against the State.  There have been a few cases in which <i>ex gratia</i> payments have been made by the State where serious injury or death resulted.</P>
    <P>That is not an adequate substitute for giving to employees of the State the same right to common law compensation as is available to anyone else.  As the number of employees of the State is considerable, the Minister for Labour has a duty to ensure that these people have the same rights as anyone else.  It would be a very good earnest for the future if the Minister were to prevail upon his colleague&mdash;in this case I suspect it would be the Minister for Finance&mdash;to take the necessary steps to make available to employees of the State the same rights &mdash;equal rights&mdash;as are available to other workers in the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>To coin a phrase, I do not propose to delay the House very long, but I should like to say that during the week I was not feeling too well and I reached for the daily newspapers and read of the introduction of the Estimate for the Department of Labour.  I can tell the House it did not do my temperature any good.  The Minister's prescription for the trade union movement reminded me of other days.  A Government came into power in England in the twenties, and they produced, by a combination of inaction and interference, a situation wherein there was recorded the highest number of unemployed ever known in Britain, and the greatest amount of industrial conflict ever recorded.  That Government were brought to power with a policy which was called a doctor's <Col N="2170" /> mandate.  There is some similarity here, I would suggest.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is a bit premature to give a final judgment upon how the Minister will operate his Department, but at first glance he gives the impression of bringing to the problems something of the mentality of a Clare Dragoon.  I do not think this uniform sits well upon the genial personality of the present incumbent of the office of Minister for Labour.  The trade union movement is part of the history of this country and when politicians begin to lecture trade unionists, there is about it an air of unreality which can lead to certain dangers.  All that we see about us in the shape of such standard of living as has been achieved for our people, in the physical fact of improved housing conditions, improved working conditions, shorter working hours, improved facilities for recreation, which are not by any means adequate&mdash;by that I mean a reduction of working hours to enable people to have more free time &mdash;all this is due to the work of countless people who form part of the trade union movement.  There has been and there continues to be a usurpation of credit for this work by interested politicians, but there is no doubt in the minds of the people who make up the trade unions as to how these things came about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, when the Minister, a new man in office, sets out to lecture the trade union movement as to its responsibilities to society, I think he is acting impetuously and with a somewhat marked degree of presumption. When it comes to the exercise of responsibility, the ordinary worker, who is, in the heel of the hunt, the man who composes the membership of the trade unions, is the person upon whom lies the greatest pressure of responsibility, because he cannot lightly undertake any act which will endanger not alone his own livelihood but that of his family, his wife and children.  To impute to the trade union movement and, in doing so, to impute to the ordinary trade unionist, irresponsibility and to seek to lecture him as to what way <Col N="2171" /> he should act in the future, as has been done by inference, at least, by the Minister, is to act with presumption and to act without a proper appreciation of what is called for.  That is one side of the picture.  Then we had, as I say, the Minister donning the uniform of the Clare Dragoons, posturing before the workers: &ldquo;If you do not do what I tell you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>One must use it when one wants to make oneself understood by people who understand little but clichés.  It seems to me, however, that the Minister's words and actions are more liable to provoke dialectic than dialogue, if he takes my point; and this is undesirable.</P>
      <P>This Government have talked for a long time about what they are going to do in regard to the approach of the Common Market in the matter of retraining, in the matter of redundancy and in connection with the various problems which will undoubtedly arise as a result of our entry into the Common Market&mdash;we will follow whatever England does, as we know.  These are all tomorrow propositions.  We have not yet seen any concrete evidence in the shape of Bills before the House for discussion as to how the ordinary worker who will be disemployed by the impact of competition in a Common Market situation is going to fare. We do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we do know for certain at the moment is, as has been admitted by a spokesman for the Government, that in at least one industry which has often been referred to, the motor car assembly industry&mdash;and goodness knows how many others, but at least that one&mdash;unemployment is inevitable for some thousands of men.  That means short rations for some thousands of families.  There is nothing on the <Col N="2172" /> Statute Book at the moment providing for these people.  There is plenty of talk recorded in the journals of the House, but that is all.  Talk is no good. I have no doubt we shall have more of it but it is no good.  I know they have set up a committee; part of the Fianna Fáil syndrome is now, according to my reading of last week's debate, a sort of clinical committee to deal with the trade unions.  Indeed, I had the opportunity of reading a speech delivered late at night&mdash;which did not add either to my general physical well-being, but one does it as a duty&mdash;by Deputy Andrews in whom one forgives a lot because of youth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews was dilating upon trade unionism.  He announced that this committee set up within Fianna Fáil would deal with problems relating to the trade union movement and would advise the Minister.  He revealed the identity of the chairman as a noted trade unionist.  I am not given to recounting the personal histories of Members of this House.  It is an undesirable practice and has little relevance to matters which we consider here, but one is sorely tempted at times to do it.  If one were to take the bad example of leaders of the Government Party, some of them now sadly in political decline, one would indeed rake up, for further orders, as the saying goes, not alone what they said and did last year but what they said and did since they were infant children. However, I eschew that kind of activity, but it is, I think, essential that I should point out to the House that this statement which the Minister made in connection with his intention, if necessary to dragoon the trade union movement in order to bring it to heel if that movement did not do what he told it to do, is made, apparently, upon the recommendations of some existing committee.  If I do not make a mistake&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>There still is in Ireland, and it is being made very obvious to me in this debate, the gombeen mentality that came from a little town in the south-west of Ireland, the gombeen mentality that cocked itself up in this city in the shape of a certain gentleman, long gone to his reward, and I do not speculate <Col N="2174" /> as to what that reward was because I have no doubt as to what it was.  But his mentality still pervades certain areas of thought in this country and I am very grieved to think that so promising a young man, so genial a character as the present Minister apparently is, should become in any degree tainted with this malicious, malignant, filthy mentality, which would seek to create the impression that trade unions represent a conspiracy against order and good government.</P>

      <P>What I want to say to the Minister now is that, in dealing with the trade unions, he should appreciate, first of all, that these are the organisations that have him and every one of us, to a greater or lesser degree, where we are and that for this country, for good or ill, whichever you may deem it, it is upon the unions its position depends and the Minister should, therefore, exercise in his public statements the maximum of discretion because, when trade unionists hear about the invocation of the law to compel them, as was the clear inference from the Minister's speech, upon certain lines of action, that has the opposite effect to what may have been originally intended by the Minister.  I might add this is not just a trade unionist reaction; it is the reaction of most Irish people.  They are people who can be led but not driven.  That applies all down the line.  If you set out to invite trouble, trouble will come rushing merrily to meet you more than half way.</P>
      <P>The trade union movement can be depended upon to act in a responsible way, but it has at all times its primary responsibility&mdash;responsibility to the nation and responsibility to the working people, who are the most important part of this nation, the people who do the work and keep the country going, the people who are going to make the difference between the survival or extinction of this country in the economically very perilous years that lie ahead.</P>

      <Col N="2175" /> Six factory inspectors: one would think a revolution had taken place listening to Deputy Crowley and others.  One does not mind my gracious colleague from Co. Dublin.  There is upon him, as we all know, only the obligation to express his overflowing heart and impart his benediction to all things Fianna Fáil.  He also hailed this appointment of six factory inspectors. I suppose it is a good thing there should be extra men appointed but surely all this brouhaha about the appointment of six men is quite unjustified, remembering that the situation calls not for the appointment of six but for a multiplication of that number.  Yet, this was one of the main points in the Minister's introductory speech.  I do not say he did wrong in appointing the six but I do say he might have gone a good deal further and appointed many more for this most important and urgent work.  The need for this was brought to the notice of the Dáil, if I am not mistaken, some six months ago by Deputy Mullen.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the appointment of an Information Officer. Deputy James Tully spoke yesterday about this and his remarks were made the subject of some comment now by Deputy Ryan.  An Information Officer is being appointed.  Again, I do not wish to go into any personal details in regard to the man's background except to say that it seems to be part of the accepted policy of the Establishment to put their political friends into every conceivable kind of job and, if there are no jobs into which to put them, to make jobs for them.  It is totally wrong, however, for anyone to interpret the remarks made by Deputy Tully as being in any way critical of the NUJ. On the contrary, the point made by Deputy Tully&mdash;I am sure he made it effectively, irrespective of how it may have been reported by word of mouth outside the House&mdash;was in support of the attitude of the National Union of Journalists in this matter.  It is very odd that a sports journalist, skilled no doubt in the reporting of hurling and football, should be chosen to fill the important position of information officer in the Department of Labour. <Col N="2176" /> All one can take from it is that he must be exceptionally good at the game.</P>

      <P>As one having some acquaintance with the NUJ.  I know there are different kinds of journalists. There are a number of different branches in the NUJ.  I am not in a position to say whether the man concerned is a journalist in the strict, technical, legalistic sense Deputy Ryan was referring to.  I do not know that. That is not the point I am concerned with.  I am concerned with emphasising that Deputy Tully was at pains to uphold the interests and rights of journalists.</P>

      <P>In case there may have been any doubts about that, I want to emphasise that we would at all times support <i>bona fide</i> journalists of experience who might be thought suitable for posts of this kind.  But journalists are like the ordinary man in the street going about his affairs&mdash; not all of them have the &ldquo;pull&rdquo; to get these jobs, not all of them have the influence.  I could go a lot further but I shall not go any further, because I dislike very much talking about anybody not present.  I shall leave the matter rest at that.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party are anxious to see the Department of Labour do well.  We believe it is a necessary Department. We have referred to the need for it many times during the years.  The first Minister for Labour was Countess Markievicz, Citizen Army and Liberty Hall.  The late Joe McGrath, a great man, was also Minister for Labour for a short time.  We all know the great and generous work he did for this country.  It is good to see that the Department has been restarted.  It is a vital organ of the State.  The main thing is to ensure it is run on the correct lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It behoves the Minister to ensure that, as far as policy is concerned, it is <Col N="2177" /> in favour of those who labour.  I am not suggesting he should be unfair to the employing class.  I do not think it is impossible to be unfair to many of them.  I do think he has an obligation to ensure that the rights so hard-won by the trade union movement over the last half-century shall not be interfered with.  The one example of such interference was the introduction of the Bill which made it illegal for certain workers to go on strike.  That kind of legislation, no matter how you paint it, has about it the very definite appearance of coercion and reversion to days long past in this country.</P>
    <P>The success or failure of this Department will be largely reflected by the success or failure of the Minister. He has had great advantages&mdash; a wealth of knowledge, contact with trade unionists who have a lifetime of experience, and the future is there before him.  He may think it is a difficult task, but every politician thinks he is loaded down with the worries of the world.  It is not really all that difficult.  He should, I would urge him, be imbued, first, with the principle that workers should get a just return for their efforts&mdash;something which does not obtain today&mdash; and that those who are skimming off for the purpose of an easy life the products of the labour of workers shall not be treated, as he seems to think they should be, in so gentle and so cuddly a fashion.  The Minister's main obligation is to the majority of the people of this country, and the majority of the people of this country are the working people.  Every day that passes they are finding it harder and harder to live.  I hope that not alone by his public utterances will he endeavour to do justice by the workers, but in the private conclaves of the Cabinet, where it counts most, I ask him to resist the pressure which will undoubtedly be put on him by, in the first instance, the know-nothings. They abound in his Party, although his Party have not a complete monopoly of them.  I hope he will resist reactions on the part of at least some of his fellow Cabinet members and that he will endeavour <Col N="2178" /> to maintain the fundamental principle, which I believe motivated all the good things that ever happened in Ireland, that is, that it is the duty and obligation of the Government to secure for the working people by means of a re-distribution of the existing wealth the maximum return for their labour and the greatest improvement possible in their standard of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel all Deputies should say something on the very important question of labour relations, but we should be careful in our statements not to jeopardise the negotiations going on at present between Congress and the employers' federation.  I have said on many occasions that this is a time of dedication, a time when workers and employers must dedicate themselves to finding some means whereby their problems and grievances can be resolved without resorting to action which can bring only hardship to themselves and their families.  Their efforts must be directed towards creating an atmosphere of goodwill and of understanding of each other's problems. This means, to my mind, a beginning in the industry, the shop or factory.  This sense of co-operation between worker and employer has been too long lacking in the factories. I have often wondered why employers did not avail of the opportunity of setting up councils or committees in their factories so that meetings could be held and problems discussed and everyday matters threshed out between employers and workers.  If the atmosphere of co-operation could be established in the factory, it would lead to great efficiency in the industry itself and would remove that suspicion that has existed between employer and worker down the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admire the Minister for the manner in which he is facing his task which, nobody will deny, is a very difficult one in dealing with the problem of labour relations.  There must be a greater realisation now than ever that trade unions, workers and other sections of the community who can <Col N="2179" /> play a part in co-operating with the Minister in trying to bring about this &ldquo;work together atmosphere&rdquo; should make the utmost effort to play their part.  We must aim at laying a foundation and when that has been done, we have at least achieved something. Only then can we aim at perfection in labour relations.  It is the duty of every Member of the House to co-operate with the Minister and there is no point in being critical of what he is doing.  All during the past seven months the Minister has been casting about for directions, seeking suggestions as to how best he can please the workers and the employers and get harmony in industry.  Looking back on the past two years, we must see the necessity for the Minister's work and I am amazed at people here criticising that when we know that everybody desires peace and co-operation.</P>
    <P>Many aspects of the problem have been discussed on this Estimate but I should again like to ask the Minister at this stage to consider the matter of committees and factory inspection. I know that in a number of factories in our own city of Cork such committees do not exist and that when an inspector calls to a factory, a member of the committee or a worker is not taken with the inspector on a tour of the factory.  That is wrong and emphasis should be laid on the fact that when an inspector calls, he should ask that a member of the committee, or if such does not exist, some worker, accompany him on his inspection.  This is essential and there is a crying need for it in very many factories.  I ask the Minister to pay special attention to this and to direct his inspectors to that effect.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is providing for the proper training of officers in the employment services.  These services are essential for those seeking suitable employment and I am sure that whatever co-operation the Minister needs in that respect will be forthcoming from all interested in full employment. Reference was made to committees within our own Party.  You <Col N="2180" /> may be sure that whatever committee is set up within Fianna Fáil, all sections and interests are represented on it.  That is how a committee should function.  It is not sufficient to say we have representatives of the trade unions and the employers; we have all sections, and that is essential if it is to be democratic.  That is something we always insist on in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Any nation entering the Common Market or free trade must ensure that an atmosphere of peace, understanding and co-operation between workers and employers exists within its shores.  Any nation entering the free trade area without this must know its fate.  The Minister is directing all his efforts towards bringing about this atmosphere and every Member of the House and every section of the people should give him full support.  I have no doubt he will succeed in his efforts because no matter where you go at present, this subject is being discussed and so long as it is being discussed we can be sure that success will come to the Minister's work.</P>
    <P>Again, I compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has carried out the duties of his office and the way in which he seeks advice on various aspects of his work.  I can give an assurance, and I speak for many people in Cork, that whatever co-operation is needed by him in Cork will certainly be forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the industrial difficulties we had in recent years, it is a very good sign that such great interest is being shown in employer-employee relations.  I am not so young as not to remember the time when in many parts of the country and in many industries there was no relationship between employer and employee: it was purely a matter of master and servant and it was particularly so here about 50 years ago.  I do not want to go back that far but I want to emphasise this change, that there is now being placed on industrial relations the importance which they should have had for very many years past.  It may be a bit late in the day, even though it is good to see that a Minister for Labour <Col N="2181" /> has been appointed.  I do not think the Minister is too brash to admit to the Dail that he welcomes views from all sides.</P>
      <P>If I had any criticism to make of the Minister for Labour since he assumed office, it would be that he has made far too many speeches.  It may be true that he is a man who wishes to learn.  I believe this, but some of his speeches have been&mdash;I do not say all the time or even a majority of them&mdash;somewhat provocative.  Many people have deduced from his speeches a certain antagonism towards one side of industry.  That is not always there. He has not been entirely consistent. Of course, if we were to have regard to the speeches of the Minister for Transport and Power we note that the majority of them appear to be antagonistic to wage and salary earners. He must be much clearer in his public pronouncements.  I have a cutting here from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> in relation to a recent speech in the Central Hotel, Dublin, by the Minister for Transport and Power and Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Childers, to the Dublin Society of Incorporated Secretaries.  I quote:</P>
      <P>Mr. Childers referred to &ldquo;the crazy rush for higher living standards&rdquo;...</P>
      <P>I note he did not say &ldquo;workers&rdquo;; I note he did not say &ldquo;wage&rdquo; or &ldquo;salary earners&rdquo;.  However the inference is there that the trade union movement has in recent years been demanding too much.  If one had any doubts about the inference to be drawn from that speech, one has but to read further down to the part of it where he defends profits.  I quote again from the <i>Cork Examiner:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Childers said three great red herrings had been drawn across the economic track.  These were (1) that profits had grown excessively, when, in fact, profits hardly increased at all in 1966 and had not increased more than earnings from 1958 to 1966; (2) that there were hundreds of thousands of rich people to tax and that if taxation affecting everyone increased, then wages and salaries must increase; and (3) that everyone was entitled to work for less hours, even <Col N="2182" /> in industries with a high labour cost.</P>
    <P>The Minister must agree that that is biased in a certain direction.  In any case, the time has come not only this year but in recent years when the employers recognise the value of unions &mdash;and the majority of them welcome organisation.  Unfortunately, there are still some employers who discourage their members from becoming members of a trade union, and, in some cases, make it a qualification for employment that the workers in the particular industry or in a particular business should not become members of a trade union.  I think we should hear a little more from the Department of Labour and from the Minister condemning that sort of action and, in turn, encouraging employers to encourage membership of a trade union in business and in industry.  It is a good thing, too, and the trade union movement welcomes the fact, that the employers also have their association. Even those regarded as being all-powerful in local governments, the county managers, have their association as well.  It is good, despite the difficulties, that both sides should be organised and, apart from this, of course, there is the principle of the right to organise.</P>
    <P>There is a common impression, which I do not think is entirely correct, that the interest of the employer and the interest of the employee are dove-tailed. I do not think it can ever be conceded that the interest of the employer and that of the employees are dovetailed as neatly as some people think.  Naturally, the employer is working for his profit and the employee is working for his income, whether it be a wage or a salary.  Even though their interests may be different, I do not think there should appear to be a perpetual trench warfare between these two sides.  I trust, therefore, that the main function of the Minister for Labour will be to try to ensure as far as he can&mdash;legislation alone will not do it&mdash;that the interest of the employer and the interest of the employee are brought more closely together.</P>
    <P>In recent years, with industrial strife, we have had many solutions from <Col N="2183" /> people who, one might say, speak before they think.  I refer to those who would say: &ldquo;Strikes should be banned&rdquo; or &ldquo;If workers do not want to work they should be put in jail&rdquo;.  I hope that no Member of the House would readily go along with that attitude&mdash;apart from the Electricity Supply Board (Special Provisions) Act which went through this House recently.</P>
    <P>Again, let me pose the question that every Deputy should pose to himself: Why have we had this industrial strife? There is no use in talking about irresponsibility or about the power of the trade unions or about defects in the trade union structure.  There are other reasons.  It cannot be put down to legislation or lack of legislation, to the structure of the trade union movement or to any of the factors I have mentioned. The Government must take a share of blame in this.  There have been different Budget proposals and different attempts to restrain workers from seeking increases in their incomes. All these factors have had their effects. The financial measures in the various Budgets have been the cause of many rounds of wage demands in the past four or five years.</P>
    <P>There is no point in stressing to members of the Labour Party or to the trade union movement that strikes damage the economy.  Every day lost to work does some damage to the economy whether it be big or small. However, they do not ever seem to be particularly worried about the days lost through illness.  There is no reference by any Government spokesman to the loss to the economy in the number of unemployed which we have and in the increase in the unemployment figures in the past two years and particularly last year.</P>
    <P>Let me pose the same question as Deputy Tully posed: Do we ever think about the people who make the decision to go out on strike?  What sort of people are they?  There is no sinister influence behind them.  I suppose that any accusation against the trade union movement would be to the effect that they are too democratic. Some people are under the impression <Col N="2184" /> that leaders call strikes, that branch secretaries provoke strikes.  If there is another criticism I would make of the trade union movement it is that many of the members, particularly on important occasions, do not seem to take the trouble to attend and to participate in vital decisions that may affect themselves, their unions or, incidentally, the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>Wildcat unofficial strikes have been referred to.  I always regard them as a strike not so much against the employer as against the trade union and the authority of the trade union itself. As far as the trade union movement as a whole is concerned, it does not condone in any way the unofficial or wildcat strike.</P>
    <P>Again, there is this charge of irresponsibility. I was present at a social study congress meeting in the Stadium in June last.  There was a Mr. Douglas Hyde there who spoke.  I remember and read subsequently in the paper something he said with regard to the allegation of irresponsibility of workers on strike.  He said that if industrial workers are irresponsible, we have to ask ourselves why that is so.  It reflects a break-down in human relations because we fail to make the industrial worker feel he is part of the enterprise in which he works.  I do not accept that all those who go on strike or that any number of them are irresponsible but I think we should take note of his words, particularly when he says in effect &ldquo;...because we fail to make them&rdquo;&mdash;the workers&mdash;&ldquo;feel that they are part of the enterprise in which they work&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know that the primary function, the accepted function, of the trade union movement is to try to ensure that their members will be paid fair wages and that their conditions of employment will be as good as can be got from the business or industry in which they work.  These are issues that are pretty well-defined and pretty clear-cut but there are other factors that provoke workers into action. There are other difficulties to which we do not seem to pay attention or make any effort to have alleviated or resolved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2185" /> There is a new mood not alone with the workers but with people in general. There has been a radical change since the last war and certainly in the past ten or 15 years.  In Ireland, as all over the world, people are looking ahead, planning for the future, coming closer to the outside world. They are not prepared to stagnate in the day to day climate in which they were for quite a long time and which marked our general economic activity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the very short time at my disposal last night, I sought to emphasise the urgency and importance of this motion in the names of the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Corish, and the Labour Party Whip, Deputy James Tully.  It is the view of all of us in the Labour Party and in the trade union movement that it is vital that a motion of this kind be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the necessity for such a motion, having regard to the speeches made here by Government spokesmen in the past few days and, indeed, in the past hour, on the Estimate for Labour.  Deputy Wyse, a Fianna Fáil spokesman, told us of the Minister's great anxiety to bring about peace, understanding and co-operation between workers, employers and the State.  References were made to irresponsibility on the part of certain sections of the community and it was clear that these unfair and unfounded <Col N="2186" /> remarks were directed at the trade unions.  This is strange, especially when one realises that it is the State that is signally lacking in this kind of co-operation. The Minister should put his own House in order before seeking to lecture trade unions as to their responsibility. As the motion indicates, Government Ministers for Lands, Agriculture and Fisheries and Defence in particular, have made no provision whatsoever for proper consultation and liaison between these Departments and their employees and the unions representing the employees.</P>
    <P>It has been a most frustrating exercise for unions representing employees in these State Departments to have had to agitate unrelentingly down the years for a better deal for these employees, to no good effect.  They have been frustrated on every side.  When they take up matters appertaining to conditions of employment or wages with departmental chiefs, it usually transpires that these heads of Departments have no function in the matter, that it is a ministerial function.  We have seen trade union leaders so utterly frustrated that time and again they have had to raise questions in the House with reference to the conditions of employment of these men and especially with reference to the fringe benefits which are so important to workers today.  Greater emphasis is being laid today on fringe benefits such as a guaranteed payment in case of sickness, infirmity or injury through accident.  The need for retirement pensions is also greatly emphasised.  Great advances have been made in respect of these matters in industry.  Many thousands of workers in this country do enjoy these important fringe benefits.</P>
    <P>It is significant that employees comparable with those referred to in the motion, such as road workers employed by county councils, have conditions of employment applied to them that are far superior to those applicable in the State Departments referred to in the motion.  County council employees are covered by the Superannuation Act which was introduced by another Government and which provides for pension on retirement. <Col N="2187" /> The workers contribute to that pension out of their wages.  It is a great safeguard and a source of consolation to them to know that when they come to the end of their working life, they will receive a pension based on years of service and on the wages payable at the time of retirement.  The pension can be £3, £4, or £5 a week and this, supplemented by the old age contributory pension, makes for reasonable comfort for these employees after long years of loyal and devoted service.  These employees are directly under the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>It is an anomaly, which must be corrected, that their counterparts in the Department of Lands, Agriculture and Fisheries and Defence and the Office of Public Works do not receive such a concession.  Why should there be a distinction?  It is unfair, unjust and inequitable and must be discontinued.  It is humiliating in the extreme that trade union leaders should be so frustrated in their endeavours to improve the lot of this category of workers.  It is clear that it is Government policy to keep these workers down lest the State might be regarded as pathfinders in the matter of improved conditions of employment. There is no danger that any industrialist would be upset by the standards laid down by these Departments because the wages payable to these State employees are inferior and fringe benefits are not provided for them.  Let there be no anxiety that the Ministers might be starting a spiral or creating unrest or a general demand for a better deal.  The people to whom we refer are on subsistence level as compared with other categories of workers.</P>
    <P>The House may wonder why we are pressing this motion, especially having regard to the fact that the Minister for Labour, in his brief remarks last night, stated that to all intents and purposes he was accepting the spirit and intention of it. Having listened to the Minister and having heard his remarks, we are not satisfied that we should allow him to <Col N="2188" /> accept the motion in the context of the statement made by him.  He stated:</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the proposals in regard to the 1946 Act which I supplemented last April do indicate my intention to provide that industrial workers employed by the State will have access to the Labour Court for the purpose of trade disputes.</P>
    <P>In that connection we are concerned with the words &ldquo;industrial workers&rdquo;. The workers to whom we refer in this motion are clearly non-industrial workers.  They are workers employed in the Departments of Lands, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.  We want clarification as to whether the Minister in using the words &ldquo;industrial workers&rdquo;, was taking into account these categories.</P>
    <P>He also talked about the acceptance of the motion on the basis that it would include all workers concerned who do not come within the ambit of the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration machinery.  I do not know what brief the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance may have for tonight but we would want to be satisfied that the Minister's acceptance of the motion implies specifically and clearly, without ambiguity, that it covers all the categories of workers referred to in the motion.  The words, &ldquo;industrial workers&rdquo; certainly cut out a substantial number of them.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that these workers, being State employees, to all intents and purposes do not have the right to withdraw their labour.  They are precluded under the statute from taking strike action.  This places them in a most invidious position in that they must suffer interminably intolerable conditions with standards far lower than those which apply to workers in the country at large.  They have no redress whatever.  Their trade union leaders are wholly frustrated by the duplicity and back-pedalling of Ministers in this House and by the fact that they are denied access to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>It is fundamental to the motion that these workers be no longer treated as <Col N="2189" /> second-class citizens but that they should have full access to the Labour Court as has every other worker in this country, particularly having regard to their high productivity.  If one considers forestry workers, it is true they have access to the Labour Court but they are involved in this motion; they are obliged to work winter and summer in conditions that leave much to be desired.  This fact has been harped on in this House on many occasions.  They are now operating under a time and motion system which has the effect of horsing them, of extending them to the full capacity of their strength and endurance.  The Minister concerned does a great disservice to himself, the Government and to the workers by condemning them to conditions lower than those which apply to other workers.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hog any more of the time allowed for discussion of this motion but I would ask the Minister to come back to the House and clarify the position with regard to these workers, to clarify in particular the reference to industrial workers which he made in his speech and which could not refer to many categories of workers referred to in the motion.  At a time when the Government are admonishing all of us to strive for greater co-operation and more harmonious relationships, it is disgraceful that we should have to bring in this motion asking for the granting to these people of the right to go to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Before concluding last night, I was coming to the point of saying how embarrassing it is for various trade union leaders who represent these men, some of them Members of this House, and Deputy Tully in particular, to have to be putting questions to the Minister for Lands, Agriculture and Defence, asking when they will bring in sick pay schemes for these workers, or whether they are going to provide pension schemes for them, only to find these Ministers passing the buck, evading the issue and saying that they will bring in these schemes when there has been consultation with other Ministers.</P>
    <P>We have always had the Fianna Fáil ruse, when a Minister is in difficulty, <Col N="2190" /> of saying that this must be a decision of the Cabinet.  I would ask the respective Ministers involved in this serious injustice to the workers to get down with the Minister for Labour and end for all time the humiliation imposed on the workers under their charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>When one considers that for the past three or four sitting days of this House we have been discussing the Estimate for the comparatively new Department of Labour, one wonders why it is necessary to have a motion such as the one before the House tabled for consideration.  Leading spokesmen of the Government Party over the past few days have referred to the need for better relations between employer and employee and have applauded the Minister for Labour for some of the measures which he stated he intended to introduce.  We have also heard Fianna Fáil Deputies claiming that the Government were, if not solely, then largely, responsible for any of the improvements enjoyed by workers over a number of years.  Yet we find in a Bill introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1946 that the employees mentioned in this motion were excluded from recourse to the Labour Court in order to air publicly, and to have an impartial decision given on, any grievance which they may have.</P>
      <P>We know the difficulties in which these workers find themselves when in a serious and responsible manner they try, through their trade unions, to negotiate on any claim which they wish to submit to the Government, who are their employers.  We have heard it stated, and it was not denied, that a claim served three years ago has not yet been finalised by one Department and that the trade union officials and the rank and file members of the union who negotiated with the civil servants who are responsible on behalf of the Government find it, to say the least, frustrating in so far as they do not get anywhere.  The only reply they received over a period of three years in regard to one claim was an acknowledgment that the claim had been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right for Fianna Fáil spokesmen to get up time and again and tell workers that they must be good boys <Col N="2191" /> and must not unduly press any claim they may be considering, but surely it is not too much to ask that Government employees should have the right to submit a claim to the Labour Court, to have their arguments in support of that claim made in public, and for the Government, or their spokesmen, to have the right to argue the claim in public and to have an impartial decision or view on the justification or otherwise of the claim by the Labour Court?  When one wonders why these people were excluded, the only conclusion one can come to is that they are amongst the worst paid workers in the employment of the State, with possibly the worst conditions also.  One can only think that the Government, realising this, are afraid to justify in public their refusal to improve these conditions.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister spoke about introducing legislation in respect of trade unions and said that he was considering making the findings of the Court compulsory.  The very real argument was then put up that if this was done, workers might be reluctant to go to the court.  The Minister, being at times realistic, reconsidered that aspect of the proposed legislation because he realises, as does everyone who has any knowledge of industrial relations, that the Labour Court serves a very useful function in the field of industrial relations and that it has been responsible for more settlements than any other body we have known in this country. It should also be realised that not all strikes concern large issues, nor are they all in respect of increases in wages, nor are they all because people want three or four weeks' holidays.  A number of issues go before the Labour Court which if not solved can lead to strikes; there can be a build-up of grievances, small or minor grievances they may be considered, but if they are not attended to, there is a build-up which will condition the minds of workers to the belief that there is no justice to be got from their employer and if they have just one more&mdash;small, if it is considered in isolation&mdash;grievance, then that might be the straw that <Col N="2192" /> breaks the camel's back and then you end up with a strike.</P>
    <P>A number of the people referred to in this motion are not allowed to go on strike.  They are precluded from taking strike action under the law.  They are precluded under the existing law from presenting any grievances they may have to the Labour Court.  They are left solely at the mercy of the civil servants who are instructed by the Minister as to what attitude they will adopt on any particular issue.  These are people&mdash;and no one will deny this&mdash;who have many grievances. They have absolutely no way of rectifying these grievances without being forced into a situation where they may take very drastic and serious action.</P>
    <P>All we are asking in this motion is that manual workers employed by the State should have the same rights as any other worker in the State.  The Government should stop treating these people as second-class citizens and give them their full rights.  We do not think the Government should be allowed to hide behind legislation which they introduce.  We feel that if they are going to resist the justifiable demands and claims of these people, they should do so publicly, and they should make their case before an impartial body which we accept the Labour Court as being.  They should accept the same responsibility as they ask other employers and employees to accept.</P>
    <P>Last night we heard Deputy Tully speaking about the negotiations carried out by the trade unions which represent these employees.  We also heard a brief history of the attitude being adopted by the Government towards these employees.  When one listens to the Minister for Labour, and hears the workers condemned from the Fianna Fáil benches by speaker after speaker, when one reads this motion, and realises the true attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil Government towards the workers, it makes one wonder just how seriously the workers will take the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>We know that the workers referred to in this motion are engaged in <Col N="2193" /> certain types of work.  Let us take a forestry worker.  Were he to stop work in the morning, he could be ignored by the Government.  He could be ignored for three, six, nine or 12 months.  There would not be a very great outcry about a forestry worker stopping work.  He would not do the economy any great harm, I suppose, over a period of six to 12 months.  He would not inflict any great hardship on any other section of the community. There would not be any great pressure on the Government to try to deal in a realistic and just manner with whatever grievances he might have.</P>
    <P>We heard the Minister, a Government spokesman, state that one cannot achieve one's object just because one has strength&mdash;because one is industrially strong&mdash;and that one cannot go on strike regardless of the consequences to one's fellow citizens and the nation as a whole.  Workers who are not industrially strong&mdash;let us face it&mdash;are the people covered by this motion.  These men are in that category where they have not got any great industrial strength, but they have&mdash; and this cannot be denied&mdash;a tremendous amount of justice on their side.</P>
    <P>It is only when one considers the wages and conditions on which many of these people work, and compares them with the wages and conditions of similar employees in outside employment, that one realises the justice of any claim they may be pursuing. Instead of just making sounds about justice, and instead of condemning the workers for trying to negotiate in a responsible manner claims which they feel are just, the Government should look at their own set-up and realise that the manual workers employed by these Departments are denied the right to present their arguments in a responsible manner to support or justify any claim they may be making to an impartial body which was set up by the Government under the 1946 Industrial Relations Act for the very purpose of reconciling any differences that may exist between employer and employee, without that difference developing to the point where a stoppage of work takes place.</P>
    <P>When one realises that this body <Col N="2194" /> was set up to cater for workers who had a right in the ultimate to stop working and bring direct pressure to bear on the employer, surely it is only just and reasonable that people who have been placed in a position where they have not that ultimate weapon should have access to the Court in order to justify themselves and have an impartial finding on any claim they may wish to process.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave an ambiguous kind of acceptance in a very brief statement last night to the principle embodied in this motion.  If the Minister would elaborate on that statement and make it quite clear that acceptance of the motion would cover, as mentioned by Deputy Crotty and Deputy Tully, all workers employed in the particular categories mentioned, we shall regard that as a step forward. We shall congratulate the Minister on his belated enlightenment and we can stop the discussion from going any further.  Unless we are clearly satisfied that acceptance by the Minister will cover all manual workers employed by the Department we intend, on behalf of those workers, to pursue this matter to the full and by every means open to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is abhorrent to us in this Party that any body of workers in the State service should have no vehicle to make their complaints or to negotiate their standard of living.  It is as a result of our experience over the years of the predicament of many thousands of workers in State employment who do not have the opportunity of going before an impartial board, that we have tabled this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite some years since the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Malley, was in the Board of Works. I recall negotiating with him at a period when there was a strike in the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park in Killarney, and there were certain threats that as a result of withdrawing their labour, the cattle in that park would go unmilked&mdash;the same situation may arise in the next week or two.  In any case it was a serious situation and I recall at one conference in the Board <Col N="2195" /> of Works being informed by the official side that the worker in rural Ireland must await our entry into the Common Market for social justice.  One can make such magistral statements only to those who have no way of ventilating their grievances.</P>
    <P>It is a great thing to have industrial peace in the country, but industrial peace can be purchased at too high a price.  If the price of industrial peace in the State sector for manual workers, forestry workers and others is to be that these workers must have no way of ventilating their grievances, then this is not a peace that our Party would stand over or condone.  The industrial peace we seek would be that where there would be no lack of opportunity for the workers involved to voice their grievances, a peace in which there would be free negotiation with their employers, a peace that would be the outcome of just negotiations and a realistic balance between employer and worker.  A situation of constrained peace on workers who have no means of voicing their grievances is not one in which workers in this country should find themselves.</P>
    <P>It brings up the point that for the most part the basic wage of people in this type of employment must be the major issue in their minds, because there are very few opportunities for workers in such employment, as a result of the nature of the job, to get much overtime.  Therefore, the basic wage is paramount in this type of employment. If&mdash;and we have quite a number of cases to prove this&mdash;these workers cannot maintain some kind of relationship with the rates of wages of other workers, inevitably they drop behind in their wage rates, and their basic wage drops very far behind.</P>
    <P>In the absence of negotiating machinery, we do not find the State acting in a just manner towards these workers and saying: &ldquo;We find your wage rate has dropped back appreciably by comparison with that of other people in similar employment and we therefore have decided that your wage rate should increase by so much next month.&rdquo;  In fact we find, as people have <Col N="2196" /> said during this debate, that their wage rates have dropped down quite a number of rungs in comparison to other workers.  There are cases of people whose particular grievance, perhaps a wage matter, has not been aired in any court or has not been negotiated with any responsible official for a number of years, whose cases are relegated to dusty files; they have not been looked at by the officials involved, and if one asked the ordinary worker two years after a dispute has occurred whether he had lost hope, he would confirm the fear that he had lost hope.</P>
    <P>The astonishing thing in regard to the servile position of these employees of the State&mdash;and no one could describe their position as being otherwise&mdash;is that if it is a definition of a slave that he is his master's property, then these people who work as State servants are slaves in a very literal sense.  The Minister has stated that the case of these people is catered for under existing legislation.  I am not quite sure that he has come all the way with us on this motion, but just to make quite sure that it sticks, we have decided to push the motion to the limit.</P>
    <P>Whatever our political affiliations in this House may be, I think it is a paradoxical situation, and certainly not one we condone, that the arbiters of the standard of living of these workers should be civil servants who themselves do not appear to be subject to any great check in regard to increases in their incomes.  It is extraordinary that manual workers in the State's employment cannot argue their case in the light of day with other workers, that there seems to be some question of security whereby they cannot compare themselves with other workers and argue their case in the Labour Court I cannot see that the State will find itself at any greater expense by going to the Labour Court and by allowing State workers to go there.  If it is the mentality that the State is not agreeable to these workers retaining parity with outside workers, then this should be made clear.</P>
    <P>The higher officials involved in many of the Departments to which we have referred today are subject to <Col N="2197" /> no constraint whatever in regard to their incomes.  Their wage rates expand year by year by mysterious means decided upon by the higher authorities, while other grades of workers have to fight out their case in the full glare of press publicity, adverse press publicity in many cases, and against the advice of Government Ministers.  It appears that with the entire approval of the Government, the increments and wage rates of civil servants expand. I do not say they are not worth their weight in the salaries they receive but I suggest that the manual workers in these Departments, should, at least, have similar rights to air their grievances and say what their worth ought to be in terms of pounds, shillings and pence.</P>
    <P>It is the ultimate in hypocrisy that the very people whose wage rates move on well-oiled wheels year by year, subject to no check, should be the very people who preach against the manual workers and prophesy doom because of inflation in the economy if there is any suggestion that these workers should get an increase, even when the cost of living merits such an increase.  It is the ultimate in double-thinking on the part of the Establishment that they should persist in this campaign against the efforts of the lower paid workers to improve their standards of living.</P>
    <P>There is another matter involved here.  Employees in the State service should not be victimised in their wage rates as against employees in private employment.  We are very concerned in the Labour Party about private opulence and public squalor.  It is the mark of a private enterprise mentality that the riches in the economy should go to those who really do not earn them.  In the same way, the rewards go to the wrong people.  They go to those who are not productive.  Those who do a fair day's work are the people who are penalised under our wage system.</P>
    <P>We wish to restore an elementary right to manual workers in State employment. They should be as free as any other group to argue their case. They should have the same right as <Col N="2198" /> any other group to have their case heard in a fair way.  Such elementary rights would not lead to a dissolution of society, would not lead to danger, or to a threat to the State's impartiality, but it would certainly improve the standing of the State and the kind of morality that exists in relation to incomes.  It is perhaps unfashionable to mention this, but Connolly said at one time that we measure the advance of civilisation by the advance of its lowest elements.  I humbly suggest there is need for some such advance, for some spreading of light in the State service.  These manual workers should have the right to argue their case openly in the light of day.</P>
    <P>Other countries do not suffer from this relic of British rule under which State employees must be separated from the generality of the citizens. Most continental countries allow such workers the same rights as other citizens. It would enhance the sincerity of the Minister for Labour and his Department if they saw to it that such workers were given the elementary right of referring their case to the Labour Court.  I refer to the Court as we know it since 1946.  If we are to believe the Minister, it will be changed out of all recognition in the future.  If such workers could go to the Labour Court in the ordinary way, comparing their position with that of similar workers elsewhere, keeping a certain relationship in wages with other workers, we would be bringing genuine industrial peace to this sector of employment and forming a more lasting and better relationship between management and these employees than exists at present.</P>
    <P>We cannot cite any number of days lost in any particular year where these workers are concerned and, because of that, it may be argued that peace reigns in that particular sector of our economy.  As I said earlier, one can have industrial peace at too high a price.  One of the prices our Party feel we should not pay for industrial peace is the price of complete lack of redress for those in such employment and a complete lack of the fundamental right to air grievances.  This is not the kind of peace a real democracy would <Col N="2199" /> wish its employees to enjoy.</P>
    <P>There is a danger inherent in this situation.  Where you are sure your employees cannot embarrass you by any public statement, cannot go to wicked trade union officials to state their case, then the official side is supreme in its control of that particular wage situation and there is a great temptation for the official side to take the long view.  I think it was Lord Keynes who said that in the long run we are all dead.  I referred at the outset to negotiations at which we were told that the rural workers should wait for the Common Market for the coming of social justice.  That is an arrogant approach, asking workers to wait for such an unpredictable evolution as our entry into the Common Market. This is stated with all the arrogance of power in a situation in which employees have no redress and no way of pressing their wage claims in the open at Labour Court level.  As I say, the official side are subject to this temptation.</P>
    <P>The granting of these elementary rights to manual workers in the State service is long overdue.  A different practice prevails in other countries and we can see no reason why that practice should not be adopted here.  In the present situation the official side can overlook the genuine grievances of these manual employees.  They have control over the standards of those working in this sector and the workers have no redress.  This situation should be rectified immediately.  Other State employees are subject to no such check on their earnings.  If I question their economic worth, I cannot question the fact that their negotiating machinery appears to be effective because there is no shortage of tribute to the quality of their work in the wage packets they receive.  I ask that the same elementary justice be afforded to manual workers.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the deep, ingrained, prejudice that exists.  There is one law for those on one side of the social fence and another for those on the other.  This is especially true in the attitude to manual workers.  In private employment there are holidays with <Col N="2200" /> pay and sickness benefit for clerical staffs and for management.  For the vast majority who work in these enterprises, far different standards prevail.  This, of course, is no more than the reflection of the kind of basic injustice in our society.  Those who preach every day of the week about economic efficiency and about improving productivity are the drones of our society, the very people who live on dividends and never work, who go to their offices at 11.30 a.m. or mid-day and drive home in the afternoon in their Mercedes&mdash;and I am not necessarily referring to Government Ministers.</P>
    <P>Somebody talked about the veritable backbone of this country.  Undoubtedly, the backbone of this country are those who work an eight hour day or 50 hour week, those who work on the land, in firms and the manual workers in State employment. We do not very often hear their voices raised about the way they think the economy should be run, but the air is thick with Ministerial announcements about how they think the economy should be run.  There are civil servants coming from obscurity telling us how the economy should be run, what the targets should be in the economic programmes, who have very little acquaintance with what it is to work a heavy day's work at the bench.</P>

We all have the right to <Col N="2201" /> elect any political Party we want and we can see that our viewpoint is expressed through these Parties.  I am making the point that there is a bit of double thinking.  The incomes of those who preach about what way the economy should run are not subject to the same checks as are those of the majority of the people, who must argue the size of their pay packet in the full glare of publicity at the Labour Court and elsewhere.

      <P>Then let me say there are X individuals in this country whose incomes do not appear to be subject to any check whatever, while there are other individuals, manual workers, whose incomes are subject to very heavy checks indeed.  Apparently, they do not have the right to bring their cases to the Labour Court.  We make the point that they should have this right.  We make the point that many people in this country who pontificate on economic matters apparently do so in ignorance of the real problems that the majority of the people face in their standard of living.  We make the point that, whereas the incomes of the majority of people working for a living must be fought out in the full glare of publicity, and a case made in agonising detail with the employers for every shilling extra, everything proved at every point, there are others in this country who have to make no case, who merely notch up a price increase <Col N="2202" /> or get an extra director's job.  We say it is an injustice that these people should preach to the majority about how the economy should be run.</P>

      <P>You find difficulty in following my argument, a Cheann Comhairle, and I find difficulty in following yours.  However, I bow to your ruling.  We see no reason why there is any great danger or threat to the State in allowing manual workers in these Departments the right to resort to the Labour Court to argue their case from time to time.  There is a serious lag in their living standards in comparison even with those of workers in private employment.  Although official peace may exist between the authorities and the workers in these Departments, it is a very spurious peace indeed.  It is purchased at the price that these people have no right of bringing their case before an impartial tribunal.  This is an unjust situation and one not worthy of this State.  That is why we put down this motion, which we hope will be approved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time now available to me, I want to add my support to the motion before the House.  This motion mainly concerns rural workers.  It covers forestry workers and workers employed by the Board of Works and the Department of Agriculture.  Both inside and outside this House, we have been subjected to lectures about how to preserve and repopulate rural Ireland.  The treatment of these workers is one of the best means of denuding rural Ireland. The present machinery available to them for the negotiation of their wages and working conditions is most inadequate.  Possibly the greatest criticism that can be made of an employer, or a union for that matter, is that he refuses to attend the Labour Court when invited to do so.  Here we have the State protecting itself by having a regulation behind which it can shelter <Col N="2203" /> and not go to the Labour Court.  This is what we want to see put right by the acceptance of this motion.</P>
      <P>We all know the kind of regard in which an employer who refuses to attend a conciliation conference or a full hearing is held.  The State itself has shown bad example by refusing over the past number of years to attend Labour Court hearings.  In the past few months, the Minister for Local Government refused to attend a Labour Court hearing concerning county council road workers.  He refused on the ground that under regulation the Labour Court could not demand his attendance.  As a result a grave injustice was done to county council employees and we want to make sure that injustice will not be repeated.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is a surprise that we should seek to have State employees given the protection of the Labour Court.  We would prefer that such workers would not need the Labour Court, that they would be given adequate wages and conditions, but experience has shown the reverse is the case.  The Government have proved to be the worst employers so far as low-paid workers are concerned.  We need go back no further than the past few months to find how the Government treated low-paid workers&mdash;in the application of the £1 a week tenth round wage increase.  Forestry workers, workers employed by the Office of Public Works and by the Department of Local Government were denied the £1 increase for many months and when they eventually got it, it was granted from a date less favourable than in the case of any other employees.  It was granted reluctantly from 1st June when most employers had granted it from a date in April or dates much earlier than 1st June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government treat low-paid workers in that manner, it is time the Labour Court was made available to such workers.  When the unions representing those workers tried to get the increase implemented from an earlier date which would compare with the date in the case of their fellow-workers <Col N="2204" /> in private employment&mdash; possibly with employers not in as good a financial position; and some of them paid earlier than April, some time between 1st January and 1st April&mdash; the Government had to drag their feet, as usual and wear out the patience of these men.</P>
    <P>The workers covered by this motion are not in a good bargaining position. Forestry workers could go on strike for perhaps a month without the Government being at any loss.  The Government have played on this for too long and it is now time to give these workers the same access to the Labour Court as their fellow-workers enjoy.  Their employment, their wages and conditions are the worst in rural areas and whenever a demand for improvement is made, the excuse given by the Government or the Department representative is that they must not pay any better than this imaginary &ldquo;local rate&rdquo;.  In other words, the Government must always be behind. The Government should set the example and the rate in rural areas. If they are to improve rural areas, bring back and retain people to live and work there, these amenities must be given.</P>
    <P>Apart from bad wages and conditions, these workers suffer hardship by not getting full employment due to weather, credit squeezes and lack of finance from time to time.  They lose employment in the winter months and this does not help their conditions. They should be guaranteed full employment for the 12 months of the year.</P>

Deputy Treacy heard the Minister speaking and he is here, and what the Minister said was that because of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, State employees have not come under the Labour Court but that the position could only be changed by legislation.  He said that in the proposals for the amendment of the 1946 Act which he circulated last April&mdash; incidentally the Minister circulated them to the trade unions and the employers; I was under the impression that he circulated them to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Those are not the workers we are talking about.  We are talking of workers employed by the Land Commission, the Forestry Division, the Board of Works, the Department of Defence and the Department of Agriculture.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that agricultural employees are not left outside the scope of the proposed amendment because the Department of Agriculture workers seem to be in a different category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2206" /> During the period of office of one of the inter-Party Governments, a Bill was introduced which gave right of access to the Labour Court to local authority employees.  Why the workers we are now concerned with were not included, I do not know.  If the Minister wanted to do so, he could introduce a short Bill which would include the type of worker to whom we refer in this motion.  It is all right to say that he proposes to do it but, unfortunately, the position is that, apart entirely from wages, quite a substantial number of grievances have built up over the years.  Those, admittedly, will have to wait until the Minister, in his own good time, introduces a comprehensive Bill to alter the legislation with reference to workers and, in that, he proposes to include the workers to whom we referred.  Is there any reason at all why the Minister could not copy the Bill introduced by the inter-Party Government to cover this type of worker and introduce it almost immediately? I am quite sure it would not be opposed in this House.  One of the extraordinary things about this debate &mdash;I am glad, for this reason alone, that it has gone through&mdash;is that the people who have been shouting from the back benches of Fianna Fáil about their interest in workers in general and in State workers in particular were conspicuous by their absence.</P>

      <P>I am sorry they did not know very much about it. This bears out our argument that if <Col N="2207" /> you want people to take an interest in the matters that affect workers in this country, you will find them in these Labour benches, and nowhere else.  As far as the Minister is concerned, I know that he might be anxious enough to be of assistance. I am quite sure the position is that the Minister does not know the details as we know them.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister know that forestry workers at the present time are compelled to work a 5½ day week in the winter?  Does he know that, in the summertime, they work a five-day week?  Does he know that when they get their annual holidays, the holiday starts on a Saturday morning, even though the Saturday is not a work day?  If they have ten days, they get Saturday and the days of the following week and then Saturday again which is a non-working day, in order to make up their holidays?  If they had access to the Labour Court, this sort of thing could be killed overnight.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister know that forestry workers, Land Commission workers and, indeed, very many other workers applied through their trade unions for a sick pay scheme and a pensions scheme three years ago to the Departments and that still the Departments can only say that the matter is under consideration?  If they had the right to go to the Labour Court is it not a fact that this would be cleared up within three weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister know that forestry workers and Land Commission workers and, indeed, any other types of State employees working out in the country do not get protective clothing but that they would get it if they had the right to go to the Labour Court? Does the Minister know that they are entitled to get boots when working in water but that they must leave these boots every evening in an old wet dirty box and that the State does not care if they have to go home in their bare feet after their day's work is finished?  The boots are issued to them again the next morning.  Even in those conditions, does the Minister know that it is nearly impossible in <Col N="2208" /> some forests to get the boots issued? A fortnight ago, we were attempting to get boots, requisitioned last October, issued to certain men in Tipperary.  The forester wanted to know from the Department if they could be issued.  The Department wanted to know why they needed 40 pairs.  But 13 men in the neighbouring forest had also got an issue and somebody in the Department could not subtract 13 from 40 and find the 27 requisitioned and needed&mdash;and, while the men were awaiting the boots, they had to do for themselves.  They certainly could not afford to buy the boots they needed with the money they were getting.</P>
    <P>The Minister says we are continuing this debate, no matter what happens.  The fact is that we are continuing this debate in order to drive home to the Department&mdash; and to the Minister who, I am quite sure, will be prepared to pass it along to the Department and, therefore, it may not be necessary to do it again &mdash;that this is something that is years overdue.  In 1919, the British Government introduced the Industrial Courts Act and those people in this country to whom we refer had access until 1946 to the industrial courts.  In 1946, the Act was changed and those people were excluded as were employees of local authorities.  The only reason I can think for their exclusion is as was said here earlier, in order to prevent them from getting anything like justice.</P>
    <P>I have experience of going into various Government Departments in my role as a trade union official, after serving a demand for an improvement in wages and working conditions, and meeting very civil civil servants who were prepared to talk very civilly and discuss the case but, every time, they finished up by telling me that they would have the matter considered.  I am suspicious of asking the Department of Finance to deal with it.  I understand that, in every case, what happens is that the Department of Finance have to be asked if they are prepared to have the money sanctioned.  Even if the recommendation comes from one of the Departments, <Col N="2209" /> the Department of Finance must decide whether or not the money can be provided and the result is that it is not provided.  I understand that that is what is wrong with the sick pay scheme.  If the Department of Lands had the right to deal with it, I believe the matter would have been attended to two years ago but the Department of Finance is involved.</P>
    <P>It amazes me that the very people in the Department of Finance who are difficult about this matter enjoy, themselves, the benefits of sick pay, a shorter working week and a good decent wage.  I cannot for the life of me understand how it is that people who are not themselves directly affected&mdash;as employers are&mdash;can be so niggardly.  If we deal with the private employer, at least he has the merit of trying to save his own pocket. Whatever effort he is making not to increase wages is because he is trying to save his own pocket.  When a group of people who are getting the money out of the same purse refuse to sanction benefits to their less well-off brethren, it is just not good enough.  It is about time the matter were well aired, as it has been aired here today and yesterday.  All we are asking the Minister is that he should not wait until the Industrial Relations Bill is introduced and goes through this House.  He himself can introduce a short Bill in this House which will give just the right to go to the Labour Court to those workers and we shall solve the problems ourselves.</P>
    <P>In almost the last speech he made in this House, the former Taoiseach said, in answer to an interruption from me, that he thought that these workers were long overdue the right to go to the Labour Court.  He said he would have a special look at it.  I am afraid he has not had time to do so.  I know he is a very busy man since he left the Government but he might have asked his successors to ensure that the right would be given to the workers concerned. If the Minister does that, he will go down in the mind of those people as one person who has made an attempt to give them fair play, as a person who had the authority to give <Col N="2210" /> it and who has faced up to the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress, I was saying that the people of this country are not prepared to stagnate as they have been stagnating due to the general sluggishness of economic activity.  When we consider incomes, and, in particular, wages and salaries, regard must be had to the fact that the aspirations, the hopes, the needs and certainly the desires are much more clearcut than they have been.  I do not think these could be or should be described, as far as the workers are concerned in any case, as being a crazy rush for higher living standards because if higher living standards are their aspirations, their hopes, their needs and desires, it is tantamount to their saying that they demand that our economy should be further expanded.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody could accuse the leadership of the trade union movement of not making this demand and of not working towards it because, as is known, they are on such bodies as the NIEC and various other semi-State concerns and they have contributed and will continue to contribute in order to see that the nation will be developed at a more rapid rate than it is being developed now or has been for a few years.  They want the nation developed to the extent that there is full and secure employment.</P>
      <P>Towards that end, we have had in recent times projections and plans.  We have had the First and the Second Programmes for Economic Expansion. This is not enough.  In my view, it all depends on our ability to match human endeavour to these plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2212" /> A statement of aspirations by members of the Government as to what ought to be done or should be done in order to develop the economy and to ensure that our people would have higher living standards is not enough. These things will not happen merely because we wish them to happen.  We cannot wish increased productivity; we cannot wish the elimination of waste; we cannot wish the elimination of bad management or industrial strife.  We cannot wish good design and good marketing.  Nor can we wish upon ourselves an increase in exports.  We will have to apply ourselves to the problem of developing the country at a faster rate now that we have a measure of free trade with one country and now that there seems to be, however vague, a prospect of our entry into the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>In order to do these things, particularly in industry, in order to increase productivity, to eliminate waste, to ensure that management will be good and that there will not be industrial strife to the extent that there has been, one of the most important things is a substantial improvement in employer-employee relations.  In order to achieve this, no matter what the difference may be, the boss and the worker must both agree that they should work together in order to ensure higher efficiency and greater production.</P>
    <P>This is accepted by way of statement by both sides.  Therefore we have to ask ourselves what is wrong and who is at fault when we cannot tackle successfully the problems to which I have referred.  Is it bad wages?  Is it high incomes?  Is it the fact that we have bad social services, bad health services?  Is it the fact that housing is inadequate or that the education system needs to be greatly improved? Is it because we have low output or, in some industries, in respect of some workers, absenteeism, or that we have selfishness?  I do not believe there is absolute, complete, right or wrong on either side.</P>
    <P>There are many in this country who should get a far greater share of, as it is described, the national economic cake but if all are to get a bigger slice <Col N="2213" /> of cake, all sides in industry must accept responsibility for making a bigger cake.  As far as the worker is concerned, he must not alone feel that he is part of the enterprise in which he works but he must be, in fact, part of the enterprise in which he works.</P>
    <P>A valid criticism of the Government in this respect and maybe of other institutions as well is that workers who are regarded as the primary producers in industry are not sufficiently acquainted with the general economic plan for the country.  That is bad enough in itself.  I have said this on many occasions and I repeat here today: There is no point in the Civil Service or the Minister or any national committee knowing about the Second Programme for Economic Expansion. The Government have done nothing&mdash; I repeat&mdash;the Government have done nothing to try to ensure that the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, with its attendant plans, is brought down to the level of the ordinary worker.  That is bad enough but, worse still, and this in the context of employer-employee relations, the majority of the workers in industry are not sufficiently acquainted with their own enterprise.  I do not think it would be invalid criticism to say that the only interest the worker is allowed to have in the business in which he works is the wages he gets and his hours and general conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>There must be a drive initiated either by the Minister for Labour or the Minister for Industry and Commerce or maybe the Taoiseach to ensure that if there is a plan for further expansion all sections of the community will be conversant, even if in a general way, with that plan and with its objectives. It should also be made known what the workers in an individual capacity or as trade unionists are required to do in order that the plan will be successful.</P>
    <P>There is insufficient consultation as far as employer-employee relations are concerned.  It is tragic that in 1967 the main consultation is in respect of wages and conditions of employment. <Col N="2214" /> As I said before, the primary function of a trade union is to ensure that these will be fair and equitable and advantageous to the worker.  It is deplorable that in the majority of cases this is the only type of consultation that takes place between employer and employee.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that consultation is the complete answer but I do suggest that no matter how small or big the enterprise or the job the worker must be identified with the welfare of the firm in which he works.  As against what happens in the majority of cases, the employer should be concerned with the welfare of the worker and one might say <i>vice versa</i>.  Too seldom do we see employers showing any initiative in establishing sick pay schemes or an attractive holiday scheme or, something that has been mentioned in this House ever since I came into it, the establishment of industrial pensions. Very many people, including employers, believe that there is no necessity for those things now.  In their ignorance, they believe that the contributory social welfare pension is adequate. I do not think this is good enough treatment of employees by employers.  After a service of 15, 25, 30 and in many cases 40 and 45 years, there should be, if not a legal obligation, a moral obligation on an employer to ensure that an employee who has given such long service in a firm is adequately provided for for the remaining years of his or her life.</P>
    <P>We accept that efficiency and greater productivity should be for the worker's profit and not merely to produce additional profit and fees.  We could make other comments on the matter of profits and fees but it is our belief that workers in industry should have it made known to them by way of consultation that greater productivity and greater efficiency, the elimination of waste and bad management, will be beneficial to both sides of the industry. Effective communication between both sides is of vital importance but that communication must mean consultation, not merely consultation about wages and hours of work and the other usual things but consultation related to productivity, efficient <Col N="2215" /> management and the other things I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>All this business of industrial relations has come to the forefront because of the industrial strife in 1965, prolonged to some extent in 1966.  Many people, including, I think, the Minister, have suggested that an incomes policy might be the solution of all our difficulties. After economic development had floundered, due to incompetent leadership, due to incompetent Government, we welcomed the announcement of the National Industrial and Economic Council that this country should establish an incomes policy but we do not accept that an incomes policy on its own is a way out of all our problems.  It could be regarded as a progressive weapon for economic and social development but there are many other things to be considered.</P>
    <P>If all it meant was the introduction of an incomes policy relating to economic growth, the matter would be very simple indeed, but I think the Minister ought to have regard to paragraph 48 of the NIEC Report No. 11 which says &ldquo;An incomes policy must be considered in the wider context of a policy of incomes distribution&rdquo;. An incomes policy is necessary and desirable but it can be successful only if it is part of the overall social and economic policy of the Government. It is ridiculous for this or any other Minister to brandish the big stick of an incomes policy as if it were a simple means of ensuring the economic well-being of the country, particularly when the Government do not appear to be able to put before the country proper proposals for a revised programme of economic expansion and a national social programme. Without these, an incomes policy would be worse than useless.  It does not depend on itself alone but on the nature of the Government measures that are necessary and should be introduced. To introduce such a policy now would be more an irritant to wage and salary earners than anything else.</P>
    <P>The Minister on one occasion suggested that people should finish their <Col N="2216" /> thinking before they started to speak. He might have taken that lesson to himself.  An incomes policy relating to productivity would mean percentage increases according to our growth rate but the NIEC report recommends that it must also be used to ensure a fair distribution of incomes.  If it is to mean that on occasions of economic growth a percentage increase will be given to those on £8 or £9 a week, it does not mean an equitable distribution of incomes.  Our first job must be to ensure that fair standards will be established and I must say that the recent speech of the Minister for Transport and Power in which he talked of a crazy rush for higher living standards annoyed and angered me.</P>
    <P>It would suit the Minister for Transport and Power much better to talk of people on low incomes.  I do not hear him speak very often of people who are in receipt of small allowances. On a recent occasion in my constituency, a question was put to me by a man who is a widower with three children and who is in receipt of sickness benefit and getting £4 12s 6d or £4 15s per week.  How is such a man to fare out under an incomes policy? If economic growth goes up by a certain percentage and if that same percentage is to be applied to people working in industry, it simply means that the people now living on £8 or £9 per week will be looked after but is there to be nothing for the people who are unemployed or who are unable to work?  These people have been pleading for years that something should be done for them and their pleas have not been answered.</P>
    <P>To ignore the existing inequalities would only make a mockery of an incomes policy and we cannot accept that an incomes policy will be a weapon for the improvement of our society if it is not aimed at better income distribution.  I would like to know therefore, as this is the Minister who will be arbitrating in disputes, if he will give us his views on a just incomes policy, how it should be established and how it should be operated.</P>
    <P>The Government were not always <Col N="2217" /> enamoured of an incomes policy.  I remember welcoming the views of the NIEC on an incomes policy and even at that stage the former Taoiseach was laughing at the idea.  It was after the boom of 1964 and the slump of 1965, extending into 1966, that this was introduced.  The proper time to introduce an incomes policy is in time of boom and it should not be used in a period of crisis.  We are in a certain period of crisis now and an incomes policy should not be used as a big stick against people on low incomes or people unemployed at the present time.</P>
    <P>We are very concerned in industry to think about such important things as capital, factories, equipment and an incomes policy.  What is equally important is the establishment of a proper social organisation in industry.  We have to remember that the nature of the social organisation of industry moulds the lives and attitudes of the workers. If we are to make genuine progress, we cannot afford to ignore that point.  I do not think that anybody could be satisfied with the present social structure of industry.  We could not say that it is good.  The financial arrangements may be good; the machinery may be good and the productive methods in many cases may be good, but we have not begun to think of the social organisation of these industries.  No employer, no industry, is going to get the best out of the workers, unless there is good social organisation within the structure of the industry.</P>
    <P>Mark you, many of the disputes I know of, whilst the final issue may have been in regard to wages or hours of employment, have been built up by a lot of irritations&mdash;bad conditions, overheated or underheated factories, draughty factories, snoopy employers or narky foremen&mdash;all these tend to make the sore of discontent fester in the workers' minds and the combination may result in strike by the workers on another issue which would be regarded as being important.</P>
    <P>If we are to have good and happy industry, we must have regard to the conditions in which workers have to do their daily work and we must be satisfied <Col N="2218" /> that there is proper and effective consultation between both sides of industry.  The worker should be made part of the industry.  It is not an unfair comment to say that at present, and for quite a long time, all power clearly resides, and has resided, with the employer. He is the man who decides whether a man is to work or not, or whether he is to be sacked or not.  The unfortunate thing, as far as many industries are concerned, is that this device of sacking a man, or taking him on, or of closing down the factory, need not necessarily be a decision of somebody in Ireland, a foreman or a manager.  This is a decision that can be taken by somebody in London, New York, Amsterdam, or in some other part of the world.  This person has no idea of the difficulties facing the firms or the industries.  It would be much more reasonable if there were greater consultation on any difficulties the firms had, or on any suggestions for increased production, because consultations on these matters would give the workers a little more interest than they have at present in their jobs.</P>
    <P>As I said, many workers have only one stake in their job, that is, the weekly pay packet.  This is not so in other countries.  It is not good socially and it is not good economically.  I am sure the Minister has examples of this in some of the factories in his constituency and there is no need to particularise.  The Minister should take positive and deliberate steps to encourage new forms of industrial organisation.  The idea of co-partnership is anathema to many employers at present and it has been so for quite a long time past.  He should encourage schemes of works organisation and works committees and he should give greater encouragement to the establishment of safety committees.  I do not want to appear to be in any way impudent to the Minister but on many occasions it appeared to me that his attitude towards safety committees was quite casual.  Perhaps this is an attitude that has been built up in the Department of Industry and Commerce over the years.  His attitude towards factory inspectors seemed to be quite casual.</P>
    <P>I was encouraged to hear&mdash;and the <Col N="2219" /> Minister may take note of what was said by one of his backbenchers&mdash;the complaints made by Deputy Wyse which were as strong as the complaints made in this regard by Deputy Mullen over many months.  The Minister did not appear to believe Deputy Mullen but if he did not believe Deputy Mullen in regard to the inadequacy of the staff of inspectors, or when he said that workers should be brought around with these inspectors, then he may believe one of his own colleagues, Deputy Wyse.  The Deputy comes from Cork and I am sure that he knows what he is talking about.</P>
    <P>I referred to co-partnership schemes, works organisation and works committees and I want to tell the Minister that this is not merely my view or the view of the Labour Party but they are suggestions made by the Irish Management Institute last year.  I should like to know if anything has been done at Departmental level or if there has been any effort made to consider these suggestions of the Irish Management Institute.  I believe that there has not been; at least the Minister did not refer to them in his opening speech.  The emphasis has been on the generous grants available to industry.  This grant policy should be used to consider new approaches and to stamp out abuses. The trade unions should have access to these grants, providing agencies both for the purpose of consultation on matters of organisation and for assessment of the personnel policies of firms.  In addition, serious consideration should be given to whether or not a firm should get the same scale of grants, or get any grants, if it does not conform to certain standards laid down by the Minister or fair standards that may be requested or demanded by the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>Despite all that has been said about the Minister or his Department.  I do not think anybody believes he will not endeavour to do the best job he can. I do not know what the actual function of either the late Countess Markievicz or Mr. Joe McGrath was but I am sure they did not have the same difficult job as the Minister for <Col N="2220" /> Labour will have.  I appreciate that he is willing to learn; I know that he believes, or should believe, that he is not the sole repository of all knowledge in regard to industrial relations, but there is a tendency on the part of Ministers in this House and in other countries to reject out of hand any suggestions made by members of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>We are all vitally concerned with the question of industrial relations.  If we want to increase production, or to prepare for free trade, or to prepare for the competition which we will undoubtedly have in the European Economic Community, it behoves all of us to pull our weight, whether we are trade unionists, or employers, or whatever we are, to ensure that we will succeed in this task.  Increased productivity and increased economic growth depend on keeping our people at home at work.  The Minister for Labour is a very important man.  We do not expect him to provide solutions immediately. As a matter of fact, we do not expect that he will provide solutions by way of legislation.  It is necessary that there should be amending legislation in respect of trade union law, in respect of industrial relations generally, but the Minister should heed the warnings, some of them strong and some of them stronger than others, from these benches in regard to the distance he can go in the matter, say, of interfering with the structure of the trade union movement, and particularly of interfering with the right of trade unions and their members to free collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach in very positive terms stated in one of his speeches within the past 12 months that he had no intention of interfering with free collective bargaining. What has happened in the meantime?  The Minister and the Government should not be scared because we have had perhaps too many strikes in the past two years.  Those are not the ideal periods on which to judge the trade union movement and, for that matter, the employers.  Those were extraordinary times and, without going into it, the Government must take their share of the responsibility for the industrial strife we had.  The <Col N="2221" /> unfortunate thing is that we tried to provide a solution when we were nearly in the middle of a crisis.  I believe that if there is to be industrial legislation, and if we are to get rational views and ideas, this should be done in a time of relative peace.</P>
    <P>What reaction can the Minister expect from the trade union movement when in the final part of his speech, he says that if the workers do not come to heel&mdash;and if he did not say it in those specific words, he inferred it&mdash; he will have to do something about it?  He might as well be tilting at windmills, because the trade union workers do not want to cause trouble but they do want to have the right to sell the only thing they can, the use of their hands or their brains.  There is no use in the Minister talking in terms of imposing fines or putting the workers in prison or in jail if they will not work, because that will not work.  Threats of that sort are not conducive to a favourable response from the trade union movement, if legislation on the lines which has been suggested is to be introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In any case, I know he has had consultations with the trade union movement, and I think he realises that regard must be had to the views of the workers, the wage earners and the salary earners.  When the Minister and other Ministers of the Government call for restraint in incomes, they should not forget that in the beginning of 1966 the trade unions voluntarily restrained themselves to what they regarded as a minimum increase&mdash;the famous £1 per week for men and the appropriate scale for women.  I do not think the trade union movement as a whole can be regarded as being wild or irresponsible. The number of strikes we have had has tended to be exaggerated and, with all due respect to those who publish these stories and news, there is far too much emphasis on strikes and far too little emphasis on settlements.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not think we should be scared by reason of the fact that an unusual number of days were lost through strikes or lock-outs in recent years.  We should approach this problem <Col N="2222" /> of industrial relations not with an eye on 1965, 1964 or 1966, but having regard to what the future pattern of industrial relations will be, and what the future structure of the trade union movement will be.  We should not be prejudiced by events in the recent past or by any clamour from any section of the community which believes that the trade union movement is too powerful or too strong.</P>
    <P>I shall end on this note.  The trade union movement has been recognised by various Governments as very responsible and important.  The evidence of this is that they have called upon the trade union movement to participate in semi-State organisations, many of which have been established and designed to ensure that there will be real economic growth.  The Minister should bear in mind that economic growth is dependent on the co-operation of the trade union movement and all sections of the community.  I do not think any section can act independently. We are together in this battle to ensure that the country will progress and in this the trade union movement can play a very important part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>A point was raised in regard to the appointment of an Information Officer. While this appointment falls to be made by the Department of Labour, it is not a function of the Minister or the Department.  The selection of an Information Officer is made by the Civil Service Commission.  I do not know whether the Deputies who raised this question have doubts about the Civil Service Commission and its methods of working, but if they have, they should pursue the matter through the Office of the Taoiseach, I think. I want to make it quite clear that the requirements laid down and given to the Civil Service Commission for the selection of an Information Officer were exactly the same as the requirements laid down for a corresponding post in another Department, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, two years ago, for the post of Information Officer.  Again, I should like to say that one name came from the <Col N="2223" /> Civil Service Commission to me and the appointment falls to be made if the person so recommended accepts the post.</P>
      <P>On the Supplementary Estimate last October, I tried to cause a discussion on the question of free collective bargaining. At that time I said that before raising the question of changing the system of collective bargaining, I should like to explore the possibility that the system itself was all right and did not have any inherent defects, but that it was being used badly.  I was disappointed not to get any discussion whatever at that time on this so important part of our economic life. There was no discussion in the House or outside it on what I intended to do. I must say I cannot make that complaint now.  There has been a sharp reaction, if not discussion, to the further points which I made about working the system of free collective bargaining.</P>
      <P>While some Deputies naturally enough saw an opportunity in it for gaining a bit of political advantage perhaps for themselves by trying to place me in a posture which would gain some votes for them, I must say I am grateful to the Deputies who took seriously the suggestions I put before them for consideration, and also to those Deputies who made serious contributions on other aspects of the work of the Department of Labour.  I can assure Deputies that these contributions will be examined and if they merit action, I will try to have them implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say that while I did get a discussion going, my ambition would be that we would get down to discussing what is the best system for our circumstances and for our country. Some people took the posture of trying to conserve what is there and attacked me for approaching it with any intention of changing it.  Most of the community is made up of workers, and what is good for the community must be good for the workers.  I am asking the Dáil, the trade union movement and the employers to consider whether we can produce here a system <Col N="2224" /> whereby we can fix our wages and salaries, and which will act not against the best interests of the community but to promote the benefit of the community.  I think we can with a little thought take that extra step from just reacting to threats to existing institutions in a most conservative manner to seeing if we can produce institutions which will meet the needs of our times for our own community.</P>
    <P>I will have to be a little disjointed because different points were raised by Deputies, starting back with Deputy Donegan.  Adopting his best &ldquo;poor Richard&rdquo; manner, he told us that you can lead a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink.  This extraordinary distillation of the wisdom of the Fine Gael Front Bench was repeated by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I know you can lead a horse to the water and you cannot make him drink, but I would say to Fine Gael Deputies they ought to do more thinking than that. If you cannot make a horse drink, at least you should bring him to the water and let him make up his own mind. To say that you can make laws but that they will not be obeyed is unworthy of Deputies.  I do not think people should seek election to this House and then come here and try to prove that the Oireachtas is impotent. I do not know why they should seek from the people a voice in this House and then in the most joyful way, taunt us that if a large enough section of a democratic community does not want to obey the law, the law can be overthrown. I would ask those people who seem so happy that the law and the authority of the Government&mdash;and not just this Government but the authority of Government&mdash;should be threatened, to think of how much protection they themselves and the different sections of the community, including the trade union movement, get from the law and from the authority of the Government. This is fundamental and if the authority of any Party to govern is laughed at by the Members of this House, it is illogical for those same Members to seek from the people support in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan treated us to a <Col N="2225" /> homily on the need to adapt and reequip industry for the more competitive times which lie ahead.  I agree with this, and I waited for his ideas on how he thought this should be done, and particularly for ideas on whether he thought the Government's procedure so far, what the Government had done over the past few years, should be changed. I suppose the House is aware that I waited in vain.  I do not think the function of a Deputy ends at just saying what is wrong with what has been done.  If we here in this House do not become more constructive, we cannot expect a great deal from our management or our trade unions, and we are calling on industry in Ireland to make the greatest contribution to any further economic advance we make.  However, we cannot expect them to do what we ourselves are not prepared to do, that is, to get down and do our work on it.</P>
    <P>I did gather from Deputy Donegan that he favoured&mdash;and I presume he was speaking for his Party in the absence at the time of the spokesman for this Estimate&mdash;productivity agreements in relation to wage movements. I am watching with interest the working of some of the agreements made during recent months.  I am certainly in favour of the idea of income increases matched by productivity improvements and the elimination of restrictive practices as well as the introduction of more orderly and more disciplined procedures for dealing with settlements of disputes and the solution of wage problems.  If this could be done, it would mean the price of a product or a service would be kept from rising.  If the price of a product could be kept from rising a firm would be permitted to keep its position in the market and perhaps increase its share of the market.  It should not be too much to expect that, with better productivity, the customer should sometimes be considered for the benefits of that improved productivity through price reductions. I would judge productivity agreements of the kind mentioned by the Deputy by these criteria.</P>
    <P>Deputy M. O'Leary spoke at some length on the need for the Department of Labour to adopt what he <Col N="2226" /> called a neutral posture in dealing with employers and workers.  This is not the first time I heard the innuendo that in some way the Department of Labour is failing to hold the ring fairly between employer and employee. The Deputy saw fit to use the phrase &ldquo;a branch office of the FUE&rdquo;.  While the Labour Party have welcomed the setting up of the Department of Labour, this innuendo has been there from the very beginning. It is important for the future of the office of the Minister for Labour and the Department of Labour, both created only seven months ago by the unanimous decision of this House, that that suggestion should be firmly refuted. I resent the suggestion and refute it as strongly and as completely as I can.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour, as all Deputies obviously realise, have a very difficult job to do.  They are doing a difficult job.  They have dealings often with most unreasonable kinds of people from both sides of industry. Employers and trade union leaders have gone out of their way to compliment the officers of this new Department on the skill and the patience with which they deal with troublesome matters.  The Department of Labour is not a branch of the FUE; neither is it a branch of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Its main job is concerned with the welfare of the workers, and I am resolved that it will continue to carry out that job in the best interests of the workers and the community generally. The community is largely made up of workers, and anybody who tries to make out that we are against workers when we are talking about the interests of the community is misleading himself and other people.  I think Deputy O'Leary, on reflection, will withdraw that suggestion that the Department of Labour is biased and is a branch of the FUE.</P>

I do not want to discourage them from becoming a little more modern because a while ago I said I was glad to get any comment from them, but I should like to see the next step, that they would be constructive and that the suggestions they make in this House would meet the circumstances of our time.  The posture that the Labour Party have taken throughout this debate has been one of raking over old embers, resurrecting long dead grievances and wrongs, squaring up to enemies who are no longer there.  Many of the Deputies in the Labour Party seem to think that all they have to do is shout &ldquo;Tol-puddle&rdquo; and draw their pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can do the martyr any time he likes, but I doubt if he will do it.  That is the posture of the Labour Party, instead of facing up to the problems of the times and co-operating in trying to achieve what we want to achieve, the higher production and increased employment which the country must have.  If there are any real grievances, we should try to get down to settling them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputies who said that our manpower policy will not bear full fruit until we are closer to the stage of full employment.  But that does not mean that a great deal of useful work cannot be undertaken in the field of manpower before we have full employment.  In fact, the implementation of a manpower policy is one of a variety of measures needed to facilitate the achievement of full employment. The provision of additional jobs is of fundamental importance and depends on the acceleration of our rate of economic development.  The <Col N="2228" /> achievement of an accelerated rate of economic development is not a function of the Government alone.  Apart from involving many Government Departments and many State agencies, it calls for co-operation and constructive action on the part of many vocational organisations, including the trade union movement and the employers' organisation and, above all, it depends on a public acceptance of the policy measures necessary for a faster growth rate.  The Department of Labour can play a part in this and I assure Deputies now that it will play its full role.</P>
    <P>There were serious criticisms last night of the staff of the Employment Service.  I want to reject categorically the sweeping statements made and the unfounded accusations levelled against the staff in general by Deputy Treacy. The overwhelming majority of the staff perform their work courteously and efficiently and they have the utmost respect for the dignity of the people with whom they have to deal.  Deputy James Tully, I think, admitted that. Any instances of discourteous behaviour which are brought to my notice have been, and will continue to be, dealt with severely, but I must emphasise that, to my knowledge, these are rare happenings and it is most unfair, I think, for a Deputy to try to blacken all the staff by making these sweeping allegations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they may be based on the shortcomings of a few but this does not justify a sweeping attack on the whole staff.  With regard to the particular case in relation to which the Deputy gave me the insurance number, I had the case investigated this morning.  I find it is normal practice to require an unemployed person who leaves his home to prove unemployment at the employment exchange to which he travels.  In this particular case, I agree with Deputy Treacy that it would have been more reasonable to excuse the applicant from proving unemployment.  It was a case in which the applicant was going to be interviewed for an appointment. <Col N="2229" /> There are two days in question and it has now been arranged that he will be excused from proving unemployment and payment for both these days will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Quick service.  The Employment Service was taken over by my Department last October.  We took over the existing employment exchanges and the staff in them.  As I said earlier, we are undertaking a review in depth of the organisation and structure of the service.  That review will take time.  Until it is completed, it would not be wise to take any firm decision on many of the long-term developments of the service.  It would not be possible at this juncture to say whether we should aim at long-term separation of the placement service from the other activities of the exchanges. Neither would it be possible to come to any firm decision about the future staffing of the placement service. But we had to make a start and, consequently, I arranged on an experimental basis to provide separate placement offices within the exchanges in certain centres.  These offices will be staffed by specially selected and trained placement officers.  The idea is that the placement officer will be able to interview unemployed workers and others in privacy.  As a result of the interviews, very detailed records of the qualifications, aptitudes and experience of the persons using the service will be kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The placement officers will be trained to undertake guidance work and aptitude testing.  They will also, of course, study the needs of employers and will make, and I hope maintain, a close liaison with employers, in relation to their employment requirements and in relation to trends in the particular area. As I said, staff will be trained to adopt approaches and attitudes in keeping with the new tasks we have in mind for the service.  I have already spoken to the managers about this.  The Dáil will understand it is a long-term job to revamp our Employment Service in order to put the emphasis on placement work <Col N="2230" /> and I do not underestimate the difficulties which have to be overcome. However, I think in these pilot schemes in these centres we are making a useful start and I would welcome any suggestions, especially from those Deputies with experience and knowledge in these fields, as to any further action we could take in the short-term arrangements in these centres while the long-term examination is proceeding.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise again that there has been no unavoidable delay in preparing the redundancy payments legislation.  The Government decided not to prepare a Bill until we had had discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the employers' organisations.  These discussions have, of course, been long drawn out, as Deputies might expect, but they have been worthwhile.  I could have come to the House with a Bill months ago but that would be at the price of not consulting both sides of industry concerned in this legislation.  I have no reason to believe that either the Congress or the employers' organisations would have welcomed any such move on my part.  I hope to be able to circulate this Bill after Easter and there will be ample opportunity then to debate its provisions.  At this point I do not think there is any need to say more than that it is the type of Bill in relation to which one side will say we are going too far and the other will say we are not going far enough.  In fact, before seeing it at all, Deputy M. O'Leary said we were not going far enough and it would only be the basis of private negotiation after being brought in here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <P>Deputy Jones raised the question of arranging for the training of young workers.  I should make it clear that the new authority which will be set up when the Industrial Training Bill becomes law will take over the functions of An Cheard Comhairle in relation to the training of apprentices. It will be empowered to undertake directly the training of other young workers also.  It will endeavour to secure further improvements in the arrangements generally for the training of apprentices.  I have to repeat again, for the sake of Deputy Tully, that workers leaving agriculture for other employment will come under the scope of that Training Bill.  An Chomhairle Oiliúna will have power to train workers coming off the land for any other type of employment they may be taking up.</P>

      <P>As far as this House can go, we have given the Comhairle power to train people who leave agriculture for any other type of work.  To those Deputies who say: &ldquo;What is the use of training people unless the jobs are there?&rdquo;, the answer is that there are thousands of people who now require additional training or retraining in order to bring their skills up to date.  There is also the question that the availability of training courses and of a skilled labour force will be one of the biggest attractions for the investment of capital in industry here and the creation of new jobs.  As I said before, we should try.  We should not be discouraged by every obstacle.  We should go ahead and play our part.  If we do that, we cannot blame ourselves if we have not the jobs at the end.  I have no time for those people who ask: &ldquo;What is the use of training if we do not have the jobs at the end?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Jones asked what job the industrial psychologist will have to do. This expert is being recruited mainly for the purpose of developing the guidance functions of the Employment Service.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a link.  Perhaps I should make the position clear about vocational guidance.  The Department of Education are responsible for the school vocational guidance service. This will be designed to help children in school and their parents in relation to whether they need further education, what type of further education and their general aptitude if they are completing their education at 15 years.  It is the intention to raise the school-leaving age to 15.</P>
      <P>The Department of Labour, on the other hand, will be responsible for the vocational guidance service for the unemployed and for people at work who may wish to avail of this if they think they can do better by going for another job.  These two systems of vocational guidance are obviously complementary. Both Departments will have to work closely together.  The general responsibility of providing information about careers, both for the Employment Service and for the schools vocational guidance service, will rest with the Department of Labour.  This, as I made clear when introducing the Estimate, is a very big task, but that should not prevent us from making a comprehensive scheme available.  In the meantime, as I said, while awaiting the staff and the resources to have a comprehensive scheme, we hope to have ready by the end of the school year a series of 100 leaflets, as a start, for guidance to those leaving school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was some confusion about the subject of manpower forecasting.  It is possible in advance of formal forecasts to keep in touch with the situation in different industries where employment is particularly sensitive, economically and technologically, to change.  We are doing that and will continue to do it. But formal forecasting uses very complicated and advanced techniques to assess some years ahead the demand for and supply of different types of skills and occupations.  It is a highly technical task that cannot be undertaken without employing experts.  That is the reason why we are seeking qualified personnel in that field.  Some Deputies ask: &ldquo;Can you not make a guess?&rdquo;  We can make a guess as good as anybody else, but for formal forecasts, <Col N="2234" /> you need very highly trained experts.</P>
    <P>On the subject of prices, Labour spokesmen, like ourselves, showed a keen interest in the control of prices; but I think they should be equally keen not to mislead themselves and others.  The fact that price control is exercised does not carry with it the promise that prices will not increase, if there is a substantial increase in costs.  Whether the increase in production costs is by way of raw material costs, labour costs, power or transport, it is inevitable that commodity prices will have to increase unless there is some offset by way of increased productivity.  The most price control can do is to ensure that increases are not unreasonable and to help in seeing that the consumer, as well as management and workers, get some share in increased productivity. It is a disservice to workers if spokesmen imply that production costs can go up and prices can be held down. This cannot be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen asked what would be the duties of the special senior officer attached to the Department and how he would fit in with the operation of the Labour Court.  As I said when introducing the Estimate this officer would act on the instructions of the Minister and perform special duties for the Department by way of general liaison and contact between the Department and both sides of industry. He may at the Minister's request undertake special negotiations and inquiries. But it would be a mistake to think of him as a special firebrigade officer dealing with individual strikes.  These will be left to the negotiators themselves and the Labour Court.  There is no question in my mind of this special officer cutting across or interfering with the responsibility of either the Labour Court or the conciliation service.</P>
    <P>There were complaints in the course of the debate about delays on the part of the conciliation service in arranging conferences.  The number of conferences being arranged has continued to increase steadily over the past four or five years and in 1966 it reached an all-time record of 750, an average of <Col N="2235" /> 15 a week.  The high level continues this year.  The number of conciliation officers has been augmented to enable them to deal with the increased volume of work.</P>
    <P>It must be appreciated that the question of arranging a conciliation conference can only arise at a point in time when both parties indicate their willingness to attend the conference.  I have made special inquiries from the Labour Court and have learned that the number of disputes at present awaiting the fixing of a meeting, both parties having indicated willingness to attend, is eight.  In three of these cases, the unions concerned have indicated that they do not want a meeting arranged just now.  In the remaining five cases, difficulty has been experienced in arranging dates to suit the employers. In addition to those eight cases, there are 56 on hand where one or other party has not yet indicated willingness to attend conferences.  I think I told Deputies before that many of the delays are due to the difficulty in arranging a time and a place to suit both parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point. I am answering the point made about delays.  I think the practice of conciliation is, as I think the Deputy will allow, always to facilitate the holding of a conciliation conference having regard to the wishes of both parties.  The Deputy knows well that conferences are often arranged within days, or even hours, of the dispute being referred to the Labour Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>He is not here now, but Deputy <Col N="2236" /> Ryan continues to repeat that inspectors send out warnings to factory owners when the factories are to be inspected.  Somebody backed him up on that tonight.  It is practice, and long established practice, not to give any notice in advance of intended inspections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not sufficient inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes the advice of the inspectorate is sought by the occupier of a work place and in that event, of course, a prior appointment is made.  I agree that we need more frequent inspections and when I told the Dáil that we had increased the number of inspectors from 22 to 28, I made it quite clear that this was not the whole of what we had to do.  I said I was reviewing the need for strengthening the inspectorate but until such time as I know the needs, I thought that, as an interim measure, we should increase it to that extent.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish said that I am casual about these safety committees.  I want to encourage every firm, every work place, to have a safety committee. As I told the Dáil, the number last December was 89 as compared with 57 the year before.  There is some response. Again, Deputies who should know, have asked me to take the initiative in setting up committees but I have told them that the initiative was written into the law by a Labour Party amend-ment as a workers' initiative, and it is the workers themselves who must set up these committees.  I should like to give them every encouragement.  Six months ago the inspectorate adopted a new procedure in visiting factories where committees exist, a procedure whereby the committee must be contacted, and the inspector must fill a form showing that this has been done. When this practice is generally well known to exist, I think workers will no longer feel the committees are being ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the need to do something for the lower paid worker.  It is clearly a social aim to improve the lot of the worse-off sections of our community.  If we are to <Col N="2237" /> accept the principle that total money incomes can in certain circumstances rise by a certain percentage without inflationary consequences, it follows that if some groups get a higher percentage increase than that particular one, others must accept a lower percentage increase.  The increase for the lower paid group must be higher than the accepted norm if we want to improve their relative position.  If they get a higher increase than the norm, then other groups should be willing to accept a lower percentage than the norm.  I do not know if Deputies accept that, but it is like thunder: you must listen to it.  Our present practice in free collective bargaining and wage negotiation does not appear to allow this to happen except in very minor respects. The lower-paid workers are usually in the weaker bargaining position and many of them are unorganised. I think any Deputy knows that it is not from the ranks of the lower-paid workers that the pressure for improvement comes but from the highly organised and powerful sections that have the power to bring these movements about and to insist on maintaining their traditional differentials.</P>
    <P>One Deputy suggested last week that the only way the lower-paid workers can get an increase is through the operation of a general wage round.  A general wage round does nothing to improve the relative position of the lower-paid worker.  The lot of the lower-paid worker requires to be looked at afresh by all sections of the community and we must try to devise a method to secure improvements for the lower-paid workers.  The present method of wage bargaining does not seem to be sufficient unless there is a change in certain attitudes.  Wages may be low because workers are in jobs where productivity is poor or where the work is not remunerative for the employer.  In those cases there should be a special look at productivity.  It may be that we must look, not only at additions to wages, but at social distributive methods as a means of improvement.</P>
    <P>To the Deputies who mentioned the <Col N="2238" /> lot of lower-paid workers in the direct employment of the State, I would repeat what I said on the Private Member's motion tonight: employees who are not covered by conciliation and arbitration schemes will, under the new industrial legislation proposed, have direct access to the Labour Court, something which is denied to them at present under the law.  In any event, I am having a look at the whole question of the nature of their working conditions, in consultation with other members of the Government, my colleagues in other Departments.</P>
    <P>Because my interruptions were not strong enough tonight in Private Members' Time, I should like to get back to what Deputy James Tully said in regard to Fianna Fáil Benches being empty when this great motion was going through, giving these classes of workers access to the Labour Court. He tried to make out that this was because Fianna Fáil Deputies were not interested.  The strange thing about it is that we decided and published our proposals to give these workers access to the Labour Court 11 months ago. Consequently, there is no need for this motion now and no need for Deputies to support it.  They had already been told of the proposal to give these workers access to the Labour Court.</P>

      <P>I want to clarify the position with regard to those workers excluded under the 1946 Act from access to the Labour Court and who can only be given access to it by legislation. In case there has been any doubt raised by the use of the word &ldquo;industrial&rdquo;. the word &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; is used in this context by the Minister for Finance to define certain employees, employees whose rates of pay are related to rates of wages outside the <Col N="2239" /> Civil Service, employees who have no counterpart outside but whose rates are dealt with by the Interdepartmental Wages Advisory Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will they be excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The only exclusion is the person who already has access to the conciliation and arbitration machinery of the Civil Service.  The manual classes outside conciliation and arbitration machinery to whom it is proposed to give access will cover forestry workers, Land Commission workers, drainage and maintenance workers, employees of the Office of Public Works and civilian employees of the Department of Defence, mainly skilled craftsmen, semi-skilled workers and labourers.</P>
      <P>To get down to the part of my introductory remarks which brought about a certain degree of disagreement, Deputy Kyne made a serious contribution to the problem which exists when he mentioned that industrial workers, in their negotiations, know the damage that can be done to the industry in which they work by excessive demands and that they are concerned to ensure that a round of wage increases should not create unemployment.  The Deputy quite obviously was sincere when he said that workers have regard to the capacity of a firm when making their demands on it.  But it is not as simple as all that.  A round of wage increases has no regard to the individual firm. There are many industries in which the results of collective bargaining can give rise to things outside our control and that is why I say that it is up to us to produce a system which is suitable to our own particular circumstances. It could be that circumstances outside our control, arising from a particular form of collective bargaining, could produce unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey and the FUE object to my words about collective bargaining and they are as much together on that matter as Fine Gael and Labour are in this House.  Both of them say that I have threatened this system and that they do not want it threatened. I do not wish to threaten that system <Col N="2240" /> but we would be awful fools if we allowed a system damaging or injurious to the community as a whole to continue. It reminds me of a memorial erected on a roadside in America with a wrecked motorcar on top bearing the inscription: &ldquo;He died defending his right of way.&rdquo;  To my mind it would be foolish to allow a job to be lost, wage packets to be eroded or the economy held back because of a system in connection with which we refuse to consider whether it is working for us or against us.</P>
    <P>My remarks that wage and salary increases should be kept within the limits set by national growth have occupied Deputies during the debate, on the ground that only wage and salary earners are being asked to exercise restraint.  One would imagine that I was encouraging other sections to get as much as they can.  What I said was that it is important to the community that we develop a system for ourselves, a system suited to ourselves, and I would have liked that matter discussed without the invective and emotional undertones introduced into it by Labour Deputies, I fear deliberately and, by some, maliciously.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years it is the rise in the wages and salaries and not the improvement in other incomes that has gone out of line as far as the overall level of our incomes is concerned. Other forms of income have not gone out of line and therefore that problem did not fall to be dealt with by me. The out-turn of 1966 which has been well publicised shows that total production went up by less than one per cent. All incomes went up by three per cent and prices rose by three per cent but wages and salaries increased by six per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>All other income groups got less than three per cent, and that includes profits.  It was suggested to me when I produced these figures that if this situation continued it would cause unemployment.  But nobody seems to worry about that and it is a bad situation in any country where the only one worried is the Minister for Labour. <Col N="2241" /> What consolation can Deputies offer to workers if they lose their jobs?  You will tell them that the Government are at fault and now, before jobs are lost, is the time for the Government to talk.</P>
      <P>It has been said that last year was a unique year and that we should look at a longer period so I took the income movement since the end of 1963, immediately before the ninth round. Between the end of 1963 and the end of 1966, national production went up by 7½ per cent.  All incomes went up by 25 per cent.  Prices went up 15 per cent and wages and salaries went up 31 per cent.  Now, in the year 1966, the percentage rise in all other incomes was appreciably lower than the rise in wages and salaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In case the Labour Party's statements should give rise to any misunderstanding, I would like to say a word about overall profits.  In the three years I have mentioned, profits rose by 18 per cent as compared with a rise of 25 per cent in all incomes and 31 per cent in wages and salaries. In 1966, profits rose by one per cent as compared with three per cent in all incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think Members of the House will accuse me of talking down to them if I find it necessary to say that to promote economic activity and employment we must have enterprise and investment. I think the House will agree that this investment must be got in competition with other communities offering attractions to those who have the funds and who have the expertise which we require to develop our economy and provide jobs for our people.  We have undoubtedly many attractions to offer those people with funds and expertise, but unless we can offer them a reasonable return on their investment, we will not get the projects here and the jobs will not be here for our workers. This is not governed by any theoretical idea of what should be done.  If we want jobs here for our workers, we must attract people here who have the funds and the expertise.  The Labour <Col N="2242" /> Party will have to look forward instead of back.</P>

      <P>I have been putting to the House the risk involved in the current trends in wages and salaries relative to the incomes of others in the community.  I put it to the Dáil that the country, and in particular Irish industry, on which, as I said before, our hopes for survival depend so much, require at this time a stabilisation of wage and salary costs, until such time as production has caught up on the money incomes and improvements in conditions already given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see this might involve a test of leadership in our economy, in our political and industrial democracy.

I appreciate, and I think every Deputy should appreciate, the practical difficulties referred to in that Report by the NIEC.  There are very real difficulties in applying a policy to incomes and an enormous amount of work will have to be done to surmount those difficulties.  It is not the wish of the Government to do it.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is unanimous. The trade unions, the employers, the Opposition Parties who would seem to disagree with me and with one another on many things appear to be at one in wanting this system of collective bargaining for fixing wages and salaries and conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>Each one of those who are intimately concerned in the process of free collective bargaining has a partisan interest.  This is understandable.  I think most of the time they have only a short-term interest in the immediate results.  The Government and I, as a member of the Government, must be concerned with the long-term future, as well as the immediate settlement of a dispute or claim.  We must concern ourselves with the effect in the future of that settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in introducing this Estimate, <Col N="2248" /> I find that the system of collective bargaining is now operating in a way that threatens our community.  It is bringing danger to the workers themselves, their own jobs, and certainly it is eroding the value of their wage packets.  The fact is that settlements made without regard to the future, without regard to any other context but the table at which both parties sit, are tending to raise manufacturers' costs and making it more difficult to sell Irish goods at home and abroad.  The danger I speak of lies in the inevitability that, if present trends continue, sales of Irish goods will fall because Irish goods will be too expensive, and Irish workers will lose their jobs.</P>
    <P>If, as Deputy Kyne said, workers do not understand this talk about public interest, I suggest that it is a job for Deputy Kyne and me and all other Deputies to explain that the workers' interests are concerned in the public interest and that the preservation of the workers' own jobs may be involved.</P>

      <P>If this House and the people involved outside this House want to make collective bargaining work, there must be an obligation somewhere on somebody to see that the operation of free collective bargaining does not undermine our economy or jeopardise the employment of Irish workers.  I do not know if anyone in this House rejects that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to say we are in favour of free collective bargaining. It is the same as saying we are in favour of temperance.  What I am interested in is that by our behaviour we should translate our words into deeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall finish up with a threat.  I say again that if there is failure by the employers and the workers in operating the system of free collective bargaining to bring this into line with the needs of the community, there will be demands <Col N="2249" /> here in this House for the Government to do something, to salvage something from the wreck because wreck there will be of our economy, if we let this thing go on in a thoughtless manner. What I am asking this House is that we should not allow this to come about just for thoughtlessness or just for a belief that something is there and that it must not be changed.</P>
    <P>If I might refer again to something Deputy Corish mentioned, holidays and pensions, I said these are not immediately cost-producing and I would like to see them dealt with at this time in free collective bargaining.  There are improvements in conditions, holidays, sick pay and pensions that the worker could get without doing damage to the economy and himself and I should like to see him get them.</P>

      <P>At the beginning of this debate, I mentioned industrial relations legislation.  I said there had been a measure of agreement on what the Congress of Trade Unions wanted and what the FUE wanted.  The word &ldquo;measure&rdquo; might have indicated a very limited area of agreement.  This is not so.  There has been agreement in a number of areas but there are areas in which agreement could not be reached and decisions will have to be made about those matters.  I did not intend at the time to give the impression that there was lack of co-operation on the part of either the Irish Congress of Trade Unions or the FUE; indeed, I gave the impression which I am correcting now, one night on a television appearance when I said to Deputy M. O'Leary that I was quite prepared to let him prepare his own law so long as it solved the problems involved.  I may have given the impression in a reference to earlier work that officials of the organisations involved did not produce solutions.  I should say that we had a considerable amount of co-operation from these organisations in such matters as the production of the Industrial Training Bill, the Redundancy Payments Bill <Col N="2250" /> and a wide field of activities, and there has been worthwhile consultation in relation to trade union law and industrial relations legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish said we were always trying to produce solutions in times of peace but another member of his Party said we should not produce these things now at a time of peace. &ldquo;Never is a good time to do anything&rdquo; seems to be the philosophy of those people.  This country cannot be served by the conservative attitude that we should not change anything.  What I am asking of every individual is to consider what system or change in the existing system will best serve the community.</P>

      <P>When speaking here on Thursday evening, I dealt with the problems we are confronted with in Dublin Health Authority who administer services for a population of approximately 800,000.  We attend more than 22,000 patients a year in our institutions, taking up 1¼ million bed days at a cost of £2.7 million.  The Authority pay for nearly 60,000 patients in other hospitals during a million bed days at a cost of £2¾ million.  More than a million attendances are recorded yearly at out-patient clinics at a cost of more <Col N="2251" /> than £250,000.  The Authority's mental hospital services attend to 3,141 patients as well as a rapidly increasing number of out-patients at various centres throughout the area at a cost of nearly £2 million.</P>
      <P>The unit at St. Loman's Hospital, Ballyowen, for the care and treatment of autistic children is one of the most advanced and progressive in these islands.  It contains 30 beds with specially trained, medical nursing and ancillary staffs and backed by the most up-to-date equipment and services, including school and recreational facilities for the children.  The beds are fully occupied and there is a long waiting list.  In the early stages of development, patients from other areas were taken but admissions are now confined to Dublin residents because of the local pressure for beds.  An adolescent unit to take the older children from St. Loman's will shortly be opened at St. Dympna's in the North Circular Road and it is hoped to have a unit for the intermediate pre-adolescent children opened at St. Loman's as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ambulance service was mentioned by Deputy Esmonde.  I happen to be a member of the ambulance service of Dublin Health Authority. There are 20 ambulances, with the service of eight ambulances owned by the Corporation of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire and of one ambulance donated by Our Lady's Hospital, Drogheda.  Of these, 19 are equipped with radio-telephone and it is proposed to instal such equipment in at least two more.  Consideration is being given to the installation of full accident and emergency equipment in all ambulances in the Authority's area.  The Authority also supplement their own service when necessary by calling on private ambulances. There is a 24 hour ambulance service available in the Authority's area for all purposes and the Authority's ambulance service gives help outside the area under arrangements or in special emergency.  I quote these figures not for the information of the Minister or his very able secretary, <Col N="2252" /> both of whom are well aware of them, but in order to put these facts on record.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been in the Department a very short time but he has visited quite a number of health authorities throughout the country. There is one little setback in relation to Dublin in respect of which I now appeal to the Minister.  The Dublin Health Authority estimate for 1967-68 was based on the assumption that the supplementary health grant introduced in 1966-67 would be continued in the following year.  The Minister informed the members of the Authority that as far as he was aware the full grant would be payable.  The Department were informed on the basis of the estimates on 9th December, 1965, and were given copies of tables showing how the supplementary grant had been calculated. The Authority were not told until the day of the final estimate meeting, on 2nd February last, that the full supplementary grant would not be payable. Details of the revised arrangements were notified by the Department on 6th February, 1967, four days after the estimate meeting.  It was therefore not possible to revise the estimate on the basis of the altered health services grant.  The result is that the demands on the rating authorities have been understated as follows: Dublin Corporation, £341,275; Dublin County Council, £62,977; Dún Laoghaire Corporation, £28,589.  That makes a total of £432,841.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the Deputy's able assistance.  I shall consult him from time to time.  The Dublin Corporation demands are down to £341,275, and Dublin County Council, £52,977.  For the amount to be received during the year, the Authority will resort to temporary borrowing.  We have tried, as far as possible, in Dublin Corporation and in Dublin County Council, to make provision for this.  The law does not permit us to introduce a supplementary estimate because Dublin Health Authority had already gone to Dublin Corporation, and Dublin County Council and the Dún Laoghaire Borough figures had been accepted.  I bring this forward in an appeal to the Department of Finance to amend the law so as to change the date when we will introduce our estimate and give the Department of Finance an opportunity of telling us the amount we will get each year.  We should know in time what we are to get from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Health Estimates are up by almost £5 million on last year.  That amount which will have to be procured by the Government by way of taxation is no small amount.  I know that the Minister and the Government would like to be in a position to give a lot more towards the relief of rates.  I have already stated that the cost of the health services has gone up. Under Dublin Health Authority these services have increased since 1963.  The estimates increased by 15 per cent in 1962-63; seven per cent in 1963-64; 5¼ per cent in 1964-65 and in 1965-66 by 12 per cent.  That shows that, even <Col N="2254" /> with the best will in the world, in 1966-67 they will go up five or six per cent more.  The problem of the health service is huge even with the special grant we are getting&mdash;£500,000 grant plus 50 per cent of the health charges paid by the central authority.  That shows the huge problem we have to face.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation at their estimates meeting introduced a contingency fund which I hope will relieve the big impact on the rates next year. I may not be there after the next election but somebody else will, and the local elections are coming shortly.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health should be in a position to notify all the authorities about the grant that will be coming to them.  Negotiation between the Department of Finance and the Minister for Health may be required to delay striking the rates for the health authority.  In that way we would know in good time.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health, if he could get enough money, would do a good job.  So would I if I had enough money, but we have to cut our cloth according to our measure.  The Minister has done a good job and is as honest as he can be towards everyone. He has our sympathy and our co-operation in doing what he is trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Thursday night last I dealt with a number of items and I do not want to delay the House again tonight.  I just want to mention the silent voluntary organisations who are doing a wonderful job in the city and county of Dublin and in Dún Laoghaire, the religious orders with the meals on wheels service, as they call it, going around to the poor and giving them lunch in their own homes.  One of the big problems we have relates to the large number of people in our hospitals. Figures I compiled for my own <Col N="2255" /> information point to this problem.  We have a problem in dealing with the aged in the health authority hospitals. We should have more voluntary organisations and we should be a little more liberal towards the people who are looking after the aged by giving them help, and what I mean by help is money.</P>
    <P>Sometimes a son or a daughter may have to stay at home to look after the mother.  They may be losing employment and they have rent to pay and cannot carry on.  If we could go at least one-third of the way towards helping this boy or girl, or even stranger, in looking after an old person in his or her own home, it would relieve the shocking problem we have in trying to get hospital accommodation for the treatment of the aged.</P>
    <P>The position is very bad in Dublin city.  We have demands for accommodation under the health authority. Dublin Corporation are supplying flats for old people and we have all these voluntary organisations.  Notwithstanding all that, there is an acute demand for more and more hospital accommodation. We are obliged to introduce a system in St. Kevin's Hospital where old people will be taken in for a month at a time so as to give their people at home a rest.  Some of these old people are over 80 years and this work is done for charitable reasons.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister whether he could give this matter further consideration.  While the voluntary organisations have done a wonderful job in Cork and Dublin and in various parts of the country, nevertheless we have this huge problem. People seem to be more anxious to get into hospital now than they were 40 years ago.  Forty years ago, a person did not go to hospital unless he was dying.  That is completely changed now.  We have the Little Sisters of the Poor and various other charitable organisations looking after people in institutions and doing a very good job. But that is one of the huge problems we have.</P>
    <P>I refer to another matter about which the Minister is very keen to assist, that is, retarded children.  There are a number <Col N="2256" /> of voluntary organisations dealing with them.  There are many children physically disabled and their people have to put up with them at home because we have not enough hospitals to cater for them.  We know the religious bodies have been doing a very good job but even a child who is not mentally retarded, but physically deformed, is a big problem for the father and mother and it often results in the mother getting a nervous breakdown trying to look after the child. These are the big problems we have. While voluntary organisations have been doing a wonderful job, and I cannot speak too highly of the work they do, nevertheless there is a huge problem there.  The religious bodies are taxed to the very limit, both in the building of their institutions and in trying to cope with the huge volume of applicants, and we have quite a number still to be accommodated.</P>
    <P>Speaking generally, this health problem is a very big one in so far as we are concerned in the city of Dublin and in Dún Laoghaire.  The co-operation we have received from the Department of Health, from the Minister and from his executive officers, has really been a pleasure.  As far as we are concerned in the health authority, we have the most excellent and charitable staff of all times; men who are anxious to do their job and who yet still have that sense of charity which is so essential when dealing with matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters I should like to have dealt with but I shall not delay the House any longer except to say again that I wish the Minister luck, and I have no doubt he has the ability to do his job in the most conscientious and honourable way possible.</P>

It was not his wish, nor was it his making, that he should find himself, within less than a year of taking office, having to tell local authorities, through his officials, <Col N="2257" /> that the promise given last year&mdash;when it was proposed to freeze the health charges to local authorities at the 1965-66 level&mdash;could not be carried out and that, as a result of the miscalculation by his predecessor, the health charges to local authorities in 1967-68 had to jump substantially. He has my sympathy&mdash;I know sympathy is very little use to him&mdash;in having to face the local authorities with this as his first major piece of information.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke was putting some figures together and did not quite finish the job, but, no matter how he subtracts, divides or adds them, the facts are that Dublin Health Authority find themselves down £438,000, which they must find over and above what they had expected they would have to find.  My own local authority in County Meath are not in such a bad way but then we do not represent the same number of people; it would be a fraction only of the people represented by Dublin Health Authority.  As a result, we are down only a mere bagatelle&mdash;about £50,000.  The Minister refers to the fact that while the country is down 1/3d in the £, we are one of the few cases&mdash;despite the fact we have done a spot of pruning here and there&mdash; down 1/6d in the £.  But we do not know whether or not that is the end of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a peculiar situation: the extra money found by the State last year, which has not been found this year, has to be added on in future to any extra charges.  Therefore, this can escalate.  We could find next year we would be in the position of having to find quite a substantial amount of money in addition to what we are finding this year.  There is St. Loman's Mental Hospital&mdash;we subscribe to the upkeep of it&mdash;and our representative, a Fianna Fáil councillor, assured us that the mental hospital authorities had got an assurance from the Department of Health there would be no additional charges and that the 100 per cent grant over and above the 1965-66 figure was being found. Of course, he did not know&mdash;but then he is only a county councillor&mdash;that <Col N="2258" /> the Department had changed their minds.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister could quite reasonably say that not alone was the money which had been set aside last year to meet this fund spent, but he has to bring in here&mdash;in addition to his Estimate for this year&mdash;a supplementary of £2½ million to balance his books.  That is a substantial figure but if on this whole question of financing health charges a definite decision were taken and kept, then we would know where we stood.  Deputy Burke was on a very solid point when he said if we only knew in time what we had to meet, it would not be so bad.  But when one starts to make up an estimate and then halfway through suddenly finds the floor has gone from under the whole thing, because of the fact that some money which was to be available is not, it makes it very awkward both for officials and public representatives.</P>
    <P>The Minister visited practically every health authority in the country. He took great care and any questions he was asked he answered as fairly as he could.  He was, perhaps, more honest than most politicians in his position might be because, when asked a question which was perhaps a leading one, he did not try to avoid it but rather answered it.  One of the questions he was asked by my local authority was what he meant by saying that in future there would have to be some provision for helping the less well-off counties with regard to health charges. He made no bones about the fact that he proposed to do something, particularly about the western counties who had, of necessity&mdash;because their valuations are low&mdash;very high rates. He pointed out that he proposed to help the poorer counties, as he referred to them, by taking something extra from the richer ones and he made no bones about it that he thought County Meath was one of the richer ones.  I should like to point out to the Minister that a poor man in County Meath is every bit as poor as a poor man in Mayo, Donegal, Clare, Galway, or anywhere else in the country.  Also, if over the years, successive Meath <Col N="2259" /> County Councils had&mdash;instead of keeping the rates the lowest in the country, as they are at the present time; their valuation is high, therefore the rates are low&mdash;allowed the rates to go up, they would get a lot more sympathy from the Minister for Health, from the Department of Health, and the Minister might say: &ldquo;These poor fellows cannot afford to pay any more; they are already paying enough and we must give them an extra grant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have a question down for the Minister this week which, by a chance of bad luck, does not become due for answer until tomorrow.  It would have been very helpful had it been due for answer today, because the question I ask is how much the Department are paying, in addition to the 50 per cent, to each health authority in the year 1966-67, and how much they propose to pay in the year 1967-68?  Although the answer will not be given until some time between 2.30 and 3.30 p.m. tomorrow, I wager that the answer will be that while we in Meath are getting about two per cent more than the 50 per cent, in the counties I have already named, Mayo, Galway, Donegal, Sligo perhaps, Cork, Kerry and Clare, the proportion of the extra grant will be somewhere around the region of 30 to 40 per cent.  I am quite sure that that will be so.  I am quite sure that there will be a very substantial amount being paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait until we see it in thousands of pounds.  I am quite <Col N="2260" /> sure that the reason for this sudden decision is as the Minister fairly said. I am not quarrelling with him for not telling the truth.  He told us in Navan &mdash;not in Leinster House&mdash;that he proposed to do it and he can now tell us that he told us so.  We will see what the position is when the figures come up.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given mortality statistics.  There are a number of surprising features.  One is that the rate of deaths per 1,000 of the population in 1966 was .6 per cent higher than in 1965&mdash;12.1 as against 11.5, which seems rather odd.  The rate of births per thousand, at 21.5, is down on 1965, when it was 22.1.  Possibly there is a reason for this which I do not know.</P>
      <P>The Minister, as his predecessor did, points to the fact that deaths from heart disease are continuing to rise. He told us that the number of deaths from heart disease, in 1966&mdash;I suppose certified&mdash;was 11,772 as against 11,210 in 1965, which is a horrifying position.  I am just wondering is this like deaths from cancer, that they are now appearing to be far more numerous because modern diagnosis is able to discover more accurately the cause of death rather than the position some 30 years ago when a person might write a death certificate that death was due to some peculiar internal pain.</P>
      <P>The number of deaths from cancer is 5,129 as against 4,979 in 1965, a very substantial increase.  That is an alarmingly high figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister must be giving very great attention to the question of TB.  The provisional figure of deaths from respiratory tuberculosis, at 306 as against 302 in 1965, must cause a certain amount of unease. Even if there has been only a slight increase, it is too bad that the incidence of TB, which we thought was practically wiped out some years ago, should appear to be rising.  As I have a friend in a TB hospital, I had occasion during the year to visit it and was horrified to find a number of relatively young persons, mostly young to middle aged, suffering from the disease.  A number of them had been discovered as a result of the visit of <Col N="2261" /> the mobile X-ray unit to their areas. A number of them had been discovered in the normal way.  They became ill and TB was diagnosed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be possible to put on an extra effort in order to get back to the happy position that obtained some years ago when TB was almost completely wiped out.  It is just too bad that the incidence appears to be increasing.  I am quite sure that the Minister is concerned that that is so. He is the only person who can exert the necessary pressure to have it wiped out.  It may be said that the figure is relatively small as compared with 20 years ago and as compared with the figures for cancer and heart disease. Nevertheless, TB is a disease that could increase at an alarming rate, and it would be too bad if it again reached epidemic proportions.</P>
    <P>The care of the aged has been referred to briefly by Deputy Burke. That is a matter that takes up a lot of the time of those of us who serve on local authorities.  Some years ago I, with some colleagues, put a proposal before the local council that there would be a fixed sum paid to persons over 70 years of age who have no means other than the old age pension, living in their own homes, so that the persons with whom they were living, usually members of their own family, could afford to keep them.  The proposal was defeated.  I can never understand why the local authority is prepared to pay £5, £6 and £7 to keep an old person in a home whereas if these people could get £1 or 30/- per week they would be quite content to remain in their own homes.</P>
    <P>It is no use for the Minister for Health to say they prefer not to put old people into institutions.  That is a platitude. Something definite must be done about it.  I with my colleagues attempted to do something practical about it but it just did not work out. We often find a man and wife and family living in a house with an aged parent who is in receipt of a very small pension which certainly does not pay for food, clothing and other necessaries, not to mention contributing to the upkeep of the house. <Col N="2262" /> It is very hard for those who do not know to understand the difficulties that beset these people.  Are they to deprive their young families of what they are entitled to get&mdash;more space, more food, more leisure&mdash;because they have to look after the old people, particularly if they are bedridden, or are they to put the old people in the county home and be called hardhearted for doing so?  This is one of the major problems of our time.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that we have not got a great reputation for kindness to our aged people.  We pay lip-service to them.  Many of us find that the old people finish their days somewhere other than in the home in which they were reared and in which they reared their family.  If people stopped to think for a few minutes they would realise that the young people of today are the pensioners of tomorrow and the way that they treat their parents is an example to their children as to how they may be treated themselves.  It might make a difference.  Even putting it that way, we must understand that it is a very big problem for a man and his wife with a young family to keep a grandmother or grandfather and to look after them in a small house.  If there is shortage of space or of money the tendency is to send the grandparent to the county home, if there is any room there.</P>
    <P>At present, with the assistance of the Department, we are building a new wing to the county home in Trim. Recently, somebody was so sarcastic as to write to the <i>Irish Times</i> saying that we would have the swankiest poorhouse in Ireland.  We are not proud of the fact that we have to have one of these places, but we have to have them and, even with a number of beds, which will be almost 500, divided equally between men and women, we still will have quite a number of people who will be seeking admission and finding that there is no place available.  The problem, therefore, is threefold and it will have to be faced up to.  Unfortunately, so far, the tendency has been to sweep it under the carpet where it cannot be seen.  So long as these old people are not in a <Col N="2263" /> position to kick up a big row, the attitude is to leave them there: the problem will eventually sort itself out; they will die.</P>
    <P>It is too bad that old people, who have reared their families at home and lived in a district and worked very hard there all their lives, should, at the end of their days, find themselves put into a county home, particularly put into a home where the men go one side and the women the other.  I shall never forget an experience I had of two old people I knew well who were put into a county home.  After a lapse of some years, I happened to be visiting it one day and saw the old man standing outside.  He was very lonely looking.  I went over and spoke to him.  He told me that he was taking a last look at his wife's coffin which was going out on the other side.  Over the years, while they had been there, they had not been able to talk or associate at all.  It is too bad that that should be so but that is modern life and I suppose that that is the way things must be.  If there is any way out of it, it should be avoided.</P>
    <P>If the Minister says there is a hope at all of trying to keep those old people in their own district, then I am all with the Minister.  Old people can become very lonely.  If they get out of the circle of their friends and acquaintances, they may make new acquaintances but they seldom make friends again.  It is heart-breaking to see old people having to mope around the dayroom of a county home waiting for the next meal which they are not in form to eat and for the night when they will get some merciful sleep.  The Department of Health will have to deal with this.  Somebody will have to be courageous enough to face up to it.</P>
    <P>In one local authority, an effort is being made to help those old people. One of the biggest problems confronting old people, if they are living alone, is housing.  So often, we find the small farmer type, a person with a few acres of land who is just eking out an existence, living in very bad housing conditions. If the house starts to fall, they are unable to repair it.  This local authority has devised a system whereby <Col N="2264" /> they purchase cedarwood homes which they set up on the site of the old houses.  They let them for a nominal rent of 5/- a week to those old people, and, as soon as they pass on, the house is put on a loader and moved on to the next place where there is a need for it.  At least it gives them a convenient house, a small house, a warm house, and the cost is very small.  It may not be the answer to everything but the system might possibly be investigated by the Minister's Department with a view to trying to implement it on a wider scale.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he is fully committed to the view that it is preferable, if at all possible, to keep people in their own surroundings and I am all with him in that view.  However, they cannot stay there on the amount of money they get by way of pension, particularly non-contributory pension.  The Minister might discuss with county managers, if he thinks fit, the possibilities of giving a fixed supplement to those people so that they can either use it themselves or use it to pay somebody to help them to do the housework or whatever has to be done around the place.  It is money which would be well spent.  It would reduce the occupancy of the county homes and I think it might be the answer to a lot of our problems.</P>
    <P>It is all right to talk about voluntary bodies such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society, and so on, who already have more than enough to do.  Anybody who knows of their activities is aware that these public-spirited people who go around to investigate these cases find they never have enough money to meet the requirements.  There is always somebody they would like to help but they just have not enough money.  The amount of financial help they are able to give to those people is terribly small. Therefore, I think the State should step in.</P>
    <P>It is all right to talk about meals on wheels, and so on.  Particularly in the country districts, it just is not possible to do anything like that.  One goes about and it is amazing to find so many independent old people who have not had a decently-cooked meal for a long time.  There is nothing they <Col N="2265" /> can do about it.  They say: &ldquo;We cannot blame anybody.&rdquo;  They get whatever few shillings State aid they are entitled to.  It is little enough to buy a bag of coal for 13/-, which they must buy, to pay the rent and the ESB bill.  They have very little left for any type of comfort.  It is really a very big problem.  I am sorry if I am dwelling so very much on all this, but I believe it is one of the major problems of our time.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the district nursing service.  Every time we discuss this service, we are told that it is going to expand, that it will be useful, particularly for the people I have mentioned, that it will be useful to help the overworked dispensary doctor particularly during flu epidemics, and so on.  However, it does not seem to be expanding.  It still seems to be just a few people who are trying to do so much.  Occasionally, we find an effort being made to start a service in a particular district and a crochety old dispensary doctor, who has been there for donkeys ages, feels he is being interfered with and will not give the nurse anything to do. After a few weeks or months, the nurse will return to the centre and say: &ldquo;There is nothing I can do there.&rdquo; The people who refuse to co-operate from the medical end are few, but there are a few, and it does discourage those who want to help.</P>
    <P>Big strides have been made in mental health.  At present, some enlightened RMS are, in fact, setting up clinics throughout the various areas and giving the drugs and treatment at home level to people who, up to a few years ago, would be taken into a mental hospital and kept there for months and maybe years.  This is a great step forward.  I believe it can be expanded even more.  This is the sort of system we must have.  However, when people have to go to a mental hospital I think there is something wrong, that, above any service, mental hospital authorities seem to feel that, medical card or no medical card, they must get their money.</P>
    <P>I had a query some months ago about a person whose wife, an old age <Col N="2266" /> pensioner, had gone to a mental hospital. The old man was living at home in a town and trying to live on the amount of pension which he got.  He was trying also to send some small comforts to his wife.  Occasionally, he went the long journey to see her.  He got an order from the hospital to sent on a contributory old age pension book.  He spoke to me about it.  I told him to do nothing of the kind.  He showed me the letters which said that the mental hospital people had got permission from the Department of Social Welfare to collect it.  There was nothing further about the matter until about a fortnight ago when he got a bill for £16. That man can pay the bill if he eats nothing for three weeks: it is really quite simple.  All he has to do is eat nothing for a week.  He has £15 of the £16 and I am sure that they will wait for the other one.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister about it and he said that most certainly the mental hospital authority were not entitled to collect the book.  I have spoken to the Minister's secretary on the telephone and I have written to the Minister giving him particulars about it and I am sure that I will get a reply in due course.  I did get an acknowledgement saying that the matter was being looked into.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would point out to the mental hospital authorities that they are not above the law and that they are not entitled to try to take the only source of income which those poor old people have.  Is it the idea that they want to have both the father and the mother in the mental hospital, because if the old man has to hand up his book and has nothing to live on, it will be either the local hospital or the local cemetery to which he will go pretty quickly?  It is rather stupid that this should be the approach.</P>
    <P>Another matter which requires attention is the shortage of beds in the various schools and institutions which deal with mentally defective children. Occasionally we find children of tender years in mental hospitals associating with patients who have grown old in the place.  It is shocking that this should be allowed.  I know that when Deputy MacEntee was Minister for <Col N="2267" /> Health some years ago he stated that he hoped to train a number of nurses for the purpose of opening some of the hospitals and old buildings which were being closed at the time in order to try to deal with this problem of mentally defective children.  I distinctly remember his comments that it was not accommodation which was his worry but trained personnel.  At that time some effort was being made to train them. It was a good many years ago and there has been a substantial improvement in the position but I understand that present accommodation for mentally defective children is so scarce that many children start on the register looking for a place in one of the institutions when they are four or five years old and the problem is solved when they reach 16 and they cannot then be taken in.</P>
    <P>The new place in Delvin, County Westmeath, has been very obliging and did a lot of work last year to accommodate extra patients, but this still does not solve the problem.  While the Meath local authority have no children in Mullingar Mental Hospital, they have quite a number in their own homes.  Other local authorities have sent children to the mental hospital.  There is nothing so sad as to see poor little children of seven or eight years of age rambling around a ward with a group of unkempt, filthy-looking old men who have been there for years.  Apparently nobody worries about them and the only prospect for the youngsters, if they can think at all, is that down through the years before them they face an existence there where they will eventually turn into the same kind of creatures as those with whom they are associating.  It is not good enough and it is not good enough to say that we have not got the money or the accommodation. We should make an extra effort to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>The number of mentally defective children is very large.  The day schools which have been started, mainly by voluntary effort and with some assistance from the State when they are properly established, are doing an excellent job, but the amount they are able to <Col N="2268" /> do is only a fraction of what has to be done.  Again, they will take in only those who are mildly handicapped.  I do not know what the answer is.  I do know that apart from those we know about, through the local authorities, there are literally hundreds, indeed thousands, of children who are not known about officially because their parents still stupidly think that it is some kind of slur on the family and they keep them away from everybody. It is too bad that we should have this attitude in 1967, but it is there and we have to face up to it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can do anything to try to resolve the position, he should do it and if money is spent in this direction, it will be very well spent. Recently I heard a statement by a doctor that the incidence of mental disorder among emigrants to Britain, and particularly among young people, was far higher among the Irish than any other race.  I hope that statement is wrong and I would be glad if the Minister would comment on it.  It has received wide publicity and I should like to know whether it is true or false.  We should attempt to treat the mildly handicapped and those suffering from nervous breakdowns in their own homes.  Some of the mental hospitals have been supplying such a service.</P>
    <P>I was appalled after I had been a member of one mental hospital authority for a short time to find that up to about 1963 or 1964 women in the hospital were only supplied with shawls.  I was told that this was done so that people outside would know that they were mentally afflicted when they left the hospital.  I am glad to say that with the co-operation of other members of the authority, we stopped that practice.  Certainly the type of clothing supplied to those who require clothing could not be likened to Paris models, to put it mildly.  It would contribute greatly to an improvement in the mental health of girls and women in such hospitals if an effort were made to allow them to dress reasonably and also if facilities were provided for them so that they could have improvements made to their appearance, such as to their hair. <Col N="2269" /> It would help greatly because they are not too happy when they cannot have their hair done or have proper clothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I always admire Deputy Mrs. Desmond, even as a politician.  The position about the ambulance service has been referred to.  It is something which I discussed with the Minister a couple of months ago.  It is one of the services, apparently, about which nobody is prepared to make up his mind whether it is to be treated specially or just as a run of the mill service.  Some years ago arrangements were made whereby ambulance drivers were to be paid the same rate as lorry drivers employed by local authorities, with this difference, that no overtime was to be paid.  In other words, the lorry driver started work at 8 a.m. and finished at 5 p.m. or 5.30 p.m.; he finished on Friday evenings and was off on Saturdays, Sundays and on holidays, but the ambulance driver starts at whatever time he is required, usually at 7.30 a.m. or 8 a.m., and works all day and perhaps goes home then but can be called on again at night.  He may have to work through the night, and if he is not needed the next day, he is allowed take a few hours rest.  If he is needed, he will go off to work and he will work on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. I should like somebody to explain how that system can be regarded as the right way in which to treat special people&mdash;and I regard ambulance drivers as special people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some local authorities decided to try to improve the position and they started to pay these people overtime. Various grades of overtime were paid. Eventually three or four unions catering for the ambulance drivers decided to make a unified effort to improve the position.  After making a number of futile approaches to the county managers individually, and to the County Managers' Association as a body, they eventually asked the Minister <Col N="2270" /> for Health to meet a deputation. He did meet them, and said that he considered they had a case.  He agreed to ask the County Managers Association to arrange an early meeting.  An early meeting was arranged and was held.  A further meeting was to be arranged in the near future and from that good day to this&mdash;I think it was 16th December&mdash;it has been found impossible to get the County Managers Association to meet the unions representing the ambulance drivers.</P>
    <P>I want to put this plainly to the Minister.  Will he think it unreasonable if, after treatment like that has been handed out, the unions, at the request of their members, serve strike notice on the county managers and completely stop the ambulance service?  If these people were not special people, if they were not dedicated men who realise they are doing a job which must be done, that strike notice would have been served a long time ago, but they are special people with an interest in helping suffering humanity and they have not so far served strike notice.</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that we, as trade union officials, cannot stop the serving of that notice for very much longer.  I should like to place on record that I think the behaviour of the County Managers Association in this case is very shabby indeed.  I see no reason why they should have adopted and continue this attitude. Maybe they think it smart.  Maybe they realise that these people are not anxious to go on strike.  Maybe they feel that if they keep from meeting them they are putting off the evil day.</P>
    <P>Right in the middle of this the Minister announces a training scheme for ambulance drivers.  He may not be aware that about 60 per cent of them have already had training which means they can get a certificate after any test which he likes to give them. They can prove that they have the necessary experience and the necessary training to carry out their job properly.  I appeal to the Minister&mdash; this is something I do not like to do; we were talking about free collective bargaining earlier on today&mdash;to try to put the situation in order and to <Col N="2271" /> approach the County Managers Association and point out to them that it is not good enough to treat these people in this way.</P>
    <P>We have all sorts of hospital staffs. Last year we were told how serious the situation was because a number of senior medical people in the hospitals were dissatisfied with their pay.  We were asked to agree that surgeons and certain other people should get an increase in salary at local authority level.  They got an increase in salary with effect from April 12 months.  In most cases the local authorities realised that they had to pay their surgeons or they would go elsewhere. These surgeons are doing an excellent job.  They, too, are dedicated men who have been trained to a profession and must be paid accordingly.</P>
    <P>Shortly after that, a question of a wage increase for hospital staffs, including wardsmen, wardsmaids, porters and ambulance drivers, arose. This was freely negotiated between the managers and the trade unions and dated back to 1st April, but the Minister's predecessor refused to sanction a date earlier than 1st June.  Surely the Minister and the House will appreciate how difficult it is for a trade union official to meet a group of these people and tell them it was all right for the surgeons to get £700 a year dated 18 months back, but that they could only get £1 a week or 15/- a week dated back to 1st June because the Minister said the country could not afford it dated back to 1st May or 1st April.</P>
    <P>We went to the Labour Court and we worked out terms, but the Minister and his colleague the Minister for Local Government refused to agree to an alternative date.  I should like to place on record my disappointment at the fact that these people who are doing an excellent job should be treated in this way.  They are paid very little.  They get very little for the job they are doing.  These people must work at weekends.  They must work according to a rota.  They get Saturday or Sunday off every third week.  They must work on Christmas Day, on St. <Col N="2272" /> Patrick's Day, and on any holiday you like to name.  The only holiday they get is their annual holiday.  Still they could not get this increase back to a date which was freely negotiated because the Minister decided they were not entitled to it.</P>

      <P>The only history it has is that it was negotiated all over the country.  This is the first time I have ever come across the situation where the employer, the State being the employer, refused to sanction a Labour Court recommendation.  A conciliation conference agreed on that figure and on that rate.  We attempted to have a full Labour Court hearing but the Labour Court informed us that they were told &mdash;I assume by a Government Department&mdash;that as the Minister had made a decision, they were not entitled to hear the case.  If this is not pettiness, I do not know what it is.  The money is so small that it is hardly worth talking about, but when someone has £7 a week, an extra £4 is a lot of money. These people still feel they are entitled to it.  There has been a tendency down through the years to treat these people who are known as non-nursing personnel as not belonging to the ordinary staff of the hospital.  Recently the 100 hour fortnight was reduced to 90 hours. These people who are referred to as non-nursing personnel do most of the work around the hospitals, apart from the technical work.  They feed the patients and in many cases they change them and look after them from morning <Col N="2273" /> to night, but there is a tendency to deprive them of the reduction in hours.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Adjournment Debate: Rents of Local Authority Houses.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair and the House will be aware that I do not lightly raise a matter on the Adjournment nor do I do it very often, but I think the reply to this question was such that it must be ventilated in the House.  With your permission, sir, I should like to repeat the question I asked:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that the effect of certain circulars issued by his Department recently will be either to increase the rents of local authority houses to an unbearable level, or to increase rates beyond the capacity of ratepayers; if he will make a statement on the matter; and whether he favours meeting any deficit arising by greater subvention from his Department or by increase of rents and rates.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the fixing of a rent is entirely the responsibility of the local authority, but in discussing this, I must relate certain circulars from the Department of Local Government and actions of the Minister to the effect they would have on the position of a local authority in this regard.</P>
      <P>First, I should like very briefly to explain the deficit principle.  The deficit principle, as most of us here know, is that in respect of people from condemned houses and certain priorities such as those living in houses where there is TB, the Government shall meet two-thirds of the loan charges, principal and interest repayments, in respect of the rehousing of these people, for the period of the repayment.  There has always been a maximum amount in respect of which the Minister will pay.  That maximum over the years has approximated to the cost of the house.  The maximum to-day stands at £1,650.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between the position to-day and the position over the years is one which can be explained by a <Col N="2274" /> very practical example.  There is in Drogheda town a new housing scheme known as Balls Grove, and it was built in three sections which were occupied sectionally as they were built.  Section one cost £1,650 a house.  Two or three years ago the Minister was paying by way of principal and interest, up to £1,500 per house, so that there had only to be met by the local authority the balance of £150 without help from the Department.</P>
    <P>Section two cost £2,070, and the limit of subvention from the Department at that stage was £1,650.  Section three, where the last tenants have just gone into their houses, has cost £2,600 per house, and the maximum the Minister will pay by way of subvention still stands at £1,650.  This means that from somewhere, be it from the rates struck by the local authority, be it from the tenants of these houses or from any other tenants, there must come the full repayment charges on the extra £950 as well as the normal repayment charges on the aforesaid £1,650.</P>
    <P>The Minister sent a circular to the local authorities.  I refer to Circular No. H.3/66 of 30th March, 1966, and this circular was most important: It was headed: &ldquo;Modification of Deficit Principal: Review of Rents&rdquo;.  This meant that for the first time if a local authority chose to charge a rent which resulted in there being a decreased deficit or no deficit at all in an old housing scheme, which were the houses which cost less, they would not lose by way of subvention from the Department.  They would gain this amount as profit or as a surplus which they could devote to any other purpose such as the reduction of rents elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the wording of that circular&mdash;which I shall not quote here because I do not want to delay the House any longer than necessary&mdash;the Minister is exerting undue influence on a local authority to increase the rents of old houses by not providing the wherewithal for the new houses. Therefore, in respect of that new housing scheme the local authority must (a) get it from the local rates, which would be financially impossible, <Col N="2275" /> or (b) from a rent which would be beyond the capacity of the ordinary working man to pay.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Minister to the second part of my question where I asked him whether he favours meeting any deficit arising by greater subvention from the Department or from increases in rents or rates.  I submit that that question was not answered. I want to know which he prefers.</P>
    <P>This deficit principle in respect of which there have been two distinct types of deficit has been of itself a cause of annoyance and trouble.  It has been met by certain local authorities by subvention from the rates.  I do not want to go into absolute detail on this matter, but there were cases in Drogheda town where rents on the same type of houses were different because the people who had got the subvention got two-thirds if they came from a condemned house or had, unhappily, an illness such as TB in their old house before they left it, but if they did not come from a condemned house, or from one of these priority classes, they got only one-third subvention.  The unrest because of this was such that we had to meet the difference from the rates and reduce the rents of all the tenants in these schemes.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Minister's circular of 30th March last, the accountant has produced what would be a viable situation for Drogheda town.  In the same area of Balls Grove to which I have referred, there would be for identical houses a maximum rent ranging from £3 6s 2d to £4 19s 4d where the figures at the moment are £1 6s 3d and £1 9s 11d.  I suggest this is undue pressue brought by the Minister, which cannot be condoned.</P>
    <P>While the Minister by circular desires to force the hand of the corporation into increasing the rents of the old houses, there has not been over the past few years, since the new housing Bill was mooted&mdash;and that is quite a few years ago&mdash;any enthusiasm on the part of local authority officials to offer houses for tenant purchase.  Therefore those tenants who brought out their houses some <Col N="2276" /> years ago are now &ldquo;untouchables&rdquo;, whereas the other tenants who perhaps over the past four or five years have desired to buy out their houses are in the position of having the rents of their houses doubled.  There is also the anomaly that because of the pressure on the local rates and because money was scarce, the repair and maintenance of old houses was minimal.  It is found now that the tenant who spent a large amount of money improving the house which he has occupied for many years will have his rent increased, even though he has not been a burden upon the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>To give an indication of what the trend is in these three sections of the Ball's Grove estate, I shall recount what happened in three instances.  In the case where the cost of the house was £1,650, the rent plus rates at the moment stands at 34/5d per week. They are now moving to differential rents within that section.  In section two where the cost was £2,070, the rent stands at 41/6d, including rates.  If the rents on the new section were compiled by the same method as in the other two sections, the rent would work out at something like £4 10s, which no ordinary worker rearing a family in a provincial town can pay. What has been done is a stop-gap; for the moment the entire scheme has been placed on a differential renting system and we have turned aside from the idea of increasing the rents on the old houses.  The result has been that section three will place an impost, unless something else happens, of 6/-in the £ on the Drogheda rates and the rents in the Ball's Grove estate will range from 19/- to 60/- a week, inclusive of rates.  This means the hand of the local authority is being forced, improperly forced.</P>
    <P>I hold that the idea behind the whole industrial structure here in the fixing of wages has been that from the Central Exchequer the industrial worker and his agricultural counterpart got his house at a reasonable figure.  That meant, perhaps, that an easier settlement could be made with that worker from the point of view of the wages he felt he could expect. <Col N="2277" /> There is now a complete departure from that principle.  No matter what the Minister may say the position is that his circular places local authorities all over the country in a position in which they have a choice and that choice is increasing rents on old houses in which the standard of accommodation is inferior and which have, in many cases, not been maintained properly because of financial stringency, up to a level approximating to those charged for new houses in which there are undoubtedly better amenities.  Added to that is the fact that, where these old houses have been maintained, maintenance has been done by the tenants themselves.</P>
    <P>I hold the Minister has not answered my question in a proper manner.  I have tried not to be either antagonistic or destructive in my approach to this matter and I hope now the Minister will improve upon his answer earlier today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to an intolerable degree.  He puts forward as a solution to the problem the suggestion that there should be a subvention from my Department. It seems to me this phrase &ldquo;subvention from the Department&rdquo; is intended to convey that this problem can be solved without any section of the community having to pay.  If Deputy Donegan maintains that increased costs should not be borne by rent payers or ratepayers, or partly by both, then he should, I think, make it clear that what he is in fact proposing is that the total increased cost should be paid by the general taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always been accepted that the provision of houses for rent by people who are in need of <Col N="2278" /> housing and who are unable to provide houses for themselves was, in the first instance, a matter to be dealt with by the local authority.  The Government have, however, by various measures, adjusted from time to time, made arrangements to spread a substantial part of the load over the whole community, largely because of the fact that there may be in one area a particularly acute housing problem, involving such heavy financial commitments that it would be inequitable to ask the particular area itself to bear the entire cost.  It has, however, always been accepted that local authorities should be responsible for a considerable part of the financing of their housing activities by raising revenue by means of fair and reasonable rents and by means of local taxation.  This is, I think, essential.  Local authorities should have a responsibility in this matter; they should have an interest in keeping costs as low as possible and also a certain discipline in not embarking on anything except schemes that are absolutely necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Donegan thinks a greater proportion of the cost is appropriate to be paid by the general taxpayer, I do not deny his right to argue that case, but I think he should state clearly why that burden should be put on the shoulders of the general taxpayer instead of using that misleading phrase &mdash;it is, I think, intended to mislead&mdash; that the position should be met by subvention from the Department.  I cannot give any subvention from my Department.  I can only give a subvention from what money the Department of Finance can provide.  There is no money available to my Department from any other source.  I can disburse only that money which the Minister for Finance finds it possible to extract from the community as a whole.  If Deputy Donegan thinks, for instance, that, because of the exceptional magnitude of the housing problem in Dublin city, it is both proper and fair that a greater proportion of the cost of housing in Dublin should be borne by the taxpayers of County Louth, why then I should be interested to hear him making the case for it because that is, in fact, what he is <Col N="2279" /> suggesting.  I do not say it might not be possible to make such a case.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the circulars issued by my Department would increase either the rents or the rates to an intolerable level is, as Deputy Donegan knows, utter nonsense, particularly from the point of view of rents, because the basic principle of the circulars is that the rents should be related to the tenants' ability to pay and no circular from my Department could reasonably be interpreted in the manner in which Deputy Donegan has interpreted them as urging local authorities to increase rents&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The text of the circular&mdash;I think in reply to a question tabled by Deputy Donegan&mdash;was given in the Official Report of 29th November, 1966, and if Deputy Donegan goes to the trouble of reading the reply, he will see that one of the principal objectives is that no person in need of housing should be refused housing merely because of inability to pay the fixed rent, and no person should suffer hardship because of such inability.  It was clearly stated in the circular that tenants should pay rents related to their incomes, their family commitments and the standard of accommodation provided.  There was nothing in any circular issued by my Department that could be interpreted as an instruction to local authorities to increase either rents or rates to intolerable levels, nothing whatever, and if any local authority interpreted any circular in that way, then they are interpreting it incorrectly. If any such proposal came before my Department, I would certainly turn it down.  I do not know what Deputy Donegan is talking about when he makes this allegation that the effect of the circulars would be to increase rents to an intolerable level, in view of the fact that the basic principle is, as I said, that rents should <Col N="2280" /> be related to the capacity of the tenant to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, what I said was that the circular now allows a local authority to increase the rents of old houses and make a profit on them to put towards any purpose it so desires.  If the ordinary method of fixing rent were applied to this estate in Drogheda, the rent would be £4 10s. a week.  This would bring the rent to an unbearable level, representing in the case of a working man one week's wages.  I did not say the circular suggested bringing all rents to an unbearable level.  I said that, if the previous principle were followed by the local authority, as had always been followed, the rents in section three of this estate would be at an unbearable level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that the effect of certain circulars issued by his Department recently will be either to increase the rents of local authority houses to an unbearable level, or to increase rates beyond the capacity of the ratepayers....</P>
      <P>I have said that no circular issued by my Department could have that effect and that, if any proposal that would have that effect comes before me, I will turn it down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That forces them to do something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the cost of houses has increased in recent years.  I know that this has an effect on people seeking tenancies and has an effect on the taxpayers and ratepayers.  It is a fact that a house which costs £2,500 to build gives rise to annual costs of approximately £4 6s. 6d. a week plus rates.  It is a fact, which I recognise, that most of the people whom it is the duty of the local authorities to house <Col N="2281" /> could not afford rents of that size or anything approaching it.</P>
      <P>The system is, as I have said, that this cost is spread in three different ways&mdash;the State through its subsidy payments, the local authority through its rate payments, and the tenants.  In reply to the question here today, I pointed out that the contribution from the State and local authorities to the cost of a local authority house amounts, between them, to the equivalent of a capital sum between £1,505 and £1,981.  Surely it will be agreed that these are substantial subsidies?</P>
      <P>With regard to Drogheda Corporation, which Deputy Donegan seems to be most concerned with, in 1955-56 the State subsidy contributed about £18,000 towards housing costs in Drogheda, the rates contributed about £6,260 and £32,000 was the contribution from rents and purchase money.  By 1966-67 there has been substantial changes in these figures.  The subsidy contribution had almost trebled to £49,000; the rates contribution had quintupled to £33,000 and the contribution from rent and purchase annuities had not quite doubled&mdash;less than £60,000.  I think there are obvious implications to be drawn from these figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There certainly are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the amount of subsidy from both ratepayers and taxpayers had increased proportionately in regard to local authority housing.  I do not see how Deputy Donegan can maintain that there has been neglect in regard to making reasonable arrangements for subsidy by the State.  But I think there is evidence there of a necessity, in the interest of fair dealing, to ensure that those people who are able to pay reasonable rents, or rents approaching the economic rent, should be required to do so.  Certainly, with regard to the level of rents in Drogheda Corporation area, there is evidence that some of the rents are too high for certain people, whom it is the duty of the corporation to house, to pay.  There is evidence also that there should be a reduction in the rent for these people. In other words, I think the figures I have quoted here show quite clearly <Col N="2282" /> that, in the interests of fair play to everybody, there is every reason for the corporation to adopt the system of relationship with income which was suggested in the circular, that is, that the rents should be subject to a maximum which is fairly calculated, and that the rent within that limit should be related to the capacity of the tenant to pay.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan referred to purchase schemes.  I indicated in reply to another question today the terms of such a scheme which I would be prepared to approve under the 1966 Act.  I indicated this to Dublin Corporation. The reply, which I have sent to the City Manager, was:</P>
      <P>In this connection the Minister would be prepared to agree to sales under section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966, when in operation, at a discount from the market value of the house calculated at a rate not exceeding two per cent a year for each year after five years during which the tenant has been continuously in occupation of the house or any other house of a local authority, subject to a maximum discount of 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>I think those are reasonable purchase terms.  The intention is that every tenant, who according to Deputy Donegan has these unbearable terms imposed on him, should have the option under the terms of a scheme similar to that I have read out.  That is reasonable and nobody need have any justifiable complaint.  There is no question of an unbearable rent being imposed on anybody, because the suggestion in the circular is that the rents should be related to the income of the tenant and, therefore, to his capacity to pay.  I really do not know what Deputy Donegan has been talking about.</P>
