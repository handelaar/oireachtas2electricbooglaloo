      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that conditions may arise, due to altered circumstances, with the passage of time, or to the absence of enforceable conditions in the terms of past planning permissions, in which the provisions in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, by which the completion of estate roads by developers may be enforced, may not be applicable.  It is a matter for the local authority to examine the position in such cases and to decide whether, or in what circumstances, they would be <Col N="450" /> prepared to take such roads in charge.  I may add that following representations made by me the whole problem of unfinished estates in the Dublin area is under special consideration by the local authorities concerned and that considerable progress has been made in recent months in bringing cases of long standing to a satisfactory conclusion.  I make no secret of my view that these efforts must be fully maintained until this problem is resolved in all outstanding cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Taiscí Stáit is a very special type of organisation.  I think the Deputy is aware that it owes its origin to the fact that the Industrial Credit Company, which was a company expected to operate by normal commercial standards, had been asked by the Government from time to time to take on various projects which were not necessarily very remunerative or profitable.  Taiscí Stáit was established to take over this type of project from the Industrial Credit Company so that the Industrial Credit Company would be left with what would be, properly speaking, commercial transactions.  For that reason An Taiscí Stáit is in a special position and the advances it makes and the equity holdings which it takes up from time to time are usually of a very special nature.  They are often a rescue type of operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time this particular operation was in jeopardy and when there was a very serious question of farmers who had supplied this organisation with products being denied payment for their products, I am quite certain the Deputy would be one of the first to suggest that Taiscí Stáit should step in in this critical situation and help out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple answer is that the original enterprise was a failure and an attempted rescue operation by Taiscí Stáit was unsuccessful. The Deputy cannot have it both ways. When we have one of these organisations or companies getting into difficulties and a general demand to try to keep them going and shore them up, Taiscí Stáit steps in to do that rescue type of operation.  I do not think we can come along afterwards and suggest it should make a profit on every operation of this type.</P>

      <P>Apart from the Economic Research Institute referred to in my reply to Question No. 33, the National Building Agency is the only body for which I have requested overdraft facilities, pending the voting of the necessary funds by Dáil Éireann. The facilities were requested to cover the Agency's commitments on houses for State personnel within a limit of £100,000.  Recoupment is made periodically from the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter of undertaking referred to in the question was simply a request to the Institute's bank to provide temporary finance within a limit of £30,000 pending the taking of a Supplementary Estimate which was passed by the Dáil on 7th <Col N="464" /> December, 1966.  No statutory authority was required for the making of such request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, I was referring to the future hospital building programme and the cost of providing the extra accommodation. I know that the Minister referred to this in the course of his speech when he said that the rapidly rising cost of hospital buildings makes it imperative that all reasonable economies should be secured both in design of building and the utilisation where practicable of new techniques of construction. I think that any investigation of future needs should ensure that accommodation that is provided at enormous cost should fully be utilised. I do not know whether the Minister is aware, as I am aware, that accommodation has been provided at enormous cost and, in fact, has never been used over a period of years.  I think there should be a very close investigation of existing hospitals and institutions in the country to ensure that no unnecessary extra building takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of vacant spaces in existence over a period of years that have not been utilised.  I know that various reasons and excuses can be advanced as to why it is not used but it is a disgraceful waste of public <Col N="496" /> money that that should be so.  I think that many arrangements could be made for a change of use.  I think that in quite a number of institutions space is becoming available and this should be followed up very closely to see if it can be utilised for any of the purposes for which we require accommodation at the present time.</P>
    <P>I said, earlier on, that I was impressed by certain things which the Minister had to say.  I was particularly impressed by the present-day thinking and attitudes towards the care of the aged.  There has been a complete change of outlook here over the past year or so and this is very welcome.  At present, I think we should concentrate on providing institutional care and accommodation for aged people.  I am glad the Minister is completely committed to the idea of doing everything possible to keep old people in their own surroundings.  It is only in these surroundings that I think they can ever hope to be happy because people belong where they have spent their lives. I think that with half the comfort and half the care they would be much happier in their own surroundings.</P>
    <P>I said before on numerous occasions that I visit quite a number of institutions where aged people are looked after and where they receive the most excellent care and attention, medical nursing and otherwise and yet, to me, they are not happy people.  They are not happy because they are looking at the four walls of a room in an institution in which they have no interest.  Every effort should be made to keep them outside.</P>
    <P>We are all pleased to learn of the development taking place in many parts of the country, that various voluntary and charitable organisations and welfare societies are combining to provide the necessary social services to keep these people comfortable and happy in the surroundings of their own homes.  The religious orders and charities generally have done wonderful work over the years.  Indeed, they have not always got the co-operation and assistance they were entitled to expect from the responsible health authorities.  It is quite obvious that <Col N="497" /> there has been a complete change in outlook in this regard and the health authorities, at least in some areas, are co-operating as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister has listed many of the services which can be provided and the equipment which can and should be supplied.  Of course, the needs of individuals very greatly, but if we get full co-operation from the health authorities and if the voluntary organisations work in co-operation and association with the health authorities, the number of aged persons finding their way into county homes and other institutions will be considerably reduced.  Many hospitals in the country have been crowded out and silted up with elderly people who move in and stay there.  The whole question of hospital accommodation is very important and it is so expensive to provide that every effort should be made to ensure that, for instance, accommodation in acute hospitals is used only by persons who require the sort of treatment obtainable there. When patients pass the first stage of treatment, there should be accommodation found for them in less expensive institutions where they could recuperate just as well and at a fraction of the cost.</P>
    <P>It is lamentable and deplorable that more investigation has not been done in relation to this matter and that there is not first, second and third stage bed accommodation for patients.  In an acute hospital, naturally, equipment is expensive and the staff must be expensive. The acute hospital, having done the main job, cannot move the patient.  Patients have been in acute beds for three or four months longer than need be the case if proper arrangements were made to move them on and to reserve the acute space for the right type of patient.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which should be a cause of concern to all of us.  We made rapid progress in the eradication of tuberculosis over a period, as the Minister said, of 15 years.  Then we come to 1964 and 1965 and we have the disturbing statistic that slightly over 2,000 new patients were discovered in each of those years.  If we <Col N="498" /> accept that state of affairs and make no intensive effort at final eradication, there is something wrong.  This is evidence that we dealt with the problem up to a point but are not getting any further.  There must be an all-out effort if this hard core of 2,000 is to be appreciably reduced.  The special attention of county medical officers and of practitioners generally should be drawn to this figure.  A special circular should be issued by the Department asking for their co-operation in ensuring that every case that shows clinical signs of tuberculosis is X-rayed and, where there is a positive result, that every contact is X-rayed.  This is an important matter which deserves special attention if we are to finish the job that has been so well done in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that only about 50 per cent of pre-school children were immunised against diphtheria.  In referring to the health services generally, Deputy Gibbons recommended a pre-school medical service.  If we had such a service, that other 50 per cent of pre-school children would be immunised against diphtheria and many other preventable diseases.  This question is associated with the scarcity of district nurses.</P>
    <P>I am glad to learn from the Minister's statement that a training course is now in progress with the object of increasing the number of district nurses.  Consideration should be given to the question of giving further assistance to the Jubilee Nursing Association&mdash;I think there is another name for it.  This is an organisation that gives excellent service.  In any district I am aware of where there is a Jubilee nurse, the amount of work done by the nurse is simply fantastic. Recently I attended the annual meeting of the Jubilee Nursing Association in one area in County Dublin.  It is worth describing the amount of work done by one nurse.  The nurse, of course, is totally overworked and the association would gladly appoint a second nurse, who is badly needed, but cannot see that it would be possible to raise the necessary funds to enable them to do so.  I realise that a <Col N="499" /> large percentage of the money is provided by the health authorities but the voluntary element is very important and the people are kept in touch with the nurse.</P>
    <P>I shall now give some idea of the work done by this nurse: number of general cases seen during the year, 206; number of visits to general cases, 1,720; number of visits to infants and children, 2,606; number of welfare clinics attended, 44; number of school children examined for school medical examination, 305; number of school children prepared for school medical examination, 208.  That is an amazing amount of work for one nurse to perform. It indicates the great need for stepping up the nursing service which, of course, is also associated with the efforts to keep the aged out of institutions and to help to care for them in their own homes.</P>
    <P>The high percentage who took the vaccine against polio has been referred to.  That has been possible only by reason of the intensive effort made and I know that a very intensive effort was made in the Dublin area. All the pressures were brought to bear and we had this first-class result of which we should be very proud.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the conditions in mental hospitals and the decline in the number of mental health patients.  I have been very impressed by the improvements which have taken place over the last few years in the area with which I am especially acquainted.  Until recently, conditions in these institutions could be described as nothing short of deplorable.  They were completely overcrowded. Due to the small number of doctors employed and to the fact that in one institution you could have as many as 1,850 patients, it was completely impossible to sort the patients out and have any kind of active treatment for them.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that positions for doctors in these institutions have been made more attractive.  Now there is an effort to sort out the geriatric patients from those really mental, to provide active treatment and to get as many out as possible.  If we continue making <Col N="500" /> progress at the rate made in the past few years, we will go very fast indeed. It is not before time.  I know the accommodation is completely inadequate, but the out-patient approach and the active treatment approach will reduce significantly the number of people who will be permanently in these institutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the unit for emotionally disturbed children at St. Loman's.  I believe this unit is doing excellent work but I understand the cost is enormous.  Apparently, there is no way of reducing this cost.  The Minister said it was regarded as a priority to set up a provincial unit for this type of work.  The information I have is that it is very important that these institutions be within reasonable range of the family from which the child comes.  There is serious objection to taking children a long way from their own homes.  I do not know how accommodation is to be provided unless that is done.  In any case, I personally believe it is far better that accommodation should be provided, even at a considerable distance from their homes.  The disturbance they can cause at home in certain circumstances is enormous.</P>
    <P>It is time we gave up criticising the ambulance and accident service.  No doubt for many years it was deplorably inadequate and our ambulances were not equipped to deal with accident cases.  Now I believe that certainly in the Dublin area, the ambulances are equipped and the crews are trained and equipped to deal effectively with accident cases.  It is wrong criticism to say the service is still not up to standard.  There may be certain parts of the country where improvements could still be effected but the service in the Dublin area does not leave much to be desired.  I hope the new arrangements which have been come to with the hospitals in relation to accident cases, especially at night, will prove to be effective and that the team work expected of them will be available to the unfortunate victims of these accidents.</P>
    <P>The dental service is something that needs to be examined.  I heard of a case recently of an applicant for <Col N="501" /> assistance towards a repair job on dentures.  They cost £1 and eventually, after considerable time and agitation, the person got 2/-.  That is something that needs to be looked into.</P>
    <P>I was rather disappointed about the setting up of the special unit in the Dublin Health Authority area for the investigation of cervical cancer.  I do not know why it has taken so long to bring this unit into being.  There was considerable difficulty about staffing the unit because the salary offered was insufficient.  I know the Department stepped up that salary but, quite frankly, I do not know what the present position is.  I think the unit is still not set up on a working basis.  I know there are a couple of technicians employed and there is some sort of temporary arrangement which, I think, is not fully effective.</P>
    <P>That more or less covers most of what I wanted to say except one further point the Minister should look into.  There should be some sort of an agreed veterinary and medical policy on the use of antibiotics and other drugs.  There is a fair amount of indiscriminate use of antibiotics in agriculture today.  That could have serious repercussions.  There should be some general understanding about the use of these drugs.  It is possible that not only could similar drugs be ineffective on people who have used these agricultural products but they could have very dangerous reactions. It is a matter that requires attention as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>There are many aspects of the Minister's Department one could deal with.  However, I intend to confine myself to one aspect only&mdash;hygiene in our restaurants and hotels.  I am aware that great progress has been made in this respect in many of our hotels and restaurants, but unfortunately there still remain a large number which are not very hygieneconscious. I was glad to hear the announcement last year that the Minister was in the process of setting up a committee to deal with the improvement of hygiene in the hotels and restaurants requiring it.</P>

      <P>Yes, indeed, and the bars.  The washing and toilet facilities in the bars particularly and in many of the restaurants are totally inadequate. Frequently, there is a lack of clean paper towels rather than the roller towels, which, reports have indicated, are not as hygienic as people think.  I am conscious of the difficulties that many of the bar owners and <i>restaurateurs</i> have.  Some members of the public have the unhappy hobby of collecting plugs or anything else removable from a washroom.  It is difficult then to fill a washbasin, particularly if one is using the type of tap on which one has to depress a lever. Education of the public is required here, particularly in the schools.</P>
      <P>I have here a booklet entitled <i>Hygiene in Marks and Spencers' Staff Kitchens and Diningrooms.</i> This booklet is dedicated to improving the standards of hygiene not only within their own organisation but throughout Great Britain.  The original publication was for the <i>Hygienic Food Handling Magazine</i> which first appeared in 1949. This annual is such an excellent publication that it has been accepted by many county councils in Britain.  In fact, they say:</P>
      <P>Like its predecessors, this annual is intended primarily for use within our own organisation, but it is gratifying to know that thousands of copies of these hygiene publications have found their way, upon request, into the hands of Public Health Authorities, Hospitals, Catering Organisations and individuals who are anxious to prevent the many thousands of cases of food poisoning which occur each year in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>I have given a copy of this booklet to the Minister.  It deals with such things as personal hygiene, the tidy appearance necessary for food handlers, ensuring that they have proper covering for their heads.  I have gone into many restaurants and very often found waitresses with little caps on their heads which are more decorative than practical.</P>

      <P>This booklet deals with that subject and says the hair should be clean and well brushed, tidy and covered by a cap.  That is accepted.  It also deals with morning inspection of hands.  I wonder in how many restaurants or cafés in this city are the hands of the staff inspected by the staff manageress or those responsible to see that the nails are clean.  I imagine very few.  How many people come into a restaurant to prepare food having a bad cold or open sores on their hands, dirty bandages or things like that and there is nobody to check?  This does happen.  Many people report for work suffering from sore throats, upsets or infections of the stomach and it says quite rightly in this book&mdash;and this is accepted among those who know something about hygiene&mdash;these people should not be allowed near food.  How <Col N="504" /> many times in staff canteens do we see notices saying: &ldquo;Before starting work hands should be washed?&rdquo; This should also be done, of course, after using the lavatory on returning to the kitchen and even after breaking eggs which it has been discovered are very unhygienic things to handle and are full of bacteria.  Hands should also be washed after handling raw meat.  These are simple things and many people are not conscious of the fact that this constitutes good hygiene.  Education in hygiene in many instances is deplorable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If you knew what went on in some restaurants, it would turn you against food undoubtedly.  There are many thousands of cases of mild food poisoning which we do not hear about but which we know occur.  Many people coming to the country notice in many cases when they go into our restaurants the cakes left on a plate which have been there all day with flies settling on them, the open sugarbowls again with flies settling on them, which a lot of people accept as part of their lives.  They are not aware of the tremendous danger this represents to public health.</P>
      <P>Dishwashing facilities in many restaurants are totally inadequate. Dealing with this subject, the booklet says:</P>
      <P>The object of dishwashing is to produce clean commercially sterile crockery and cutlery.  This is particularly important in the case of cutlery and teacups which pass quite literally from hand to hand and from mouth to mouth.</P>
      <P>People do not even know that there is a certain temperature to which water must be brought in order properly to sterilise cups and plates and so on. There are bactericidal detergents which should be used and which very often are not.  The ordinary type of dishcloth can be quite dangerous.  Many people do not know that paper towelling is a far more satisfactory way of drying dishes from a hygiene point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" /> There are many things like that lacking with us and we certainly must develop some means of getting through to the people concerned with public health this better standard of hygiene.</P>
    <P>Next September, I understand from the Minister's introductory statement, the European Regional Committee of the World Health Organisation are coming here and delegates from various countries will be visiting our city and probably many parts of the country.  It is very important that these people should see that the standard of hygiene in our restaurants is much better than it is today.  There is very urgent work to be done in that respect. In parts of America, I understand, they are very strict and a health inspector can go into a restaurant and if he sees that all is not as it should be, he closes down that restaurant which is not permitted to re-open until he says so. Frequently, there is no opportunity to rectify the trouble without closing the restaurant.</P>
    <P>I know there is a great shortage of health inspectors here and those we have have their hands very full but I should be very much in favour of the county councils and other public bodies becoming much tougher where they find infringement of the rules of hygiene.  If a few more restaurants where these rules of simple hygiene are being blatantly broken were closed down for a week or ten days until they put right whatever is wrong, there would be a much sharper reaction and a keener desire to be more conscientious in the application of hygiene in restaurants.</P>
    <P>I could go on with this subject for quite a long time but the main point I want to make is this: Is it possible to convey right down from the Minister's Department to all the county councils in the country the need for improving the standard of hygiene by the preparation of a booklet, if necessary? I understand this company, Marks and Spencer, are only too pleased to supply this booklet to anybody who wishes to obtain a copy.  I am sure they will have no objection to the Department of Health copying this and producing their own hygienic <Col N="506" /> food-handling manual.  I do not think I have ever seen one at all anywhere. I do not intend to take up the time of the House further.  I should just like to reiterate that we must be more hygiene-conscious, that we must be made more aware of the dangers of improper hygiene.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to welcome the Minister as Minister for Health and to say that the review which his introductory speech to this Estimate contained is an interesting review of the activities of his Department.  I am glad to have noted that the Minister, in the course of the time since he was appointed, went around the local authorities, met them and discussed with them on the spot the common matters of health policy.  I am happy to feel that in so doing the Minister followed a practice which I initiated as Minister for Health some years ago.  I felt it was a pity that my immediate successor did not continue that practice, because I have no doubt that visits of that kind are of tremendous assistance not only to the Minister but also to the officers of his Department who get to know a local problem in a more real way than they would from a file or from the documentation that builds up in relation to any problem.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I am about to be critical and I hope it will not be taken that any criticism I level at the Minister for Health is on a personal basis. I do it because it is necessary that some things should be said in relation to what I regard as the profound lethargy that seems to exist in relation to the development of health policy.  The Minister referred to the good things that are in store, to the legislation that is being prepared, to the plan that is to see the light of day some day, to what is to happen some time in the future.  We have in his speech the same undertaking that in this year this Dáil will discuss and pass legislation to provide for better health services.  I hope I will not be regarded as intemperate when I say: &ldquo;That is all my eye&rdquo;.  We have heard that far too often before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well to remind the Minister <Col N="507" /> that this time last year his predecessor, the present Minister for Education, worked himself into a white heat of apparent sincerity assuring Deputies that by the end of last year&mdash;&ldquo;by next November&rdquo;, he said&mdash;the White Paper proposals would have legislative form and the Bill would be introduced in Dáil Éireann.  He was going to ensure that there would be no delay about it and that was the reason why the White Paper was published in the spring of last year.  He said that discussions and consideration would go on throughout the summer and autumn would see the legislation.  I do not know whether the Minister's predecessor, Deputy O'Malley, was saying that with his tongue in his cheek; I merely know that he said it and I merely know that he was wrong.  Autumn has passed and months have passed since.  We now have, in March of a new year, another Minister for Health making the same promise that some time this year this legislation will be introduced.  I wonder is there sincerity in that.</P>
    <P>This battle for an improvement in our health services has been a long and arduous one.  It is one that has been waged by Deputies on this side of the House, in particular in the Fine Gael Party, in successive Dála, in successive general elections, endeavouring to beat down the hidebound conservatism of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to health, a Party who ceased to think on these important social problems years ago, a Party who have demonstrated hidebound conservatism in relation to the develment of new ideas, a Party whose thinking in relation to health services and social problems was epitomised in the person of Deputy Seán MacEntee.</P>
    <P>Away back in 1961 the Fine Gael Party tabled in this House a motion calling for the introduction of a comprehensive health scheme, giving reasons why it was possible and why it was desirable.  That motion had the support in this House of the Irish Labour Party, and an amendment to it was tabled here in the name of Deputy MacEntee, the then Minister <Col N="508" /> for Health, an amendment which was carried because of the Fianna Fáil majority in the House, and an amendment which resulted in the appointment of a Select Committee to consider health services.</P>
    <P>That Select Committee was established in 1962.  It sat through 1963, 1964 and 1965, and its object was to commit the question of the development of our health services into the limbo of forgotten things.  In the dying days of that Select Committee, the Fine Gael Party, in my name, tabled at a meeting of the Select Committee, a comprehensive, detailed plan for the development of our health services, giving practical proposals, giving costings and financial data, and indicating a road which we could as a people travel.  That detailed memorandum was prepared by a Party without the assistance of a Civil Service, without the assistance of a legion of officials, but it was prepared as a sincere contribution to the rational development of our health services.  Perhaps it may be forgotten, but that detailed proposal was never considered by the Select Committee, never brought before it, and it was rejected in this House by the then Taoiseach before the Committee itself had any opportunity of considering it.  It was because of the outrageous rejection of that memorandum that the Fine Gael members felt obliged to withdraw from the Select Committee just prior to the general election.</P>
    <P>The general election was then fought.  It was fought by my Party on a policy aimed towards a just society, a policy with which all our thinking is imbued and which represents our political philosophy in this respect.  In that general election, we put forward our proposals for an improvement in our health services, for their rational development, for bringing our policy in this regard more into accord with the thinking and the practice in every Christian country in western Europe.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party contested that election initially by trying to persuade the people that what we were <Col N="509" /> seeking to do could not be achieved and was not, in any event, necessary. Towards the end of the election campaign, however, they conceded that our point was valid and they gave an undertaking that they would do something in relation to health and other social problems.  We are still awaiting for that something.  Fianna Fáil were elected to office and a new Minister for Health produced a White Paper. That White Paper contained a great deal of unnecessary data about our health services and a modicum of promises with regard to development. The White Paper proposals went only one inch in a mile towards improving our health services.  Even that inch the Minister for Health has not stepped.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the Minister that in my Party there is no tradition of speaking merely from the teeth out. There is no tradition in my Party of advocating things in which we do not believe.  We have made it clear where we stand in relation to the development of our health services and other social policy.  At every opportunity we will remind the Government and, if necessary, the people, how urgent this matter is and how essential it is that we bring to health policy here a constructive approach.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to various things that had been done in the past year.  He obviously expected a pat on the back for what has been done.  I want to assure him that in all that he seeks to claim credit for in our present health structure he is merely tinkering at a machine which will not operate. No matter what improvements he makes, he is merely papering over cracks.  The result is a patchwork quilt not worth the patching.  So long as we continue to accept that health policy and health services are to be born out of a marriage between the Central Fund and local taxation, so long will we continue to have a system lagging considerably behind the needs of the times.</P>
    <P>The present health policy was initiated away back in the last century.  It is part and parcel of the <Col N="510" /> Victorian outlook of imperial Britain in which people were habituated into thinking that the provision of a health service for the public constituted some kind of public charitable exercise.  Ever since there has been built up on that idea a system of doling out health benefits and health services in accordance with what the rates or the Central Fund can from time to time afford.  As the cost of health services, particularly in recent years, has grown enormously, the impact on the taxpayer and on the ratepayer has created a tremendous obstacle in the way of expansion and improvement.  I have said many times that, so long as we continue to finance health services in that way, we will never get anywhere.  We provide doctors under the dispensary system.  They are good men.  They do good work.  Frequently they are called upon to do more than they can reach upon.  The end result of our present domiciliary general medical services is hospitalisation in more cases than is necessary.  We have a system which results in more and more people being sent to hospital and fewer people being treated at home.  We have a system which depends for its financing on the yearly striking of the local rate or general taxation.  Because of that, there is always an obstacle in the way of raising of standards.  Until we accept that the rational development of health services must be on the basis of social insurance, we will never get anywhere. I have made my views in that regard known on many occasions.</P>
    <P>I have never been able to understand why the principle of social insurance as a means of financing health services should have been so emphatically rejected by the former Taoiseach and the Minister's predecessor. I believe it was rejected because it was proposed from these benches and I prophesy that, so long as that rejection remains, Ministers for Health will come limping into this House year after year, saying: &ldquo;Of course, we know there is much we would like to do, but we cannot do it at present because the financial situation does not permit it.&rdquo;  From beginning to end of the Minister's speech. <Col N="511" /> there is in every second line a reference to present financial stringency and the difficulty of providing the things he would like to provide and his hope that some time in the future the financial situation will ease sufficiently to enable things to be done.  It is utterly hopeless, in my opinion, if we go on refusing to stand back and take a fresh look at this whole problem.</P>
    <P>We are a small community looking forward to the day on which we and those in the other part of Ireland, together with the people of Britain, will join the greater association of Europe under the Treaty of Rome.  Do we ever contemplate what that will mean to us?  We cannot go into Europe as the poor relation.  We cannot be the Cinderella.  If we go into Europe, we must go in with our health services, our social services, at least as good as those of any other member of that association.</P>
    <P>In one part of Ireland today, and for many years past, the idea of a comprehensive health service based on the principle of social insurance has not only been accepted but fully operated. So it is in England.  So it is in every country at present subscribing to the Treaty of Rome.  So it is in every other country in Europe.  But here in this part of Ireland, <i>nollimus mutare</i>&mdash;there will be no change.  Why?  Because a Fianna Fáil Government incorporated this idea in the Health Act of 1953 and all thinking then ceased.  From then on, little bits of improvements here, a little bit of papering over a crack there, promises that something better would be done in a few months time, a few White Papers on one thing or another &mdash;these have represented the startling and dramatic developments in social thinking and in health policy.  It is all so tragic.  The Minister is a new Minister. I wish he were a Minister in a Fine Gael Government.  He would be given his head; he would be allowed to think for himself.  He would be permitted to develop a new idea, or new ideas, in relation to this important matter.  Of course, he is a member of a Fianna Fáil Government who have not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know my Flanagan well enough to know that he has good intentions but he is a member of a Party and one of the real troubles the Minister for Health has is that he has been exhausted since he became Minister in trying to catch up on the promises of his predecessor.  Just when he is nearly catching up, he finds his predecessor is busy scooping the kitty so that nothing will be left for Health. Here it is, then, a situation in which once more Health is not important.  I have no doubt that there have been discussions in the Government in the past few weeks, that they have been asking: &ldquo;What are we going to do with the money we will raise in taxation this year?  Well, we have to give it to Education because O'Malley has been opening his mouth about that.&rdquo; So it has to go to Education but Health can wait.  Nobody is making speeches about Health now and therefore it can wait until next year.  We are going to have a repetition of the same old story: Health postponed, and of course always with the idea that if it becomes an acute or burning question again, we can always set up a committee to inquire into it.</P>

      <P>The sum of £4 million in relation to the costings of health services equated to 1953 terms is nothing, absolutely nothing. I know it represents a problem for the Minister for Health and the figure could be £8 million and the problem would still be the same as long as the present policy of financing health services remains.  Until such time as there is established an insurance fund financed by weekly payments by people who would derive benefit from it, independently from other sources, a fund which will be so constituted that it will finance health services which will be based on the principle that people pay while they are well for the day they will be ill, we will not make adequate progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> I said that I would be critical and being critical, I am not in any way being personally hostile to the Minister, or indeed to any of his predecessors. I am criticising the policy; I am criticising the system that is there.  I am criticising the fact that progress which could have been made has not been made.  I am criticising the orthodoxy and conservatism which still creates a wall around fresh thinking on this matter of health services.  I am referring to the fact that in our community today there are still unfortunate people who are searching and seeking for a medical card because that represents to them the only way in which they can be sure that when illness strikes the chemist's bill and the doctor's bill will not constitute a tremendous hardship for them.</P>
    <P>I am referring to the fact that we still operate a system whereby when an insured worker is stricken down with illness and has to go to hospital, it is only then, when he is sick in a hospital bed, when he cannot earn, when he has the worry about his illness, about the cessation of his earning capacity and about his family at home, that he is asked to pay.  I am referring to the fact that while in other directions we have accepted a way of organising the community so that insurance can operate, we have not attempted to do it with health.</P>
    <P>I am glad that in one field with which I was associated, that of voluntary health insurance, the idea of health insurance was tried out, perhaps as an experiment, and that it has succeeded.  The voluntary health insurance scheme which was introduced in 1957 is the only effort that I am aware of in a social scheme of this kind which is not the least dependent on a contribution from the Exchequer or from rates.  When I introduced it here and stated that that was the aim, that it was my view that this could be possible. I was jeered at by Deputies from the Fianna Fáil Party, with one honourable exception, the present Minister for Health.  I should like to recall the fact that out of the entire Fianna Fáil Party at that time, Deputy Seán Flanagan, as he then was, alone came <Col N="514" /> out clearly to express support not only for the proposal but also for the hopes I held out in regard to its success.</P>
    <P>We have the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and people without compulsion, but having regard to their ordinary responsibilities to themselves and to their families, pay a sum of money each year into a fund.  They pay it when they are well so that when they are ill, or when their neighbours are ill, the fund will be there to meet that contingency.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Board has gone from success to success.  The initial loan made available to it by the then Government was repaid within a year. Subsequently the Board, being liable for income tax on its earnings, in fact made money for the Exchequer.  I mention that merely to indicate that while the problem is different, there is an example of insurance on a voluntary basis working out as a worthwhile social measure.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general problem of providing our health services on the basis of social insurance, of course it could not be done&mdash;and I would not contemplate that it could be done on the basis of voluntary insurance.  It would have to be on the basis of compulsory insurance.  It is not beyond the wit of men who believe it is possible, to devise a scheme suitable to our needs.</P>
    <P>When I suggested ways of doing this from time to time serious objection was taken by the Minister's predecessor, and mine, Deputy Seán MacEntee, who used to love to say that compulsory social insurance represents a poll tax on every person in the country, as if that were the end of the argument.  Poll tax or not, what is wrong with every able-bodied person paying a sum of 1/6 or 2/6 a week, or whatever it might be, into a fund to provide a community health service, a fund which would be there independent of the local rates, and which would not be looking towards the Budget of the Minister for Finance as to its constitution in any one year?  I do not see any reason why such a development should not take place.  I am certain that unless some new approach <Col N="515" /> of that kind is considered, we will never make the progress we must make within the next 24 months if we are to go into Europe as a fully adult member under the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say, but having said what I did say, I hope it will not be taken that I do not welcome&mdash; because I do very sincerely welcome &mdash; the improvements and progress which the Minister has outlined in his Estimate speech.  Given the obstacle and the hindrance of a Fianna Fáil Government, the Minister is doing a good job of work.  I have no doubt that subject to that restriction and that fearful cross with which he is burdened, he will continue to do a good job of work as Minister for Health.  I appreciate that he has to deal with a number of services which, even if not extended, would continue to cost more money each year.  I can well understand, particularly at the time of the Budget, the financial problems involved in ensuring that our health services continue to be operated.  The financial problem of the Minister and of the local authorities is a very severe one indeed.</P>
    <P>I notice that the proposal put forward two years ago by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy O'Malley, to freeze all increases in rates has got to be modified this year.  This is the thin edge of the wedge.  If this modification passed without a murmur, next year there would be a complete thaw in respect of any remaining partial freeze. There is nothing like trying to unscramble an egg and that is what the Minister has to do in relation to many of the things done and said by his predecessor.</P>
    <P>Might I ask a question in relation to this little White Paper the Minister's predecessor waved around this House, this little White Paper with little proposals for improvements in our health services?  Do I detect that it is to be watered away?  Do I detect from what the Minister said that, having travelled up and down the country, and having talked to all the county councillors, doubts are being expressed about providing a choice of doctor even?  May I express the hope that there will be no <Col N="516" /> modification in that regard?  Sooner or later the system which we have had for far too long will be modified where possible.  No one ever suggested on these benches or elsewhere that in the areas in which there is no concentration of population, in the areas of sparse population, we could ever have a system whereby a choice of doctor would be provided.  It is recognised that that must continue to be the case, no matter what modification is introduced. In the cities and in the towns, in the centres of populations where a choice of doctor is available, there is no reason why this elementary change should not be made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rationalisation of the health services, I hope that development will continue.  I can well understand that members of local bodies may have other views, and no doubt have expressed those views to the Minister.  The plain fact is that in local government and in health we operate on a division of our country which has no basis in the contours of the country, in the areas of local wealth, or in our traditional history. Our county system was introduced here by our friends the English, some hundreds of years ago.  There is nothing Irish and nothing logical in it.  It is not based on geographical features; it frequently is based despite geographical features.</P>
    <P>I know the county system has now been concreted because of its sporting, social and athletic connotations in other spheres.  Possibly, it has now become so accepted that we cannot foresee its being changed, but, in my view, the existence of our counties should not insulate the development of health services within county boundaries. I would hope the regionalisation suggested in the White Paper will remain part of the Minister's policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday, 16th February, 1967, I addressed a question to the Minister for Health:</P>
      <P>What progress has been made in the introduction of cyto-analytical clinics in Irish hospitals; and in how many hospitals such clinics are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" /> The Minister gave me the reasonably satisfactory reply that</P>
    <P>services are at present being operated in the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, the Regional General Hospitals at Galway and Limerick, Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  The possibility of providing a cyto-analytical service on a national basis, in addition to or in substitution for the services at present operating, in the interests of securing the widest possible availability, is under examination in my Department.</P>
    <P>Cytology, as we know, is the study of germs by pathologists and my interest particularly in this branch of medicine is the application of this science to cancer of the cervix.  There is, as we know, a smear test taken from the cervix and it is important, in my view, that this service be made available in every gynaecological hospital in this country.  When women, married women particularly, go in for examination, it is important that this test be taken.  It is an early warning system in the nature of things for cancer.  It is a very easy, as it were, operation and I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that this test is taken in every gynaecological, and indeed in every other hospital, in the country.</P>
    <P>We seem to regard cancer today as tuberculosis was regarded ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  Tuberculosis was considered a sociological problem, say, 20 years ago.  If a young lady intended getting married and if possibly she had a black spot on her lung, it would lessen her chances in making the marriage grade.  Consequently this was hushed up, particularly in rural areas. Now that we have, thank God, eradicated tuberculosis, I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that everyone in this country is examined at least once a year to find out whether he or she has any traces of cancer, or the cancer germ.  In my view this again is an extension of the first-class tuberculosis service we have operating today. <Col N="518" /> The tuberculosis test&mdash;I am speaking now of human beings&mdash;has now performed its function and I would ask the Minister to set up these first-class X-ray units, mobile or static, as the case may be, around the country and appeal to the people to subject themselves to X-ray examination or otherwise, for early warning of cancer.  We have to speak about these things and the fact of the matter is that cancer is considered a dirty word.  It is not; it is an affliction, and the more publicity it gets&mdash;the more it is spoken about&mdash; the less fear people will have of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave figures and mentioned that he is seriously concerned about the figures for diphtheria in preschool-going children.  The figure for 1962 showed that only 47 per cent of our pre-school children were immunised against diphtheria; in 1963 there were 53 per cent; in 1964, 56 per cent; and in 1965, only 47 per cent. This, again, is a free service provided by the health authorities.</P>
    <P>The figures for polio show that 77 per cent of our children took the full course of three feedings, 84 per cent, two feedings and 88 per cent, one feeding.  This is in relation to the oral polio immunisation.  I agree that polio is more dramatic than diphtheria. When this scheme for polio treatment was being started, it was advertised on television and given national coverage in the daily papers.  I would ask the Minister to consider&mdash;particularly in relation to the figures for diphtheria about which he expressed some concern&mdash;a nation-wide campaign on television and in the national dailies to ensure that this problem of the lack of immunisation of pre-school children is given the fullest publicity.  The Minister can do so much but I believe parents have responsibility here and these figures certainly reflect, in my view, parents' lack of responsibility to their children, children who have not even reached schoolgoing age.</P>
    <P>The question of drugs has also come up and the Minister mentioned he was taking a closer look at the possibilities of ensuring that in this country the problem will not be as serious as it has been and is in England.  I quote <Col N="519" /> now from a Report of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs:</P>
    <P>There have been stories about, and rumours of, adolescent drug-taking in Ireland for the past three years.  As yet, however, no official cognisance has been taken of these rumours and no evidence has been officially accepted that drug abuse or dependence is growing in the Irish Republic.</P>
    <P>My point in bringing this out is that elsewhere in the world such stories and rumours have always preceded, by about four years or so, the production of definite evidence of drug-taking by adolescents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the date with me: I can get it.  It is a report of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs and I will hand my reference to the Official Reporter after the debate.  There have been appeals to the Minister&mdash;and I add mine to them&mdash;to ensure that if drug-taking is stamped out in England, these beat types do not come over here where at the moment the type of drugs they are seeking are available.  There is also the question of the drug companies. I ask that these companies should, instead of spending huge sums on advertising, form a central agency and make available free to doctors the daily requirements of drugs which at the moment have to be paid for by some doctors who can ill afford the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins dealt with the cost of the health services.  I should like in particular to deal with the question of the cost to the middle income groups.  In an urban constituency such as the one I represent, people are pushed hard enough without having to worry about their health. A man with a medical card goes into a clinic and if he is suffering from disease of the kidney, of the throat or <Col N="520" /> the chest, the doctor is not embarrassed about giving him the best possible drugs available because they are free to him.  On the other hand, take a man in the middle income group, a man with considerable commitments otherwise.  The doctor knows very well that he has not got a medical card and he does not want to embarrass him by prescribing costly drugs which the doctor can give with abandon to a medical card holder.</P>
    <P>This is a big problem.  The middle income groups are not getting the best type of drugs available to the man who gets them free.  There is the drug penbritten, for instance, a penicillin drug for the treatment of kidney, chest and throat ailments.  The problem was pointed out to me of doctors not being able to give the better type drugs to the man who has to pay for them.  I appeal to the Minister to see if he can extend the allowance for the middle income groups relative to drugs.  In fairness to the Minister, I should mention a case recently where a man earning £1,500 a year was found not to be able to afford the best drugs.  I brought the matter to the Minister's attention and he allowed this man free drugs in the circumstances.  Of course this should have been there as a right. As I have said, these people are being pushed hard enough and if they have the security of good health, they will be able to stand up to their other obligations without much difficulty.</P>
    <P>Care of the aged is another concern of mine not particularly in a constituency sense.  Coming from an urban constituency, I know that many old people are living in what I would describe as poor conditions.  The Minister paid tribute to the various voluntary organisations which provide domiciliary and meals-on-wheels services to these unfortunate people.  I have expressed the view, not in the Dáil, that if it were not for our voluntary health organisations, the entire health services would break down.  Again in fairness to the Department of Health, they have been very good to these voluntary organisations, helping them in every possible way.  I mentioned on this Estimate last year <Col N="521" /> that the efforts of the various voluntary organisations should be co-ordinated and I am glad to see there has been a move in that direction.  I know that the Dublin Council of the Aged have co-ordinated many similar functions.</P>
    <P>I received in the post a pamphlet &ldquo;The History of Fluoridation&rdquo;, which is described as &ldquo;The Crime of the Century&rdquo;.  It is by J. A. Campbell, a research development engineer of California and it was sent to me by Miss K. Neill, of Schull, County Cork. She asked me to read this history of fluoridation and to act to prevent it spreading.  The entire suggestion in the pamphlet is that the Government in this country have abused their position by fluoridating our water and the Governments in other countries who have fluoridated the water have committed a calculated crime against the community.  I reject this because no responsible Government would fluoridate the water against medical advice and against the advice of other experts such as dentists who have said this is the best way to promote dental health. It is my view also, as a layman, that it is the best way.  I am satisfied that the fluoridation of Irish water has been a good thing.  I welcome it, and I reject the suggestion that this or any Government have committed a crime, &ldquo;the crime of the century&rdquo;, by fluoridating our water.</P>

      <P>I was pleased by the intervention of Deputy T.F. O'Higgins in the debate, partly because he is one of my predecessors as Minister for Health and partly because I always enjoy his facility.  However, much as I should like to do so at this stage, I shall have to leave until later any comments on some of the more sweeping statements he made with regard to the policy of his Party and the record of mine in health matters in years gone by and indeed with regard to the plans I have at the present time.  Instead, I propose to go through the more humdrum exercise of replying to some of the points made in the course of the very interesting and mostly constructive debate during the last couple of weeks. Indeed as a relatively new incumbent <Col N="522" /> in office, I am grateful to all those who offered their observations on an Estimate which concerns one of the most vital aspects of the welfare of our people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mullen asked about the Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Illness.  This report will be available in the very near future.  I suppose, inevitably, one will be asked what does the phrase &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo; mean?  I should hope that in fact it will be published within the next three or four weeks.</P>
      <P>Early on in the debate Deputy Gibbons and Deputy James Tully referred to Irish emigrants in Britain and suggested that there is a high proportion of them suffering from mental disorder.  I must say that this came as news to me: I never heard that this was so.  Indeed, I should be surprised if the Deputies can sustain their arguments in regard to this by producing any survey.  I am not aware that any surveys are going on or have been carried out.  If the Deputies are basing their observations on personal experiences retailed to them, they should be very wary.  At the same time, I have great respect for the views of those Deputies, particularly Deputy Gibbons who made such a constructive and enlightened contribution to this debate. I should be glad to study any further evidence regarding this problem which they may wish to furnish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early part of his rather mixed speech, Deputy Ryan mentioned the problem of the mentally handicapped. I say the Deputy's speech was rather mixed because he can really be very good, whenever he chooses to forget Fine Gael propaganda, but it breaks out in spite of him, every now and again.  Then he becomes rather a bit cranky, not so constructive and not so accurate.  This problem of mental handicap has been a matter of great concern to me and my predecessor in recent years.  I am not for a moment trying to score at Deputy Ryan in correcting the figure he gave to me.  He said that the Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap states there is a need for 7,000 beds.  I do not think this is so.  I think the estimate was 5,750.  The needs for severely <Col N="523" /> handicapped children were 1,000, for moderately handicapped, 942, mildly handicapped, 1,291 and adults 2,517, making a total of 5,750.  What I stated in my introductory speech was that the number of beds in residential institutions for mentally handicapped, as at the end of December last, was over 3,600, whereas more than 500 adult units of accommodation have been provided in the past two years.</P>
    <P>I want to say I am pressing ahead with all speed with the provision of additional accommodation for the mentally handicapped and that I regard this work as being not merely important but worthy of priority.  The fact that over 500 beds have been added in the past two years is a noteworthy achievement and one of which my Department, my predecessor and, to a very much lesser extent, myself are entitled to take credit.  I do not think that this falls within the category of being a patchwork quilt.</P>
    <P>I believe that in regard to this problem of mental handicap we are at least in sight of providing the necessary institutional units of accommodation. I assure the House that we will continue with every initiative until the problem is solved.  Of course, it is not a matter entirely for the Department. It is one thing to provide units of accommodation, to provide houses, but it is another thing to have a religious order or other voluntary body with the personnel and the desire to do the difficult work involved in looking after those suffering from mental handicap.</P>
    <P>I might add as well, from the capital cost point of view, that the provision of the 500 beds I mentioned in the past two years has involved a capital outlay of over £1 million. Again, Deputy O'Higgins, and others, seemed to regard money as being of no consequence when he said that £4 million is a mere nothing.  Obviously, £1 million is one-fourth of nothing.  I do not think that when Deputy O'Higgins's Party were in Government and trying to balance their Budget, they would regard £1 million as one-fourth <Col N="524" /> of nothing and £4 million as of no consequence.  We also gave capitation grants <i>et cetera</i> for the care of the handicapped in the institutions.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity of paying a tribute to the religious and lay staff, the medical and nursing staff, the professional personnel and all others who have helped in tackling this great problem of mental handicap. I want to say that I believe the work they are doing is now, at long last, being appreciated by the public generally and therefore any additional tax that might have to be levied for the purpose of bringing institutional or domicilary care within the reach of all persons requiring care, by reason of physical or mental handicap, is money which the community at large would be quite willing to give.</P>
    <P>In regard to children, Deputy James Tully, I think, also mentioned the undesirability of having mentally handicapped children in mental hospitals. I could not agree more about this.  It is not at all desirable that there should be mentally handicapped children with adults in mental institutions but one difficulty here is that it is not, and never has been, easy to get personnel willing and capable of looking after the severely handicapped particularly. For that reason, it has sometimes been necessary, particularly in regard to severely handicapped children, to have them temporarily housed in mental hospitals.  It has also been found out that some of those children could have been accommodated in institutions for mentally handicapped if we were in the position where we had sufficient units of accommodation.  We are planning new accommodation at special centres for mentally handicapped, providing, where possible, for special small units for disturbed cases.  This will certainly minimise the need to send these children to mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>I should add that a survey of mentally handicapped children made in August, 1964, showed that there were then 122 children in district mental hospitals of whom 83 were severely, 30 moderately and nine mildly handicapped and approximately half of that total number were accommodated in a <Col N="525" /> special children's unit at Portrane, County Dublin, so that while it is indeed true to say that it is not desirable that children should be in district mental hospitals, at the same time the problem is not, numerically, a large one.  I concede that one does not look at problems like this in terms of numbers but in terms of compassion.  I do not want to give the impression that merely because the number of children involved is relatively small it should be treated as of any less importance or with any less compassion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan also mentioned the question of a single statutory authority for the mentally handicapped.  I have a relatively open mind on this matter I must say but I cannot for the moment see that any single authority would help the existing services to function any more effectively.  On the other hand, there is the fact that there is division of function as between the Minister for Education who exercises control in regard to the recognition of special schools for the mentally handicapped and sometimes perhaps because of the fact that the Departments of Health and Education are involved in that the aspects of building, acquiring, supervising, <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, presumably the Department of Labour will now come into it as well.  As I say, I have an open mind on this matter.  Deputy Ryan is aware that there is the National Association for Mentally Handicapped of Ireland which has the job of advising, co-ordinating and disseminating information in relation to the services of the various voluntary organisations and associations but I will keep an open mind on this, and if I think, in the course of time, that a single statutory or other body should be established for the purposes mentioned by Deputy Ryan, I will be willing to take whatever steps are necessary to that end.</P>

    <P>Deputy Kyne referred to special <Col N="526" /> problems of a local association for the mentally handicapped in Waterford.

      <P>I am thankful to Deputy Corish for his views.  I am merely saying what I think about Deputy Kyne's approach.  He is a person who invariably manages to avoid the personal abuse, the sly inferences and innuendoes about the motives of Ministers and other things which are not alien to some members of this House from time to time. Deputy Kenneally joined with Deputy Kyne in regard to these difficulties.  All I have to say here is that discussions have taken place since the Deputies spoke in this debate.  The various problems which have arisen have been fully discussed and I am hopeful that suitable solutions will be found.  I am available to give any necessary help to achieve a suitable solution for the association and any aid for the mentally handicapped in Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kyne also raised points in regard to the transport of mentally handicapped and of disabled children to special day schools and to residential clinics and domiciliary care and placement services.  In so far as the mentally handicapped children are concerned, it is the Department of Education which provides the grant for the transport of the day pupils to approved special schools for the <Col N="527" /> mildly and moderately handicapped. My Department makes grants to the overall cost of associations providing services on a day basis for moderately and severely handicapped children. With regard to the associations providing day services for other disabled children, various health authorities pay their contributions to these associations.</P>
    <P>It is agreed that a service provided on a day basis which enables the children to remain in the environment of their own homes is clearly the most desirable form of service in appropriate cases and improvements in arranging transport facilities can, I think, be expected, as part of the general improved development in the health services for the future.  Of course, I agree that development of community care services is of vital importance. Most mentally handicapped children spend their lives in the homes of their parents or of relatives.  Where that is possible, it is clearly the most desirable arrangement because it enables a child to develop his personality in a natural way and enables the child to avoid later adjustment difficulties. However, we are again involved here in priority problems, problems of the need for residential care as against the problem of providing suitable domiciliary care.</P>
    <P>I think the public would now expect us to concentrate, first of all, on the provision of the necessary residential accommodation as a first prority, if only for the reason that it is the more difficult cases which cause the parents or the relatives, as the case may be, to clamour for accommodation for these unfortunate children.  I know that in pressing ahead with an attempt at solving this problem of residential care we are in each individual case relieving parents, relatives and quite often our children of a grave burden and where children are concerned a factor which could cause their retardation later on.  Of course, the whole problem of general development of the services is a big one.</P>
    <P>I was thankful to Deputy Clinton today and others who referred to the <Col N="528" /> part of my early statement in which I referred to the problem of the care of the aged.  Again, I want to pay tribute to the voluntary bodies throughout the country who have sprung up, including those in my own county, for the purpose of providing a community service to aged people who do not require institutional treatment or in respect of whom institutional care can be avoided. No matter what Deputy Treacy or anybody else says, it is not a criticism of the Department of Health that voluntary bodies should be necessary and should be developing throughout the country.  Let us face it, while a Government Department can provide money and officials, there can hardly be any substitute for the day-to-day practical help and sympathy of one neighbour towards another.  In regard to this and allied problems, recent developments in Kilkenny, Tipperary and elsewhere are evidence of the fact that the official and the Department he represents, and voluntary bodies, can and ought to co-operate in furnishing the most comprehensive service possible on a human and personal level in providing for the aged and others in the community who are in need of help.</P>
    <P>I have attended a number of seminars, meetings, and recent developments in order to show the public my interest in them and to express my approval.  Perhaps voluntary bodies sometimes overlap in their enthusiasm. It is desired that their work should be harnessed by some sort of local committee, representative of the local voluntary bodies and official representatives, so that on the one hand, the best can be got out of voluntary effort and benefit for the recipients, on the other.  Far from its being a reflection on the Department of Health, the fact that these voluntary bodies are growing in number and are playing a steady, more well directed part in the solution of community problems, is a credit to the Department.  I intend to press ahead to encourage these voluntary bodies and to provide whatever help the Department can give to improve their work.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies mentioned giving financial assistance to the relatives <Col N="529" /> and friends of old people to keep them in their homes.  This is something which is already being done in a number of counties and which, incidentally, does not require departmental approval to put into operation. I am not sure which county started this first, but there is no reason why the various local health authorities should not in appropriate cases give special grants so as to enable old people to have a meals service and so on, in their homes, thereby enabling them to stay in the home environment instead of being sent off to an institution.</P>
    <P>I do not, of course, accept that people who can afford to do so should have to be paid to look after their parents.  There seems to be implied, at least, by Deputy James Tully in his remarks, and in fact I think it is a strange observation &mdash; or is it part of socialist thinking nowadays &mdash; that old people should be provided for by the State merely because they are old.  I do not think this is a sensible proposition at all.  I think the far more fundamental duty is the duty of children to look after their parents when they become old and well-to-do people should be glad to shoulder the burden of helping their parents and should not expect the State or the county council to come to their aid for this purpose.  On the other hand, I would be the first to encourage local authorities to pay a grant, where necessary, so as to provide for old people who are not able to look after themselves, and thereby obviate the necessity of their going into county homes.</P>
    <P>With regard to county homes, I was surprised to learn that amenities such as newspapers are not always available. I hope to make inquiries within the next few weeks to ascertain whether, or to what extent, there is any substance in this charge and, if there is, to take the appropriate steps to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy P.J. Burke asked me specifically to deal with the shortage of geriatric beds in the Dublin health area.  I am of course aware that there is pressure on the geriatric beds in <Col N="530" /> the Dublin area.  As I have already indicated, I am strongly in favour of keeping elderly people out of institutions if this can be managed and I am in favour of a wide range of community services towards this end.  I am also aware that there are delays and that this service cannot be brought into operation straight away.  Accordingly, there will still be pressure for some time to come on beds for old people in the Dublin area.  It seems to me that the position has been somewhat improved by the use of the old St. Mary's Chest Hospital and part of the James Connolly Memorial Hospital for the accommodation of geriatric patients.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan asked that the geriatric beds in the Regional Sanatorium in Merlin Park in Galway be used to cater for patients in the west of the county rather than that these patients should be sent to St. Brendan's in Loughrea because of the difficulty for relatives visiting a place as far away as Loughrea.  There is only limited space in Merlin Park which could become overcrowded.  In deciding which particular patients should be transferred to Merlin Park, the best the authority can do is take the circumstances of each case into account, including the question of the liability of the patient on his relatives, and then make the best selection possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally asked also about the Holy Ghost Hospital in Waterford. I do not have to tell Deputy Kenneally that the description &ldquo;Holy Ghost Hospital&rdquo; is a misnomer.  This, in fact, is not a hospital and, therefore, the problem of reconstruction may possibly be a matter for the Department of Local Government rather than the Department of Health.  However, this is something which I discussed at great length with a large representative vocal and able deputation from the county and city of Waterford, and I am very sympathetic with the views expressed, subject of course to the rather hard facts of my own situation in regard to the making of a grant for the purpose of its conversion into a hospital or home.  I will give the whole matter every sympathetic consideration. However, I would ask Deputy <Col N="531" /> Kenneally and those interested to try again with the local people to consider the possibility of treating this as a housing problem with the Department of Local Government rather than as a problem which can properly be dealt with by me or the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress on Wednesday last, I had complimented Deputy Seán Dunne on bringing this Bill before the House and on highlighting a problem in which many people are interested, that is, the problem of providing work for those who are disabled whether their infirmity be physical or mental.  I said that my interest in this matter is because I am associated with some organisations which deal with these types of persons&mdash;the National Organisation for Rehabilitation and the Toghermore Re-ablement and Training Centre in Tuam, County Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill seems to be based broadly on the Disabled Persons (Employment) Acts, 1944 and 1958 which were enacted by the British Government. From inquiries I have made, I am of the opinion that this measure has not fully achieved the objects it set out to achieve.  We have here the National Organisation for Rehabilitation which was set up some years ago by the Minister for Health as an advisory body on all aspects of rehabilitation.  It was set up to co-ordinate the work of voluntary and all other bodies that deal with this work and to bring in schemes for assessment, treatment, training and replacement in useful employment of disabled people.  For some years, it has operated a placement service for disabled persons and, also, it has set up a youth advisory service to train disabled <Col N="532" /> young people and to place them in useful employment.  There was another institution, the Rehabilitation Institution, which also operated a placement service but recently these two services have been combined as a national rehabilitation service and it is operated by the National Organisation for Rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, at this point of time there is a seminar going on in Malahide to bring in this unified placement service.  If I am not wrong, Malahide is in Deputy Dunne's constituency. These two services are to be combined and operated on behalf of the Minister by the National Organisation for Rehabilitation.  This is the organisation which, to my mind, is best fitted to do the work that Deputy Dunne has in mind in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not too keen to follow slavishly British Acts of Parliament.  However, if an Act has worked well in Britain I suppose it would be well for our Parliament to benefit by the experience of the British with it and that we should, if necessary, introduce a similar Act into our legislation.</P>
    <P>In the course of the past week or so, I read in the newspapers that Cardinal Heenan is very worried about an Abortion Bill which is being brought before the British House of Commons for the murder of the yet unborn. Cardinal Heenan is further worried that if the Bill becomes law, the next thing may be a Bill to legalise euthanasia, the murder of the aged, the old, the infirm, the mentally and the physically handicapped. If such an Act were brought into operation, there would be no need for a Bill such as this Bill which Deputy Dunne has brought before the House, designed to get work for these classes of people.</P>
    <P>I do not favour the aspect of compulsion in this Bill.  I was on that point last Wednesday evening when I had to report progress.  I believe that the quota system, or compulsion, is not the solution. We have our placement officers in the National Organisation for Rehabilitation and my information is that they have not very much difficulty in getting access to employers.  The introduction <Col N="533" /> of a quota system might do more harm than good from the point of view of antagonising the able-bodied and also possibly antagonising the employers.</P>
    <P>A figure of three per cent has been mentioned in relation to the quota system&mdash;it is in the British Act, too &mdash; and that would easily be overcome in most industries at the present moment. I am sure there are many good employers who would have heart cases, chest cases and people coming within a few years of their pension whom, after long and faithful service, they could keep on in employment until they retire on pension.  I imagine that they could be included in this register of disabled persons and so defeat the objects of Deputy Dunne's Bill.</P>
    <P>I do favour, however, Deputy Dunne's point about reserving a proportion of vacancies in certain occupations such as the Civil Service, public bodies, local authorities and semiState organisations.  To my mind, that part could be put into effect.  I think Deputy Gibbons made the point that, if the medical test for these positions were modified or done away with, many people would be able to take up useful employment in these bodies. There are various types of people with chest and heart ailments who could do useful work at a desk, and so on, which would not be physically hard on them.  We consider ourselves a fairly august body here but if we had to have a medical entrance test for the Dáil and the Seanad it is possible that more than three per cent of us would be found wanting.  Therefore, I think the point made by Deputy Dunne and Deputy Gibbons about keeping a proportion of places in these bodies I have mentioned for the disabled should be looked into.</P>
    <P>I do not like the idea mooted in the Bill of segregating the disabled because that would mean that their employment would become a matter of either charity or compulsion.  The objects of the National Organisation for Rehabilitation are to secure employment for the disabled because of their abilities rather than their disabilities. That should be our motto. <Col N="534" /> Deputy Dunne also referred to this principle.  He said that some disabled persons have a high degree of intelligence and ambition and that disabled persons should not be segregated and offered jobs only of the lowest denomination or given employment opportunities of that kind.  He suggested that men who were disabled but who rose to great heights would not have attained these heights if they had been segregated or classified as disabled. Our motto should be that these people should be employed on account of their capabilities, which is, as I have said, the object of the National Organisation for Rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>In addition to placement and training, great strides have been made recently by this organisation with the help of other bodies.  A new factory has been set up recently at Shannon for long term psychiatric cases.  These patients will be trained initially in hospitals and when they are capable of work will be given suitable employment in the factory.</P>
    <P>In Toghermore, the other one of these establishments with which I am connected, there is a training centre for young boys.  They do woodwork and leatherwork.  I would invite anybody interested to visit that centre which is maintained almost exclusively by voluntary subscriptions.  Recently the centre was reorganised.  We have spent a great deal of money on it and we need help.  I was glad to hear the Minister for Health saying a few minutes ago that he would come to the aid of these voluntary organisations. From inquiries I have made I find that in the last 12 months, from the Rehabilitation Centre in Galway, 20 persons were placed in useful employment and at Toghermore eight persons.  During the year when reorganisation and decorating was taking place the number had to be reduced but we are ready to take the full complement again.  These boys are doing wonderful work.  I have experience in my own house of the upholstery they can do and the furniture they can make under the guidance of the woodwork instructor there.  It is a credit to them and is as good as can be produced in <Col N="535" /> any factory or furniture shop in Ireland.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I am of the opinion that the compulsory element in the Bill will not work but that we should work in co-operation with the voluntary organisations and give them every help and assistance, financial and otherwise. The National Organisation for Rehabilitation heretofore has worked with the Department of Health by which it was set up and in close co-operation also with the Department of Industry and Commerce and, of course, the Department of Education.  From now on I expect it will work in close co-operation with the Department of Labour.  I imagine that the discussions between the organisations and the Department of Labour will be most helpful in planning future development. The Industrial Training Act has been passed recently and I am sure there could be incorporated in that Act the provisions that Deputy Dunne is seeking in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a special appeal to the youth of the country.  I remember in my student days doing a composition in Latin entitled &ldquo;<i>Mens sana in corpore sano</i>&rdquo;&mdash; a healthy mind in a healthy body &mdash; which is a great blessing, indeed.  For young people who are healthy in mind and body there is a wonderful field in work of rehabilitation. I would ask them to get interested in this work as an outlet for their energies.  Day after day we hear of a young person in the bloom of health and life meeting with an accident and becoming disabled.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the National Organisation for Rehabilitation and the other voluntary bodies concerned for the wonderful work they do in such cases.  They train these people.  It is a long process to rehabilitate them to be useful citizens again.  I want to pay a tribute to the doctors, psychiatrists, nurses, field workers, assessment officers, placement officers, down along the line for the work they are doing.  I want to refer to the help they are getting from volunteers throughout the country.  As the Minister for Health said recently, <Col N="536" /> these voluntary organisations are growing every day and should receive every encouragement in the noble work they are doing.  I trust that the youth of our country will become actively engaged in this type of social work.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish to compliment Deputy Dunne.  We all have the same idea, to get work for these people and to make them useful citizens.  I do not know what the Minister's opinion of the Bill is.  I do not know whether Deputy Dunne will succeed in having it done his way or whether it will be done in the way I am advocating.  I do not mind as long as the object is attained. That is what we are all interested in and I hope that will be the outcome of the Bill.</P>
    <P>My opinion is that the function of providing work for the mentally and physically disabled should be left with the body set up specially for that purpose and that all possible assistance, financial and otherwise, should be given to that body to enable it to fulfil its function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Many tributes have been paid to Deputy Dunne for the initiative he displayed in introducing this measure, the Disabled Persons (Employment) Bill.  All of us can add to those tributes.  I should like to make it clear, however, that the Bill has the full support of the Labour Party &mdash; not that there was ever any doubt in the mind of anybody in the House who had listened not alone to Deputy Dunne but to other speakers from the Labour Party.  Again, let it be stressed that it was on Deputy Dunne's initiative that the Bill was brought before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Deputies who have spoken have praised the Bill or, at least, the intention of the Bill.  There were, of course, &ldquo;buts.&rdquo;  Of course, there are always objections to measures of this kind when they are first mooted. Similar objections were expressed to the health proposals in 1953 and to the comprehensive scheme for social welfare.  We were told that all these things should be done on a voluntary basis and that there was no necessity <Col N="537" /> for State intervention.  Even in the broad matter of economic planning, there were objections when the idea was first mooted.  Now we have a State health scheme, a State social welfare scheme and, if not in fact, subscription by the Parties in this House to the principle of economic planning.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the House will vote on this measure.  The Bill has the full support of the Labour Party. Whether Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael will vote for it, we do not know.  But I would make this pronouncement: this Bill in some form or other will come some day, and I think pretty soon.  The fact that the Bill is being introduced is no reflection on the excellent work done by voluntary organisations, but I think it should be stressed that these organisations are voluntary.  Because they are voluntary, they are incomplete and cannot do the full job Deputy Dunne wants to see accomplished by the measure before the House.  There are very many people who engage in this work.  They are people &mdash; I do not say this disrespectfully &mdash; who have time on their hands.  They are devoted to the service of their fellowmen.  But it is not a whole-time occupation with them, nor could it be.  We have to think in terms of the disabled person rather than in terms of the people who participate in these voluntary organisations in order to help the disabled.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can say that we cater adequately for disabled persons. We do not cater adequately for them as far as financial aid is concerned. In order to obtain a disabled person's maintenance allowance a person has to undergo a very severe means test.  The allowances themselves, ranging from 27/6d to 32/6d per week, are very inadequate.  A disabled person or a person sick in any way receives sickness benefit of £2 12s 6d.  Those who suffer from infectious diseases get an infectious diseases maintenance allowance at the rate of 30/- or £2 per week. Again, these payments are subject to a means test.</P>
    <P>It would be a very real improvement if all these allowances were to be increased to such a point that these people could live in some degree of <Col N="538" /> comfort.  Even that would not be sufficient, in our view.  We believe that these people should be put in a position of not alone participating in society but of contributing to the economy of the country.  Deputy Kitt, who appears to know quite a lot about the rehabilitation of disabled persons, talked about a centre in Galway.  I am sure there are similar centres throughout the country. These centres are grand so far as occupational therapy is concerned.  But what this measure seeks to do is to try to make these people feel as if they were citizens and not just segregated and put into a centre where they would all be doing more or less the same type of work.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Bill is intended to make them members of society who also contribute to the economy.  That is why there appears to be an element of compulsion.  The term &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; can be applied to many measures other than this Bill proposed by Deputy Dunne.  All our taxation measures are compulsion.  The health scheme, the social welfare scheme&mdash;under all these, individuals are compelled to pay money or do something of some nature.  Therefore, let me stress that the idea is to try to get these people rehabilitated into industry and into society.  I suggest this is very laudable not only for the people themselves but for the country as a whole.  It is all very well to have excellent centres in which these people would be employed, but it is not sufficient. They are still regarded as different citizens and should not be made to feel like that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne, in an excellent speech, referred to the rehabilitation to a limited extent of blind persons who, over the past ten or 15 years, have made excellent telephonists employed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. This scheme has proved a success. The various organisations who cater for the blind engage also in basketmaking and other types of manual work.  But, again, this is in centres.  In the case of the blind also, it would be desirable if they were, so to speak, allocated to jobs which they could do while still suffering the loss of sight.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> The strict medical examination one has to undergo to become a member of the Civil Service has been mentioned, and to this one could add the local authorities.  It seems peculiar that disabled persons who could do an excellent job in the Civil Service or the local authority service should be turned down merely because they have some disablement that would not prevent them from doing a normal day's work. If people have an objection to what they describe as compulsion on employers, surely the Government should take the initiative in this matter by determining that many positions in the Civil Service and local authority service should be reserved for disabled persons?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne frankly confessed that this Bill is a &ldquo;pull&rdquo; from the British legislation.  It is not valid criticism to say we should not always copy the British.  The Bill seems to me an admirable one to ensure the placement of this type of person.  The main criticism of it&mdash;there were many complimentary things said about Deputy Dunne&mdash;has been that there is no need for it because the voluntary organisations are doing a good job.  I do not believe they are capable of doing a 100 per cent job.  Therefore, there is need for the Bill.  There are many safeguards in it.  There is provision for the training of disabled persons on the initiative of the Minister for Labour. Whether or not he is the proper person, we still do not know.  There is provision for the application by disabled persons for inclusion in a register.  I suppose the dirty job has been left to the Minister for Labour in section 5, in which he is supposed to determine who is a substantial employer.  This would indeed be a difficult task but I am sure some formula could be worked out with, as the Bill suggests, consultation between the employers and the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>It is not intended, as section 7 says, that every type of employment should be open to the disabled or that there should be a percentage of these employed in all types of employment.  The section lays it down clearly that the <Col N="540" /> classes of employment that would be open to disabled persons would be decided by the Minister, again in consultation with the trade unions and the employers.  To those who think that this would do away with voluntary organisations, there is the provision in section 10, in which it is suggested that a national advisory council be established. This could be representative of all the voluntary organisations referred to in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>The underlying theme of the Bill has been commended by all sides, but there are many reservations and it appears the Bill has not got the enthusiastic reception we had hoped for.  We have still to learn the views of the Minister but no matter what his views are or what the attitude of the two larger Parties may be, this is a very desirable thing socially and economically and I can see that if it does not come in this Dáil session, it will come very soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I and most of my Fine Gael colleagues have no difficulty in giving our unanimous support to this Bill.  We congratulate Deputy Dunne and his colleagues on introducing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One comes to the moment of truth and one sees that we have in our society a voluntary system and the truth is we employ the smallest percentage of disabled and disadvantaged people of any country in Europe which keeps records.  We have a deplorably poor record in employing disadvantaged persons.  I think there is a common desire in the House to see more employment opportunities for the disabled and the disadvantaged, but the question is: can we get those opportunities through voluntary effort? I doubt it.  Perhaps, because we were saved as a nation from the scourage that blighted Europe in two world wars and in which most abled-bodied men were in the army, we have not sufficient consciousness of the disabled in our community because a large number of those who are disabled were disabled from birth and have been cared for and sheltered in the family surroundings.  But if we, as a nation, had found that a majority of our able-bodied people were out in wars which were to disfigure them or <Col N="541" /> if we had had to submit to bombing which disfigured thousands of people in our cities and towns, we would appreciate the serious obligation which lay upon us to give employment to those people.  Thank God, we were saved from that holocaust which afflicted so many of our European neighbours, but we have in our midst a large number of people who are not getting equality of employment opportunity and that is all that Deputy Dunne and his colleagues seek in this Bill: equality of opportunity, not preference, not special consideration, not appealing for sympathy and not trying to play upon emotion, but simply equality of opportunity.</P>
    <P>Who knows whether or not our disabled friends and neighbours and relations would not make better employees than some persons who seem to be in full possession of their faculties? Who can say that a person who has not all his five senses would not make a better employee than a person who appears to have all five?  Who is to say that a person who is blind will not make as good an employee as a person who is not blind?  There is only one way of finding out and that is to test them.  I think the experience of most employers who have taken on disabled persons is that in many cases such persons proved much better and more loyal and efficient workers with better powers of concentration than many of their fellow workers in the same employment.</P>
    <P>The quotas which the Minister would fix under this Bill, I assume, would be related to the proportion of disabled persons in our community.  I am particularly glad to see it stated in the Bill that the Civil Service, local authorities and semi-State organisations must play their part.  I had a number of Dáil questions here today relating to this subject.  I asked the Minister for Defence what proportion of applicants for the Army were rejected on medical grounds.  The figure I got from the Minister was 10 per cent. This 10 per cent was rejected on medical grounds, the State saying: &ldquo;We will not take you.&rdquo;  Five per cent of those who applied to join the Garda Síochána are rejected on medical <Col N="542" /> grounds, the almighty State saying &ldquo;We will not take you.&rdquo;  Of those who apply for the Civil Service, from every job from pen pusher to runner, one per cent are rejected on medical grounds.</P>
    <P>There are those, we know, in statistical circles who like to consider a figure of one per cent as statistically of no significance.  This seems to be a repulsive approach in dealing with human beings.  Unfortunately, sometimes we meet this in research carried out by medical people&mdash;say in epidemiological research&mdash;and they say that figures produced are not statistically significant but the statistically insignificant figure can mean absence or presence of human happiness.  In our community so long as we have one being who does not get equality of opportunity we are not giving a fair crack of the whip to the disadvantaged and disabled.</P>
    <P>To those who have a certain hesitation in supporting the obligatory nature of this Bill I would point out that there are very many practices and acceptances in our society of which nobody doubts the wisdom and which are so common in operation that we cannot conceive their never having existed and which came into being when it was found that the voluntary system did not succeed.  It was only when statutory obligation arose that those practices and activities became recognised.  We now have compulsory holidays because it was found that leaving employers to decide voluntarily when to give workers holidays just did not work.  It had to be made obligatory. Now there is no sane employer who does not appreciate the wisdom of giving workers holidays.  We found that the voluntary system for safe systems of work did not operate; we had to introduce factory Acts, again bringing in positive obligatory legislation to ensure that workers were preserved from accident so far as possible.  We had to impose obligations on employers to have safe machines, to put guards on machines.  I am sure no employer wished to do harm to employees; many conscientious employers were anxious to avoid harm to employees but notwithstanding all the desires not to see harm come to workers it was found that the voluntary system was insufficient <Col N="543" /> and statutory obligations had to be imposed.  We had to make regulations under the factory Acts because the voluntary system did not work.</P>
    <P>Likewise, in regard to conditions of employment.  In all these activities concerning the welfare of human beings, the voluntary system does not work and we must recognise, I think, that in our society the voluntary system does not work because we are not giving equality of opportunity in employment to people who appear to be disadvantaged.  I say &ldquo;appear&rdquo; because, while they may be physically deprived of some faculty which most people have, so far as work capacity is concerned they are in most cases equal, if not superior, to their apparently more fortunate neighbours.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest sympathy with those who feel that the compulsory aspect of the proposals here may jeopardise rather than assist those whom the Bill intends to assist.  However, as the present position is so deplorably bad here, it is certainly worth while trying the compulsory proposals we have in this Bill, and if we reach a stage where all the quotas laid down in this Bill are filled, and we find that is not enough, we can then, on top of the obligatory quota system, continue to have voluntary effort or we can increase our quotas. There is nothing in this Bill which can in any way jeopardise the prospects which are available to people through voluntary effort, because we can learn from experience that whatever the law prescribes will certainly be less rather than greater than what society itself feels ought to be done. Therefore this Bill is only trying to drag this country a little forward to reach the relatively low levels which have been achieved in other countries. When we have that done, then it will be time to argue whether or not the next advance should be made through compulsion or through voluntary effort.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the principle of this Bill with a number of people who are concerned with rehabilitation, with looking after the deaf and the blind, and I have found overwhelming support <Col N="544" /> for it.  All these people, with one exception, have expressed the view that it was a pity compulsion had to be introduced, but they did not see that there was any alternative way of achieving a higher level of employment for the disabled.  These people are themselves, for the most part, voluntary workers.  They are people who give joyfully of their time and their energy, of their money and of their experience to help their less fortunate neighbours.  But all these people who appreciate the value of voluntary effort find that all their efforts are being thwarted because of the poor response they get from prospective employers.  These people are loud in their praise of the few good employers who have given employment to the disabled.  Most of these people have found that the employer who took one on for a trial period was so delighted with the results that he came back and asked for more people who were disabled. The prospect is that if we increase the opportunities, we shall have more people anxious to exceed the minima which will be set by the Minister under an Act such as is now proposed.  Therefore, the sooner we introduce this system the better.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes&mdash;and quite rightly &mdash;that there should be a register of disabled persons, and the purpose of that ought to be clear.  In countries which have not got a register of disabled persons, people have avoided their obligation by taking into their employment a person who has, say, a top of a finger gone or who has some other impairment which is not of any significance.  In order to overcome any possibility of avoidance, it is important that we have a register of genuinely disabled persons; otherwise, we shall have that tendency to excuse oneself from the provisions of this Bill by having people who are not impaired or disabled but who are just suffering from some minor cosmetic disadvantage&mdash;I think that is the word the medical men use in their reports.  It is important that there should be genuine disablement as defined in the first section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes &mdash; and quite rightly&mdash;that the Minister may specify <Col N="545" /> higher quotas in some activities than in others.  This reminds me of a problem which has existed for many years and which has not received sufficient sympathetic consideration from successive Governments, that is, the competition that some organisations, such as the National League of the Blind, have to face, where there are some State bodies or penal institutions engaging in the manufacture of articles which disabled people are capable of making.  This is deplorable.  The resources of the imagination of the State ought not to be limited to the making of mailbags, mats and such things in prisons.  It is vital that the State would not in any way compete with organisations which are encouraging disabled people to lead useful lives, and that is what has happened in the past.</P>
    <P>I have been amazed to see some disabled people working away with their hands or working away at highly complicated and intricate machinery. From watching them, one would get the impression that their disablement was negligible, and one would be at a loss to understand why they were working in sheltered workshops and in voluntary institutions, until one sees those people move away from those machines and just walk or endeavour to walk or move in a wheelchair along the corridors of the workshop or factory, and then one would see their disablement.  It would strike wonder in one to see how such a disabled person could, while at the machine or at the work table, produce so much and work with such speed and such accuracy.</P>
    <P>We have to overcome, therefore, the natural reluctance of employers to engage a person who, at first sight, appears to be grossly disabled.  We must convince employers that people who socially may appear awkward or limited are not necessarily going to be limited when they get to the workbench, when they stand in front of a machine and start working.  The contrary is true, because most disabled people will have greater willpower, greater powers of concentration and a more determined approach to work than people who may regard work <Col N="546" /> a bore, work as something which just has to be done in order to get some free-and-easy money for spending during the off hours.  The disabled person is a person who finds his or her greatest satisfaction in working.  That being so, our employers have nothing to fear under a Bill such as this; rather the contrary, I believe that they and the people who would work with the disabled would find a new inspiration and a new encouragement which would be of very great benefit to the community.</P>
    <P>If and when we enter any European community, we shall find ourselves having to employ disabled people whether we want to or not, because most of the countries in the EEC already impose statutory obligations on employers to employ the disabled in a fair proportion.  We shall have a similar obligation placed upon us.  Now is the time to prepare.  But I do not think that is the only reason why we should pass this Bill.  Far from it.  The valid reason and the most adequate reason for passing the Bill is to give equality of opportunity to the disabled. That is not a mere abstract notion taken from a textbook.  That is something that can be a living reality, something which will mean something to the disabled.  It means very little to them to hear their rights discussed because more than discussion is called for.</P>
    <P>This Bill should have the support of the Government.  I know Governments are unwilling to accept Bills promoted by private Members but I think this Bill comes better from a private Member because it is the response to social conscience, the recognition of something which everyone wants to see achieved and which voluntary effort has failed to achieve.  There must be some element of compulsion.  Compulsion may be a nasty word but all this Bill asks is statutory recognition of a moral obligation.  It does no more and no less. We believe it should get the support of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to know what the official reaction of the Government is to this Bill.  We can speak here until next year and still be in ignorance of what the Government <Col N="547" /> will, in fact, do about it.  We do not know whether it is wholly acceptable or whether only certain sections in it are acceptable.  The compulsory aspect of it in regard to employers taking on a certain proportion of disabled persons is the kernel of the Bill. The Bill is not put forward to enable speakers to make heartfelt speeches on the plight of the disabled.  It is put forward to enable the Government to pass into law a statute making it mandatory on employers to bring into employment those who have been unable up to now to find employment on the free labour market.  It is not a rival to the voluntary bodies.  In fact, its purpose will be to supplement the work of these bodies and, from that point of view, it is an admission that the law should rightfully supplement the work of voluntary bodies.</P>
      <P>There is undoubtedly a real prejudice amongst employers against employing disabled persons.  We may as well recognise that fact at the outset. A disabled person will find on the labour market a whole range of prejudices on the part of employers against employing him.  It has been pointed out that any fears that may exist on the part of employers have proved to be groundless and an employer may, in fact, be missing out from the point of view of an economic asset if he refuses to employ disabled persons.  Because of the prejudice on the part of employers, both State and private enterprise, the disabled person is doubly handicapped.  He leads a crippled life in more senses than one and must regard himself as a secondclass citizen.  This situation has been ended in other countries and there seems to be no valid reason why this country should not fall into line.  We realise that a certain complexity is added to the passing of this Bill because we have never enjoyed a position of even near-full employment. That means the spectre of unemployment is always looming round the corner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill suggests that a proportion of jobs should be earmarked for the disabled.  We seek to put the disabled on the same level as the able-bodied <Col N="548" /> in certain designated employments for which they are suitable.  We are seeking to humanise the labour market. Over the past 150 years, the labour movement has sought all the time to humanise employer-worker relationships, making the position less that of the person who has nothing to sell but his labour being completely at the mercy of the man who can hire and fire him.  Starting from the 12-hour day and child labour, the labour movement has succeeded in bringing the hours worked down to a civilised level and in the abolition of child labour.  We now seek to humanise the position where the disabled are concerned. There is no sentiment behind this Bill.  The record is there to show that in other countries the disabled can make a worthwhile contribution to the economy, as worthwhile a contribution as the able-bodied.</P>
    <P>It would be useless to put on the Statute Book a Bill containing a number of desirable provisions but with no element of compulsion in it.  If the Government give no indication of how they propose to deal with this Bill, then that will presumably be the parting of the ways.  If we are to give the disabled the same rights as other citizens enjoy, then there must be some element of compulsion in the Bill.  In that compulsion is enshrined consultation between trade unions, workers and the Government.  Ultimately the arrangements made will have to be those in conformity with the facts, facts deduced as a result of consultation with bodies who are both realistic and practical in their particular spheres of endeavour.</P>
    <P>We say, and it is very important, that it is essential to get an authenticated register of the disabled.  At the moment there is only vague speculation about this.  I remember in the report of the League of the Blind last year the Secretary, Mr. Paddy Lyons, referred to this difficulty about a uniform definition in the area of the blind, as to who would be declared to be blind.  This Bill, would, in fact, initiate an investigation into this area, an investigation which is long overdue. It is an investigation that will not come about unless this Bill is passed into <Col N="549" /> law with this compulsory aspect.  We need to get this properly authenticated register of disabled people and we need to co-ordinate more effectively than at the moment the efforts of the different voluntary bodies.  Everybody admits that these voluntary bodies have, in the face of indifference on the part of the State, done tremendous work in past years.  Everybody recognises the fact that the State can no longer be a mere bystander when it comes to the welfare of our citizens.  The establishment of the Department of Labour proved the State's willingness to be more than a bystander in the field of industrial relations.  Certainly it should not be the State's wish to stand aside in this matter of legislating for the disabled. We should get in there and see how we can help the different voluntary bodies and say to them: &ldquo;We are now passing into law certain necessary measures which must be carried out by employers in regard to employment. We propose to humanise the labour market in the following ways; we propose to say that so many places will be reserved for those who have passed certain training requirements.  There will be no question of charity, no need to feel grateful because you get these positions, this will merely be your due, which is accepted by the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Comparisons between Britain and European countries and this country in regard to the number of disabled people employed and the methods adopted to obtain employment for them make very poor reading.  This is in countries which very often do not claim to have as high a standard of Christian morality as we do but which, nevertheless, in their own humdrum pagan fashion appear to be able to look after their unfortunate sections with a great deal more concern than we do.  Apparently we have the idea that the disabled should be corralled into institutions or put to particularly unimaginative work, and as long as the private citizen gives his contribution once a year to these institutions or organisations then his conscience is salved for that year.  In other countries they have proved that a citizen who is able-bodied, endowed with all his faculties, without any physical or <Col N="550" /> mental shortcomings, does not fulfil his obligation to the disabled merely by dipping his hand into his pocket on a flag day.  This Bill proposes to abolish this kind of flag-day charity.  Instead it proposes to institute central State measures which will remove this kind of problem.  This is not to say that I wish in any way to look down on the forms of help we have given in years past, but I do want to say that we stand accused if this is our only means of providing help for the less fortunate. If this is our only expression of concern for their predicament then we stand accused.  Have we ever investigated, for example, the types of disabled people who could be employed in offices or in other forms of employment?  Have we examined in the State sector, in the Civil Service, what jobs could easily be undertaken by people with one disability or another?  Unless we incorporate a compulsory aspect I do not think we will ever get around to doing that.  As long as we leave it as a matter for the voluntary organisations, confined purely to their activities, I do not think there will be any pressure on us to undertake the kind of work which is essential if we are to put this whole question of a programme for the disabled on a worthwhile rational basis.</P>
    <P>At this stage we would be extremely grateful to the Minister if he could say how far he can support this Bill, bearing in mind that the kernel of the Bill is this matter of requiring compulsion to give a certain quota of positions in industry and elsewhere to people designated as disabled under the bodies to be set up under this Bill. There would be full consultation with the bodies involved, bodies which have done such worthwhile work so far. No impracticable decisions would be arrived at.  They would be realistic decisions and there would be no loss of good employees to the employer. One of the conditions in the Bill is that the type of person we would be sending for employment would be able to do the particular job.</P>
    <P>What we seek to do by this proposed legislation is to remove this prejudice which at the moment works very much against disabled people who might be <Col N="551" /> admirable in every respect for the particular job and militates against the possibility of their being accepted into employment.  If in this Bill we merely say that there are many desirable features but that we need co-operation, we need the voluntary principle to be continued, and drop this compulsory aspect then we give consent to the continuance of this prejudice which exists. Only the disabled person knows about this prejudice.  It may never be referred to in print but it does exist and if we want proof, let us look at the figures for the numbers of disabled people employed in industry and in the State services.  The figures are there.  The country has a poor record in this matter of voluntarily giving to these citizens a fair share of the nation's work and now it is essential that the State should step in and take on this work, supplement the work of the voluntary bodies.  I hope the Minister can now give us some idea of his attitude to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no doubt about one's feelings in regard to a Bill of this nature.  Therefore, I follow the line taken by Deputy O'Leary when he said that it is mere sentimentality to enlarge on the deserving nature of these cases.  The practical solution is what matters and in this regard there are a number of questions I should like to ask.  Let us approach the Bill not so much from the point of view of the principle of it&mdash;there everyone is competing to say how concerned he is&mdash;but how to get a practical solution of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing that strikes me is that disablement can be of two sorts.  It can be a physical disablement which makes a person suitable for only one type of employment, or it can be what is called a cosmetic disablement.  The first category raises specific problems, and the second is very difficult to define.  Let us deal with the first.  If you are dealing with a person who has some positive disablement, as, for instance, a person who is blind, a person who is deaf, or a person who has lost a limb, it will be impossible simply to legislate and say he must be employed.  We have to face <Col N="552" /> the fact that these people, by the physical nature of their disablement, are limited in their employability.  Blind persons may be suitable for working in a telephone exchange, and there are certain other crafts for which they may be trained.  In a general sense, their employability is extremely limited.</P>
    <P>In an industry where audio warnings are necessary, such a person cannot work alongside other workers because he could be a danger to his comrades.  In the transport industry, in certain railways and industries of that nature, a person who was deaf could <i>generaliter</i> carry out certain functions efficiently, but he would be a possible danger to other employees. In a case like that, the employees would probably be the first to realise the risk.  A person whose limbs were not one hundred per cent efficient would pose precisely the same problems in industry.  All of us who have had experience &mdash; whether we approach it from the point of view of employer or labourer&mdash;know that there have been cases where the workers have actually refused to work with another person because some disability or peculiarity made him a danger to his comrades, so what I am saying is not by any means fantastic or imaginative.</P>
    <P>Having made this point, I hasten to add&mdash;in case I may be misinterpreted&mdash;that I am not out of sympathy with what is in this Bill.  I want to secure a realistic solution to the problem. As I said before, I could not agree more with what Deputy O'Leary said about this hysterical exercise of indulging in sentimental speeches about the deserving nature of these cases.  I do not want to be taken as being hostile to the Bill.  I want to see what results we can get.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first category of disabled people, we must appreciate that owing to a dispensation of Providence, if one may put it that way, there are members of the community who have the capacity to be useful members of the community in certain directions, but who have not got the all-round potentialities the average able bodied man or woman has. Therefore the problem becomes complicated. To my mind, you cannot <Col N="553" /> legislate globally and say that a certain percentage shall be employed.  I do not want Deputy Dunne to think that I am shooting down everything prematurely.  One has to express oneself when one is working out an argument. There is a serious problem in the selection of what is suitable employment and what is not, and what are the proportions to be used.</P>
    <P>When we come to the second category of disablement, there are even more difficulties in some cases, because who is to say whether an apparent disability from the point of view of appearance rather than ability is a measure of whether a person is employable? I can see that an effort is made in section 7 and again in section 9, to meet a number of the points I am making, but how can you segregate these people statutorily?  It has been stated, and I support it, that a disabled person in proper employment can be extremely efficient.  For instance, with a disablement involving immobility, you do not have to be an athlete to be able to work at a desk, provided you can get to the desk.  If a person has some disability of the lower limbs which restricts normal movement, that person can still be extremely efficient and indeed there are many instances of such people who are.  Let us be careful not to press that case a bit too far.</P>
    <P>I should like to know the ratio of such people employed as against the number of people who suffer from that kind of disability.  In the State services or in private employment, you will find people in this category who are completely efficient.  This is a question I cannot answer but I should like to know the answer.  What proportion are these people of the people who can be classified as suffering from the same disability?  These people have been in jobs and they have got promotion in their jobs, because of their efficiency and ability to do the job. That seems to point out that there has not been any great barrier in their way, once they have secured the particular employment.  So much for that.</P>
    <P>In regard to other employment&mdash; the more manual type &mdash; it is quite <Col N="554" /> clear that physical disability becomes practically complete disability.  Nowadays, there is hardly such a thing as an unskilled worker; everybody is required to have some sort of skill or training.  Even people working on a building site require certain skill.  Anything involving machines requires a good deal of equipment and training. Is there safe room for physically disabled people in those categories? These are all questions one has to ask and one has to find the answers to them before one can actually frame a Bill.  Again, that is not to be taken as a criticism that this Bill was put forward, because a start has to be made somewhere, but it seems to me we have not yet enough answers, or perhaps we have not even asked all the questions we should ask about this problem.  It may be an unpopular thing to say just at the moment but I think it is a little premature to legislate, unless we are more precise.  That would be my attitude to the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another question one has to look at with regard to this.  Take the suggestion made, with regard to State employment of a clerical nature, that there should be a compulsory intake of a certain proportion&mdash;however that would be arrived at&mdash;for, say, clerical work in the Civil Service.  Let us ask ourselves a question.  First of all, there is competition for that employment by all citizens and, whereas one wants to talk about equal opportunity&mdash;and I agree something is necessary to try to afford disabled people equal opportunity&mdash;there is another side to the coin, that is, equal opportunity for the persons competing for such a post.  If you could achieve it&mdash; that applicants could be taken on merit, on their suitability for the job&mdash; then I do not think Deputy Dunne would be thinking of introducing a Bill for a purpose such as this.</P>
    <P>But let us be specific.  You have, say, six applicants for a post and, of those six, two are suffering from a disability, but a disability which does not disable them for the job in question&mdash; lameness or something like that.  Supposing there were two of the applicants out of the six suffering from that disability: everybody is all for seeing that these two would be treated <Col N="555" /> equally, but might not that pendulum swing too far?  Might not the situation be as visualised under this Bill, that those two&mdash;if the proportion were such &mdash;would be automatically ahead and other candidates, who were perhaps more suitable for the job, had better qualifications and more ability, would be rejected?</P>
    <P>When we talk of equality of opportunity, this is a very real problem in dealing with this.  There you have, say, people competing for a Civil Service post.  The normal thing would be that everyone is interviewed on his or her ability for the job.  If you put a compulsory ratio in a particular direction, you defeat the primary purpose and necessarily so.  I quite agree that Deputy O'Leary's answer to me probably would be &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but what is happening in practice is that an unfortunate, who is equally likely to do the job well, will suffer because the examiners or interviewers will shake their heads and say: &ldquo;Oh, the poor fellow is lame&rdquo; and raise an objection. I completely sympathise and agree that that should not be so but how do you achieve that by legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of legislation might well be that somebody more highly qualified, somebody more deserving of the job, even somebody from a general social point of view who might be in a better position to do it, will be blocked.  This, of course, is one of the great difficulties in social legislation of this type.  You can get only a kind of average equality.  This type of legislation inevitably entails a large number of injustices, whilst putting right an overall injustice.  This is the great difficulty of the socialistic approach&mdash; it hurts so many individuals although it does so much for the community at large.  I put these points for consideration here because I think they are relevant.  What one is really looking for here is the mechanics of trying to achieve what has to be done, and the mechanics appear to me to be difficult, but I shall not labour that aspect of it very much longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> A further point which occurs to me, though, is that we are introducing an element of compulsion here.  I am sure it is a problem the Labour Party would have faced in this.  You are going to introduce an element of statutory compulsion in regard to the hiring and firing.  This Bill would be a start to this.  This will present its own difficulties, even with workers working with workers and all the rest. No doubt Deputy James Tully would recognise the type of problem which can arise out of it.  But, fundamentally here, we are going to bring in a statutory, mandatory, compulsory element into hiring and firing relations.  In other words, we are starting statutorily to regulate employment.</P>
    <P>In all we hear about freedom of employment and all that sort of thing &mdash;this issue arises remotely out of that; it is something to be adverted to&mdash;I am wondering whether, with sympathy for a lot of this approach, there is not a lot more staff work which both the Government and the Labour Party would have to do to investigate the nature of this problem. Admittedly, I have only touched on this problem rather generally because, as I said at the beginning, my intention was to ask questions, not to give answers, because, quite frankly, I do not know the answers.  The problem is too involved, too broad, and raises too many issues to blow an answer off the cuff like that, but I do want to ask the questions, as much of the sponsors of the Bill as of the Minister who would have the information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan also raised the question of preparing people for their retirement.  This, of course, is a very wide issue, having social implications of a far-reaching nature. I accept that many people are unprepared for retirement but I have often wondered at what stage in one's life should one begin to prepare for retirement.  Is it the age of 35, 40, 45, or when?  In any event, this is one of the questions on which the Commission <Col N="558" /> on Mental Illness made certain recommendations.  I shall be considering them carefully in conjunction with the Commission's general report.</P>
      <P>In regard to old married couples in county homes I fully share Deputy James Tully's concern that people who have lived all their lives together should be separated at the end of their lives in county homes.  I am not sure exactly how many couples are so affected but it is not very large in terms of numbers.  The same consideration applies here as that in regard to mentally handicapped children in mental hospitals, namely that the problem is not one to be dealt with as a mere problem of numbers.  I propose to take positive steps to try to ensure that all married couples will in future be able to stay together during the last years of their lives, in county homes if they have to be there.</P>
      <P>The next matter I should like to refer to is the district nursing service. I thank all Deputies who paid tribute to this service because I regard the service as being perhaps the single most important service provided in the country for the community; and I regard the expansion of the service, which is going on fairly rapidly at present, as being of fundamental importance. Some Deputies, including Deputy James Tully, said the service is not being expanded rapidly enough.  While this may be so, the fact is that considerable improvement has been achieved to date and most local authorities have fairly enthusiastically responded to the circular issued by my Department some months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result, 68 additional post of public health nurses have been approved and proposals for the creation of 43 further posts are being considered.  The fact that this expansion has not occurred at the speed some of us would desire is due to difficulty in obtaining suitably qualified and trained nurses for appointment. As the House knows, An Bord Altranais are holding courses leading to certificate examinations.  I had the pleasure some months ago of declaring open the first such course, attended by 34 trainees, and I shall also have the duty of presenting the necessary <Col N="559" /> certificates to these charming ladies in the very near future.  I am told that some of them were present in the House at an earlier stage today and only regret they are not present now so that they could hear my complimentary references.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish, I am afraid, has stolen their hearts by the references he has made to the undesirability of these ladies having to disguise their crowning glory, their hair.  These courses will be continued until the requirement laid down in the White Paper of 600 district health nurses is fulfilled.  The only thing I wish to add in regard to this is that I believe the tour of local authorities which I undertook late last year had some effect on those local authorities who were dragging their feet in the matter of co-operating with my Department in steps to improve the ratio of public health nurses to the population, as set out in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputies' references to district medical officers who are not availing of the service of public health nurses, this is a difficult personal problem on which all I can say is that I hope the number of doctors about whom this can be said is steadily diminishing.  I am aware of instances where doctors have not cooperated; I am aware of instances where doctors have regarded the nurses as being more or less personal secretaries and who have, to some extent, impeded them in the discharge of their duties as nurses.  I deplore that, in the few instances it has occurred, and should hope that the motivating factor will be, as it ought to be, the service of the people and providing for their needs, not the matter of the personal convenience of either the doctor or the nurse.</P>
    <P>Another matter, mentioned by Deputy Kyne, was the provisional medical cards.  He said he thought there should be a system of appeal from decisions of the managers of health authorities.  I have given a great deal of consideration to this matter. I can certainly see force in Deputy Kyne's argument, but, at this stage, I feel we should not take any steps to <Col N="560" /> provide appeal machinery.  I am concerned by the fact that there are considerable divergencies, as between managers, in the application of the existing law, with the result that persons earning a certain amount of money per week qualify for medical cards under certain health authorities and do not qualify under others.  The fact that the county health authority system is shortly going to be replaced by a regional board seems to me to obviate the necessity for creating appeal machinery at this time.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the proposal in the White Paper to standardise the means test and to publicise an agreed formula in such a way as to achieve, as far as possible, the level of standardisation that is desirable in this regard.  With the creation of the regional board, at least as I envisage that board operating, there will be a built in machinery for appeal from whatever local officer carries out the initial examination to the board itself. This should provide a fair system of appeal, without creating any appeal machinery, as is suggested by the Deputy.  In other words, what I am trying to say is that I agree with him that uniformity of application of the means test is desirable.  I agree with him that anomalies should be removed. I agree with him that some form of appeal machinery is desirable, but I believe that to create it at this stage would be undesirable, because, other things apart, it would be expensive to do so and when regionalisation is a fact, some machinery will exist in any event.</P>
    <P>I now come to another point which Deputy Kyne raised, in regard to the interview I gave to the <i>Irish Medical Times.</i> Here I must also refer to what Deputy Ryan said because he suggested that I gave that interview with an eye on the medical profession and gave my replies with a view to pandering to the conservative elements of that profession. Might I say to Deputy Ryan that if he really thinks that, he might have said this in his article to the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> in which he dealt with my interview.  He had an opportunity then, of which he did not avail.</P>

      <P>I accept it as so.  I do not think Deputy Ryan believes I was pandering to the conservative elements of the medical profession when I said that it is not envisaged that the lower income group will be substantially increased from the 30 per cent odd it is today but I take Deputy Kyne's point seriously because it is a serious matter.  He quoted paragraph 51 of the White Paper and suggested if the limits were prescribed in accordance with that paragraph, the proportion of eligibility for medical cards would likely be as high as 50 per cent and said this was not in accordance with what I said in the interview.  He asked me to clarify this.</P>
      <P>I am glad to do so.  What is said in the White Paper is what we intend to do.  Of course, it is clear that already in certain parts of the country the proportion of people who have medical cards is already at, or even higher than, 50 per cent.  There are parts of the country where the proportion of medical cards is as high as 60 per cent, those obviously being the poorer rural areas. What I said to the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> was simply this.  It is not envisaged that there will be a substantial overall increase in the number of people who will be entitled to medical cards, but I am not tying myself.  I did not then and I do not intend to do so now. What is said in paragraph 51 is what we intend to do.  When one combines with that intention the other intention of regularising the method of assessing eligibility for medical cards, the proportion can then take care of itself.</P>
      <P>I do not believe, having regard to all the considerations that will have to apply, including increasing affluence, increasing wages and salaries and so forth, that there will in the end be a substantial increase in the proportion of people over all the country who will be entitled to be included in the lower income group, although, of course, there will always remain certain isolated, remote areas where people are poor and where the proportion will be higher.  There will also be richer urban areas where the proportion will be very substantially lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> On the question of eligibility, Deputy Esmonde, somewhat, to my surprise, made the suggestion that home assistance officers do not deal fairly with the people and that instead they try to save expense by refusing medical cards to people who should be granted them.  As I say, I am very surprised that he said this because he is a Deputy for whose views I have considerable respect.  I can only say I find it very difficult to believe. I should point out that home assistance officers do not refuse medical cards at any rate.  All a home assistance officer does is to go along and investigate the means and circumstances of the applicant and report his findings to the health authorities, who in turn make the decision.  Therefore, it is not strictly accurate in any sense to say that home assistance officers refuse applications for medical cards.  On the other hand, there may be the casual instance where the home assistance officer sends in a report which could be regarded as harsh or unfair.  I believe and hope that the number of cases in which this would apply is very small.  If the Deputy or any other Deputy can give me instances I will be happy to have them re-investigated but on behalf of the home assistance officers, I should say that they are, in the main, doing a difficult job and doing it honestly and well.</P>
    <P>I come next to complaints made by Deputy Treacy about dispensaries in County Tipperary, and also complaints by Deputy Coogan.  This question of the condition of the dispensaries, and indeed the provision of dispensaries throughout the country, must be considered in the light of the proposal to change from the existing dispensary system to one in which there will be choice of doctor.  I am aware that so far as Tipperary is concerned, if I may take it first, that it was the intention of the authority there to replace the dispensary premises at Ardfinnane, Ballingarry and Kilsheelan but the health authorities were asked to review the proposal to put up new dispensaries in these places in the light of the declared intention to introduce the choice of doctor system instead.  As the House is aware, under the new proposed <Col N="563" /> service, eligible persons will attend their doctor, not at a dispensary premises but at the doctor's private surgery.  Generally speaking, health authorities would not be obliged to provide dispensary premises at all, though, of course, an exception will always have to be made for those special areas in the country requiring special consideration.</P>
    <P>Since Deputy Treacy made his remarks, I have had certain inquiries made of the county manager in Tipperary, especially with regard to Ardfinnane.  I am advised that in an effort to remedy the position there, the authority have advertised recently for the purpose of acquiring alternative premises for use as a dispensary, pending the implementation of the choice of doctor scheme.  They have also undertaken to examine the position in regard to the other dispensaries I have mentioned, with a view to effecting any essential improvements required at any of these centres.</P>
    <P>The proposal mentioned to introduce a choice of doctor has also affected the provision of dispensary facilities in the Mervue area in Galway city mentioned by Deputy Coogan.  A premises will have to be provided in any event for child welfare and other services and a suitable site has been purchased by Galway Health Authority.  I hope there will not be any undue delay in the erection of the premises on this site and that that will remove the cause of the Deputy's grievance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan also had some adversely critical things to say about the pharmacy service at some of the Dublin dispensaries.  I agree that the service has defects but I should not like to think that it is quite as bad as the Deputy would have the House believe. He says it is not uncommon for patients to call three or four times with prescriptions before they are filled in.  I have made inquiries from Dublin Health Authority and they assure me that this is not so, nor is it so that a chemist or his assistant will give a patient a drug which has not been prescribed by the doctor, that is, where the originally prescribed drug is not <Col N="564" /> available.  I understand that the practice is that if the prescribed drug is not available, the pharmacist or his assistant contacts the doctor first and obtains his permission before supplying any alternative.  I accept that in some of the larger dispensaries, where anything up to a half-dozen doctors are in attendance, there may be a wait of an hour or two, sometimes a few hours, for medicines.  This is a matter of concern to me.  It is also a matter of concern to the health authority.  I believe that the fact that it was raised here will encourage the health authority further to keep this situation under constant examination.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan again mentioned the matter of the supply of surgical appliances as relating to the Dublin Health Authority area.  I say &ldquo;again&rdquo;, because it was the subject of a Parliamentary Question to me some months ago.  Perhaps this is an appropriate time to refer to a little skirmish between the Deputy and myself this afternoon, arising out of a Parliamentary Question. The point I was trying to make then was that I do not know that I approve of asking Parliamentary Questions in general terms when the Deputy merely has an individual instance in mind.  I have no objection whatever to Deputy Ryan continuing this practice.  I do not regard it as an abuse of the parliamentary process and I would be the last person to take umbrage at the Deputy or anybody else in his Party putting down Parliamentary Questions even on the most footling things because this is the privilege and right of the Deputy. However where a service is, in the main, good and where there may be a slight breakdown, due to personal inefficiency or neglect, absence or some such factor which is not repeated, I think that is a more suitable vehicle for correspondence than a Parliamentary Question.  In regard to the supply of surgical appliances, I am satisfied that, in the main, the procedures adopted in Dublin involve little or no delay and that in the normal course the applicant is supplied in a matter of days.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's contention that the standard of eligibility for medical cards in Dublin either is deliberately kept low to reduce pressure on the dispensaries. Surely the fact that there are considerably increased opportunities for employment in Dublin must be taken to be a factor?  There is also the fact that a number of firms provide general medical services for their employees through doctors they employ for their own firms.  I am glad to note in recent times that some of these firms are also providing a dental service as well as a medical service for their employees.</P>
      <P>I accept that the work load on dispensary doctors in Dublin is very heavy.  I therefore accept that there can be frustration from the patient's point of view.  If a doctor has to examine a large number of patients within a given time, he obviously cannot give the same minute examination as he would like to give.  This is a situation which, of course, develops where you have a rapidly increasing population in developing suburban areas.  I think it inevitable that there will be some backlog of delay in catching up on this on the part of the health authority.  I think the Deputy, and I would imagine all Deputies who are associated with Dublin Health Authority are, is aware that the Authority are conscious of the need to keep abreast of the requirements of the people by way of doctors.  Dublin Health Authority has, in the main, been assiduous in reviewing the situation from time to time and in trying to correct defects which come to their notice.</P>
      <P>Mention has also been made of delay in toning down selections.  I share the Deputy's concern here.  I think in a situation where acute cases are concerned, these are given priority and there are no grounds for complaints so far as these acute cases are concerned.  There has been over-long delay in regard to chronic old cases which are a cause for concern.  I have asked the Hospitals Commission to recommend to me what measures can be taken with a view to solving this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> Deputy Kyne also mentioned anomalies which arise from the school health examination scheme.  These again are under examination at the present time and I am expecting a report shortly.  I have also been concerned by the fact that by law a child examined in the course of a school health medical examination is allowed certain free treatment, whereas a child who is not fortunate enough to have attended the official examination in school and who has defects discovered privately by the doctor, is not so entitled.  I would be inclined, without promising to do so, to abolish that statutory provision so as to make all children equal.  However, I will not commit myself in this regard until I receive the report I have mentioned, and I will then make an announcement about my general intention.  It is obviously desirable that all children should be treated equally on the basis that prevention is better than cure in so far as disease afterwards can be prevented if proper dental, medical and other services are available to children at the earliest possible stage.</P>
    <P>I now come to Deputy Ryan's remarks in regard to the hearing aid service.  He stated that there is only one type of hearing aid supplied and that people who get hearing aids discard them because they are useless. Not merely are these statements inaccurate but they are quite unfair. The hearing aid service is operated by NOR, National Organisation for Rehabilitation, and I do not have to tell Deputy Ryan anything about this organisation or the people who run it. I should like to tell him that there are four types of hearing aid being provided. There is a standard model which suits the majority of patients, a more powerful model which suits severely deaf patients, a wide band model, and a powerful one with a wide band range.  The vast majority of people supplied with these are fully satisfied with them.  Quite recently, the organisation called back 40 adult patients selected at random in the Dublin area.  Of these, four had discontinued using the aids.  One of these four had purchased an ear-aid privately; the other three, who were <Col N="567" /> quite old, had discontinued using them because they found them too noisy. The aids were adjusted to cut down the background noise and the three patients in question are now trying to use them again.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, quite understandable that old people will find difficulty in accustoming themselves to the use of hearing aids, but this applies just as much to hearing aids privately purchased as it does to those provided under the national service.  I should add also that the organisation provides aids to the Council of Education Advisory Service for Deaf Children, and all children supplied with hearing aids are regularly visited and their progress marked.</P>
    <P>I now come to the remarks made by several Deputies in regard to the ambulance services.  I think it is now appreciated that it is the constant concern of my Department to improve the ambulance services and to continue to improve them to their highest possible level of efficiency.  Might I here thank Deputy Clinton for the remarks he made this afternoon when he so rightly said that it was about time people stopped criticising the ambulance services as being inadequate? Indeed, I would commend his remarks, not merely to those Deputies who seem to be able to find some inferences of neglect whenever it suits them, but to other people outside the House as well.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Clinton said, you cannot provide an ambulance at every corner. You cannot anticipate where the drunk will hit the telegraph pole; you cannot even be sure that it is a telegraph pole he will hit and, therefore, all you can do is provide a service and a means of communicating with that service, ensuring (a) that the service is of high efficiency, and (b) that as far as possible the communications will be as fast as possible.  In this country and, indeed, in any other country where accidents take place in remote areas, there is sometimes an unfortunate time-lag between the happening of the accident and the ambulance service being notified.  Sometimes this delay has very unfortunate results for the injured person.  But, to be realistic about it, <Col N="568" /> this is a situation which I think must remain indefinitely.  All we can do is provide an adequate ambulance service with good ambulances properly equipped, expert personnel and the necessary backing of hospital services with it.  I agree with Deputy Clinton that at this stage the ambulance service of this country is good.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of the ambulance drivers mentioned by Deputy James Tully.  There is a claim for increased pay and better conditions of service which has been on hands now for some considerable time.  I have been most anxious to help the ambulance drivers in their claim which I regard as well-founded.  To that end, I met the representatives of the unions concerned and subsequently saw the County and City Managers Association. Last month, the managers sent a letter to the liaison officer for the unions asking him to nominate representatives to meet the managers for a discussion.  I shall be only too glad to use my good offices again, if necessary, to bring these parties together.  The situation, so far as I am concerned, is simply that, subject to the ambulance drivers doing and passing the driving course, about which the House knows, the ambulance drivers will be entitled to a fair increase in their remuneration and this will be on a national basis.  If there is any further help I can give to assist the processing of this matter, I shall be glad to give it.</P>
    <P>A slightly different situation arises in regard to the remuneration of local authority staffs over the operative date for the tenth round increase.  I think it was in regard to this particular matter that a member of the Labour Party, a Mr. Ó Murchadha, saw fit at Roscommon a couple of months ago to launch a vicious attack upon my predecessor, who is the present Minister for Education, and myself.  This worthy gentleman was perfectly well aware&mdash;and, if not, he ought to have been well aware&mdash;that the decision in regard to this matter was a Government decision and that both my predecessor and myself were merely carrying out the instructions of the Government and were therefore not <Col N="569" /> in a position to vary the terms of the decision.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the inadequacies of our public dental services.  This was merely repeating what I had said myself in my opening statement because I am gravely concerned about the fact that our dental service in many areas is indeed unsatisfactory and requires considerable improvement.  The fact that agreement has recently been reached on a new scale of salary for public dental officers will, I hope, be a help.  There are 25 vacant dental posts at the present time.  If we fill these vacancies, we could immediately effect a considerable improvement in the understaffed areas, one of which, indeed, is my own county of Mayo, another being Donegal.  We are most anxious to provide a fully satisfactory dental service.</P>
    <P>I have been turning over in my mind the suggestion that dentists should be asked, or perhaps obliged, to give the public health service a year of their time after they qualify.  At this stage, I am not prepared to say any more than that I am giving this consideration. The House will be aware that, in recent times, there has been a very considerable brain-drain from the western European countries to the other side of the Atlantic and that, at the present time, this is being operated deliberately on a selective basis in the United States.</P>
    <P>We all know, and are acutely conscious, that it costs us a great deal of money to produce a doctor, a dentist, an engineer or an architect. We are naturally aggrieved if, as a matter of policy, any big nation should use its vast resources to select our brains, if we have paid to train them, and do so without return or offer of return to us.  Furthermore, we have a serious manpower shortage, especially in the dental field.  I should be slow to take steps on this side, but, as I say, I am attracted, to some extent anyway, by the idea of making it a condition of qualification that the dentist should give the first year of his service to his own country but, of course, on the basis that he will at least adequately be paid.  I would <Col N="570" /> have, I hope, further ideas to offer on this problem at a later time.</P>
    <P>In regard to the suggestion by Deputies James Tully and Healy that more use should be made of private dentists, I should certainly listen very carefully to anything Deputy Healy might mention in regard to a matter on which he is an expert.  Some 16 authorities have already made arrangements with about 16 private dentists to hold treatment sessions either in health authority clinics or in their own surgeries, but other health authorities have no such arrangements, sometimes because the private dentists are not particularly interested in sessional work and sometimes perhaps because the matter of remuneration could not amicably be agreed upon between the parties concerned.  I do not think it would be wise of me to say anything more about this matter at this time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen stated that children in Cabra and Finglas have to travel to Cornmarket when they need dental attention.  I may have been mistaken but I thought at the time that Deputy Mullen said &ldquo;Common Market&rdquo; and I was relieved to know that at least they do not have to go to France.  However, as I pointed out in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 1st December last, there is, in fact, a clinic at Ballygall Road, Finglas, where a dentist attends regularly, and the question of providing an additional clinic or clinics in the Dublin area is under review by the health authority, who, of course, are the people having primary responsibility.  I understand that they intend to put up another clinic in Cabra as soon as they can get suitable premises.  They already have a total of 25 equipped surgeries in 18 different clinics and also recently purchased a mobile dental trailer unit.  They also have an arrangement with the Dublin Dental Hospital for treating patients who are eligible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Healy also mentioned, towards the end of his speech, his concern about the oldest known building in Cork, namely Skiddy's, the old almshouse, and he came up with a suggestion, which I hope will be implemented that is, that that part of this building which could be preserved will be preserved. <Col N="571" /> According to my information, the building itself is incapable of restoration and, of course, it is very badly needed by the health authority for a nurses' home.  I do not like to have old buildings destroyed, if there is anything preservable in them and if the needs of our times as well as the aesthetics can be met together.  It seems that there is an arcade which is now invisible to the people of Cork, never mind tourists, which could be put up elsewhere, perhaps in Fitzgerald's Park or some such place, and I hope Deputy Healy and those interested with him in Cork will pursue this so that if Skiddy's should go, at least some part of it will be preserved and be visible for and in Cork in the future.</P>
    <P>Reference was made also to St. Clare's Convent in Stamullen, set up some 15 years ago by the Poor Clare Order in Newry to look after abandoned babies.  Most of the babies in this home are maintained at the expense of the local authorities and, to assist the nuns with the running costs, several increases in the maintenance rate were approved and the present rate, which was fixed on 17th July, 1965, is £5 a week.  I understand that on 7th March there were 71 babies in the home.  Eighteen of these were privately placed and the relatives contribute for some of them.  The other 53 are paid for by health authorities at the rate I have mentioned.  The order, therefore, is receiving about £14,000 a year.  I should like it to be more because these wonderful ladies are doing a great service to these unfortunate abandoned babies.  If and when a case can be made for increasing the maintenance rate, the House can be assured that I will consider it sympathetically.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton today, following up the remarks made by others earlier on, mentioned what he described as the hard core of tuberculosis patients which still remains and asked that I should take whatever steps are necessary to attract public attention, especially the attention of parents, to the need for immunisation and X-ray.  I would be glad to send a circular to the health authorities as suggested by Deputy Clinton <Col N="572" /> but I am glad to say that there are at least some hopeful signs.  I have just learned from the Mass Radiography Board the figures of those who came forward for X-ray last month.  It is the record figure of 38,611 and is the highest in any one month since the establishment of this service in 1951.  Nevertheless, I agree that public attention should continue to be focused on this problem until such time as the disease is wiped out completely.</P>
    <P>I now come to deal briefly with the references made to the efforts, some say &ldquo;if any&rdquo;, of my Department in regard to smoking.  I agree that I am not much of an advertisement but at least I am honest about it.  When I was opening the &ldquo;Home Truths&rdquo; series on Telefís Éireann, I admitted that I smoked cigarettes and regarded myself as being virtually incurable from that point of view at this late stage of my life.  There are people who, apparently, have more determination than I have who do manage to give up smoking when they are over 40.  I am convinced that the most hopeful way to tackle this problem is by concentrating on the youth. I do not propose to delay the House with details of what my Department are doing in the way of issuing leaflets and so on and so forth.  Most Deputies are probably aware that there were three of the &ldquo;Home Truths&rdquo; programmes which were devoted in one way or another to this problem of smoking.  May I say that in all the countries that have tried to mount a serious campaign against smoking the success achieved to date has been disappointingly small?  In America now there is a notice on every packet of cigarettes sold warning the public that the consumption of cigarettes may be hazardous to health.</P>
    <P>I accept that smoking is hazardous to health and, indeed, I accept the compelling evidence of the connection between smoking and lung cancer, between smoking and heart disease, between smoking and bronchitis, but there are very strong forces operating, these being manufacturers of cigarettes who have an enormous vested interest in ensuring that their product will continue to be sold.  Every time <Col N="573" /> a concerted effort is made in any country to warn the public about the dangers of smoking, the cigarette manufacturers forthwith double, redouble and quadruple the money they spend on advertising their product in an effort to counteract the influence of the doctor or the politician.</P>
    <P>If one accepts also that smoking is an addition to a drug, then it is not practicable to try to stop people who are confirmed smokers other than the occasional person who is frightened by his doctor into stopping smoking or who decides to stop smoking and has the moral courage to carry his decision into effect.  I think the right way to approach this problem is to get at the youth and I think the right people to do that are teachers rather than parents&mdash;teachers in the school who are interested, because the children might think the parents were merely trying to stop them being manly when they grow up or some nonsense like that.  In that connection, I believe children do now realise that smoking is injurious to their health. They realise their parents are not trying to make sissies of them by advising them or warning them against smoking.  The only way we will ever make practical progress in this important matter is by concentrating our efforts on the youth, particularly through the teachers, as well as the parents, so that we will have more and more people who never have acquired the smoking habit.</P>
    <P>I might add that, when I did mention smoking in my own few words in the introduction to the Home Truths programme, there was quite a flap because the amount of revenue involved for a certain organisation I am now going to praise is quite substantial. Incidentally, when I mentioned RTE in my introductory speech, it drew from a distinguished member of the Press Gallery an article suggesting all sorts of devious implications in my remarks.  I do not know why my esteemed friend, that particular correspondent, decided to take so many meanings out of my simple remark, unless perhaps he was bored with writing about the farmers' dispute and <Col N="574" /> thought he would inject a little bit of excitement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All I want to say, both to him and to the House, is that I was making a very simple statement of fact, that is, that my Department and I have had nothing but co-operation and help from RTE, especially in connection with &ldquo;Home Truths&rdquo; programme which, as far as I know, is the first programme in which a Department officially participated each week.  This represented to me a considerable advance in the co-operation between Government Departments and RTE.  I was glad to have the opportunity then.  I was not acting as a decoy for anybody else or making anything other than a statement of simple fact which I felt was due to those who put so much work into the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clinton also mentioned an agreed policy on antibiotics in veterinary and medical matters.  This is a very difficult problem.  Fortunately or otherwise, one runs up against the fact that the prescriber is supposed to be the final and ultimately the only responsible arbiter as to the particular drug to be used by the patient.  In an age when an enormous amount of money is being spent on the development of new drugs, with the resulting products very heavily advertised, this is a problem which has caused concern in every country in the world, because in the past few years, the cost of supplying drugs has increased out of all proportion in every country in the world.  I had figures somewhere of the increase in costs in Britain since 1960, which was, I think, something like 25 per cent to 30 per cent.  This has also been the trend in New Zealand, America and Ireland.  It is one which is a source of concern and which, at the same time, raises very thorny and difficult problems in regard to its control.  The ultimate <Col N="575" /> question is whether there are any circumstances in which you would deny the patient a very expensive drug, if it were recommended as being the only suitable one for him.  I suppose there are not any circumstances, if a community can afford it.  What is of concern is that expensive drugs are unnecessarily prescribed and the fact that, as I mentioned, there is very little an authority can do to control that situation.</P>
    <P>May I now come to the question of the contribution by the Exchequer to the local authorities in respect of the 1967-68 Health Bill?  I have been under very heavy attack by Members of the House because the Exchequer did not this year operate the freeze on the rates as it operated in 1966-67. Indeed, I have been accused of bad faith in this regard and of having gone back on the promises of my predecessor and the promises in the White Paper.  I want to make it clear that there is a distinction between what is said in the White Paper and by my predecessor and the general impression the public got as to our intentions in regard to the freeze.  I may have contributed to giving this impression. It is not easy for a member of the general public to look into the exact and precise meaning of, say, a paragraph in a White Paper, which, to the member of the public, is important only as to what generally it is going to give him.</P>
    <P>As a fact, the Government promised a freeze on the rates for 1966-67 and redeemed that promise by putting the freeze into operation.  As a fact, the Government did not promise that that freeze would continue indefinitely, but did say that the cost of new and extended services for future years would be met by the Exchequer and not as to any proportion by the rates. I would not expect a member of the general public to see the distinction and although the fact is that this distinction is there, the Government have not failed to honour the promise to pay for the new and extended services provided in respect of the year 1967-68, and if, to any extent, I may have given a wrong impression to anybody <Col N="576" /> in this connection, I certainly did not do so in bad faith, and it was because I did not sufficiently spell out the nuances of the differences between the Exchequer paying for everything extra and the Exchequer paying only for the extra cost of new and extended services.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about this whole matter.  This country is not alone in being concerned about providing for the payment of the cost of health services.  Any of you who have had an opportunity of reading an excellent article in the current issue of <i>Look</i> about British and American health services&mdash;one which I would recommend every Member to read&mdash; will appreciate that there are very grave fundamental problems in regard to financing health services which exist throughout the world, and if problems like this are a grave concern to the greatest and richest nation the world has ever seen, and if these problems are of grave concern to Britain, a highly industrialised and rich nation, how much more so to us?  The cost of health services in America has increased by 24 per cent in the past two years and, as the article pointed out, the British system of socialised medicine now in operation for 20 years, is in danger of collapse.  The Americans are equally worried about the capital cost of hospitalisation.  The cost per bed now in America is something so fantastic as to be almost unbelievable.  Each of us with any interest in health knows the amount by which the cost of hospitalisation has increased in this country over the past three years.  We also know that the capital cost of our hospital programme has escalated enormously and is continuing to do so.</P>
    <P>I only wish things were as simple as Deputy O'Higgins said they were tonight. Let me say to Deputy O'Higgins, as I said before to Deputy Ryan, although apparently Deputy O'Higgins was not listening because he said our thinking had stopped in 1953 and become fossilised, that one would imagine from what Deputy O'Higgins was saying that it was somebody else, the Labour Party or some bishop, who had produced the White Paper in <Col N="577" /> January 1966 that was produced by my predecessor Deputy O'Malley.  This certainly did contain new thinking in regard to the development of our health services.  I only wish Deputy O'Higgins could produce an insurance system which would be the answer to the financing of our current health services.  If he can, I will take it from him, put it into operation and give him, or Deputy Ryan, and the Fine Gael Party the credit for it, if they want it, because I am not interested in who gets the credit, but I am gravely concerned about the escalating cost of our services, and I believe we must have a combination of ordinary financing and special financing, if this cost is not to become an intolerable burden on the people.</P>
    <P>I also believe that, under the existing arrangement whereby the Hospitals Trust Fund has to make up the deficits of the voluntary hospitals, we shall have to think seriously about our capital programme also.  So far as insurance is concerned, I do not know whether the Fine Gael proposal is or is not workable but, as I understand it, it was the Fine Gael aim that the entire cost of the health services would be met by the tripartite contribution by employers, the State and the community. I have serious doubts as to whether a practicable insurance system for our general medical service can be put into operation but I am very much attracted by the idea of some form of insurance in relief of the tax and ratepayers, and I am quite willing to put that into operation because I believe that something will have to be done, not merely to relieve the ratepayers as was done last year and as is being done on an increased basis this year, but to relieve the taxpayers of a burden which it is obvious will grow at too great a speed for their resources.</P>
    <P>Some form of contributory insurance appears to me to be desirable and I am at present having an examination carried out as to the feasibility of putting it into operation and, as I said, I do not care who gets the credit for it; I do not want it because I am merely interested in providing better service for the people.  Indeed, it seems to me that Fine Gael subsist <Col N="578" /> on the notion that if you play politics cleverly enough and long enough, you must eventually win, whereas Fianna Fáil hold on to this silly, precious and unchangeable notion and belief that it is the people and their service that matters.  I could not help laughing when Deputy O'Higgins said this evening that the House was aware that no member of his Party ever talked from the teeth out.  It is the first time I heard that Fine Gael had a political philosophy.  I remember from the first time I encountered the organised phalanx of Fine Gael 25 years ago, it was the last thing they could be described as having, although they certainly had expertise in practical politics.  Their idea seemed to be that the cliffs of life can all be climbed by flashing the trident, whereas I believe they can only be scaled by the slow and often mistaken effort of honest endeavour.</P>
    <P>There are some other matters to which I should like to refer in a general way and in particular, to the allegation that nothing has been happening in respect of the White Paper and that no consultations have been taking place with the IMA and the Medical Union.  This is not so.  There have been more consultations in the past 12 months with representatives of the Irish Medical Association and the profession generally than at any time in the history of the Department of Health.  It is important that this should be so because there are so many problems that arise as a result of the proposal to change from the dispensary system to the choice of doctor system, because of the necessity to discuss the form of payment for doctors who will participate in the new system, because of the need to set up a choice of chemist as well as a choice of doctor.  In all this, there is not, and never has been, any suggestion that either the Medical Association or the Medical Union would be asked, in Deputy Ryan's phrase, to like it or lump it.  There is no suggestion that we are not open to discussion about every single aspect of the proposals contained in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I admit personal responsibility for <Col N="579" /> the fact that any promise or undertaking that may have been given by my predecessor in regard to the introduction of legislation in November, 1966, was not redeemed.  It is a fact that a Bill could have been introduced in November, 1966, though it would have been a scramble to do it.  I took the view that it is better that consultations should be held early rather than late, that as far as possible these consultations should be amicably included before the Bill was put into form, so that when the House came to discuss these proposals, the widest measure of approval would already have been reached, and so that we would escape having an unconscionable number of amendments to debate and counterdebate and have referred back for further consideration.</P>
    <P>This legislation is very important, not merely to Deputies, to the doctors and others who will operate it, but to our people.  Therefore, it is especially important, to me anyway, that it should be well considered before being introduced here.  Deputy O'Higgins says that he does not believe it will be introduced this year.  Maybe it will not, but it will not be for want of trying on my part, or on the part of my officials, if it is not.  Our aim is that it should be, at least, introduced later on this year and, if possible, made law.  This will not mean that we will then, forthwith, be able to implement all the proposals contained in the White Paper and subsequently to be enshrined in the Bill.  Even when it is enacted the broad statement set out in the preamble to the White Paper will still be valid and, indeed, having regard to the facts I have mentioned about increased costs, that situation will obtain for a considerable time, namely, that the proposals will be brought into operation as the resources available to the country improve.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the matter of the cost of hospitals, on which I touched briefly earlier on.  It was because of my concern with the enormous increase in the cost of hospital construction that I undertook a tour of three or four countries and visited 13 <Col N="580" /> or 14 hospitals roughly a month ago and also, in the process, had long and detailed discussions with Dr. Sahl of the Kranken Institute in Germany, who has done an enormous amount of research in this field.  It does seem clear to me now, having regard to the rapid changes in medicine that are taking place almost daily, that the ideal to be aimed at is a flexible construction designed to last 15 years at the maximum, a construction that can be expanded or abbreviated, depending on the changes that take place in the medical field as the years go by.  In view of our very limited resources, it does seem a pity that we should put up solid cut-stone buildings which are obsolete by the time the official opening ceremony takes place and which during their lifetime are so inflexible as to be incapable of adaptation, except at enormous cost.</P>
    <P>Only a few days ago, I visited quite a new hospital in Stanford University in California and was surprised, though perhaps a little consoled, to see that from a functional point of view, it had an unbelievable number of drawbacks. I visited the new and not yet fully operational hospital in Slough in Wrexham Park outside London very recently, and the laboratory there was the subject of a large number of complaints from the doctor who was on duty there at the time.</P>
    <P>This is just to show that these problems exist in other countries, but they exist against a background of considerably more wealth than we have.  It is very important that, if we are to give a service to our people, we should make the best possible use of our capital resources for hospital building. I would hope that as a result of the crystallisation of our ideas following these examinations, more standardisation can be introduced into this temporary type of hospital structure I have mentioned, so that, without great expense, we can rapidly provide a new or extended service, if required, or close down one that has become obsolete.</P>
    <P>I have kept the House considerably longer than I had intended, but I shall conclude by again thanking all the Members of the House who took part <Col N="581" /> in the debate, and particularly those who wished me well in my post as Minister for Health.  I say this especially to Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, who was one of my predecessors in that office, and I appreciate his good wishes the more for that reason.  We have very great problems still to solve in the health field, and I hope that we shall tackle them in the right spirit, in the right priority, and that we shall during my time, however long or short it may be, achieve at least some satisfactory measure of success.</P>

      <P>I must express my disappointment with the amount of employment provided in Galway so far as Gaeltarra Éireann is concerned. This is the area in which we have the greatest drain as a result of emigration.  We are supposed to cater for native speakers.  In this area alone, there is a great demand for work. What has Gaeltarra Éireann done to meet that demand?  There is a sum here of £220,000, of which I should like a breakdown.  I should like to know how much of it is spent on palatial offices here in Dublin.  We hear all the talk about saving the West.  After 30 years of Fianna Fáil, it is still &ldquo;save the West&rdquo;.  It must be saved.  We hear all they are going to do for the West. It is results that count, not little efforts like this.  Are we to leave the whole thing to Father McDyer?  The Board of Works have given up as far as roadmaking is concerned in the West. What is to compensate?  What is Gaeltarra Éireann doing?  I do not suggest that the road workers should be turned over to making dolls, but their children could be employed to a much greater extent.  Why not channel the moneys saved by the Board of Works into doing something worthwhile to save the West?  The unfortunate people are up to their necks in muck and slush trying to get in and out of the backwoods.  The situation is a disgrace to Fianna Fáil and others like <Col N="584" /> them who will do nothing to save the West.</P>

      <P>Molaim do na daoine atá i mbun cúrsaí tráchtála sa tír seo monarchana beaga a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht agus gan bheith ag brath ar an Rialtas amháin chun obair a chur ar fáil.  Tá dualgas ar gach duine sa tír seo gan ligean don teanga dul in éag.  Sí an phríomhaidhm a ba chóir a bheith romhainn obair a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Tá an Rialtas ag déanamh a ndíchill agus níl a fhios agam conas is féidir leo níos mó a dhéanamh.  Tá a lán deontas le fáil ag aon duine ar maith leis aon rud a chur ar aghaidh sa Ghaeltacht.  Níl dóthain úsáide á baint as na deontais agus as an airgead atá le fáil chun monarchana a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words in English because I have noticed that on previous occasions on which I have spoken in our native language, the representatives of the Press were unable to report what I said, or else were not sufficiently interested in reporting what anybody who spoke in Irish said.

      <P>I would appeal to the people responsible for reporting the happenings in this House at all times to take notice of any matters relating to the Gaeltacht and our national language. <Col N="585" /> The Department of the Gaeltacht are giving every assistance towards providing further employment in the Gaeltacht areas. Under Gaeltarra Éireann, there is tremendous financial assistance available to any industrialist wishing to set up there.  The problem is that the people in the Gaeltacht who know about this assistance are not in a position to avail of it fully.  Therefore I would appeal to some of our larger industrialists to examine fully whether they could come in and give assistance in this matter of providing employment where it is sadly lacking.  Definite efforts have been made and great progress has been made through the activities of Gaeltarra Éireann, but unfortunately, as in other regards, too much reliance is placed on Government activity and there is very little private initiative in this matter.</P>
      <P>It would be a great step forward if more and more of our industrialists set up suitable factories in places where there is definitely a labour force available, where the people are highly adaptable and have a high degree of intelligence.  This has been proved to be so in cases where they took up jobs not only in this country but abroad.  They have always proved themselves to be outstanding.  I should like to say that I am not terribly happy about some of the moves that have been made since the recent change in Gaeltarra Éireann, particularly in regard to the change from machine-knits because of the change of policy.  People who had machines in their houses, some of them for perhaps up to 20 years, found that when the machines were taken from them, their only hope of further employment was to change over to handknitting and in houses where this had not been the practice, it did cause some hardship.  If the policy is successful then all credit to Gaeltarra Éireann but it has certainly brought some hardship to some families who were not able to make this change as quickly as others.  I would recommend every support for the work of Gaeltarra Éireann and I hope their efforts to expand employment in Gaeltacht areas will be successful in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1967, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain Services administered by that Office; for the Pay and Expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>I will perhaps be permitted to be brief in dealing with this Supplementary Estimate for a sum of £10, seeing that, in the ordinary course of events, the Estimate for Defence for 1967-1968 will be coming before the House in the not too distant future.  I shall then, in accordance with custom, review the events of the financial year now ending and deal to the best of my ability with any points or questions which Deputies may wish to raise. However, I have no desire that whatever discussion may be thought appropriate in connection with this Supplementary Estimate should be curtailed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As will be seen from Part II of the Estimate and the accompanying details, two things in particular have given rise to very substantial expenditure for which no provision was made in the Vote for 1966-1967. <Col N="588" /> These are the tenth round increases in pay and allowances and the continuance of the Cyprus operation. There have been other matters as well, but these are the two principal ones. In all, a gross sum of £635,000 is involved but appropriations-in-aid have exceeded the amount for which the Vote provided by £570,000, and there are savings under other subheads amounting to almost £65,000, so that a token sum of £10 is all that has to be sought.</P>
    <P>The principal item in the sum of £570,000 which represents the excess appropriations-in-aid is £510,000 received from the United Nations in respect of overseas allowances, stores claims and suchlike.  If Deputies so wish, I am in a position to give a breakdown of these receipts, but again I contemplate giving a full up-to-date account of how we stand <i>vis-à-vis</i> the United Nations when presenting the Estimate for 1967-68, and Deputies may be prepared to wait until then.  I may say, in a general way, that our current claims are being met very satisfactorily&mdash;we have, in fact, received a further £151,000 since this Supplementary Estimate was prepared&mdash;and that we are still optimistic about a full refund in respect of allowances paid prior to 26th June, 1965.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Supplementary Estimate and, as such, we must agree to give it to the Minister, but there are a few matters I should like to mention in the House.  Looking at the Estimate, we find that one-fifth of the amount voted is for civilians attached to the various units.  In other words, civilians attached to the Department of Defence cost us one-fifth of the amount which we pay to the Permanent Defence Forces.  It is time we had a fresh look at this question of defence.  There are superfluous civil servants attached to the Department of Defence.  I was too young to take an active interest in this question, but I understand that during the Civil War when the army was at its numerical peak, four quartermasters, four pay officers, paid the entire Army. Whether that be right or wrong, I <Col N="589" /> understand there is some truth in it. Four regular officers of the Army were able to pay the entire Army which was then on active service.</P>
      <P>We have a multiplicity of civil servants attached to the Department of Defence.  First of all, the amounts of the Estimates are gone through with a fine comb by the Army itself.  It requisitions what is absolutely essential. Then again the civil servants attached to the Department go through the Estimates with a fine comb.  Then they are passed on to the Department of Finance which again scrutinises them.  I think that is all overdone.  We should cut out the civil servants in the Department and leave it entirely to the qualified personnel in the Army to prepare their own Estimates and to make their own requisitions direct to the Department.  In doing that, we would save the country considerable sums.</P>
      <P>I often thought that Defence does not warrant a Minister, and that the Departments of Defence and Justice could very well be amalgamated.  After all, both those Departments look after the internal security of the country. If we had a highly mobile striking force in the Army, limited to a certain age group, and if these men when they left the Army could be recruited into the Garda, that would be a considerable saving for the country.  During their time in the Army, they could be trained, as many of them are, in police duties.  We already have a highly efficient military police force, and there is no reason why their training could not be extended to the rest of the Army personnel.  In that way we would have a ready recruiting ground for the Garda in the Army.  In the event of an emergency, these trained men in the Garda could automatically be switched back to the Army as trained NCOs who could train an expanding army.  We would have a very good auxiliary force in the Garda to supplement the Army in case of emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems which worries the personnel of our Army is what they will do when they secure their discharge. We recognise that a soldier to be fit for active service must be comparatively <Col N="590" /> young.  After that, so far as active service is concerned, he is redundant. I understand that there is no pension available for Army personnel, other than long-term serving soldiers. If the Army personnel were aware that the Garda force was available to them, I think we would get an equally good type of recruit in the Army.  Members of the FBI in America become redundant when they reach the age of 32 or 33 years.  They are then automatically absorbed into the State police forces in the various States of the US. They know that when their short term of service in the FBI expires, there is a ready and secure occupation for them in the police forces of the States.  I think our Army would be more content if they knew that when their short period of service had expired, and when they had become efficient and proficient in the use of modern arms, they could automatically be switched to the Garda.</P>
    <P>The standard of our commissioned officers is very high.  It is second to none, in my opinion.  I think our Military College should become a constituent of National University.  The university should be available to our Army personnel to acquire a degree or a profession, as the case may be, to fit them for after life when their short term service has expired.  I understand that in other armies the commissioned ranks are given the opportunity of procuring degrees in whatever faculties they wish, during their term of service.  This is something the Minister might look into to see if the Military College could be made a constituent of the university and to have facilities given to the cadets and commissioned Army personnel to become graduates of, shall I say, one or other of our universities.</P>
    <P>It is very essential that we should have a small but highly trained mobile combat force in this country and that they should be located in some small area, such as the Curragh, where they could devote all their time to combat training.  After all, we do not want a big army but we want a highly efficient mobile, well trained combat force and we would require them situate in some central position, such as the Curragh.</P>
    <P>We have here in the city of Dublin <Col N="591" /> a number of derelict barracks where personnel are engaged doing guard, fatigue and store work.  They have no time for combat training; there is not a sufficient number of them for combat training.  It would be a very good thing if those derelict or unoccupied barracks, barracks in which there is merely caretaker personnel, were handed over to the corporation.  By so doing, we would give the corporation very badly needed parking space in the city of Dublin, space in which multi-storey flats could be built.  At the same time, I do not think we would detract in any way from the efficiency of the Army.  I would close every barracks in the city of Dublin with one exception, McKee.  If we had a small number of highly trained troops stationed in McKee for emergency duty in the city and for ceremonial duties, it would suffice, and thus make valuable sites available to Dublin Corporation, which is crying out for such sites.  It would be a very good thing indeed if those sites could be made available and our troops concentrated in a small area, such as the Curragh, which is highly suitable for such a mobile force.</P>
    <P>I should not allow the occasion to pass without paying tribute to our troops abroad.  We are all very proud of them indeed, and we are all very glad the Minister saw fit to visit them and pay a tribute to them by inspecting them on the spot and telling them how proud the Irish nation are of them.  They deserve the credit and the thanks of the nation, not only for their work in Cyprus, but also for their work in the Congo.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the good work being done by our Equitation School.  I do not notice any mention in the Supplementary Estimate of moneys for the school.  I hope it is not being overlooked, and I hope that, for the sake of a few extra hundred pounds, we are procuring the best animals and training the best personnel. The services of cadets who have some experience in equitation, and who would be an asset to the Equitation School, and to the military jumping team when they enter the service, <Col N="592" /> should be availed of.  A few scholarships or a few reserve positions could be allocated to such men, and it would be a very good thing because, despite the good work Bord Fáilte are doing for the country, our Equitation School is doing equally good work.</P>
    <P>Those are a few thoughts which struck me during the course of considering this Supplementary Estimate, which we will certainly give the Minister but perhaps, between now and whenever he is introducing the Estimate for the coming year, he might consider these matters, which would be of advantage to the nation, which might be of advantage to the corporation but certainly would be of advantage to the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputies want to speak at any great length on matters of defence.  However, during the course of the year, I had occasion to put a question to the Minister for Defence in relation to the relative strength of officers and other ranks. One would think we were almost a country behind the Iron Curtain because the information I sought could not be given for reasons of security.  I am quite sure the information I sought publicly was available to anybody who really wanted to make inquiries.  I raised the question at the time because I was becoming concerned about the continuance of a situation in which there is a relatively small force of other ranks with a high proportion of officers.  One wonders exactly what the officers will engage in in the normal course of their duty.  Will they be busily engaged in athletics or will they get other ranks to act as their bat men? I understand the position in the Curragh is certainly very strange with regard to the buildings and the establishment down there.</P>
      <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell reinforced my own feelings on the matter when he talked about trained personnel leaving the Army to join the Garda, marrying the posts of the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>But a particular point was introduced, which is important, in so far as it is suggested that it would be suited to our circumstances and the circumstances of a police force normally recruited and trained for civilian duties to be integrated, to some extent, with a force recruited and based on military duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise on this Estimate; the Deputy will get an early opportunity of raising these matters on the main Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I really want to explain that I object to that particular approach because we have seen, in certain European countries, where military forces have been used as riot police and I think the Garda are well able to look after their affairs and carry out the duties for which they are responsible.</P>
      <P>On Subhead D. there is reference to An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí £60,000; less savings in respect of non-attendance at annual training, £60,500.  In relation to that particular saving I should like to know if it was brought about because of the discontent among members of the force last year when they discovered they would be asked to go on a week's training only and paid for a week, as against the normal fortnight.  Is this saving a result of the attitude of the Department of Defence which was later corrected after public protest had been made because members of this particular force&mdash;who are purely voluntary&mdash; were being treated in a very shabby manner?  Perhaps the Minister would tell us whether the saving arose for this reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> On the question of civilians employed by the Department of Defence, the Minister might briefly indicate whether these employees are confined to full-time civil servants or do they include unestablished personnel, temporary staff, skilled and unskilled labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this Supplementary Estimate, I am, of course, bound by the rules of order.  Therefore, the only matters I should refer to are those items for which the Supplementary Estimate makes provision.  Deputy P. O'Donnell raised a number of points, some of which are relevant to the Supplementary Estimate and some not.</P>
      <P>On the question of civilians employed with the Army, they mainly comprise tradesmen, labourers and so on.  Many of them are retired Army men, who are appointed by the Minister for Defence whenever possible.  I follow that rule whenever possible: I give these civilian posts to men who have served in the Army, some of whom occasionally take pre-discharge leave in order to make themselves available for such posts.  When one examines the position of civilian employment in the Army, one appreciates that it is a necessary adjunct to the armed forces.  This situation of paid civilian employment as part and parcel of a defence organisation applies to armies all over the world.  It is a practice that I do not propose to depart from.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin raised the matter of pay and conditions of service for those civilian employees.  Their pay and conditions are related to those of State employees as a whole, temporary and part-time.  This is an old question: it has been raised many times in the House and Deputies and trade unions have made representations on it.  These matters have been dealt with during the years by the different Ministers for Defence and have been met as equitably as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> On the question of the recruitment of Army personnel, they are recruited on a different basis from that applying to the Garda Síochána.  A candidate for the Garda has to sit for an examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister being ruled out of order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to show, in reply to a point made by Deputy P. O'Donnell, that different regulations apply to recruitment of Army personnel. On this question I agree with Deputy Larkin and not with Deputy O'Donnell who suggested that a method of strengthening our police force would be to employ ex-Army men.  I do not believe there is any merit in that suggestion; I do not think it would be workable.</P>
      <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell raised the entire question of our Defence Forces throughout the country.  It is a very big question which cannot be dealt with adequately on a Supplementary Estimate. The question depends largely on the amount of money available to the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>A good and efficient Army needs first-class equipment, and so on.</P>
      <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell raised the question of having our Military College as a constituent college of the National University.  One must realise that cadets come into the Army to become military officers.  Whether it would be advisable to encourage military officers to take academic courses in the universities is a matter on which I am not prepared to give an opinion at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell raised the question of the disposal of barracks here in Dublin&mdash;handing them over to Dublin Corporation for purposes such as housing.  This is a big question.  It was referred to last year on the main Estimate, when I said I would have it examined.  That is being done.  However, it needs very thorough and careful <Col N="596" /> consideration.  The question of what payment should be made to the Department or the State in respect of such property is one factor.  Another is the need for the military to hold adequate accommodation in large built-up areas like Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin raised the question of the relative strengths of officers and men.  He has been raising it for some time.  He did it in particular in relation to specific posts throughout the country and wanted information in respect of the different posts.  I refused to give him that information for security reasons.  On the same day the Deputy asked another question &mdash; I am speaking from recollection &mdash; about the total strength of the Army and certain other additional information.  I answered that question fully.  I gave him all the information he asked for on it.  The reply to the first question was fully publicised, but the reply to the second was not.  It apparently did not suit the newspapers to say that the Minister for Defence gave information on the full strength of the Army, but it suited them to say that the Minister refused, for security reasons, to give the strengths at particular posts.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that I was quite right in not giving information about the strength of any particular post, let the post be large or small.  All our barracks are not used for the purpose of training and maintaining combat units. They are used for other purposes, which may require small strengths only. This is no reflection on the administration of the Army.  As to the number of civil servants attached to the Department of Defence, speaking from memory, I think there are about 500.</P>

      <P>The Department of Defence administers the Army Pensions Acts and the Military Service Pensions Acts, involving a great deal of work on matters such as special allowances and so on.  The pay and allowances of <Col N="597" /> the Defence Forces and the administration of the Pension Acts occupy the time of a fair number of civil servants in Coláiste Caoimhghín.  I think the Department is administered with the greatest economy.  There is also Civil Defence.  The number actually engaged in administration, in relation to the Army, is not disproportionate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,107,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1967, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain Services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for Sundry Grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate provides for increased expenditure in all three Sections of the Social Welfare Vote for the current year.  Under the head of Administration &mdash; Subheads A and C &mdash; £203,000 extra is required. <Col N="598" /> Under Social Insurance&mdash;Subheads E and F &mdash; the additional sum sought is £1,068,000.  For Social Assistance&mdash; Subhead I&mdash;the supplementary provision is £166,000.  The gross total comes to £1,437,000, but as there are estimated savings on other Subheads amounting to £217,000 and surplus Appropriations in Aid, estimated at £113,000, the net additional requirement from the Exchequer is £1,107,000.</P>
    <P>Of the £203,000 extra now sought for administration expenses, £194,000 arises on the salaries subhead.  This is required to meet the cost of pay revisions, including the tenth round wage increase, for certain grades, which was not included in the original Estimate. The gross additional amount required is £234,000 but this is partially offset by expected savings of £40,000 on the original provision of £1,726,000. An adjustment of an underclaim by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in the previous year is mainly responsible for the increase of £9,000 under Subhead C&mdash;Post Office Services.</P>
    <P>As regards social insurance, provision is made for increasing the Exchequer contribution to the Social Insurance Fund under Subhead E by £1,063,000 bringing the estimated total for the year to £13,513,000.  As Deputies are aware, provision is made under this subhead for payment into the Social Insurance Fund of the amount by which the expenditure of the Fund exceeds its income in any year.</P>
    <P>The revised expenditure of the Fund in the current year is now estimated at £33,810,000, an increase of £1,106,000 on the original provision.  Revised income is now estimated at £20,159,000, a decrease of £95,000 on the sum originally estimated.</P>
    <P>The main increases in Fund expenditure are in respect of unemployment benefit £643,000, disability benefit £406,000 and administration costs £129,000.  As an offset against these increases, there is an estimated saving on old age (contributory) pensions of £130,000.  On the income side, the decrease is entirely attributable to an expected shortfall of £100,000 in the yield from employment contributions.</P>
    <P>Apart from the variations, as now <Col N="599" /> estimated, in the expenditure and income of the Fund&mdash;and I have just mentioned the main ones &mdash; there is a further factor which must be taken into account in arriving at the revised Exchequer contribution for the current year.  This is the overdraw by the Fund from the Vote in respect of the year ended 31st March, 1966.  As Deputies will readily appreciate, final draws must be made each year on an estimated basis because actual figures for expenditure and income are not available until after the close of the year.  The actual outturn on the Fund for 1965-66 indicated that a sum of approximately £138,000 had been overdrawn from the Exchequer as at 31st March, 1966; accordingly, the revised Exchequer contribution for the current year, as now estimated under Subhead E, is being reduced by that amount.</P>
    <P>As regards social assistance, an increased provision of £166,000 for unemployment assistance is included under Subhead I.  This is almost entirely due to the additional cost of the increase varying from 3/- to 10/- a week, which were granted from 1st November, 1966, to recipients of unemployment assistance under the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1966.</P>
    <P>In the case of the final Subhead&mdash; L. Appropriations in Aid&mdash;the estimated increase of £113,000 in the current year falls under Subdivision I&mdash; Receipt from the Social Insurance Fund under section 40 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  This relates to administration costs incurred by my Department in the operation of the social insurance scheme.  The increase of £113,000 in estimated receipts from the Fund arises out of the recovery of the insurance portion of the additional net expenditure of £196,000 required for the administration subheads A and C.</P>
    <P>I have now covered the principal matters affecting this Supplementary Estimate.  I shall be glad, however, to furnish any further information which Deputies may require.</P>
    <Col N="600" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister ended by saying he would furnish further information if required because the significant thing about the Minister's introductory statement is that he explains some matters and does not explain others.  He will, therefore, forgive me if I furnish the explanations that appear to be reasonable, in the absence of information from the Minister.</P>
      <P>We are informed that the expenditure of the Social Insurance Fund will exceed income in the current year and, accordingly, the State's contribution to the Fund is to be increased by £1,063,000.  We are told that the main increase in the Fund expenditure is in respect of unemployment benefit, £643,000.  From what we see of the unemployment figures, this would appear to be a reflection of the increase in unemployment, something in the region of 6,000 people per week compared with this time last year.  Why has the Minister not stated as much in his statement?  Why has he not been man enough to say that we would, of course, have to pay more unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance because we have 6,000 more people unemployed now than this time last year?  Why has he not been man enough to say that the income of the Fund would be lower because we had 6,000 fewer insurable workers contributing to the Fund compared with this time last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had furnished no explanation at all in relation to any figure in the Supplementary Estimate, we would then say that he did not make a practice of furnishing explanations but we find in the very next paragraph, after failing to give any reason for the increase in unemployment benefit, he then goes to considerable length to explain why £138,000 was being reduced in respect of the Exchequer contribution under Subhead E.  He goes into not a little detail explaining the system of operation under which overdraws by the Fund are made upon estimated figures and it is only after the conclusion of the financial year we know whether the estimate was right or <Col N="601" /> wrong, and if there is a surplus the Exchequer benefits and if enough has not been drawn, the Exchequer loses. Why we must have that explanation of a matter which occurs every year and which is routine and is as simple as adding one and one or subtracting one from two, I do not know.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister has gone to all that trouble in relation to a figure we understand and has avoided giving any explanation in relation to other figures indicates the Minister's embarrassment and the embarrassment of the Government that the increased figure is primarily due to the growing unemployment.  It is not proper that where the Minister is seeking another £1 million he should endeavour to conceal that the real reason for looking for this money is the present sad plight of the economy.</P>
    <P>I should like also an explanation from the Minister as to why there is an estimated saving of £130,00 on old age (contributory) pensions.  Is this due to the earlier demise than anticipated of contributory old age pensioners or is it that a more stringent test is being applied and that a number of people who formerly had these pensions have been declared to be ineligible?  Either of these explanations is possible.  There may be others.  It is a pity the Minister did not explain why there is such a variation of £130,000.</P>
    <P>Again we are told that on the income side the decrease is entirely attributable to an expected shortfall of £100,000 in the yield from employment contributions.  That I take it is a direct reflection of the 6,000 additional unemployed people this year.  Why does the Minister not say so explicitly when he goes to so much trouble to explain other matters in the Estimate?</P>
    <P>So far as money is necessary to provide the life blood of our social services, we in Fine Gael are prepared to vote that money at any time.  We do not think that we, as a society, are providing enough for the less privileged in our community.  Last week, without meaning to reflect at all upon the contributions made to the debate on the Road Traffic Bill, and <Col N="602" /> particularly by my distinguished colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick, I was struck by the interest and emotion that has developed in this House concerning the rights of the individual, the rights of the driver of the motor car.  We can sometimes wax eloquent and indignant about the fundamental rights of individuals, the right of freedom of speech, freedom of choice and the rights to fundamental freedom and the duty the State has not to interfere with these freedoms of the individual but I think we do not concern ourselves sufficiently with the equally important social rights, the fundamental rights of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>We are concerned all right with the ideas that developed in the course of the 18th and 19th centuries when people were creating and moulding political institutions.  Their prime concern was to create institutions which would protect fundamental rights and would allow the fundamental rights of the individual to be respected and to develop.  In this 20th century the democracies which gave life to those political institutions are far ahead of us in recognising the social right, the right which an individual has to command the society of which he is a member to make it possible for him to develop the fundamental rights, not merely to allow them to exist but to promote their actual existence.  That is why I say that the question of the rights of a driver of a motor car to prove his personal integrity are meaningless to people who have not sufficient to keep body and soul together, who have not sufficient to provide them with proper diet, sufficient to provide them with adequate homes, with adequate clothing and with adequate heating, all of which are as fundamental in our society as are the rights of bodily integrity because without these things, we allow society, by economic conditions, to interfere more with the freedom of the individual than the occasional and rare interruption there might be when a police officer might stop a motorist proceeding on his way in order to take a breathaliser test.</P>
    <P>I say these things with the greatest of respect to everyone who contributed to the debate on the Road Traffic Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> I say them in order to emphasise the obligation we all should feel to ensure that in our society the fundamental rights of the individual are respected, not merely in theory, not merely in the abstract, not merely on the rare occasion when there might be excessive use by the executive of executive powers but day in day out by freeing unfortunate individuals from the terrible restrictions which inadequate income and social conditions can inflict upon them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the provision of £166,000 for unemployment assistance included under Subhead I.  He goes on to say that this is almost entirely due to the additional cost of the increases varying from 3/- to 10/- a week, which were granted from 1st November, 1966.  Is the Minister satisfied with action in this regard last year?  These increases were granted at a time when costs of essential commodities had already gone up, and at a time when a few who were in position to secure compensation for increases in commodities had secured this increase. The recipients of social welfare were left lagging behind.  Since that time the cost of living and costs of essential goods have continued to rise.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that this provision which represents a sum of £166,000 was adequate?  I do not think it was and I doubt if any Deputy, or anybody who has knowledge outside the House, would be satisfied in the light of experience that it was.  Is the Minister aware that in the Dublin area, for instance, during the past 12 months there has been a greater call on public bodies &mdash; the local authorities and the various charitable organisations&mdash;for public assistance and for the provision of meals for people who are actually in need of meals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has been that during this last year&mdash;and I think for a second year, at least, in succession &mdash; more of the citizens have had to have recourse to public authorities or to charitable organisations in order to be supplied with a meal once a day.  Of course, this can only be a reflection on the <Col N="604" /> standard of assistance these individuals are given by the State.  Nobody will look for a meal unless he or she is in need of a meal.  Those who have the wherewithal to provide meals for themselves gladly do so, and certainly they do not want to go through the undignified process, in many cases, of begging in order to get a meal to sustain them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan refers to savings, or rather a decrease on the income side, and it is no harm to pinpoint it again. The Minister mentions a shortfall in the yield from unemployment contributions. This as mentioned is a clear indication of the Government's failure to deal with the economic problems of the country.  If in this year to March, 1967, we have a situation that because of increased unemployment there are fewer workers in work and fewer stamps being stamped, then the economic situation, so far as work is concerned, is becoming parlous indeed. The lack of effort on the part of the Government in this regard can be the only thing responsible for the present situation.</P>
    <P>The phrase used by the Minister is a nice one &mdash; a shortfall of £100,000 in the yield from unemployment contributions. Of course that phrase means that there are so many people&mdash;I think Deputy Ryan mentioned 6,000&mdash;fewer in a position to pay their contributions. There are 6,000 more signing on to draw benefit, looking for assistance or considering again whether their only hope of employment is outside this country.  That is what is covered by this simple phrase.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure what is meant by paragraph 2 of the Minister's statement:</P>
    <P>The gross additional amount required is £234,000 but this is partially offset by expected savings of £40,000 on the original provision of £1,726,000.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would say if that was in respect of savings or is it purely that expenditure included in the Estimate has not been realised.  What is the explanation here?</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party have always <Col N="605" /> supported the provision of the necessary finance for social welfare purposes. We have done so even at times when, to provide the finance to assist the less well off citizens in the community and those in need of assistance, we were faced with increased taxation, if that were necessary, to provide the money. We again support this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I should like to say, in conclusion, that the underestimation, if I might describe it as such, shown in the earlier Estimate of the Department of Social Welfare arises to a great extent because the Minister in introducing his Estimate originally failed to give sufficient attention to the needs of those who required assistance from the State.</P>

      <P>There is not very much further I have to add to what I have already said in relation to this Supplementary Estimate, which is increased by my Department each year.  It is necessarily impossible to produce an actual Estimate, and I think the Supplementary Estimate which falls at this time is an annual occurrence which is inevitable.  I do not think I am called on to give any explanation of the very detailed figures I have already given under the different subheads of the Vote.  One must be particularly aware that at this time of year in dealing with these things, we are coming dangerously near Budget time and all sorts of political capital is usually made out of expectations and what should be done.</P>

      <P>I am very satisfied that the two speakers on the Supplementary Estimate did not press the debate unduly in that direction.  I know that this Estimate, above all others, is one on which people can be faced with temptations to make political capital. One must always face the fact that it is easy to arouse sympathy for the less well off, the infirm, the aged and the unemployed.  No matter what amount is given to them, they will always be a subject for the arousing of sympathy by people who wish to do that.  I am not saying that the Deputies opposite overplayed their hand in doing that: I shall not delve into it now.</P>
      <P>New payments came into effect on 1st November last under the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1966, and this necessarily entailed a Supplementary Estimate before the end of 1967.  That is the main reason we are here tonight with this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
