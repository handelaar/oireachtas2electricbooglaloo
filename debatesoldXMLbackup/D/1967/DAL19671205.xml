      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Estimate for the Department of Finance has been availed of to provide the House with an opportunity to discuss the devaluation of the pound sterling which took place a short time ago.  Following the devaluation of the pound sterling by the British Government, our Minister for Finance announced, practically simultaneously, that his Government had decided to follow the decision of the British Government and to devalue the pound sterling to the same extent.  It appears that the Government have no alternative but to take this step.  That decision, followed by the state of affairs which has been highlighted by the foot and mouth disease in England, clearly points out how closely associated our economy is with the British economy. It clearly demonstrates that our economy and the British market and the British economy are interdependent.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has spoken of what a catastrophe it would be if the foot and mouth disease were to strike this country. Television and other advertisements point out clearly that the cattle industry is our principal industry and that were it to suffer an attack of foot and mouth disease, it would put back this country several years.  I do not propose to indulge in a historical survey or to speak on those lines further than I think necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good thing that the Government at least now realise how important agriculture is to this country, and, in particular, our cattle industry.  I say that because I can clearly recollect a period in our history, not so very long ago, when the Fianna Fáil Party and some of the present members of the Fianna Fáil Government preached throughout this country that we could carry on independent of the British market.  As a young boy on an Irish farm, I remember distinctly listening to speeches by some members of the Government such as Deputy Aiken, Deputy MacEntee and others who at that time were trying to create a public opinion in this country, which suggested that it was a crime to own ten or 11 cattle.  I distinctly remember the speeches of those Ministers who tried <Col N="1240" /> to create the feeling that there was something dishonourable in owning cattle, in having ten or 11 bullocks&mdash;&ldquo;the land for the people and the road for the bullocks.&rdquo;  I do not want to go on on that line beyond saying that I think it cost this country's economy a great deal of money.  Were it not for that silly policy advocated by Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Aiken, Deputy S. Lemass and other senior members of Fianna Fáil, this country would now be in a much better economic position.</P>
    <P>I am convinced, as much as I can be convinced about anything, that when the Second World War came along in 1939, if instead of having an agricultural economy here in a state of chaos, with farmers impoverished, the land derelict and not carrying anything like the stocks of cattle it should have been carrying, as a result of Fianna Fáil policy over ten years, we had had a healthy agricultural community, land that was rich and producing as much as it should, land well stocked with cattle, this country would have been in a position to reap a rich harvest during the years of the Second World War.  We would have been able to put the farmers on their feet and the economy generally on its feet.  The present Fianna Fáil Party and the Governments of that Party who ran the country, down through the years, have a good deal to answer for, but at least it is refreshing that after all these years, they do accept the fundamental truth preached by this Party from 1922 on, that the backbone of the economy of the country is the agricultural industry and that the backbone of that industry is production of cattle, as has been proved beyond yea or nay over past years.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what proposals the Government have to offset some of the disadvantages devaluation will bring.  I am told that the cost of house building will increase directly as a result of devaluation.  Can the Minister give any assurance that the Government will do something to offset that?  Since the standard grant for private houses was fixed at £275 in 1948, the Government, by taxation, have reduced the effective value of that grant to about £150 by the turnover <Col N="1241" /> tax and wholesale tax.  That reduced grant will be further attacked and reduced in value by devaluation.  I hope the Government will do something to offset that.</P>
    <P>The cost of living will definitely go up as a result of devaluation.  There is not much use in the Minister telling the House and country that the increase will not exceed two per cent because those who have given the matter considerable thought believe that it will increase by approximately four per cent.  The Minister may say that there was devaluation in 1949 but he should remember that there were food subsidies in operation then and as a result the increase in the cost of living was cushioned and controlled.  There are no food subsidies now.  On the contrary, we have since had a direct tax on food and on the necessaries of life and the cost of living has been increased by the turnover tax and the wholesale tax.  Has the Minister any proposals to deal effectively with the altered situation compared with 1949 when the cost of living was controlled through food subsidies which the Minister's predecessors or seniors undertook not to remove but which we know they did remove?  That is the altered situation and I should like to know what the Minister proposes to do about it.</P>
    <P>The cost of living will be increased by increases in various commodities and the increased cost of fuel for transport of these commodities.  If the cost of living is to be kept under control, the Government must immediately reduce taxation.  In fact it is thought that taxation could and should have been reduced before now.</P>
    <P>In this debate there has been considerable discussion about the &ldquo;Save the West&rdquo; campaign.  I come from a constituency which is very often allowed to fall between two stools. Cavan constituency is not regarded for all purposes as being one of the western counties.  I know it is included in one of the 12 western counties but for the purposes of various sections of the Land Act, 1965, it is not regarded as being in the West.  It is not regarded as one of the congested counties.  As a result, Cavan is suffering.  Here and <Col N="1242" /> now I want to make a special appeal for Cavan constituency.  It is a county and constituency that deserves and should get special treatment.  Its population is declining rapidly.  We are at the stage when, according to a report from consultant town planners, the death rate is about to exceed the birth rate.  If that happens, as is forecast by these consultants, then even if emigration were totally arrested&mdash;and we have very considerable emigration from Cavan&mdash;the population will continue to decline, and decline drastically over the next number of years.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about drainage in Cavan.  The principal river affecting the county is the Erne, and the local representatives in the county have been agitating for a number of years to have it drained.  We were told that until Lough Erne and the part of the Erne in Northern Ireland have been drained, nothing could be done about it.  The Northern authorities have now drained their portion of the Erne and, notwithstanding that, nothing at all is being done about the drainage of the River Erne in Cavan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A discussion on drainage would not be relevant on the Department's Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am making the point that, like the other western counties, the county of Cavan is in need of special treatment, and I am seeking to point out to the Minister in this economic debate that the Government have fallen down in their treatment of Cavan and what is necessary to be done.  I do not intend, Sir, to attempt to go into a detailed debate on drainage or on some other matters I have to mention.  As I say, the county badly needs drainage and the Government have done nothing about it, and, as far as we can see, there is no hope of their doing anything in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a Government spend money on a large scale in subsidising industry, they should see to it that that money is well spent, that the industry is properly vetted, and that the money which is to be put into it provides employment. I speak about an industry in Cavan town which we all welcomed <Col N="1243" /> and which we all hoped would provide much wanted employment in the town and, indeed, we welcomed the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, down to Cavan about three years ago to open this undertaking.  There is £176,000 of public money in this factory and there are at present 11 people employed in it.  You can count them on the fingers of your two hands plus one, and there never were more than about 35 people employed in it.</P>
    <P>Whether or not this was a Common Market mishap, or an industry built in anticipation of entry into the Common Market on 1st January, 1964, I do not know, but I can tell the House this, that it is a source of great disappointment to find that £176,000, approximately, has been allocated for this factory, of which £150,000 has been drawn, and yet there are only 11 people employed in it at the present time.  This is a disgrace and a waste of public money.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there were any loans or other assistance given to it or not, but I do ask that if the Government have not sufficient control over undertakings like this which benefit so much out of public money they will see to it that proper employment is given and if proper employment is not given, that the buildings, <i>et cetera</i>, will be made available to other undertakings who are prepared to give employment. If they have not got that authority and if that condition does not apply to this grant, then the sooner it applies the better.  I think any Deputy will agree with me that the spending of £170,000 of public money for the provision of 11 jobs of an uncertain nature is something that cannot be justified and something that should be deplored.</P>
    <P>I wonder was this undertaking properly investigated before the Government sanctioned the grant of £176,000.  I am not against industry, I am for industry.  I am for industry in rural Ireland.  Cavan badly needs worthwhile industry that will give a return for the money spent in it in the provision of employment, but there is an obligation on the Government and <Col N="1244" /> these semi-State bodies to make sure that before they encourage an industry to be started and public money to be spent on it, it is worthwhile and has a reasonable chance of getting off the ground and providing employment. This undertaking never got off the ground and never looked like getting off the ground.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is under a misunderstanding if he thinks this is a general economic debate.  The debate is confined to the Minister's Estimates and to devaluation. The questions of industry and agriculture do not relevantly arise in the debate on this Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am sure the Minister provided the money for the industry I am talking about, because it did not come out of the sky, and I think that the Minister, as the Minister in charge of grants, is providing the money for such undertakings. I am suggesting to him that he should have seen to it that he and the country got better value from the money invested in this.  It is not fair to a county like Cavan in need of help that it should be helped in this way, because a failure does harm.  It discourages other industrialists from coming.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Well, the Minister provides the money. At any rate I have made the point and I hope it has got home that the Minister and the Government are expected to see that this money that has been given to this undertaking in Cavan produces some employment.  That is all I want to say about that.</P>
      <P>We were glad to see the pilot areas in Cavan have been extended.  We have got two other pilot areas.  We welcome them; we are thankful for them but indeed I think the whole county should be treated as a pilot area.  We hope that these two instalments are an indication that the entire county will be treated as a pilot area.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other matters concerning rural Ireland in general and Cavan in particular that I would like to deal with but I quite concede, Sir, that they would probably be out of order in this debate and I shall have an opportunity of dealing with them on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government later on.  I leave it therefore at that, that I think the county of Cavan deserves special treatment with, of course, the other neighbouring counties and I appeal to the Minister to take steps to see that his devaluation of the Irish pound will not put the cost of house building beyond the capacity of the people to bear and that it will not put the cost of living beyond the capacity of the people.</P>

      <P>A good House.</P>
      <P>In the course of the discussion which followed the announcement of devaluation in Britain, somebody&mdash;I forget who it was&mdash;said that Wilson had devalued the Englishman's word or something to that effect.  This is devaluation of the Irish nation which we are at here this morning.  Painful though it is to me and to Deputy Corry, Deputy P.J. Burke, Deputy Browne and other patriarchs with whom this House abounds, painful though it will be to all of us, collectively and individually, I am going to bring their minds back to other and more idealistic days.</P>
      <P>The whole reason for their existence could be said to be based on the proposition: &ldquo;Break the connection with England, the never-failing source of all our evils.&rdquo;  I do not know how many Fianna Fáil Deputies will recognise the source of that.  I am sure that well-known savant, Deputy Corry, will, because it comes from the writings of the father of Irish republicanism, Theobald Wolfe Tone: &ldquo;Break the connection with England, the never-failing source of all our evils.&rdquo;  I have no doubt whatever in my mind that when Deputy Corry raided his last police barracks in 1927, some few months before he came into Dáil Éireann, he did so from a position of principle; that he accepted that Fianna Fáil meant what they were saying; that they were going, in fact, to break the connection with England and that they were only taking an oath to abolish an oath, a little bit of a jig but nevertheless securing the end result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we find?  We find this ancient and indeed, to his credit, this worthy warrior now trooping in with the rest of them giving his unqualified support to the sustenance and the maintenance of the last tottering <Col N="1247" /> pillar of the British Empire.  Who would have thought it some 40 years ago?  Nonetheless, here we are faced with the situation that Britain having devalued, <i>ergo</i> we must devalue.  Not alone do we devalue or must we devalue with Britain but our watches must be synchronised to the very second.  It was not that we were let know an hour later or the day after but by some extraordinary alchemy of communication, we were all sitting peacefully and no doubt wearily around our firesides when suddenly we were confronted with the not unpleasant though familiar visage of the Minister telling us that a few seconds before Britain had devalued and therefore we would do so.  The arguments were trotted out with all the facility of mind for which he is noted.  You cannot get away, do you see, from first principles, no matter how hard you try and if you erect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Probably recognising the signs of distance.  If you erect a structure from certain foundations and certain propositions whether it is a physical structure, Euclidean or logical or what have you, inevitably if the foundations are found to be false, the structure collapses and in this structure to which I refer, the Fianna Fáil Party, the whole concept on which it was based, built and thrust upon the vision of the Irish and shoved down the throats of the Irish&mdash;I once heard a man saying &ldquo;Could I inveigle a half-one down your throat?&rdquo;&mdash;it was inveigled in that sense down the throats of many of the Irish.  However, I wonder how it feels; how does Deputy Corry feel?  It is very hard to get a response from him this morning. How does he feel in these circumstances?</P>

      <P>Devil a bit.  I have a deep and abiding concern for Deputy Corry and his conscience.  No doubt at a later stage, now that Deputy <Col N="1248" /> P.J. Burke has departed, as he is next in line, perhaps Deputy Corry will tell us how it has hurt him to his national and republican quick.</P>
      <P>It is true, quite apart from anything light which might be said in the House concerning this situation, that to people of my age and generation who came to the use of what knowledge there was lying behind that which I shall not call the use of reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I doubt if any Deputy who crosses the threshold of this House can be said to have reached the use of reason, and, for Deputy Corry, I say that there is a certain inherent foolishness attached to taking up public service unless one is already so well provided with the goods of the world that it does not matter.  But, for people of my generation who listened at the impressionable age&mdash;I am talking about the late 20s and early 30s&mdash; to the professions of the Fianna Fáil Party who now constitute the Government and to their claims that what could be done by a native Government acting with complete independence from England, relying first, last and all the time on our own economic strength, you would not want to have blood in you at all not to be stirred by it.  Even in the long, hard days of what was called the Economic War when the wading was done not through the blood of brothers but through the blood of cattle and calves, we know that changed.  The people were sustained by this concept which had first been promoted by Griffith, and those who helped him, that we had sufficient in this green and pleasant land without relying on any outside source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of it all, and this is the puzzling thing to people of my age and generation, when we look back and consider how worthy men, men with whom I would not find myself in political agreement in a thousand years &mdash;not that that has any significance&mdash; were blackguarded and hounded and their characters torn to ribbons because they enunciated the policy that is now being followed by the Fianna <Col N="1249" /> Fáil Party, a policy which in fact ends up now in devaluation, that advocacy of this policy was at one with treachery of the deepest and vilest kind, how can politicians claim to be integrated as the Fianna Fáil Party do in that situation?  They have done no more than pre-empt the pro-Treatyites' position of 30 or 40 years ago all the time.</P>
    <P>We are back, as I say, wondering what was it all about.  The most worrying thing about devaluation or anything that occurs in the British economy and which, in turn, provokes this kind of financial reaction is the effect it will have on employment in this country.  As far as I and the Labour Party are concerned, we have to examine devaluation from one principal aspect primarily, that is, to find out will it mean more or less employment. It cannot mean more as far as one can judge except in a sense to which I will come in a moment.  Will it mean an increased cost of living in so far as it is a reduction in purchasing power, as it must be, of the value of the pound?  It must mean an increase in the cost of living.  Had we any alternative but to follow after Britain, to trot along like a docile, toothless, somewhat decrepit pensioned Irish terrier, long past his best days, in the trail of the British bulldog, also not in his first health and strength?  Had we any alternative but to trot behind the bulldog?</P>
    <P>Not having had the benefit of a classical education, not knowing much more about economics than one picks up from the table of life or from having met the scholars from school, it would be difficult for me to give a theoretical economist's answer to that question. But it would appear to me that we had little choice but to follow Britain and to do as she has done in the matter of devaluation.  It could, of course, be argued that it is only a fractional devaluation and it has been justifiably said that it is a tribute to Mr. Wilson, and indeed Mr. Callaghan and the present British socialist Government, that they seem to be in a position to bring the British economy into some kind of equilibrium by so fractional a move as this.</P>
    <P>We remember looking back to the last devaluation.  It represented a far <Col N="1250" /> more serious alternation in the position of the pound, both nationally and internationally, so that this was nothing like a revolutionary financial convulsion. To that extent it could be said it should not of itself produce an intolerable or indeed any substantial increase in the cost of living.  But let me forecast this, or to put it more fashionably, let me make this projection: the first time we have any sign of difficulty of a wide nature in the economic field, we will be told by this Government that it is due to the fractional devaluation which has occurred in England.  The moment it suits the Government to try to brush it lightly aside and describe it as something of little or no consequence, it is put on the shelf for future use, just as world crises have been brought into play by the Fianna Fáil Party, with no little skill but with absolute lack of conscience, in order to buttress their political position.</P>
    <P>It is well I remember ten years ago when every country in the world was struck by a financial onslaught, much worse than the present one which afflicts Britain.  Then, deflationary methods were being applied to every economy we know of, including this one here; but because there happened to be in power an inter-Party Government, the Fianna Fáil propaganda machine successfully persuaded the Irish people that that world crisis was the work of the inter-Party Government, that the fact that there was unemployment, that there was international recession, that there was credit restriction on a scale which had not been known for many years, was due not alone to the ineptitude of the inter-Party Government, but it was suggested, if not stated, that it was due to the downright deliberate treachery of that Government whose intention it was to disrupt and destroy the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>That was the picture painted then. We do not get it now.  During the past 18 months or two years, we had credit restriction here in a far more obvious and far more damaging form than we had it ten years ago.  We had the banks refusing money at the direct instance, it might be said, of the Government <Col N="1251" /> on the advice of the Central Bank.  It was deliberate Government policy to reduce the availability of money and to restrict credit.  In that situation, however, the Fianna Fáil propaganda machine did a successful about turn and proved to their own satisfaction, and apparently to the satisfaction of some people at byelections, that it was a world problem that had caused it and not any conscious act of the Government.</P>
    <P>What lessons are to be drawn from all this?  One lesson certainly may be drawn from the Fianna Fáil about-face from diehard republicanism to true blue 100 per cent unionism and conservatism&mdash;from their execution successfully of a somersault in the matter of presenting the economic facts to the people: they blame world recession on the Government only if it is not a Fianna Fáil Government; and when Fianna Fáil blunder, they blame it on world recession.  One thing that must be said for them is that they are extremely successful as political acrobats. However, this success is transient.  It cannot last forever, though I am sure some Fianna Fáil members live in the euphoric dream that it will last forever. It will not.  We are coming nearer and nearer to the time when people will say to themselves: &ldquo;What are we doing?  What are we letting them get away with?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mention has been made here of the effect of devaluation on housing.  I have seldom intervened in a debate when opportunity offered to mention housing that I did not mention it, and I cannot resist the temptation now because I wish to bring home to the House one fact about housing, and I hope it will be understood outside the House.  It will be understood certainly by house purchasers.  Because it is related to devaluation, it will be in order to mention it.  Previous speakers made the point that there has been no increase in the grant given to persons building their own houses.  The present grant of £275, the grant allegedly made available for house builders, has not been increased in a very long period.</P>
    <P>Speeches have been made urging the Minister for Finance to take steps to <Col N="1252" /> get the Minister for Local Government to increase this grant.  I should like to say to the Minister for Finance that before he does anything of the kind, he should cause a public inquiry to be made into the question of where the £275 goes now because the applicant for the house, the person who is trying to build his own house, never sees a halfpenny of that £275.  I can produce here in Dáil Éireann, if I have to, building contracts which have in them a clause providing that the grant which is supposed to go to the house purchaser goes directly from the Department into the pocket of the builder and the house purchaser never sees hair or hide of it.</P>

      <P>The point was made during the debate that all Government payments are reduced in their worth by reason of devaluation and the point was also made that this particular grant, a very important and vital matter, should be increased to make up for the loss it suffers by reason of devaluation. The point I am making is that it is all one to the house purchaser whether it is increased because it is the builder who gets the grant: the purchaser never sees it.  It goes directly from the Department to the builder.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as devaluing, a very serious step was taken by the Government in increasing the bank rate.  Whatever arguments may be adduced in support of this step, the effect of it is to impose on borrowers, that is to say, small business people, shopkeepers, publicans, small companies trying to run factories or anybody who has to <Col N="1253" /> depend on bank credit for his business, and that means I suppose 80 per cent of commercial interests in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the lucky one who would be able to persuade a bank manager that he is a good proposition. For all those small business people, the bank rate is of vital importance because in their plans many of them who borrowed last year a certain amount of money with which to extend their premises, to expand their business, employ more people, buy more stock, or whatever they want, will have estimated the cost of what this is likely to be.  They will have estimated what it will cost them to meet competition in a more competitive world.  We know it is becoming more competitive, particularly with the growth of supermarkets.  Now we have the bank rate going up without any prior warning.  This means a big additional impost on the kind of persons to whom I refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a meaningless exercise to be talking about expansion of industry or expansion of commercial activity on the one hand, and on the other, making it more difficult for people to carry on, to meet their existing commitments, by making the obtaining of further money to improve their business more difficult still.  As I say, we know the arguments advanced for the increase in the bank rate.  The simple one is that if we did not increase the bank rate here there was a likelihood of large scale withdrawals of money in Britain and deposits here.  That, to my mind, is a likely tale.  I do not believe that would occur in any sort of a proportion that would mean a real problem to England. I would like the Minister to say in his reply, in answer to this, did we get any request from Britain that the bank rate here should be increased coincidental with devaluation?  Did this come up at all or was it purely voluntary to show how closely we are knit now with the Union Jack?  It seems to me to be an unnecessary exercise but the most worrying part of it, and this has been represented to <Col N="1254" /> me by people in business as a worrying thing, and one which would give them great cause for concern, is that their whole prospects in the matter of trade, their commitments, their debt and so on, have been thrown out of focus by reason of the fact that they have now got to pay 1¼ per cent more for money than they originally contracted to pay.</P>
    <P>It is not a very fair way of carrying on.  What steps can the Minister take to redress that injustice?  I would suggest to him that the best thing he can do in that situation, where there is definite evidence of financial hardship, and indeed where the employment of workers may be put in question by the increase in the bank rate, is to see at Budget time what can be done to relieve such people in the matter of tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement referred to decentralisation, so I assume that I am in order in referring to it as well. I do not want to roam over the whole conspectus of the Irish economic scene any more than the Chair will encourage me to do.</P>

      <P>It would be a right place for a meeting.  Last night I was at a very important function and it occurred to me to mention the fact that I read in the Sunday papers that General Franco has decreed that there must be a reduction in the siesta hour in Spain, from three hours to two hours, for civil servants.  I am not saying that there is any significance in this for Irish civil servants.  Far be it from me to make any such suggestion but it is a well-known fact that the west of <Col N="1255" /> Ireland has a very soporific influence so that many of you sleep far fresher than those of us on this side of the country.  It is also alleged that there is a great deal of Spanish blood there which dates from the Spanish Armada. Deputy Burke might turn his mind to this and take up the matter when he is in the running.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation is to be theoretically welcomed but there is another side to it.  There is the position of people who have worked in Dublin all their lives, who have their families here, whose children are being educated here and who have houses here.  One must look at the question of whether it is socially just to uproot such people and bring them down to the west of Ireland, albeit that some of them would be doing no more than going home.  Still, home is where you spend most of your life, and many of them have their homes here.  That is why Deputy Corry never feels at home until he is in here. A lot of them, I am sure, would be very distressed by such a move if it were imposed on them.  I should like the Minister to say definitely in his reply that while he is going to pursue the concept of decentralisation, with which none of us would disagree as far as it is practicable, he will give a definite assurance that no civil servant with a family who has been long resident in the city will be uprooted, required to sell his house and go down to start life anew in the west of Ireland, pleasant though it is there and inhabited, as we know, by very kind, nice and dear people.  In spite of all the amenities over there, there is still a lot to be said for this old city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of the cattle industry. I do not know whether it is properly relevant to this debate.  If the Chair will permit me, I should like to say it is of great importance to us. It is also affected by devaluation and even more seriously now by foot and mouth.  If we are to think seriously of going into Europe within the next decade&mdash;that is as near as it can be put&mdash; we will also have to consider seriously that our cattle industry may at some stage face fierce competition.  We must develop alternatives for the purpose of <Col N="1256" /> creating a favourable trade balance.  So many things are changing so rapidly today that we can easily find that many of the things out of which we have lived up to now, such as cattle, may need to be replaced by some other products.  This matter of change, which most of us sought so urgently for most of our lives, has suddenly come upon us with an astonishing rapidity.  It can be seen no place more clearly than on television, and is indeed to be heard in the views expressed on television from the most amazing quarters.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset how devaluation can affect us as far as employment is concerned, but in a remote way.  The reason given for devaluation in Britain is that they want to establish an export-led boom.  The economists tell us, for what it is worth, that this means expansion and expansion means more employment.  If it means more employment for Britain's workers, it must certainly mean more employment for Irish workers.  To that extent it will affect us as far as the earnings of our people in Britain are concerned. Recently I saw on the &ldquo;24 Hours&rdquo; programme on BBC television a group of workers, including two Irishmen, being interviewed.  I was struck by a fact which underlined the degree of change which has occurred in England over the past 25 or 30 years.  One of the Irishmen interviewed was a carpenter and the other a bricklayer.  One was asked was he working and he replied that he was unemployed.  This was in Birmingham or Manchester.  He was asked could he get work and he said he could.  He was asked at what wages and he said at £18 or £20 a week.  He added: &ldquo;That is no good to me; I am used to getting £35 a week.&rdquo;  This struck me as illustrating more clearly than anything else what is meant today by unemployment in England and what was meant when we were young in the thirties.  At that time unemployment meant absolute hunger, that no matter where you went, you could not get a job, even at 25/- a week.  But as a result of the efforts of socialist Governments in Britain and as a result of the tremendous upsurge in the power of the workers there, unemployment today <Col N="1257" /> means not the dire conditions and semi-starvation of the thirties, but the lack of the opportunity to be selective and the lack of a job at the rate at which you want to work.</P>
    <P>How far are we away from that? Devaluation certainly does not help us towards it.  We are not anywhere near full employment even at inadequate wages.  We will not be until this country and the workers get wise to themselves and take over the Government in the same democratic sense as the workers did in Britain.  No matter what attacks may be made on the present British Government, the thought of a conservative administration in power there would be simply appalling.  We have a conservative administration here.  Indeed, it strikes me that we have worse.  We have an administration that does not even conserve but lets things drift on.  I understand the phrase is <i>laissez faire</i>&mdash;do not give a damn.  Everything is going all right for the moment, so do not do anything about it.  Even the conservatives claim that they tried their best to maintain what is good.  We know their conception of what is good and that is where we disagree with them.</P>

      <P>I will try, Sir, and thank you for your guidance.  I am sure you understand one can easily stray from the central matter of discourse here.  As well as devaluation, we are dealing with the Minister's Estimate. You will agree that at the best of times it is a difficult Estimate to deal with.  In the light of the fact that in the heel of the hunt it is on the desk of the Minister for Finance that the bills for all the Government's activities will land, some slight indulgence might be given to those of us who want to touch upon other matters.  However, there will be another opportunity next week, please God, for us to go into the whole performance of this Government in greater detail, I hope, on the Taoiseach's Estimate.  I must confess I have nothing further to offer at this stage.</P>

      <P>This is the first time I have been called by the new Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I wish him luck and I hope he will carry on for many years.  This morning was a bit of a revelation in the House.  I listened very carefully to the two speakers.  I am always a student, always anxious to learn something.  I thought this morning that I would hear something original, but Deputy Fitzpatrick went back to the days of the Economic War and blamed the Government for everything that happened then.  He forgot to tell us that we did not start the Economic War.  Britain started the Economic War, but I will not follow him on that.</P>
      <P>He also said we were not concerned about the farmers, but the farmers were getting very little when Deputy Fitzpatrick's Party left office in 1932. In 1957, the farmers and the workers of Ireland were getting less from that Party.  Yet Deputy Fitzpatrick says that we are not concerned about the farmers, good, bad or indifferent.  I have often said that we are concerned with the wellbeing of every section of the people, irrespective of class or creed.  It is the aim of the Government and this Party to concern ourselves with everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very happy to congratulate the Minister on doing a very good job with the housekeeping of this State since the became Minister.  He has succeeded in righting our balance of payments. This is most essential for any country.  If our socialist friends on the left have anything to offer as a shortcut to prosperity.  I should be anxious to hear it.  The only way to prosperity so far as I can see is the policy adopted by the Government on the advice of their financial advisers in the Department of Finance, and others. Prosperity can be brought about in one way only, and that is the way we are doing it.  This has been tried and proven in other countries which have enjoyed their freedom for 1,000 years It is all right to hear all this claptrap that we are slipping away and not doing this, that or the other but we are doing the things the Irish people want us to do.  This is a responsible Government. <Col N="1259" /> We are trying to increase production.</P>
    <P>We have succeeded in giving almost £70 million to our main industry, agriculture, directly and indirectly.  Yet the Opposition say we are doing nothing and that we are not concerned with the farmers.  The sowing of the seeds of illwill by some members of the Opposition&mdash;I do not wish to mention any names&mdash;during the recent national dispute was most discreditable.  I hope they will examine their consciences as to whether they are helping the people who put them here, and are representing them properly.</P>
    <P>On all sides of the House we have a number of Deputies of goodwill, men who are not anxious to create illwill or do anything to upset the economy.  I am sorry the Minister is not getting the co-operation from all Deputies which he should get in the national interest. We have to be political here.  We have to consider the political and economic philosophy of our own Parties.  I have seen men in this House who put the overall national issues before personal politics.  They have been in this House for a long time and they will be in the House for a long time, but there are also some people who try to score a political victory during some crisis started by some pressure group.  I have no regard for that type of representation.</P>

      <P>Any money that was left over was distributed among the weaker sections of the community, and used also to build up our production and industry generally.  I have yet to be convinced that there is any <Col N="1260" /> other way to prosperity.  May I claim the indulgence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who is a very gracious gentleman, to say that the countries that claim to be socialist and the countries that claim to be communist have found that their philosophy was a cod, because they have not succeeded in doing what they believed could be done.  Our economic philosophy has succeeded in doing what we have done for our own people.  This State has to depend on its own resources and on the resources of the people as a whole.  The Minister, his predecessor and this Party as a whole believe in the philosophy of increasing production to bring about an equilibrium in our balance of payments situation, and when there is a surplus, giving it out for social services, housing, roads, health services, hospitalisation, schools and increases in old age and widows' and orphans' pensions.  We hope to continue in that way, which is the only way.</P>
      <P>We have heard a good deal about devaluation in this debate.  It did not make two hoots of a difference whether we had our own financial system or not, when our next door neighbour with whom we have been trading as a free and equal country devalued, we had also to devalue from a bargaining and trading point of view, as had other countries that had trading relations with Great Britain.</P>
      <P>People may say that we are tied hand and foot to Britain.  We are tied as equals.  We are trading as free, independent, and equal partners.  Surely the Gospel of 2,000 years is good today? We have been taught that our neighbour is all mankind of every description, without any exception of persons, even those who injure us or differ from us in religion.  Nobody can do without his neighbour.  The same applies to countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of play was made about things that happened in the past.  None of us would like to reveal his past, individually or collectively.  He who never made a mistake never made anything. Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke of investment in factories and so on.  We encouraged industries.  If we have made <Col N="1261" /> mistakes, at least, that is better than not to have tried to do something for the country.  We have succeeded in industrialisation to a considerable degree.  If we had said, do not give a grant to John Murphy or to Paddy Swan, do not subsidise industry, there would be no industrial production in this country today.  We had to take chances and the chances we did take have paid the country well.</P>

      <P>I am naturally a man of great charity and hate to refer to these things, but when one hears members of the Opposition suggesting that they have the cure for all our economic ills, one must refer to the fact that they were in office for six years and not one constructive thing was done from the economic point of view during that period.  The policy at that time was to carry on and to let the devil take the hindmost.  We have changed that policy.  We have a policy. We are not living on some little crisis or other, as the Opposition do, putting down questions in an effort to embarrass Ministers at the behest of certain pressure groups outside.</P>
      <P>The Minister should continue along the lines he has adopted and I want to tell him that the nation is greateful to him.  He has been a good captain of the ship and posterity will regard him as amongst our greatest.  Thank you very much.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke should remind himself, if reminder is necessary, that economists are not to be found advising a Government or any one political Party.  Economists advise wherever their advice is sought. I have the greatest respect for the advice of economists.  Economists are qualified to diagnose economic ills and to prescribe remedies.  Their advice is usually sound in relation to matters of proper management and good national housekeeping.  However, in my experience, economists are the world's worst politicians.  The advice they give is based on sound economics.  There is not a very close relationship between sound economics and good, sound politics.  The production of a political policy should be a job for politicians. A politician who acts on the advice of economists may be doing the right thing from the point of view of good housekeeping, but his action may be disastrous from a political point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" /> Great tributes have been paid by Deputy Burke and others to the Minister for Finance.  The Minister must realise that criticism of him in the discharge of his duties as Minister for Finance is not of a personal nature. We are not criticising the individual: we are criticising the office he holds. We are criticising the Government of which he is a member.  It makes me smile to hear Deputies like Deputy Burke appealing for unity, co-operation and support for the Minister.  It is the duty of an Opposition to oppose. It is the duty of an Opposition to make constructive criticism in an effort to mould the Government into thinking along constructive lines.  Members of the Fianna Fáil Party ask Opposition Deputies what they would do, how they would do it and what means they would adopt.  The fact is that is not the job of an Opposition.  It is the Government who have the responsibility, the very serious responsibility indeed, of steering the country along an economically sound path.  It is not the duty of the Opposition to advise the Government; it is their duty to show the Government where they may be on the wrong track.</P>
    <P>That brings me now to the devaluation of the pound.  I cannot understand how the Minister could state that the devalued pound would have a lower purchasing power, and, at the same time, assure us that nobody need worry.  Surely the fact that the pound will purchase less is a cause for worry. The Minister seems to be taking this whole question of devaluation as something of no importance, something of little significance which will have a very minor effect on the whole economic structure of the country.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister and the Government made an overall examination of our financial and economic structure.  There should be a re-assessment of tariffs.  For some time past we have been cutting tariffs and allowing in imported goods at reduced tariffs in order to prepare us for entry into the European Economic Community. As a result of the reduction in tariffs, depression has been created in business; there has been widespread <Col N="1264" /> unemployment and a resort to short time.  This has had a very detrimental effect on the workers in the industries involved.  The Government should take some practical steps now, knowing that we will not enter the European Economic Community in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge in Britain at the highest levels that it is not only during the lifetime of President de Gaulle but for many years after Britain will not be a member of the European Economic Community and, if Britain is not a member, we will not be in the Community either.  It would not in all probability be practicable for us to enter the Community without Britain.  Another generation may pass before we become members.  Are we going to continue the present policy of the Government of cutting tariffs, permitting reasonably free entry of foreign goods into our markets?  If we are, then that will have a very serious effect on employment and on our industries. Since our prospects then of entering the European Economic Community are slender indeed, why not take some practical steps now to prepare the country for a long waiting period, perhaps a generation, until it becomes possible for us to join Europe?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what you are going to say, Sir, and I come back now to the question of devaluation. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer gave solemn undertakings that devaluation would not be resorted to; he was wrong in that.  When the pound was devalued, Mr. Callaghan immediately resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer.  That shows the high standard of integrity in Britain's political life.  It is a pity the same standards do not operate here.  When Ministers in Britain make statements which they cannot subsequently stand over, they resign from office.  Mr. Callaghan is to be admired for his courage and integrity in resigning.  Were our Ministers to adopt the same high standard, we should have resignations week after week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> It is admitted that devaluation will have serious consequences in Britain. Surely it will have equally serious, if not more serious consequences here? The Minister's colleagues have paid him many tributes.  My advice to him is to follow the example set by Mr. Callaghan and resign.  Let somebody be appointed to Finance with the courage, foresight and ability to do what should be done.  We are heading towards economic disaster because of the monetary policies of the Minister for Finance.  The burden of taxation has become insupportable.  Our whole tax system needs replanning.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been asked many questions in relation to devaluation.  I am sure that before he made his announcement at the dinner given by the Institute of Bankers that the pound was devalued, he was aware for ten days, at least, before that time that devaluation was coming.  I think Parliament has a right to ask the Minister if devaluation of the pound is in the best possible interests of this country.  Did the Government examine any alternative means of getting over this problem?  Did they seek any advice in this matter and, if so, from whom? Were they advised to follow the same pattern, step by step, with England?</P>
    <P>It all boils down to the fact that the Government had no choice but to do exactly as England did in the matter of devaluation.  Assuming that the economic position in Britain does not improve within the next 12 to 18 months, necessitating a further devaluation of the pound, provided the present British Government are there that long, shall we have to devalue again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is neither my job nor my place to make any comment on British politics: I do not know anything about them.  Britain is now reduced from a once prosperous country to a condition in which she can be described as an international pauper&mdash;and we are the nearest economic orphan.  If she goes down, we go down financially and economically.  If Britain is an international <Col N="1266" /> pauper, naturally enough we cannot be described as other than a fellow-pauper with Britain.</P>
      <P>This Fianna Fáil Government failed to introduce legislation to give themselves power to very parity with sterling and therefore we had no option but to follow England in this connection. Is it proposed to introduce such legislation in the immediate future so that our hands will not again be tied and so that we shall have the same power to control our currency as other independent States have?  This very serious responsibility rests on the Government and they should not remain silent about it.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that this devaluation will not have any very serious consequences. I cannot see where it will not have serious consequences.  As reported in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 19th November, 1967, the Minister said he could see no reason why the cost of living should be affected.  I fail to understand such a statement.  The Minister must be trying to hide the ever-soaring cost of living which is causing grave hardship to workers, business people, the aged, the sick and the thousands of unemployed we have with us.  There does not seem to be any question of a halt being called by this Government to such an enormous increase.  Fianna Fáil are recklessly allowing the cost of living to rise at its own will, without any regard for our people.  In the past four years, the cost of living has risen annually by over 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>Within the next 12 months, there will be another very serious rise in our cost of living due to this devaluation of the pound.  Is it not correct that most, if not all, of our imports will very drastically be increased in price?  Bread, foreign fruit, tea and coffee, petrol and cars, tyres and electrical goods, aluminium, wine, houses, wooden goods, refrigerators, copper tubing, imported timber, brandy, wool, and so on, will all go up in price.  That being so, how can the Minister say that this devaluation will not have any serious consequences on the lives of our people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most serious rise will be that in the price of bread and flour.  Recently, <Col N="1267" /> the Irish Flour Millers Association said they do not know what increase will take place in the price of bread or flour until they examine the increased wheat imports and the intake of Irish wheat.  An increase in the price of bread or flour will have a serious bearing on the cost of living in every home in this country.  We have also seen that supplies of fruit&mdash; apples, pears, oranges and all dried fruits&mdash;are likely to be seriously affected.  I cannot understand the Minister so lightly assuming that devaluation will not have a serious effect on the cost of living when we find that the price of oils and petrol will be substantially increased.  What explanation has the Minister in regard to the statement he made on November 19 telling us this would not have a very serious effect on the cost of living when last week there was a jump of 23/- per ton in the price of American coal and 24/-per ton of Polish coal?  Quite recently there was a substantial increase approved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the price of briquettes manufactured at home.  Surely there is a very serious rise in the cost of living even if one only takes the single item of fuel, something no home can do without?</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Government have not taken some practical steps to control the cost of living or have some machinery to ensure that the cost of living will not run amok as it has been permitted to do, particularly in the past two or three years.  We now see these prices will be, and, according to the Minister, must be increased and it is only right that we should ask him what steps he has, or the Government have in mind to stimulate employment.  If we see living costs rising, the cost of providing houses being seriously affected, interest rates on loans for housing seriously affected, insurances of all kinds substantially increased, is it not only right to say that in the midst of all this that we cannot describe ourselves as living in anything other than a very much depressed economy with a very gloomy and dreary outlook, holding out no <Col N="1268" /> hope of any general relief for the Irish taxpayer?</P>
    <P>Already the economy has been sufficiently depressed by Government action.  Every action of the Government over the past two or three years has resulted in depression.  The increases in the prices of bread and flour, tea, sugar and coffee and all the other items to which I have referred will cause very grave hardship to workers and recipients of social welfare benefits and indeed to every section of the community but particularly to those who are on fixed incomes and have no means of getting increases. There must be many hundreds of such people.  The fact that the Government have no plans to relieve or assist them in any way shows a very high degree of failure by the Government in providing, as they should provide, for such a large section of the community.</P>
    <P>I have little doubt that the Minister will tell us, now that he has had time seriously to consider all aspects of devaluation and its effects, and what we might describe as its most depressing effect on every sphere of activity, and if that step is being taken because of the fault of our Government and the absence of suitable legislation, what drastic steps he will now take to pull our economy out of the depression into which it has been plunged in recent years?</P>
    <P>It is a very serious matter that interest rates have been forced up by the rise in the British bank rate and that cheap money is no longer available to stimulate our economy.  Every local authority knows that it is not possible to provide money at cheap rates of interest to stimulate the economy and provide necessary schemes of national development.  That is a very serious situation.  Local authorities find now that it is becoming impossible for them to borrow for housing because of the high interest that must be paid and the consequent high rents and rates which tenants, particularly those in new housing schemes, are faced with.  It is taken by the Government as a matter of course. They are not taking positive definite action to remedy the high rate of bank <Col N="1269" /> interest which is crippling every local authority and preventing general development of the economy.  This high rate of bank interest, when it is preventing development, must be contributing substantially to the pool of unemployment and to the depression that exists in many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have made suggestions and offered constructive criticism of the whole handling of this situation by the Government.  There is only one way left to stimulate the economy&mdash; provide work, get down to business, and see that money will be provided at reasonably cheap rates of interest to enable local authorities to go ahead with their many planned schemes of housing, waterworks, sewerage and general development.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage when taxes must be reduced and the time has come for the Minister to consider courageously the deplorable circumstances in which the poorer sections of the community now find themselves living, that is, all who are in receipt of social welfare benefits, because an effort must be made to raise the spending power, get demand rising and, generally speaking, get the economy out of the rut into which it has been driven.  I should like to know from the Minister which taxes he proposes to cut and by how much he proposes to increase all rates of social welfare benefits in order to help people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the cake were made bigger, would there not be bigger slices made available?  That is exactly what we want.  The cake cannot be made bigger unless we stimulate the economy by providing more employment, facilitating greater investment and enabling the development of our housing, health, educational and other services on which we are spending money today.  We must also take steps to reduce substantially the bank rates in order to allow local authorities to proceed with their many schemes of development which they cannot do at the moment.</P>

      <P>I most readily accept the Minister's word, but I should not like to quote him in certain parts of my constituency.  However, the Minister for Finance will agree that we have in this country the dearest possible motoring in the world. If we are to be faced with further increases in the price of oil and petrol it will have a serious effect on people who have motor cars as a matter of necessity, not for pleasure or joyriding but as a means of getting to and from work.  The Minister should now take the necessary steps to cut the duties on petrol and oil and take similar steps in regard to tobacco.  In addition to that, he should increase by at least five per cent our social welfare and social assistance benefits.  Furthermore, these steps cannot be left until the next Budget.  This is something the Minister is expected to do now.  It cannot be postponed until next year if we are to assist people in the most practical way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> The Minister has said time and again that our economy is sound.  Our economy cannot be sound when our agricultural community are living under the most depressed conditions possible.  Surely the Minister is aware that there is great need for further investment in agriculture, a great need for increasing the amount of capital to be made available, particularly to small farmers in order to assist them to increase their production, to increase their livestock, to improve the quality of their land and the general layout of their holdings.  This cannot be done in present circumstances.  If we want to get our farmers to produce more wheat, more oats, more beet and more barley, and to contribute their share to the general standard of the nation's economy you must first help them financially.  One of the greatest needs for the building up of Irish agriculture at the moment is the lack of credit facilities for small farmers and the manner in which people are curtailed because of the lack of credit from stocking their lands as fully and as well as they could.  How many of us realise that our greatest exports are our cattle exports and without our cattle exports where would we be?  Yet, when we go up and down the country every rural Deputy knows that there is grazing available, there are lands available and there are farmers available and if one asks them why they have not got their lands better stocked or why they are letting grazing or setting grazing they will say that it is because they cannot afford to stock it.  There must be something very seriously wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but I want to say that the more cattle we have for export the better for the country.  Everyone agrees on that because the agricultural community depends to an enormous extent on the amount of our exports of cattle to Britain, to the Continent and elsewhere. Therefore, it will help the economy of this country if we can step up on our exports.  The only way we can do it is to plough money into the <Col N="1273" /> agricultural community to buy stock, to keep stock and to improve the quality of their lands.  Then we will have more for export which will be an enormous help towards our balance of payments.  That is why I feel the Minister has not seriously tackled this problem or is not seriously tackling it when the principal section of our economy, the agricultural community, is and has been in such a deplorably depressed condition.</P>
      <P>What else has the general economy of the country to depend on but agriculture? We have seen that industry has had its difficult period by the tariff cuts, short time and the amount of unemployment and by the flooding into this country of what we can describe in many instances as dumped goods which are permitted to come in here under the trade agreement with Britain.  I feel that the time has now come, when there are no immediate prospects of our getting into the Common Market, to enter into a new trade agreement which will be more beneficial to this country, more beneficial to Irish industry, more beneficial to Irish agriculture and more beneficial in keeping our Irish people in productive employment at home.</P>

      <P>The Chair will have little difficulty in soliciting my fullest co-operation on that.  Now that the Government have decided on a policy of decentralisation of Government offices shall we have the next chapter which we are all waiting for, the decentralisation of industry, something that will give employment and improve the general economy of rural Ireland?  I agree in principle with decentralisation.  I think it is a good thing.  I do not think that it is right <Col N="1274" /> that everything should be centred and built up around Dublin.  We are reaching a stage in which rural Ireland will be completely denuded of its population and if the present trend continues practically the entire population will be centred around Dublin.  The tendency now is to flee from the land and come to the cities.  The cities have their own problems and God knows, their problems are great.</P>
      <P>As well as embarking on a policy of decentralisation of Government Departments, some practical steps should be taken to decentralise industry and the Government should take steps to see that industries, instead of being centred in Dublin, should be set up down the country.  That is the place for them.  If this is done, the Minister for Finance will earn the gratitude of the thousands who live in rural Ireland and want to stay there and only need a little encouragement to stay in their native districts but must leave for the cities and big towns, for Britain, Canada or the U.S. because of lack of employment and good living standards at home.  Therefore, in addition to the recent pronouncements on the decentralisation of Government Departments, we hope and trust for a general review of the whole industrial structure of the country and that we will hear from the Minister for Finance that not alone is he about to decentralise State Departments but that an effort will be made to decentralise worthwhile industries which will provide employment for the manpower that is available in rural Ireland.  If such a programme is embarked on it will yield a very good economic return by keeping our people at home in rural Ireland and providing them with the wherewithal to live there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have reached a position now in which practically every worker is obliged to pay income tax.  Under the PAYE system the amount of income tax that has to be paid by workers is very great.  I would seriously appeal to the Minister to take some practical steps to see that ordinary labouring men will be exempt from the payment of income tax.  We see workers in bacon factories, in the ESB, Bord na Móna and other State organisations <Col N="1275" /> obliged to have large amounts deducted from their wages.  The time has come for a general review of the allowances.  I am sure we will be able to debate it more fully in the Minister's next Budget.  The Minister for Finance has a responsibility to these taxpayers.  With the cost of living at its present level it is an awful thing for the Government to have both hands down into both trousers pockets of Irish taxpayers to drag out the last penny piece that is available and leave less to the taxpayer for spending, which means that there will be less in circulation.  This is a very serious matter.  A general review should be undertaken and substantial increases in allowances made if we expect our workers to remain in this country and attain a decent standard of living here.</P>
    <P>They are the only comments I wish to make and I make them knowing that the Minister realises that they are addressed to him in his capacity as Minister for Finance, also bearing in mind that we as an Opposition have a duty to criticise, and to criticise constructively, as I have endeavoured to do during the past hour.</P>
    <P>The whole economic position of the country is in a deplorable mess due entirely to the bad handling of the Government and I would have wished the picture to be more pleasing.  I can see nothing ahead of us except more claims and more depression with added unemployment and a substantial addition to present living costs.  The Minister and the Government should take practical steps to stimulate our economy, to make more money available for planning, and to see to it that the poorer sections of our community are looked after.  There is a vast amount of hidden poverty that has not come to the surface.  These are the people who will be affected by increased living costs and the Government have a serious responsibility to such people Immediate steps should be taken and every effort made to prevent further hardship being imposed on such <Col N="1276" /> people, particularly the working classes.</P>
    <P>The devaluation of the pound has added considerably to the already overburdened taxpayers and it will have a further detrimental effect on the general economy.  The Minister has not satisfied this House, or, indeed, the country as he said on the 19th November, that this will not have serious consequences.  It will have serious consequences and I feel it is something that will be felt by every section of our community.  We are all waiting with eager and attentive ears to hear of the solutions, remedies and assistance of a sound and practical nature which the Minister has to stimulate our economy and assist our people in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone with an unbiased mind would recognise the masterly handling of the present situation by the Minister for Finance.  He was faced with the devaluation of the pound and this Government, like all Governments who have met with grave obstacles before, will progress.  The Minister gave a very able explanation of what he did and of what might have to be done.  He has convinced most Members of the House with his usual expertise that he has made the right decision and one which will benefit the people of this country, more so than if the country had either a Fine Gael or Labour Government at this time.</P>
      <P>Devaluation will, of course, have some ill effects.  Those we naturally think of are the lower paid workers and the pensioners.  The Minister has shown in his last Budget his concern for pensioners.  He gave them increases and free electricity and free travel.  Devaluation will have more effect on these people and we are hoping that next year, when the Minister introduces his Budget, he will be as generous as he was this year and so ward off the full effects of devaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard Fine Gael speakers talk with monotonous misery about the state of the country with regard to emigration, unemployment and other matters.  There is one fact they did not mention and that is that the last census figures show that for the first time <Col N="1277" /> in 100 years the population of this country has increased&mdash;admittedly a small amount; I think it is 61,000.  It is a change and we can look forward to greater progress at a more rapid rate.</P>
    <P>We have been accused of slavishly following the British but the Minister has shown that we were free to make a choice on devaluation.  Most people who look at it think honestly that the right decision has been made.  We have not had to go like other countries to the World Monetary Fund to get a loan to tide us over our difficulties.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael speakers attacked the Government for their borrowing.  Fine Gael are touchy on this point because whenever they issued a loan there was a marked lack of confidence shown by the people in the Government at the time.  The history of loans by the present Government is different and they have been taken up avidly by all sections of the community.  This is a marked vote of confidence in the Government.</P>
    <P>An important matter also in the Minister's statement was that of the decentralisation of some Government Departments.  Nobody will say that this decision is wrong.  It is the best thing to be done.  We must recognise the fact that many civil servants and their families living here are in fear about a possible forceful transfer to Castlebar or Athlone.  The Minister has assured them that as far as possible transfers will be on a voluntary basis.  I feel that in the case of a man who has his family in school here and who does not want to go, plenty of young people will be found instead to go to the new towns.  This move will revitalise those particular areas and play a big part in the general build-up of our economy. The Government have been attacked over this, but this is something which every Party has had at some time to face when handling the mechanics of something which may hurt some people.  We are assured that the Minister will discuss these plans with the Civil Service associations and I feel a good solution will be found and that this will prove a great shot in the arm for towns like Athlone and Castlebar. It shows, too, that the Government <Col N="1278" /> appreciate that the city of Dublin is overcrowded and that this has put a tremendous strain on the finances of the city in regard to houses, roads and general services.  Here, again, the matter is thrown back into the Minister's lap because he must provide funds for housing and other services.</P>
    <P>We have heard the present situation of housing in Dublin attacked.  I have never seen as much progress being made with regard to housing in the city.  People may have seen protests about so few houses and nothing being done about it.  We have well over 2,000 dwellings being built and we have plans for 17,000 new dwellings by 1971.  However, unless the money is there we just cannot build the houses. I remember the time when we used to go to the Bank of Ireland to plead for more money when they told us there was no money for us and the Government said there was no money.  The Government at the moment are not short of money.  At no time in our history have we made such progress.</P>
    <P>It is the wish of Members on all sides of the House that we overcome our problems.  To do so we must have the necessary finance and we shall not have that without a sound economy. There seems to be an idea in some quarters of the House that the Irish people have a God-given right to prosperity.  This, of course, is not so. Nations which are prosperous are those whose people work hard to build up the economy to meet the demands on it.  We cannot say this too many times.  Neither can we emphasise too often that the Government cannot just go to the printing machine and print money.  Unless we can produce our goods at such competitive prices that we can sell them freely in competitive markets, our economy will not show the progress we all hope for and we shall still suffer from imbalance.</P>
    <P>We cannot drive this lesson home hard enough.  Our salvation is in the hands of our people and unless all sections, workers and employers as well as people who are neither workers nor employers, play their parts we shall not reach the goal we should strive for.</P>
    <P>I cannot see what alternative steps <Col N="1279" /> to devaluation the Minister could have taken.  It was the sanest action he could have taken and I am sure that in their hearts the Opposition agree. The Minister handled the situation so well that I believe we shall get over the extra burden&mdash;I know there will be a retarding of the national effort for a while&mdash;and, as the Minister stated, if we accept the challenge posed by devaluation, devaluation in itself will not have the effects prophesied by the Jonahs.</P>
    <P>Last year when the Minister was preparing his Financial Statement he surprised many of us by his treatment of the weaker sections.  As a result, there is no more popular man among the old age pensioners, the blind and the other less well off sections of the community.  This Minister did this, though at the time we were only emerging from a particularly bad period.  As a result, he has given us all confidence to face the future, whatever that may bring.</P>
    <P>Emigration is still too high but there is consolation in the fact that the population has increased for the first time in a hundred years.  The only cure for emigration is the provision of more jobs.  I gather from figures issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce that it costs £5,000 to provide employment for one person.  That includes the capital money needed for the establishment of the factory and so forth.  Therefore, if we are to abolish or reduce unemployment we need a lot more money and we shall get that only if we attain a sound economic position.  It is not wise to go into the hands of international financiers but unless there is some external investment in the country it will be impossible for our people in the space of the next ten years or so to create sufficient finances so that every man and woman who is able to work and wants to work will have a job and so that every family will be properly housed and so that the standard of living will reach the level we all hope to see.</P>
    <P>It has been said that people who cannot get employment at home must emigrate.  We can do a lot towards <Col N="1280" /> easing that situation but we must have confidence in our people.  The former Taoiseach spoke on television last night and said that in the 1950's people lost hope.  They believed that even the go-ahead man at that time had to leave.  This trend is disappearing and the manner in which the Minister and the Government have handled the devaluation situation as well as the general economic problems has been an indication that here is a country which can progress through wise Government and hard-working people, that we can reach an economic level through which there will be work for everybody, proper homes for each family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was interesting to hear from Deputy Moore the excellent situation we have.  According to him things are going well.  For once, we can report a slight increase in our population. Immediately afterwards, the Deputy spoke about the emigration figures and about lack of confidence during the mid 50s.  One of the things we have decided on this side of the House is that neither the line taken by Deputy MacEntee in 1949 nor the line taken by the ex-Taoiseach in the 1950's will be followed.  As far as we are concerned, contributions from the Opposition will be constructive and will help towards the framing of proper Government policy.  Assistance from the Opposition is one way in which Government policy can be framed.  That is all we can do until the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the banking set-up and of the activities of the Minister for Finance during the previous period, there was no doubt the Minister had to stand up at the bankers' dinner and announce devaluation seconds after it had been announced in London.  It is quite clear that Popo the Puppet can do anything if somebody else pulls the strings.  If Britain has a bad balance of payments situation, a fall in exports, an increase in personal consumption without, at the same time, capital rebuilding, then Britain's pound becomes weak.  It does not follow, <i>ipso facto,</i> that we must follow that pattern.  However, we get the ill results. <Col N="1281" /> The only difference is that we are not quoted on the gold exchanges of the world.</P>
    <P>In this situation we had an extraordinarily contradictory position. While our balance of payments stood well and while our revenue, as far as we can judge at this time of the year, was good, we were faced with the situation that the Second Programme had failed abysmally, that there had been no spectacular development in new industry.  Deputy Moore quoted a figure of £5,000 as the capital cost of putting one person to work.  The last time I did the sum the figure was £3,000.  We had, therefore, two quite contradictory matters which indicated bad Government housekeeping, bad Government policy.  We had all our financial indices satisfactory but at the same time we had a fall in employment. The Minister sneered across the House at me a few years ago when he quoted the &ldquo;Deserted Village&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey Where wealth accumulates and men decay.</P>
    <P>This is not so far from the truth at present.  I attended a dinner where I had a nice social chat with the Minister in Drogheda last week.  He repeated a phrase I have never heard before in regard to the way he was approaching the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  The phrase was &ldquo;excessive quantification&rdquo;, that no longer in the Third Programme, as soon as it is produced, would there be excessive quantification, in other words, would there be too many figures.  When you set figures and they are set too high and not reached then you must accept failures.  In future, the Government do not intend to produce targets.  This is not very convincing to anybody.  We always said that more than targets were needed.  We said that planning was needed, especially more detailed planning and that we would then have better results.</P>
    <P>We find that the situation now is if we had a separate monetary unit of our own, which we have not, it would appear from the financial figures as if there would have been no need to devalue <Col N="1282" /> but yet our employment situation would have indicated that we were doing badly.  This is all the more extraordinary because we are a developing country and with the particular events in Europe, with the Common Market coming along and the Free Trade Area with Britain, one would have thought that the quite natural happening would be that more industries would have been coming here and picking up the excellent labour force we have available.  One would have thought if we had set our own house in order in a developing economy that we would have had more jobs yet we have fewer.  I am aware that we have marginally more jobs in industry and colossally fewer in agriculture.  Nevertheless, one would have thought if we did nothing except keep our own house in order there would have been a greater increase in the number employed in industry because of the advent of the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain and that we would have had industrialists coming here in greater numbers.</P>
    <P>It is sad to recall that the Minister for Industry and Commerce in introducing his Estimate a week or so ago indicated that there was deceleration in regard to the establishment of new industries here and that he saw fewer people coming forward this year than before.  This means more emigration and it also means that we are not progressive at a time in our history when we have taken a very deep plunge into very cold water, when with our two eyes open we have entered into a free trade agreement with Britain which can injure industry here and that our real problem may be the preservation of existing jobs even more than the creation of new jobs.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is sad that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should come in here in this year when we may expect a further drop in our tariffs in January next and say that we have a deceleration in regard to new industries and this shows bad housekeeping. We are a developing country and there is no doubt about the fact that if our labour force became known to the nations of the world, if our own housekeeping was in order, many <Col N="1283" /> industrialists would come here and establish new industries.  One would have thought with free entry into Britain that there would have been more people in jobs.</P>
    <P>A few years ago it was <i>infra dig</i> for anybody to mention the banking system in this country.  You could take your pick that if you did you were meant to be a radical or a communist. I am happy to say that this position has improved and it was as a result of Deputy Sweetman, when he was Minister for Finance, taking the decision not to change the bank rate, that we would not for the first time follow suit.  At the time this was regarded as quite radical and extraordinary but it has been repeated since.  Deputy Sweetman took the plunge at that time and it was a start. It is true that there was an urgent necessity for a change in the pattern of the banking system here.  That does not mean that anybody, especially the Minister for Finance, can trot down to the Governor of the Bank of Ireland, or any other man in such a position, and tell him what to do.  The banks here are licensed and the pattern has been that while they are commercial banks thy consult with the Government. While saying this, I should like to point to two things.  While Deputy Dunne said earlier this morning that there is always the fear that if you have a different deposit rate from that in Britain, especially a lower deposit rate, your funds will fly away, this, of course, would be disastrous to the commercial banking system.  That does not mean that you cannot vary your interest rates and it does not mean, as the Minister for Finance indicated quite clearly to bankers, not only how much credit he would wish to see extended, but that there could be an indication given as to what purpose this credit was extended for.</P>
    <P>We must accept the fact that the banks here are commercial banks and as such, operating for their shareholders, they have responsibility to those shareholders to see to it that they get the maximum profits available. That would indicate to me that the <Col N="1284" /> person making the decision in regard to overdrafts, whether he be the director, the area controller or the manager, might be more inclined to give an extension of credit to some organisation that could very quickly repay, even if it was an organisation which employed very few people because of the commercial nature of its transactions and that it was quite clear that they could repay very quickly rather than give it to an organisation which would employ a greater number of people but yet be an industry which would take a longer number of years to repay any major capital expenditure. There was also the fact that while the Minister indicated that their credit which it was indicated to the banks would be extended, even be taken up by the private sectors, the fact is there has been a radical change in the approach to banking here.  That change has been because up to a few years ago the banks were saying that they were in favour of short term and were not lending money for long term capital projects.  The fact was that they did lend money for those and that they are not at the present moment so lending.  The banks here address themselves to short term credit as commercial banks do in other countries. The snag is that while in other countries there are other financial institutions, where such money can be got, such institutions do not exist here, with the exception of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  There has been criticism about the amount of money made available by the Minister for them.</P>
    <P>I have adverted to this on the Estimate for Industry and Commerce.  We are in a situation whereby it is much more difficult, with the size of firms here, for firms to go public, to use a common term, and float themselves on the Dublin Stock Exchange, such as it is, than it would be in other countries, where there are larger industries and certainly, if not larger, be as fish swimming in a larger pool.  While the Minister may say there is sufficient credit extended to the private sector from the banking system, the fact is it is only extended for short-term borrowing, for stocks and for the extension of credit to customers who <Col N="1285" /> repay in a short time and not for the long-term capital investment which is so important if we are to provide employment, particularly for men.  I do not advocate for a moment control of the banking system.  I do advocate an indication by the Minister through the Central Bank that there should be an extension of credit to the commercial bank for long-term projects that will employ men.</P>
    <P>I believe there is something in the system used in other countries whereby there are different grades of overdraft interest for different projects.  Take the case of a person employing a large number of men and who in the course of time and the carrying out of necessary adaptation measures in his industry finds himself borrowing large sums over long periods in order to employ these men and to extend the number of those employed.  If it were possible to do this and, at the same time, ensure that the shareholders of banks got their due reward for the investment of their money, there should be different rates of interest for different projects. I have no doubt there is no need for control of the commercial banks.  An indication from the Minister, seriously spoken, of such a desire would result in an examination of the situation and some improvement, if not the complete improvement I suggest.</P>
    <P>I think I have proved that when the Minister attended the bankers' dinner he sat in a situation of <i>status quo</i> that had existed right through the present Taoiseach's rather somnolent occupancy of the Department of Finance, that he arrived in the same situation as he had been before, that Popo the Puppet could devalue if somebody else pulled the strings.  The Government have not been livewires in this matter. Without being radical or in any way frightening as far as our economy is concerned, without taking risks, there is a need for us to buy a tailormade suit so far as our financial policy is concerned, to realise we are different from Britain and that we as a nation have the duty and opportunity to tailormake our financial arrangements to suit us and that that has not been done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> There has been too conservative and too slavish an approach to this whole problem.  We may accept that this question of the British umbrella as far as our financial institutions are concerned is a leaky umbrella.  I do not think the British economy is half as bad as many people seem to think. The strain of acting as an international currency market is too heavy for a nation the size of Britain.  If Russia does not do this sort of thing, and she does not, there is only one other nation in the world that underwrites currency, and that is America.  The great trade build-up in Britain over the centuries, which culminated in the peak of her Empire, is now gone so far as the real recompense to Britain is concerned. The pound is more overworked than in trouble.  In future we may see some international form of backing currency which will relieve Britain of the heavy responsibility she bears at present. This has been said before, but it bears repetition.  The Minister was most complacent about the whole affair.</P>

      <P>On television and in your public pronouncements since, you were being very slick: I mean that in no derogatory fashion.  How you could approach this as Minister for Finance with a sort of happy mind and how you could say to the Irish people that everything is all right, when the dogs in the street who study the matter know it is not, is beyond me.  For instance, our exports to non-devaluing <Col N="1287" /> countries are about a quarter of our total exports.  We are going to get an advantage there temporarily.  In relation to the other three-quarters we are not.  Many of the raw materials of our industries come from non-devaluing countries.  There we have to pay more. It is a question then of whether we use the finished product here or re-export it.  If we re-export it back to these countries we are all right.  Of course, the real truth of the matter is that we export only one-quarter to these countries. Therefore, the likelihood is we will not be re-exporting.  This means we are in trouble.</P>
      <P>There was one thing not mentioned by the Minister which it is desirable to state here.  There is a common external tariff against us when we want to send goods into the Common Market countries.  In the case of cattle, for instance, it has excluded all our cattle from the Continent.</P>

      <P>We have done our homework and we know that.  The proof of whether devaluation has allowed us to export cattle to the Common Market countries is in whether or not they went since the Minister spoke at the bankers' dinner.  The truth is that they did not.  Whether or not the Minister wants to pick me up on some details of the trading arrangements, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  I have heard no cattlemen yet say that because of devaluation they were able to export cattle to the Common Market.  I accept the Minister's correction in regard to the levies.  I use cattle merely as an example because they are so important.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the opportunity for increasing exports to the Continent is minimal, that we are not going to get as good an increase in exports as the Minister suggested, and that, in fact, we are just going to be in the same position so far as Britain is concerned, with this very serious exception.  We entered the British Free Trade Area Agreement on the very serious basis that we were moving towards Europe, and it now looks, according to General de Gaulle and others, as if we are moving towards it very slowly.</P>
      <P>On this particular point I should like to refer the House to an article under the heading &ldquo;The Economy&rdquo; in &ldquo;Business and Finance&rdquo; of 24th November, 1967.  I want to refer most particularly to the date because it is now a week later.  I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big question mark is whether Britain has done enough to put right its balance of payments, and, more importantly, to convince France that it should be in the Common Market. Devaluation has always looked like the last card up Mr. Wilson's sleeve in his efforts to enter Europe, and <Col N="1289" /> the sterling crisis of last weekend may have done no more than precipitate the situation.</P>
    <P>The prospect of Ireland having to depend almost entirely on the U.K. market in the 1970's is an unhappy one.  Tariff protection will be disappearing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>There will be another cut in January&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and export opportunities could be limited by stagnation across the channel.  It is in the interests of both countries that Britain succeed in its Common Market bid. </P>
    <P>I would refer the House to a statement made by General de Gaulle since that article was published, and I would even refer the House to his photograph in the <i>Irish Times.</i> Perhaps the Minister would cut it out and frame it and he would then realise that the words, &ldquo;Everything is as it was&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nothing is worse&rdquo;, &ldquo;A lot is a little better&rdquo;, are not really true, and that this country is facing quite a difficult situation because of devaluation.  The Minister may object to that, but there is no reason why he should, because the criticism due to the Government on this matter is that they did not look after their financial arrangements in the previous two years.  Perhaps they were more tied up with the succession to power.  Perhaps they were so tied up that they stagnated.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan dealt very lucidly with the situation so far as increased costs are concerned. We will pay more for imported wheat; we will pay more for hydrocarbon oils; we will pay more for coal.  In fact, we are already paying more for coal.  A few days after the announcement of devaluation a statement was made by the trade unions that they were seeking a general increase in wages.  We are right up against another wage round.</P>
      <P>Many people in this country fail to appreciate the position or the attitude of the trade unions.  I am not going to say whether it is right or wrong, bad, good or middling.  The trade unions believe that these people have not got a proper slice of the cake, and they desire to increase that slice.  For people who are paid a weekly subscription by their members that is not an extraordinary point of view.  I would say it is a most normal point of view.  On top of the increases on the major heads I have mentioned, and which were so lucidly dealt with by Deputy Flanagan, the position is that we are going to have a general increase in costs if there is another wage round.  I do not see how another round can be avoided. There is no point in sticking our heads in the sand and saying we cannot have another round: &ldquo;wrap the green flag round us, another round would be disastrous.&rdquo;  It appears today that the trade union activities will precipitate another round.  I am not asking for it, nor am I trying to sink the boat or rock the boat.  As an observer for some years it seems to me that this will happen. That means we will have a further increase in costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that occurs, so far as exports are concerned the minimal advantage which I indicated as a result of a devaluation to this country from non-devaluing countries, the majority of which have protective tariffs set up against us anyway, will be completely eroded.  That means that the economic ill that besets us before devaluation was mentioned will clearly remain. This economic ill is that the ingredients of the national cake and the shape of <Col N="1291" /> the policy adopted by the Government have failed.  The Minister referred to excessive quantification.  I have not yet looked up the Oxford Dictionary to see whether that is correct.</P>
    <P>Other people referred to the position of the agricultural industry.  It is most necessary that this should be referred to.  Our agricultural exports and particularly our cattle exports are the bulwark of the financial structure. When we export a bullock we are exporting probably 70 per cent of the grass he has eaten and the milk he has drunk.  That means that while it is an excellent thing to employ people in importing raw materials from abroad, in this case we are exporting good Irish labour.  That is an excellent thing to do to pay for the raw materials and to achieve a sound economy.  We must have a steep increase in our agricultural production.  In fact this year we had an increase in the export of cattle but that pattern may not continue after next May.  What we want is a constant increase in the export of these goods.</P>
    <P>I should like now to quote from the <i>Irish Times,</i> Thursday, November 23rd, an article written by Mr. Michael Dillon in which he deals with devaluation and says devaluation will raise costs.  I quote:</P>
    <P>In all the talk about the devaluation of the pound there has been little mention of farming, but the fact is that there will be increased costs for farmers as a result of this move.  The increases will cover a fairly wide field, and there will be no advantages for exports.</P>
    <P>That is a very strong statement.  The article goes on:</P>
    <P>The raw materials that we can expect to become dearer will include fertilisers, because all our phosphate and potash come from non-sterling areas, and we can expect nitrogen prices to increase also because the fuel oil used in the manufacture of nitrogen will be dearer.  The fuel oil for the tractors will also be dearer, and petrol is another material which <Col N="1292" /> is very important in farming because so much has to be carried in and out of the farm by road.  Our high protein meals generally come from non-sterling areas and we can expect the cost of these to go up, which will affect the pig feeders, calf rearers and winter milk producers, and any grain we import will probably also be dearer.  We buy a great deal of our farm machinery from the Continent now, too, and all of this will go up, and there will surely be some increases in building costs.  Finally, we will have to pay more for the extra money we will be forced to borrow because of all these other increased costs. </P>

      <P>On the export side we gain little. Britain takes the bulk of our farm produce and the only country to which we have substantial exports of farm produce outside of that is the United States which has been buying a lot of manufacturing beef from us in the past year.  They are taking pretty well all of this beef that we have to offer so we will not increase our exports, and will not get any more for the old cows than competition forces the factories to give.  It is a poor outlook for an industry where profits were so low in 1966 that even the good cattle trade of this year has not yet restored the balance. </P>

      <P>We want to know what the Government will do about it. Would the Minister tell us when replying to the debate, if we accept that France has now well and truly put a spoke in the wheel as far as entry to the Common Market for Britain and Ireland is concerned, does the Taoiseach intend to go back to Britain and say that we should delay reduction of our tariffs so as to set up this rearguard action that I referred to, the defence of existing jobs here?  Have the Minister and his Government assessed the number of these jobs that are in danger and will he say a word about that when he is replying?</P>
      <P>Has the Minister assessed the effect of the price increases to which I have referred on the poorer members of our community and can he give any indication now of an early or immediate alleviation of their lot and suffering? Has the Minister any plans that will indicate to trade unions how they could behave and how it would be possible to give them a better return without at the same time increasing our export costs and placing us in the position of being in rather the same mess of pottage as Britain is in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister anything to say about the proposal from Fine Gael that the taxes on hydrocarbon oils should be reduced?  The Minister is in a buoyant revenue situation, no matter what he says.  At this time of year it is not so easy to know the final figures but all the figures produced indicate good revenue this year.  If there is going to be a general increase in costs as a result of the cost of movement of all goods in this country for agriculture, industry or any other purpose, and of passenger transport, if the Minister wanted to give the economy a good fillip one of the things he could do is to take the plucky step of reducing taxes on hydrocarbon oils, <Col N="1294" /> particularly diesel oil.  Will the Minister indicate if he intends to do this?</P>
    <P>What view has the Minister got on the suggestion made by me that he might suggest to the banks that different interest rates should be applied for different purposes so that there would be an attraction for people to invest in long-term heavy industries which would employ men?  Does the Minister think that it is wise to wait for the Budget before dealing with a situation that is moving rapidly to its climax, with increases in costs and in certain import costs on one side and very little opportunity for increased exports on the other side and the devaluation correcting itself as all the international forces take their push against it and as prices change, so that in nine or 12 months' time or less the effects of devaluation may be eroded and we may be far worse off because of all the impending things coming towards us if we have done nothing about them?  I have mentioned the things I wish the Minister would do.</P>
    <P>Moving now to the Estimate for the Minister's Department, I should like to refer to decentralisation and to say that in my opinion it is a political gimmick.  I believe that you will have half the Department of Lands in Castlebar and the other half in Dublin because it would be impossible to divorce a Government Department from the other Departments of State. I believe that the decision to move to Castlebar was prompted by the fact that in the two Mayo constituencies and the Roscommon-Leitrim constituency, in all cases, Fianna Fáil are less than 1,000 votes behind to get another seat and the mind of the Cabinet is so conditioned to remaining in power that they would do far more than that and say far more than that in order to achieve that purpose.  In Longford-Westmeath the difference was seven votes and in Roscommon-Leitrim one finds the same situation. In my view, Fianna Fáil hope to cod the people of these constituencies past the next election, not for the first or last time?  The early 1970s may see portion of both Departments in each place but nothing like the size of development that has been indicated <Col N="1295" /> and nothing like the benefits for the people there that Fianna Fáil would have them believe are, as usual, around the corner.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by mentioning the Kennedy Memorial Hall.  I have come to the conclusion that a memorial to the late President Kennedy, on the committee for which some of the members of my Party sat, is a worthy thing.  In this country the memory of the great President Kennedy should be perpetuated. Having said that, I want now to advert to another method of perpetuating a memory.  There is a committee at the moment examining the question of perpetuating the memory of General Michael Collins.  Their method&mdash;which I am not advocating in the case of the Kennedy memorial&mdash;is by way of scholarships.</P>
    <P>At the moment there are throughout the country retarded children who cannot find a place to go for training. If you can bring retarded children together for special training they can, at 18 or 19 years of age, return to their homes and live an almost normal life. The project to build a £3 million concert hall in the Phoenix Park is mad.  If President Kennedy were alive, the thing he would like would be the building of two homes or hospitals for retarded children.  I have made that suggestion more than once.  I put it now as a very serious suggestion indeed.  A concert hall would be excellent; even though it might only be used a few times in the year, it is, however, something the country should have, but surely my suggestion would more suitably perpetuate the memory of this great man.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;complacent&rdquo; has been used a great deal in this debate.  In fact, I doubt if any Fine Gael speaker refrained from using it; all accused me of being &ldquo;complacent&rdquo; about the problems presented by devaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, during the devaluation weekend, I had a very serious responsibility to discharge.  Devaluation to most people is a mysterious and, indeed, a <Col N="1296" /> peculiarly emotive word.  When a prominent European country devalued some years ago some old people actually committed suicide in the mistaken belief that their life savings had been wiped out by that act of devaluation. That is the sort of atmosphere that can be generated and my concern that weekend was, therefore, to point out as calmly and as objectively as I could precisely what was involved and to show that there was no need for either panic or hysteria.  It was my concern to do what I could to steady public opinion and public reaction.  I believed it was important to show our people that devaluation, while not welcome, was not something which should be regarded as a major disaster nor was there any reason why we should not or could not take it in our stride.</P>
    <P>I thought that was the right attitude to take and the proper approach.  As a Government we acted swiftly and with clear purpose on the basis of a decision already taken in advance.  We were ahead of the situation.  We did not permit ourselves to be dragged along in its wake.  What would those who now criticise me, and say I was complacent, have wished me to do? Do they think I should have given the impression of being unprepared?  Do they think we should have hesitated? Do they think we should have helped to create an atmosphere of panic, called midnight Cabinet meetings, and so on?</P>
    <P>It is the job of the Government to anticipate developments and to act decisively, when decisive action is necessary.  It is the job of the Government to give leadership to the nation. It is the job of the Government to warn the nation, when warning is necessary, and to act to restore public confidence when this is necessary.  I was very, very anxious also that no act or statement of mine would do anything at all to set off a wave of price increases or to encourage speculation or profiteering.  Do not forget all these things were very real possibilities.  As everybody knows, there are many people in our community only too anxious to avail of any development of this nature to feather their own nests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> I wanted to make it clear, to put on record as specifically as I could, what exactly devaluation meant and what exactly it did not mean so that the general public might be as clear as possible about its effects.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies during the course of the debate referred to the statutory parity which exists between our pound and the pound sterling.  None, however, referred to one particular aspect of the situation, which we have been considering for some time.  It can be argued that there is some incompatibility between the legislative proposals contained in the Currency Act of 1927 and those contained in the Bretton Woods Agreement Act of 1957 in regard to the external value of our currency.  We joined the International Monetary Fund in 1957.  We were obliged by the rules of the Fund to declare in 1958 a par value for the Irish pound in terms of gold.  The same rules laid it down that we are not permitted to change that par value by more than ten per cent except with the agreement of the Fund.  That agreement can only be given by the Fund if it is satisfied that a fundamental disequilibrium exists in our external payments. Those are the provisions of the Bretton Woods Agreement Act.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Currency Act of 1927, passed 40 years ago, provides that our currency is convertible at par into sterling.  It would probably be as well now to clear up this discrepancy and provide in our legislation that the external value of the Irish pound as declared formally to the International Monetary Fund would be the rate at which the Irish pound would be convertible into sterling and, indeed, into all other currencies.  We have been considering this, as I said, for some time.  In particular, we have been considering it in relation to the new banking legislation which is on its way.  I am sure I do not have to emphasise that a change of this nature would be a strictly technical matter. The relationship of our pound to the pound sterling would, of course, remain unaltered.  The external value of the pound sterling, and of most other currencies, is defined in the way I have <Col N="1298" /> mentioned&mdash;that is, so many grains of fine gold represent the par value of the currency as declared to the International Monetary Fund.  The relationship between these par values determines the exchange rates for the various currencies.</P>
    <P>We could not have made any such move at any time during the recent past without obviously raising questions which might have had very serious repercussions, repercussions of which I think every Deputy must be aware.  The way is now clear for us to make the change over, but to have attempted to do so in the recent past as Deputy O'Higgins suggested, and others also, to have sought to amend the Currency Act of 1927 to give us freedom to adopt a different sterling value for the Irish pound in the recent past, would have been both dangerous and unnecessary.  It would certainly have been interpreted as a clear indication by us that we believed devaluation was imminent, at the very time when the British Government was doing everything in its power to avoid devaluation.  It was also unnecessary, because we had decided that on this occasion our best interests dictated that we should follow sterling, if it were devalued.</P>
    <P>We had been studying this problem, in consultation with the Central Bank, for some considerable time and we had come to the conclusion that the least disadvantageous course for us was to follow suit when Britain devalued.  I do not think any Deputy will seriously challenge that proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Various other countries came to the same decision and no one suggests that their decision was not taken freely.  Even if our currency had not been statutorily linked to sterling, we should still have had to decide what to do in the interests of our trading and general economic position. That is something every country has to consider and decide upon when the par value of a major reserve currency is changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Britain devalued, countries all <Col N="1299" /> around the world assessed their own particular situations from their own point of view.  Some decided it would be in their best interests to follow suit while others decided they should not change at all.  A still further group of countries decided they should change but not to the full extent.  Each country looked to its own best interests and acted accordingly and so did we. We took our decision in regard to this matter, motivated solely by considerations of our national welfare.</P>
    <P>As I have said before I cannot understand what satisfaction some Deputies appear to get out of denigrating the financial status of this country. Why, for instance, did Deputy O'Higgins, the Fine Gael spokesman on finance, actually have to go to the Music Halls to get a term which would belittle the status and standing of the Irish Minister for Finance.  That just does not make sense to me.</P>
    <P>I want to put the record right: I am not doing it in any false motives of nationalistic beating of drums but simply because I think it is right that the people should know the truth about our currency.  Ours is a separate, independent currency and is one of the highest standing in the world of international money.  It is backed by more than ample reserves and by a sound external payments position.</P>
    <P>We carry on the overwhelming part of our trade in the sterling area.  In these circumstances, it is clearly to our advantage to have our £ on a par with the £ sterling.  If it ever became clear that our advantage required a different rate of exchange, we should be free&mdash; indeed, we always have been&mdash;to make that change.  These are the simple facts and I do not think there is any need for either denigration, on the one hand, or exaggeration, on the other.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism during the course of this debate about the Government's handling of the economy during recent years.  It is suggested that the Government were responsible for bringing about inflationary pressures in 1964 and then prolonging unnecessarily the deflationary measures which had to be <Col N="1300" /> taken in 1965.  Deputy Cosgrave, especially, seems to think there was deflation at all in this country until September of this year when some comparatively unimportant hire purchase restrictions were abolished.  The restrictive measures which had to be taken in 1965 were necessary to correct the excessive balance of payments deficit which came about in that year through a combination of internal and external factors.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made no reference to the difficulties created for us by the British import surcharge, by the slowing-down of expansion in the United Kingdom economy and by the falling-off in the net capital inflow to this country in 1965 as a result of restrictive measures taken by Britain and the United States.  The record shows clearly that these restrictive measures which we had to take were entirely successful.  The deficit on our balance of payments were reduced from £42 million in 1965 to £16 million in 1966 and in this year, 1967, it is fairly clear that there will be a small surplus.  That clearly shows that the corrective measures were carefully gauged and judiciously decided upon. The idea was to put the situation right on the external payments front and, at the same time, to minimise the effects of these measures on output and employment within the country.</P>
    <P>As soon as it became obvious that our external payments position was improving and that the situation was coming right, we initiated a series of reflationary measures: this began as early as the summer of 1966.  In July, 1966, we made extra money available for housing and sanitary services with the idea of maintaining the level of building activity: I forget whether the figure was £1 million or £1½ million but it was of that order.  In the following month, hire purchase restrictions on various commodities were removed to help to boost consumer demand. Later in 1966 the Central Bank advised the commercial banks to make an additional £10 million available to the private sector to help to encourage growth and investment.  In the Budget, in April, we increased current Government expenditure by £23 million, <Col N="1301" /> without any appreciable increase in taxation.  At the same time, we increased the public capital expenditure programme by £10 million.  All of these measures were designed to give stimulus to the economy and to encourage expansion.  There were other measures also but the ones to which I have referred are the most important.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of these series of measures was to get the economy moving forward again without upsetting the corrective trend we had established in the balance of payments.  The record clearly shows that there is no justification whatever for the criticism that the Government did not reflate the economy quickly enough: we did. We started as far back as summer, 1966, on the process of reflation.  The measures we took led to a substantial acceleration in growth which started in the second half of 1966 and continued into 1967.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear now that, for the year 1967, we shall achieve a growth rate of 4 per cent which can be regarded as satisfactory by European standards.  This growth rate, this performance of the economy, is all the more outstanding because it was achieved in conditions where the balance of payments was stable and also in conditions where there was a general slowing-down of growth throughout the world.  We are now back to the high growth rate that we achieved in the first half of this decade.</P>
    <P>I think I am justified in reminding those who now advocate reflationary measures, as did Deputy Cosgrave&mdash; indeed, most of the principal members of the Fine Gael Party supported him &mdash;that reflation has, in fact, taken place.  We now have a satisfactory growth rate.  I believe that the various influences now at work in the economy, together with the stimulation, which will be given by devaluation will enable us to keep national production rising at this rate of 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>I did not understand Deputy Donegan's references at all to the prospects of improvement in certain areas from devaluation The common external tariff of the EEC on industrial <Col N="1302" /> products is something around 14 or 15 per cent, on average.  It is quite clear that one effect of devaluation will be to offset to a greater or lesser extent that common external tariff as far as we are concerned.  If that does not give our exports of industrial goods an excellent chance of getting into these markets I do not know what will.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that Deputy Cosgrave kept talking about getting the economy moving forward.  He seems to think it is still in a depressed state which of course it is not.  The truth is that the whole free world suffered a serious setback in economic growth during 1965 and 1966.  All the impartial commentators, all the institutions agree that this was so.  The point is, however, that our economy, having suffered the setback for the various reasons which I have outlined and in common with most other western countries, pulled out of this recession far more quickly and effectively than most.  Any objective examination of the statistics shows this clearly, shows that far from our economy stagnating it is, in fact, moving forward at a satisfactory rate&mdash;four per cent this year, and I cannot see anything to indicate that we cannot keep up that growth rate.  I want to point out that a growth rate of four per cent is exactly twice the average of the OECD countries</P>
    <P>The recovery of our economy began in the second half of 1966 when output of transportable goods industries rose by eight per cent and that rate of expansion was carried on and improved upon in 1967.</P>
    <P>In the first half of 1967 the volume of output was 12 per cent up on what it was in the first half of 1966.  Productivity in industry has also increased very substantially this year.  In the first half of 1967 it increased by 8½ per cent and at the same time the real incomes of workers in industry rose by six per cent.  I think the most satisfactory aspect, however, of our economy during 1967 was the notable rise in our industrial exports.  They increased by what I regard as the remarkable figure of 28 per cent in the first half of this year.  Most Deputies are very well <Col N="1303" /> aware of what a key role the building industry plays in our economy.  It is a very good barometer of the general economic climate.  During the first nine months of this year housing starts&mdash; and this I think is one of the best indicators one can have of the level of activity&mdash;rose by 98 per cent.  The number of grants which were approved by local authorities for private houses is up by 1,000 on the same period for last year.</P>
    <P>In regard to employment also, while the situation is not as satisfactory as one would wish, there has been very considerable improvement.  Revised figures show that for the period 1961-1966 a total of 59,000 new jobs was created in the industrial and services sector of the economy.  That was an increase of practically 12,000 new jobs each year.  The figure of 59,000 in these sectors was offset, of course, by a fall of 45,000 in the agricultural sector. That resulted in a net increase in employment for the period of 14,000. If we had not had the decline in agricultural employment which is a feature of most European countries the position in regard to the creation of new jobs and employment would have been very satisfactory indeed.</P>
    <P>The rising trend in industrial production which I mentioned is continuing to provide more jobs.  In the second quarter of 1967 employment in transportable goods industries was 4,200 more than in the same quarter of 1966 and, as Deputy Seán Moore pointed out, this rise in employment has been accompanied by a very sharp fall in emigration.  Net emigration in the intercensal period, 1961-1966 was 17,000 a year.  That figure represents a reduction of 25,000 a year on the preceding period when the annual average was 42,000.  Comparing the two intercensal periods the net emigration figure has fallen from 42,000 to 17,000.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a more important figure still is that the same census return shows that our population has increased. Between 1961 and 1966 there was a rise of 63,000 in the population.  This is the first registered increase for over a century&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The high marriage and birth rates indicate that at present that there is a permanent upward movement in our population.  Most Deputies are familiar with the situation in regard to our balance of payments and it is a satisfactory achievement to have been able to wipe out a deficit of £42 million and turn it into a surplus. It would be wrong however to be too doctrinaire about these balance of payments figures because I think there is no doubt that if we are to get the expansion in the economy here that we need we shall have to contemplate balance of payments deficits.  Perhaps at the moment there is a need to generate more imports to encourage economic expansion.  While these figures on external account are very satisfactory as an indication of what our economy can do, we should not get ourselves into a frame of mind which would regard a surplus on our balance of payments as something we should seek to maintain in the long term.  But it is important for us to establish that we can achieve a surplus.  It also of course provides us with a cushion against difficulties which may arise in the future when the terms of trade or some other developments may go against us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hogan referred to the cost of foreign borrowing.  In my introductory speech I pointed out that devaluation had, of course, unfortunately increased the cost of servicing our foreign debt.  The non-sterling foreign indebtedness <Col N="1305" /> of the Government comes under three headings, first 107 million dollars in Marshall Aid loan, next, 21,500,000 dollars loan from the International Monetary Fund and finally 19.7 million dollars outstanding on the sterling-deutschmark loan.  The effect of devaluation is to increase our liability, in terms of Irish currency, by the full extent of the change.  This means that the value of the principal sum to be redeemed in terms of Irish currency has to be increased by £8.74 million. Interest payments, of course, are also affected.  The major effect of devaluation is on the $107 million worth of Marshall Aid loan which is still outstanding and we had actually considered, before devaluation, whether it would be a good thing to redeem the loan but, having regard to the low interest charged&mdash;it is only 2½ per cent &mdash;and the current cost of borrowing, we decided against.  There would have had to be a devaluation of from $2.8 to $2 to the pound and that appeared unlikely, before it would have been worth our while.  Most of the drawing from the IMF is, of course, free of interest.</P>
    <P>The loss on devaluation which we have suffered is partly offset by the saving in interest that the alternative borrowing would have entailed for us. There is also a loss in terms of non-devaluing currencies, in the value of the sterling reserves of the banking system which amount to £270 million.</P>
    <P>However, I want to make the point that this devaluation of our external assets is more apparent than real, because as reserves these are held in the sterling area, and are most likely to be used in the sterling area.  It is only really if we decided to take all our external reserves and to transfer them into non-devaluing currencies that we would feel the full effects of devaluation.  In so far as we continue to hold them in sterling for use in the sterling area, then their value is the same as it was before devalution.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we should have, over the years, diversified our external holdings We did not do that, or at least we did it only to a very limited extent, because of the facts of <Col N="1306" /> the situation.  First, there was the consideration that any large-scale sale of sterling by us would have contributed to the severe pressure already on sterling. Indeed, if we and other countries who hold sterling balances had joined in this queue of speculation, then we would almost certainly have made things much more difficult for sterling and perhaps have brought about a bigger devaluation than actually occurred.  But perhaps the more important consideration is that if we had changed from sterling into gold or dollars it would have involved a very considerable loss of revenue for us.  Gold, of course, is a non-earning asset and dollar securities do not pay anything like the same rate of interest as we are getting from our sterling investments.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Flanagan and others put forward the intriguing suggestion that we should immediately increase social welfare benefits and, at the same time, reduce taxation.  I have already given an assurance, and this really only reiterates the policy of this Government, that the position of social welfare recipients will, as a minimum, be safeguarded should there be significant price increases from any cause, devaluation or otherwise.  Deputy O'Higgins and others proposed that at the same time as we increase social welfare benefits we should also reduce the duties on tobacco and petrol.  Taking these two commodities, I do not think there is any need for a rise in tobacco prices for some time in view of the large stocks which are held, and any eventual increase should not amount even to a penny on the packet of 20.  The situation in regard to oil prices is complicated by the Suez situation, but it is again not clear that there will be any immediate increase in petrol prices as a result of devaluation. So far as I understand, no proposal for an increase in either the price of tobacco or petrol has been made to the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins linked these two proposals together, and made the extraordinary suggestion that we should, for its own sake, increase expenditure and <Col N="1307" /> reduce taxation.  He called that being flexible.  What it would amount to in fact would be creating a Budget deficit without regard to whether or not our economic circumstances would justify such a course.  Fine Gael clearly have in mind an <i>ad hoc</i> way out of temporary difficulties.  They emphasised that the tax reductions would be merely temporary.  Can anyone tell me what real benefit it would be to reduce duties for a few months on these commodities and then put them back on again, perhaps at a higher rate, in order to make good the revenue lost which had been suffered in the meantime?  It is quite a nonsensical proposal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish and others made the point that we had no choice in regard to the changing of our bank interest rates.  There is nothing peculiar at all about the fact that Irish interest rates tend to follow movements in rates in other countries.  This happens all over the world.  No country, not even the United States, can isolate itself entirely from international movements in interest rates.  Rates have gone up in Canada, in the European countries as well as in the USA.  I said in my opening remarks that we had to raise our bank rates in order to prevent any outflow of capital and to ensure that our domestic savings would be kept at home and would continue to be available to finance our various development programmes.  However, we do not automatically follow the British rates nor do we follow them to the same extent.  There was no change here in our rates following the increase in Britain in October and November, that is, prior to devaluation and, as Deputies know, our bank overdraft rates at present are a full one per cent below those obtaining in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked me for an assurance that there would be no credit restrictions here.  I have already indicated that there will not be.  In announcing the increase in interest rates, the Irish Banks Standing Committee emphasised that they expected to be able to continue to meet the normal demands for new and additional bank <Col N="1308" /> credit for the private sector.  Deputy O'Higgins suggested that we should subsidise interest rates for housing.  We have decided not to increase the Exchequer lending rate.  The 7 per cent rate at which money is made available to the Local Loans Fund for small dwellings loans and other local authority housing will not be changed. It will stay at 7 per cent, even though this 7 per cent is now well below the cost of borrowing in the open market.</P>
    <P>Under considerable provocation last week I referred to Deputy Dillon as a fraud.  Some Deputies may regard that as a bit harsh and, on reconsideration, I want to withdraw it and to say that in his approach to economic matters he is inconsistent; indeed he is inconsistent to the point of being totally unreliable.</P>

      <P>I always try to be orderly in this House and I am always sorry afterwards when I have been provoked into those exchanges but I do not think that I can be expected to sit quietly here and hear Deputy Dillon accuse me and my colleagues of being fraudulent, dishonest and so on.  I am always suspicious, maybe unreasonably so, of those who feel it necessary to go around parading their honesty and their idealism and by inference, of course, impugning the honesty and idealism of all the rest of us.  For my part I am, in public life, prepared to take the honesty and integrity of most people for granted until it is proved otherwise.</P>
      <P>I shall leave aside what I regard as some of Deputy Dillon's more out-of-date views, his propensity to see the world in black and white terms, the goods and bads, just like a television serial.  I would, however, like to deal with his economic views strictly on their merits.  I have said before, and Deputy L'Estrange probably thinks this is harsh too, that Deputy Dillon is easily the worst economist in this House.  I think that is so because he mixes up a lot of other things with his economics.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Dillon was giving his performance here last Wednesday&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;performance&rdquo; advisedly&mdash;it was quite clear to me that he was reflecting the real essence of Fine Gael philosophy.  The benches behind him all filled up and his colleagues were nodding and smiling their approval.  I wonder would they do that if they knew the full extent of the philosophy to which they were so readily nodding their approval. Deputy Dillon held up to us the ideas of the late Per Jacobsson as the only true gospel.  Let us look at some of those ideas as they are set out in the Banking Commission Report of 1938, in the drafting of which Per Jacobsson played a very large part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need remind Deputies that the whole trend of that report was conservative, to say the least of it.  In particular, it criticised the policy of the Government of the day for borrowing for housing purposes and the subsidisation of various housing schemes on the grounds that this adds to the growing burden of dead weight debt.  I want to say that, while my colleagues and I reject that <Col N="1310" /> philosophy, we are prepared to grant that Deputy Dillon and his Fine Gael colleagues may legitimately believe in it, but they cannot have it both ways. Deputy Dillon last April and again when he was speaking last week told us of the coalition Government's last period in office and said that though they were told it was wrong to spend money on building houses they went ahead and built them anyway.  But, of course, the Jacobsson philosophy which he espouses so clearly says the direct opposite.  It can be fairly well summed up in this way.  The Jacobsson philosophy is that if the financial situation is difficult, you should not build any houses and even if it is not difficult, you should not build houses if you have something better to do.  There is the basic inconsistency, the fundamental inconsistency of Deputy Dillon in all its stark reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

      <P>Not that there is any obligation on me, but I think for the record it would be fair to say that Deputy Dillon was very sweeping and very unfair in his presentation of Keynes as an apostle of inflation. Keynes had no such doctrine.  His contribution was to show us&mdash;and I think we should all be grateful to Keynes for this&mdash;that depression was not a necessary evil and that only proper management of demand would ensure that a nation's resources were fully used.  There is no evidence at all that he considered that constantly rising prices were essential to economic progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion have been attacked here.  Indeed, they have been scoffed at.  That is quite incomprehensible <Col N="1311" /> to me.  The inauguration of economic programming changed the entire economic history of this country.  It has altered the trend of centuries and set us moving forward at something approaching a satisfactory rate of growth.  The First Programme was entirely successful and the Second Programme has been moderately so. Let us just look at the record for a moment.  The First Programme raised national output by 23 per cent in five years.  During the five years 1959 to 1963 the following growth rates were achieved.  1959&mdash;4.9 per cent.  1960&mdash; 4.8 per cent.  1961&mdash;4.7 per cent.  1962 &mdash;3 per cent.  1963&mdash;3.9 per cent.  The average growth rate, therefore, for the five years was 4 per cent per annum. During the first four years of the Second Programme the following growth rates were achieved: 1964, 5 per cent; in 1965, 2.3 per cent; in 1966, 1 per cent, and in 1967, 4 per cent. That is a total of 12 per cent for the four years, or an average annual growth rate of 3 per cent.  The achievement of an annual average of 3 per cent is to be compared with the target figure of 4 per cent, so that we achieved 75 per cent or threequarters of the growth rate we set out to achieve.  While that is not entirely satisfactory, at the same time it is not bad and compares favourably with most other European countries.  What we must do now is see why we did not reach the 4 per cent target.  That examination is in hands and we hope to publish the results of it early in the new year.</P>
    <P>We have been criticised for not publishing a review of the Second Programme earlier on.  We have also been criticised for not revising the targets in the Second Programme when it became clear that we were not reaching them. I can give valid answers to both those criticisms.  In regard to the suggestion that we should have published a review before now the simple fact of the situation is that many of the reliable figures and final data necessary, are only now becoming available to us.  If we had published a review before now it is almost certain that it would have had to be revised.  However, the examination is practically completed and the <Col N="1312" /> results will be published early in the New Year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the criticism that we did not revise the Second Programme targets there is a very valid answer to that criticism also.  It must be borne in mind that the external environment in which the economy will have to perform is of critical importance in regard to economic programming. We did not revise the 1970 targets because, in the circumstances which exist now in regard to our EEC application, to do so would be quite unrealistic.  However, I want to assure Deputies that there is no question whatever of our abandoning economic programming or indeed allowing the next stage of our planning to be postponed for any length of time.  We have now had a great deal of experience in economic programming.  We have much more expertise and knowledge at our disposal now than when we began.  Above all I think the lesson of the First and Second Programmes is that while we can do much to control external circumstances, our economic future is not entirely beyond our control.  There is a great deal we can do to manage the economy and direct it in the way we want it to go.</P>
    <P>We had earlier this year an excellent report furnished by the National Industrial and Economic Council. That report shows what further progress must be achieved if we are to achieve full employment.  The Government has made it clear that we are in broad agreement with the Council's report and that we accept the challenge of full employment.  To increase employment has always been one of our basic aims and it was one of the motivating forces of the First and Second Programmes.  We have started work on the Third Programme.  It will be a programme of economic and social development.  It will come into operation as soon as possible after our application for membership of the EEC has been clarified.  Should it appear that the decision on our application will be unduly delayed then we shall have to prepare this Third Programme on the basis of the alternatives which are open to us.  I said in Drogheda that in the Third Programme <Col N="1313" /> there will be less prominence given to figures and more to strategic policies.  That does not mean that there will not be any quantification as Deputy Donegan seemed to imply. There has to be quantification.  Indeed, in Drogheda I outlined that as a minimum the Programme would have to include figures for gross national product and its main constituents such as industry, agriculture and services and on the other hand figures for gross national expenditure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The ideal thing from our point of view is that we would know that our application would be agreed to and then we could pitch the Third Programme to coincide with the transitional period.  Part of our experience from the First and Second Programmes is that a period of eight years is too long.  In future Programmes we should opt for shorter years and greater flexibility.  If there was anything wrong <Col N="1314" /> with the Second Programme it was, I think, that there was undue emphasis on quantification.  I agree that figures and quantification are necessary, first of all to devise a programme and, secondly, as guidelines against which to measure the progress you are or are not making.  There has to be a great deal of arithmetic and quantification, but these should not have as much prominence given to them as the Second Programme did.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed at the attitude that Fine Gael Deputies are taking towards the Government's policy of decentralisation.  I would, first of all, expect that this would be welcomed in principle on all sides of the House.  I would also have welcomed a good discussion on the implications of the policy, on the problems it will involve and perhaps have expected suggestions from Deputies in regard to it.  I want to contradict the suggestion that this announcement of ours, the decision to decentralise two Government Departments was a spur of the moment decision, or political gimmick.  I want to point out that as far back as 1964 the then Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, announced that it had been decided in principle that certain Government offices should be transferred from Dublin, and the statement of the Taoiseach on 16th November simply brings the Government's policy in relation to decentralisation up to date.  It seemed to us in the Government that the only way to achieve more satisfactory progress in regard to decentralisation was to take a firm decision to send certain named Departments to certain named provincial centres.  We realised when we were deciding that we were laying ourselves open to criticism for not sending other Departments to other centres.  We decided, however, to make a start and when the Government had come to this primary decision I was authorised to meet representatives of the Staff Associations and tell them of our decision in advance of the Taoiseach making a public announcement and also to assure them that they would be fully consulted and full regard had to their wishes and requirements at every stage of the decentralisation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have asked me if the staff were consulted.  I want to say they were not consulted because they could not in the nature of things be consulted, but they were seen and informed that there would be full consultation with them as matters proceeded.  In fact, <Col N="1316" /> that consultation is now under way through the recognised machinery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While the British market for pigmeat has become less economic for some of the other principal suppliers which have not devalued or have devalued to a smaller extent than Ireland, the prices obtainable there for Irish pigmeat are not directly affected by devaluation.  In the case of bacon, prices are primarily determined by market conditions influenced by the quota supply arrangements under the Multilateral Bacon Understanding. Fresh pork prices in Britain are not affected as the supplies consist of home-produced and Irish.  When supplies of pigs increase sufficiently to enable us to resume exports of pigmeat to other markets our competitive position in those markets will be improved in relation to that of most of our competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> On the production side, the pig industry may be affected by higher prices for imported feed but effects of this will be limited by the fact that much of the pig feed is home produced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard the balconies in the Ballymun flats as being inferior in safety standards to those in any of the other housing estates of Dublin Corporation or abroad, and accordingly I do not propose to seek to have them altered.  I am informed that, in fact, the design of these balconies had particular regard to safety factors.  Whether families with children should be housed in high level flats is a different matter but I understand that the decision <Col N="1324" /> of the Corporation to do so is of quite recent origin.  I can appreciate that some families with children might be more concerned than others with relative height wherever the flats may be located, but this is a matter for the consideration of the housing authority by whose decision such families are rehoused.</P>
      <P>If the Corporation should decide that these balconies should be screened they can, of course, do so.</P>

      <P>Therefore, the Minister knows what I am talking about. If the Minister is so aware, is he conscious of the fact that when one alights from the lift in the eight-storey building, there is to the right a very low wall, not more than a couple of feet high, and at most three feet high, and that beyond that there is a clear drop? Can he be satisfied in his mind that this kind of design, which is not to be found elsewhere in Dublin, and therefore he cannot have experience of or be familiar with such buildings, is satisfactory from his own point of view, first of all, as being the principal authority responsible for the National Building Agency?  Further, will he look at this matter again as one of urgency in view of the fact that a large number of public representatives are fearful of what may occur in the light of the fact that we are now in a position to take some steps at least to prevent the possibility of unfortunate accidents which might even apply to adults, not alone to children, in the future?

That is what I am talking about.  It is <Col N="1325" /> to the right of the lift as you alight on those floors.  I am not specifically referring to balconies which are outside the flats themselves.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Cluskey</b> asked the Minister for Local Government what positive and immediate redress a tenant has where it is found that the landlord appears to be deliberately allowing his property to go into disrepair and as a consequence forcing the tenant to either accept the resulting appalling conditions or to vacate the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from any right <Col N="1326" /> to action which a tenant may have at law under his tenancy agreement or otherwise, he could, under the provisions of the Housing Act, 1966, take up with the housing authority the question of disrepair of the house in which he is living.  In addition, section 114 of the Act of 1966 may be relevant. Under this section there is an implied obligation on the landlord to maintain a house of which the tenancy started after the commencement of the section and in respect of which the rent does not exceed £130 a year.</P>
      <P>Section 70 of that Act provides that a housing authority shall make bye-laws in relation to houses let for rent or other valuable consideration to ensure the execution of any repairs necessary to maintain the structure of the houses and to ensure proper drainage, ventilation, cleanliness, lighting, cooking and washing arrangements. The section provides for penalties of up to £25, and up to £5 a day for a continuing offence.</P>
      <P>Pending the making of bye-laws under section 70, the bye-laws to similar effect under older enactments continue in force.  Penalties under these bye-laws generally provide for a maximum fine of up to £5 and up to £2 a day for a continuing offence.</P>
      <P>In addition, section 66 of the Act of 1966, empowers housing authorities to require owners to repair unfit houses capable of repair at reasonable expense.  The penalty for non-compliance with the requirements of a housing authority under the section is a fine of up to £200.  The Act enables an authority themselves to do the work, on default of the owner, and recover the cost from him.</P>
      <P>I would also refer the Deputies to the reply No. 88 on 23rd November, 1967, by the Minister for Justice in regard to section 15 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, which confers certain rights on tenants of rent-restricted premises seeking to have repairs carried out.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation have from time to time considered the question of providing pedestrian subways at locations in central Dublin.  No plans or specific proposals in the matter have, however, been submitted to my Department.  In 1962 in reply to an enquiry from the Corporation the then Minister for Local Government stated that he would be prepared to agree in principle to meeting out of the Corporation's road fund allocations expenditure on the provision of suitably designed pedestrian subways at places where the need for them could be <Col N="1331" /> clearly established judged by the following criteria:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) that pedestrian traffic at the particular place could not adequately be accommodated when vehicular traffic was halted in the normal course of traffic control;</P>
      <P>(2) that the subway would be provided at the site most likely to be effective and would fit in with other proposals for the improvement of traffic flow in the area, and</P>
      <P>(3)  that the use of the subway by pedestrians would not be so tedious as to render surface crossings preferable to the pedestrians.</P>
      <P>Recently, while considering a specific project the Corporation were advised that it is doubtful if they have legal power to provide a pedestrian subway. The preparation of legislation necessary to give this power is being considered.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary)</i> asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider the introduction of legislation at present to repeal the Currency Act, 1927 so as to abolish the statutory linkage of the Irish pound to a sterling currency which has undergone repeated devaluation in recent times and to give this country more financial independence and freedom of action in the event of future devaluations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the implication in the question that because of the provisions of the Currency Act, 1927 this country has not got full financial independence and freedom of action in relation to the exchange value of the Irish pound. Subject to the obligations which we share with over a hundred other countries under the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, the determination of the par value of the Irish pound is a matter for ourselves. The arrangement made in 1927 was a deliberate decision of the Oireachtas and it can be altered at any time if the Oireachtas considers this course desirable.</P>
      <P>When we joined the International Monetary Fund we established with the Fund a par value for the Irish pound in terms of gold.  There is possible incompatibility between the provisions of the Currency Act of 1927 and the Bretton Woods Agreements Act of 1957, which governs our relations with the Fund, and I am considering how best to resolve this difficulty.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 49 and 50 together.  When the Government approved of this development scheme in 1963 it was estimated that the cost would be of the order of £275,000. Since then extra works have been approved and there have been increases in the labour and material costs.  The cost to date is approximately £370,000 and the total cost is now estimated at £465,000.  It is expected that the works will be completed by the end of the next financial year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 58 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Importers are not obliged to notify me in advance of price increases unless they propose to increase the margin of profit they take.  Coal importers did <Col N="1352" /> in fact give me advance notice of price increases due to devaluation and on the basis that they were not increasing their margins of profit I raised no objection.</P>
    <P>It appears that coal importers held stocks, sufficient for one to two weeks' requirements, of American, German and Belgian coal at the time they gave me advance notice of their proposal. These were the coals they proposed to increase in price.  It also appears that where these stocks were paid for before devaluation they are being sold at predevaluation prices; where they were not paid for they must now be paid for at the new rate of exchange, making a price increase necessary.</P>
    <P>I should say that the price of Polish coal, which is largely used, has not been increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say why so little English coal is used?  Why is so much of the other types being sold?  Is the Minister aware that coal merchants are charging 2/-per bag extra and they do not say on the bag what the country of origin of the coal is?  The fact is that all coal has gone up for the past fortnight by 2/- per bag.  Is the Minister further aware that coal merchants have produced a letter from the Minister's Department saying they are entitled to charge this extra 2/-?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the letter they produced, but I am quite certain they have not produced a letter from my Department stating that all coal may be increased in price.  The increases authorised are the increases I have mentioned.  They relate to American, German and Belgian coal. The total imports of steam coal, including household coal, come out at approximately 40 per cent USA, 30 per cent Polish, 20 per cent German and ten per cent British.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister contend that this ten per cent increase <Col N="1353" /> means the profit margin is exactly what it was before devaluation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a slight complication in one case in that a large quantity of coal which had arrived and was being distributed at the predevaluation price has to be paid for now at a higher price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

He will then know whether or not the full price is being charged for all coal.  Would he have the matter further investigated because I believe there is a fiddle?</P>

There was one in 1966.  All the investigations that have taken place by my Department indicate that prices in butchers' shops rise when the price of cattle or sheep rises and come down when these prices come down, but they do not always react upwards immediately and do not come down as much as cattle and sheep prices come down or, indeed, go up as much as those prices go up.  In other words, there is a certain element of carrying in the price.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the medical costs involved in the caring for mentally handicapped children, he will consider allowing them free medical service regardless of family income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Health services for the mentally handicapped are provided as part of the general health services and are dealt with under the general legislation in connection with the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The services are provided free of charge for persons in the lower income group and their dependants and for pupils of national schools, where the defect is discovered at school health <Col N="1357" /> examinations.  Apart from the school children mentioned, as regards persons in the middle income group and their dependants, institutional services may be provided free or at a charge not exceeding 10/- a day and, as regards persons outside the lower and middle income groups, if in the opinion of the health authority, they would be unable without undue hardship, to provide the institutional services needed for themselves or their dependants, they also may be given these services free or subject to a charge.</P>
    <P>I understand that where there is provision for a charge health authorities in determining the amount of the charge, or whether to impose any, take into account the long-term nature of the service which has to be provided for most mentally-handicapped persons. All but six per cent of patients in the special institutions are health authority patients and the amount of revenue collected by health authorities in respect of patients for whom they accept liability is very small.  It amounted to an average of slightly less than 7d per day per patient in a recent year.</P>

      <P>There is only one <Col N="1359" /> other matter to which I wish to refer and that is to inform the House that, for some time, we have been making an investigation into the system of indirect taxation in operation in the countries of Europe.  We have been doing this in connection with our application for EEC membership and also as a comparative exercise with regard to our own taxation structure.</P>
      <P>Experts have visited European countries and have studied the system of value-added tax in operation there. Most Deputies know that the commission have directed that all Member Countries of EEC should change over to the French system of value-added tax by 1970.  It is my intention to publish as early as possible in the New Year a White Paper giving full information about the value-added tax so that the Dáil and the public may understand it fully and be in a position to discuss it should we, at any stage, decide that it is in our interests to introduce a similar type of taxation system here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a final word on devaluation.  I maintained, all along, that we should have preferred it if devaluation had not happened.  In order to get over their economic difficulties, the British could have adopted other methods which would have been much more harmful from our point of view and, of the two principal methods open to the British to adopt, from our point of view devaluation was certainly the less harmful.</P>
      <P>I have tried at all times to keep devaluation in perspective.  It creates problems for us but it also opens up opportunities for us.  Our economy is in good shape at the moment.  The external balance of payments situation is satisfactory.  Industrial production is rising.  Our exports are behaving admirably. Our growth rate is four per cent.  With the economy in this shape, there is no reason why we should not be able to take this devaluation in our stride.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an entirely different situation from that which obtains in Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Our economic situation is at present different from that which obtains in Great Britain and, if we did not have such very close trading relationship and such economic ties with Britain, there is nothing in our situation which would dictate that we should devalue.  I think I have dealt with that ground very fully.  I repeat that there is no question on my part or on the part of the Government of being complacent about this matter. We are fully aware of all the problems that devaluation has for us as well as the advantages and keeping them all in mind and having due regard to them, we still feel it presents us with great opportunities to go out and get new business and improve our situation and that, all in all, it is something that with national purpose and determination, we can take in our stride.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Trustees (Authorised Investments) Order, 1966, </P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft has been laid before the House. </P>
      <P>The Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958 defines the investments in which trustees may invest trust funds unless expressly forbidden by the instrument, if any, creating the trust.  The Minister for Finance may vary the authorised investments by Order.  The primary qualification for trustee investments is that they should be secure, and, subject to this, that they should give a favourable income to the life tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Order before the House for approval is to add Bank of Ireland Loan Stock 1986/91 to the list of trustee authorised investments. The loan stock was issued in connection with the acquisition last year by <Col N="1370" /> the Bank of Ireland of the Irish business of the National Bank.  Shareholders of the National Bank received 36s 6d in cash and 20s nominal amount of the loan stock for each share held by them.  The stock was issued at par and bears interest at 7% per annum.</P>
    <P>The total amount of stock issued was £6,000,000 and roughly two-thirds of this was received by Irish shareholders of the National Bank.  It is repayable at par between 1986 and 1991.  Registered holders have the right to subscribe in cash for an aggregate of £15 nominal amount of Capital Stock of the Bank of Ireland in respect of each £100 nominal amount of the loan stock held by them.  The subscription rights will be exercisable on 30th April in the years 1969 to 1971 inclusive at specified prices.</P>
    <P>The loan stock is quoted on the Irish and London Stock Exchanges.  The price on the Dublin Stock Exchange on 24th November, 1967, was £108 being a premium of £8 on the issue price.</P>
    <P>The Capital Stock of the Bank of Ireland has been a trustee investment here and in Britain for about a century. The loan stock has been given trustee status in Britain and I am satisfied that it is a suitable stock for addition to the authorised trustee investments in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is obliged under the Act to consult with the following persons in regard to the terms of any order he proposes to make to vary the list of authorised investments&mdash;a Judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Public Trustee, the Chairman of the Irish Bank's Standing Committee, the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, the President of the Dublin Stock Exchange and the President of the Cork Stock Exchange. I have consulted all these persons and they have no objections to the proposed Order.</P>
    <P>I recommend the motion for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We have no objection to the proposed Order, but I should like to avail of this opportunity to say that from time to <Col N="1371" /> time the funds of minors and other persons who come under the wardship of the courts are invested in what are regarded as, and what are, trustee securities, and not infrequently a loss is suffered on these securities because they fall in value.  For instance, a minor aged 14 or 15 may be awarded a couple of thousand pounds, and that sum may be invested in trustee securities, perhaps National Loan of one issue or another, and by the time that minor reaches the age of 21 he finds that the value of the stock in question has fallen.  It does not always happen; sometimes he makes a profit, but if it falls in value he suffers a loss.</P>
      <P>There should be some funds available to indemnify minors and other wards of court against this loss.  It did strike me a few times in this House, when the unclaimed funds standing to the credit of wards of court were being voted in this House for one allegedly worthy cause or another, it would be much better to use some of those funds to reimburse minors and other wards of court who, through no fault of their own, suffer a loss through the fall in value of these securities.  I suggest now that the Minister give this proposal of mine some thought, and I am sure it is a proposal that would meet with the approval of the Members of this House.  It is merely a proposal that unclaimed funds should be devoted to making up losses suffered by wards of court through the fall in value of trustee securities in which their money is invested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to this motion either, but I think what Deputy Fitzpatrick suggests is reasonable.  From time to time, people who appear to have their funds securely invested or had them invested for them as wards of court, are surprised to find that when they want to avail of the funds when they reach the appropriate age, the value has depreciated considerably, and in one case I know of, very considerably.  There should be some way, such as that suggested by Deputy Fitzpatrick, in which the value of the investment could be guaranteed.  After all, the <Col N="1372" /> court does guarantee minors their money or should guarantee them their money.  If it was suggested when an award was being made in respect of a minor, say, of £2,000, that that would be very much less when that minor reached the age of majority, everybody would raise his hands in horror and say this could not happen and should not happen.  We all know it does happen, and if Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion is feasible, it should be adopted and, if not, the Government should find some way in which they could guarantee such funds.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are quite aware the Dáil adjourned on Thursday the 23rd before I had finished reading my speech on the Estimates.  I had dealt only with housing and sanitary services. I now come to roads.  In regard to roads and road traffic, the objective of my Department continues to be to secure greater safety and efficiency in the use of our roads and in pursuing this major aim to use to the best possible effect the overall resources, <Col N="1373" /> necessarily limited, available for the work.</P>
      <P>Perhaps in no part of my Department's work is the need for team effort more apparent than in that of road safety because here we are seeking to get the whole community&mdash;since practically every man, woman and child is a road user &mdash; to play a part. The agencies which my Department work with here include the Department of Education and the Gardaí, the local authorities, Radio Telefís Éireann and, of course, the Safety First Association of Ireland.  They all co-operate in the annual campaigns run by my Department such as that conducted in the early summer this year, the chief feature of which was a nationwide road safety competition in the schools.  A further &ldquo;campagin&rdquo; is being run this month and the chief feature of it is a nationwide competition based on the &ldquo;Rules of the Road&rdquo;, a completely new edition of which is being issued.  There will also be a drive aimed at pedestrians and cyclists, with special emphasis on after-dark protection.</P>
      <P>These &ldquo;campaigns&rdquo; as they are called, are only the peaks of work that goes on throughout the year.  Thus, the Safety First Association, with the help of a grant from the Road Fund, employs full-time officers covering a great part of the country, who are constantly at work stimulating local and personal interest in road safety. My Department throughout the year continues to turn out films and leaflets and to co-operate with Radio Telefís Éireann in the production of material for use on television and, having consulted with the Department of Education and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, is preparing visual aids to road safety instruction in the primary schools.  These aids will take the form of special charts which will enable teachers to combine road safety instruction with the teaching of Irish and English.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to take the opportunity of expressing to all the bodies, a number of whom I have not mentioned by name, who co-operate with my Department in road safety work, my sincere appreciation and to thank in particular <Col N="1374" /> the members of the advisory committee on propaganda which has now been working with my Department for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I think that those engaged on road safety work deserve appreciation, if for no other reason, for the fact that, despite all their efforts, the accident rate is on the move up and in particular fatal accidents have continued to increase.  This is no reflection on the quality and intensity of the work being done on road safety propaganda; without it, without sustaining and developing it, things could be much worse.  As I shall mention later, research into road accidents is being undertaken on a comprehensive scale by An Foras Forbartha, but such studies as we have been able to conduct to date indicate that to many of out roads the volume of traffic has reached a level at which a sharp increase in accident rates can be expected.  It is a major aim of our road programme to carry out as quickly as possible the road traffic improvements necessary to take the increasing traffic in safety, but all the improvements needed cannot obviously be carried out simultaneously so that, for the present, we shall have to place most of our reliance on other methods&mdash;traffic management, propaganda and legal controls such as those envisaged in the Road Traffic Bill.  I trust that, when we come to renew the debate on that Bill, those taking part will bear in mind the sombre background to it, the accident statistics.</P>
    <P>Most of the controls applied under the existing law are of course aimed at securing greater road safety, others at improving traffic flow.  During the year these controls were maintained, developed and improved.  One of the most important safety controls is comprised in the scheme of driving tests, which has now become an accepted part of the procedure for driver licensing.  In fact, the numbers of applications for tests being dealt with by my Department have grown at the rate estimated at the time the scheme was being designed.  These numbers, which are currently running at about 1,000 per week, will undoubtedly continue to increase for some years to come and the additional staff needed to <Col N="1375" /> handle the increasing numbers of tests are being recruited.</P>
    <P>In all, since the inception of the scheme in March, 1964, more than 78,000 tests have been carried out and the rate of failure in these tests has been just 52 per cent.  The driving test is a test of competence and simply aims at ensuring that a person who passes the test can drive safely to a satisfactory standard.  It seems obvious that many people undertake the test without adequate preparation.  This shows a regrettable lack of appreciation of the serious responsibility involved in driving a motor vehicle in modern conditions.</P>
    <P>Another important safety control is that of speed limits.  The comprehensive review of speed limits on all routes is now nearing completion; all but four counties have been examined.  In order to ensure that the proposed amendments come into operation as soon as possible, a separate set of regulations is being introduced for each county.  Regulations for eight counties have already been made; regulations to cover the remainder will be introduced as quickly as possible.  With the completion of the review there will be a more uniform and reasonable application of speed limits throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I come now to the problem of traffic flow, a problem that becomes ever more complex with the growing volume of vehicles on the roads.  The Road Traffic Bill, in addition to its provisions on road safety, has a number of proposals designed to improve traffic and parking conditions.  In traffic matters, the primary functions rest with the Gardaí and the local authorities, and I operate largely as a consenting and enabling authority.  During the year I gave my consent to 14 sets of local traffic and parking bye-laws and temporary rules.  Nine car parks were provided with the aid of grants from the Road Fund and the subheads for Urban and Rural Employment Schemes.  A number of sets of traffic light signals and pedestrian lights were provided with the aid of Road Fund grants.  During the year the Road Traffic (Signs) Regulations were <Col N="1376" /> amended to prescribe for the redimensioning of roadway markings, such as centre and lane lines suitable for present day traffic and speeds, and to prescribe a new traffic sign to indicate the existence of a clearway.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, the co-operation in traffic matters between my Department, the Corporation, the Gardaí and CIE continued. Meetings of a committee of officials representative of these bodies took place at regular intervals.  During the year the committee was broadened to include representatives of Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  The Committee is primarily concerned with securing more efficient use of existing facilities.</P>
    <P>During the year some additions were made to the one-way street system by temporary rules made by the Garda Commissioner with my consent.  There has been an improvement in traffic flow in the central city area following on the one-way system, but this can soon be negatived by increased traffic, and indeed it led to a shift of the congestion to the suburban radial routes. Action to deal with these will proceed in two stages.  First, comes the introduction of a simple clearway regulation, such as was introduced some time ago on the Rathmines and Ranelagh routes.  The system worked very successfully there and facilitated the movement in peak hours of buses, which carry the majority of the workers to and from the central city area. Accordingly it has been extended recently to other radial routes and will no doubt be extended to still more in the future.</P>
    <P>Remedial measures give ease for a time only, that is, if traffic continues to build up, and ultimately a decision must be reached as to whether conditions will be allowed to become chaotic or whether restrictions will be imposed on the use of the streets in the central city area.  One does not have to be an expert to realise that, if a whole lot of radial routes discharge all the traffic they can into a limited central area, and most of that traffic seeks to park in the limited area, chaos will result.</P>
    <P>Everyone is familiar with the sight of large streams of private cars pourpose <Col N="1377" /> ing into the city each morning with generally only one or two persons in each car.  Great numbers of these cars are left on the city streets until the evening rush begins in the reverse direction.  The provision of central off-street car parks will not solve the problem because the existence of such car parks will attract more commuters in the morning and, at the evening peak, the full complement of cars will be discharged on to the limited street system.  To remove the limitations of the existing street system would involve an enormous amount of capital expenditure and I cannot visualise a time when sufficient capital can be diverted from more pressing needs to redesign radically our city streets to cater for all the foreseeable commuter traffic that would want to use them each morning and evening during rush hours.  An obvious solution, at this stage, is to limit severely parking in the central city area.  The parking meter enables priority in such kerbside parking as is available to be given to the short-term parker.  Parking meters will help to ensure that bus traffic will be able to operate at reasonable speed and buses are at present used by the majority of central city workers.  I am satisfied that commuting by private cars which congest city streets by all day kerbside parking cannot be allowed to cause inconvenience to the public and dislocate business and public transport.  What I have said indicates that I accept that <i>prima facie</i> there is a case for the introduction of parking meters in the central city area, but when I formally receive the Garda proposals in this regard I shall of course consider any representations made, in particular the views of the local authority.</P>
    <P>So much for the traffic that uses the roads and now as to the roads themselves. First I should say that, while traffic continued to increase, there was a substantial shortfall in the revenue from motor taxation for 1966/67 due to a number of factors, including a substantial drop in the number of new vehicles registered.  The shortfall in the income of the Fund amounted in all to £550,000, an estimate of £9.75 million having realised only £9.2 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1378" /> The shortfall would have been serious enough in itself but it occurred at a time when commitments, incurred in the expectation of a continuing surge of revenue, had risen to a critical figure&mdash;£6,500,000 on 31st March, 1967, compared with £5,200,000 on 31st March 1966.  Corrective action was necessary.  If this were to take the form of extra money for roads, it could be secured only by extra taxation or at the expense of other programmes such as those for housing, education and health.  It was necessary, therefore, to reduce the Road Fund allocations for 1967/68 and this was effected chiefly by reducing the Main Road Improvement Grant.  Fortunately the effect on the works programme of local authorities was not what the reduction in allocations would suggest. The total of grants allocated in a particular year is not an exact measure of the likely expenditure on roads in that year because the grants allocated will not all be spent in that year. This is due to timelags associated with land acquisition, the preparation of plans, specifications and the placing of contracts.</P>
    <P>In last year's debate on the Estimate for my Department reference was made to various studies which have been undertaken into important aspects of road policy by my Department and by An Foras Forbartha.  What I might call research of this kind goes on the whole time and is extremely important. The establishment of An Foras Forbartha, however, enabled it to be carried out on a planned, comprehensive scale.  The staff of An Foras engaged on roads has now been brought up to a full working standard.  Their work is grouped in three sections&mdash; road traffic, road construction and road safety.</P>
    <P>A programme of work has been put in hands, not merely on research, since the scope of the Institute's activities goes beyond that to education and training as well.  A number of courses for engineers have been conducted. Perhaps one of the most hopeful of the jobs which An Foras have undertaken is the collection, in co-operation with the Gardaí and the Central Statistics Office, of up-to-date statistics on road <Col N="1379" /> accidents with a view to conducting a scientific analysis of the factors involved and recommending the remedial action that might be taken.  It will be some time before sufficient data are built up to give the end product of remedial action, and in this matter of road accidents I would be slow to hold out the hope of a magic answer.  But I personally am convinced that this is the way to tackle the problem and I am more than hopeful that this method will pay in the long run.</P>
    <P>Last year a grant of £42,280 was made from the Road Fund to An Foras for road research.  An Foras works in very close association with my Department. It also has the assistance of very active committees of experts in the various areas of research and this ensures both the quality and practicality of the work done.  Close contact is also maintained with research being carried out abroad.</P>
    <P>The current work programme of An Foras includes, in addition to the items I have mentioned already, research on traffic signs, systematic traffic counting, road standards, pavement design, and road drainage.  It has appointed consultants to prepare a report on street lighting and this report will be available shortly.  Grants for post-graduate research have been made to University College, Dublin, and Trinity College Engineering Schools for investigations into the characteristics of peat subgrades and boulder clays, respectively.</P>
    <P>Good progress at both local and regional levels has been maintained with the physical planning programme. The 1st October this year was the date before which development plans were required to be made under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  By the 1st October, 78 plans had been made.  The Act enables extensions of the deadline to be allowed in particular cases and 40 planning authorities have applied for extensions.</P>
    <P>The position is, therefore, that over 44 per cent of all development plans were made by the 1st October, and, taking into account the position which has been reached in the remaining areas, progress generally is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1380" /> I want to commend those planning authorities who have been the pacemakers; those who have overcome their difficulties and made their plans within the three years stipulated by the Act. I accpet that the failure of other planning authorities to emulate their example could, in the big majority of cases, be attributed to reasons beyond their control.  It was clear for some time before 1st October that circumstances were conspiring to make full compliance with the statutory deadline impossible.</P>
    <P>From the beginning, planning authorities were working under a considerable handicap in that it was, and still is, difficult to recruit qualified planners. My Department and An Foras Forbartha have done what they could to fill this gap by providing advice and guidance for planning authorities, including the organisation of courses and seminars for local planning staffs. Planning courses are now established in the College of Technology, Bolton Street, and in University College, Dublin.  Trainee planners have been recruited by my Department and Dublin Corporation also are taking steps to recruit trainees.  The prospects of a progressive improvement in the supply of qualified planners are brightening.</P>
    <P>The local elections earlier this year interrupted progress with the preparation of planning programmes.  In a big number of areas new members were elected who had to familiarise themselves with planning policies and proposals. In addition, the time needed to comply properly with the statutory provisions for public consultation in regard to draft plans had not been fully appreciated by many planning authorities.  The draft plans were on public display for three months and representations and objections made during that period have to be considered by the councils before the plans are made.  Ratepayers making objection are entitled, on request, to be heard orally.  Considerable interest was evinced in the draft plans and it is important that councils should fully consider the views of the public, even if this involves some delay in making the plans.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> This is a part of the planning process which I would not like to see rushed. Where a council genuinely needs more time to consider representations I am not denying it to them, within reason. I must make it clear, however, that it would be unwise of any planning authority to seek to exploit this situation to procrastinate in making their plan.  Each application for an extension is considered on its individual merits and an extension will not be given unless I am satisfied that the planning authority is making reasonable progress.  Planning authorities who have not yet made their plans will be expected to complete the task within the extended periods allowed.  I am confident that the majority of the outstanding development plans will be made by the end of the present year and the balance before the 31st March next.  It is important that development plans should be generally operational as soon as possible and every effort will be maintained to secure this objective.</P>
    <P>As the title of the Planning and Development Act implies, development is the essential corollary of meaningful planning.  The Act has brought about a radical change in the purpose and potential of local government.  It has placed local authorities in a strong position to assume a positive role in promoting economic and social development at local level.  They must avail of the initiative so provided and make the most of their opportunities and resources.  Physical planning is very much a matter of creating the right environment for new activity. Local authorities must exploit and supplement their planning activities by promotional work aimed at increasing investment, employment and the circulation of money in their areas.  It is difficult to overlook the importance of the development plan machinery in this regard.  I see the plans as blueprints for local development.</P>
    <P>A well-conceived development plan will make for close co-ordination in the activities of local authorities in housing, the provision of services and the improvements of communications. It will enable these programmes to be related to private investment needs.  It <Col N="1382" /> will be the framework within which planning authorities will provide sites for housing&mdash;both local authority and private&mdash;and direct incentives for private enterprise, such as industrial sites, the promotion of renewal in cities and towns, and the development of local amenities.  To make the most of these opportunities, planning authorities will need to cultivate an active development outlook and to give increasing attention to the promotional aspects of local government responsibility.</P>
    <P>The first development plans are relatively simple documents.  Their purpose is to give expression to a basic planning policy and to provide a framework for development in the coming five years. In many areas special traffic and other basic studies are in progress and the results of these will have to be incorporated in future plans or in amendments of the initial plans.  Planning is a continuous process and the Act provides that the development plans must be reviewed at least once in every five years, thus enabling the authorities to take account of experience and of new requirements.  In themselves, however, these first plans are important and valuable as the beginning of comprehensive local planning for development. The plan programme has generated much discussion, and some controversy, about local development proposals. This is a very welcome indication of growing public interest in the work of local planning authorities and in the potential of planning.</P>
    <P>The regional planning studies which are being carried out by United Nations consultants in association with An Foras Forbartha are due to be completed in March next.  The purpose of the studies is to provide information on the opportunities and needs which exist in regard to regional development and also to provide advice on the means by which regional development potential might best be realised.  The studies, therefore, are a major part of the ground work for further decisions on regional development policy.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin and Limerick regions, studies have already been completed and outline development plans prepared by consultants.  The views of local authorities and other interests on these <Col N="1383" /> recommendations, which are advisory, have been invited.</P>
    <P>The programme of development plans under the Planning and Development Act and the Regional Studies Programme have very important implications for the future location and distribution of employment and of industrial growth.  The designation of a systematic hierarchy of centres of economic and social growth and the promotion of regional development on such a basis is our best hope of effecting a change in the trend towards an unhealthy imbalance in national development as between different areas of the country.  It is important that these problems should be tackled now, and that they should be tackled strenuously, because established patterns will not be changed overnight and there are already good grounds for concern.</P>
    <P>The planning consultant for the Dublin region has estimated that, on the basis of current trends, the population of the Dublin metropolitan area is likely to increase by 200,000 in the next 20 years and he has made recommendations for a physical development plan to accommodate this expansion. These expectations are supported by the most recent census returns.  As I have already emphasised, however, the consultant's recommendations are only advisory.</P>
    <P>Such an expansion of Dublin would certainly create great problems of physical accommodation but, most important, it must be known and shown what the implications of Dublin growth on this scale would be for the rest of the country.  Plans for the future expansion of Dublin must be part of a national development programme benefiting all regions.  This will almost certainly involve a measure of concentration in promotional effort and investment in those areas which have the potential to fill the role of regional centres of economic and social growth. In this way a development momentum can be generated which will benefit all areas.</P>
    <P>The report of the regional consultants will include advice on the best lines on which to proceed.  Obviously this advice and the regional studies <Col N="1384" /> generally will need to be jointly evaluated when the study programme is completed.  To help in this work a special committee, the regional Development Committee, has been established in my Department to advise on matters relating to regional planning and development.  This committee is representative of all the Departments with development interests, and arrangements are actively under consideration to enable it to meet the greatly increased demands which will be made on it as we move from the stage of regional study to the formulation and promotion of regional development programmes.</P>
    <P>The regional planning consultants have had a series of meetings locally with representatives of the planning authorities in each region.  As the statutory planning authorities for their areas, local councils will have a major contribution to make in translating the idea of regional development into reality.  I believe that a regional association of planning authorities, with which representatives of industrial and tourist interests would be associated, would be desirable for the successful promotion of development centres and other regional objectives. Such a group is already in existence in the Limerick region.  It includes the chairman and officials of the planning authorities and representatives of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  The Industrial Development Authority, the Regional Tourism Organisation and my Department are also represented.</P>
    <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to commend the foresight and initiative of the local planning authorities and other local interests concerned in coming together in this way to discuss their common problems and to see what they can do jointly to advance their region.  I propose to make early arrangements to encourage and facilitate the establishment of similar groups in other regions.  The groups will be instrumental in spreading the regional outlook at local level, in involving the interests which they represent in concerted effort and in presenting the regional point of view at national level. <Col N="1385" /> Under the aegis of An Foras Forbartha, a model development plan for Galway City which will provide guidance on the application of modern planning techniques and standards to the development of growth centres has been completed and is at present with the United Nations who, I understand, will send it to An Foras shortly for publication.  Other planning studies completed deal with matters such as the provision to be made in development plans for traffic in small towns and for industrial development.</P>
    <P>Seminars have been held by An Foras to spread the fruits of research and experience for the benefit of all and I know that these have been of great value to local planners in particular in preparing their development plans.  A welcome innovation in the planning work of An Foras during the year was the engagement of Irish consultant-planners to undertake, in addition to the study of the Connemara Gaeltacht, central area development in Waterford City, and shopping centre development in Arklow.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of planning and development, I must refer briefly to the question of planning appeals.  The number of appeals under consideration on 1st April, 1966, was 901.  The number of new appeals submitted in the year ended 31st March, 1967, was 1,229, compared with 1,344 in the preceding year, and 887 in 1964/ 65.  Returns from planning authorities indicate that a total of 18,439 applications for planning permission were decided by them in 1966/67 and that permission was refused in only 1,955 of these cases.  The fact that approval was given in respect of practically 90 per cent of all applications received suggests that, in general, the control powers given to planning authorities continued to be exercised in a reasonable manner.</P>
    <P>The number of appeals disposed of during the year ended 31st March, 1967, was 1,402, of which 996 were formally determined by the Minister, 302 were withdrawn as a result of agreement between the parties or for other reasons, and 104 were late or invalid.  Of the appeals formally determined <Col N="1386" /> in the year, 237 were allowed and 339 were allowed subject to conditions. The decision of the planning authority was confirmed in 420 cases.</P>
    <P>While the position in regard to planning control has been satisfactory in most areas, I have been concerned to note in my consideration of appeals that the planning policies to which decisions on applications for permission are related, appear to be applied rather rigidly by some planning authorities. As a result, a number of appeals lodged are subsequently withdrawn because, in the course of consideration of the appeals, ideas emerge as to ways in which objections could be overcome and a mutually satisfactory solution achieved.</P>
    <P>I have recently written to all planning authorities suggesting that the number of appeals could be reduced if they adopted a less rigid line in relation to development proposals, especially those of minor significance or, wherever feasible, suggested to an applicant how objections to the proposal for which he has sought permission could be overcome.  As an alternative to outright refusal of permission, planning authorities should examine the possibility of granting permission subject to conditions regarding changes designed to correct defects in the plans lodged.</P>
    <P>The ultimate objective of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, is to secure the proper planning and development of all areas in the interests of the common good. In the process, the aim of planning authorities should be to reflect public needs and public wishes to the greatest extent feasible and, at the same time, to endeavour to eliminate any valid grounds for grievance as to the validity of particular objectives of local planning policy.  For this reason. I have reminded the authorities of the importance of giving reasons for refusal, or for conditions, which are informative and helpful.</P>
    <P>A brief reference to some policy stated in the development plan will not suffice unless it is clear what the objective is and how it would be contravened by the development proposed.  In this way the applicant (and, in appeal <Col N="1387" /> cases, the Minister) will have a clearer idea of how it is considered that the proposals would contravene the development plan.  This is particularly important where the development plan does not imply absolute exclusion of the type of development proposed and it is necessary to bring out in the grounds for refusal the reasonableness of applying the provisions of the plan in the particular case.  Where there are other good reasons for refusal not related to the development plan, these should also be given since it is the interest of intending developers to know all the objections to their proposals if they are considering amendment of their plans or the making of an appeal.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the full co-operation of local planning authorities in giving effect to my suggestions.  These should increase public awareness and acceptance of the broad aims of planning policies and should substantially reduce the proportion of planning decisions which are made the subject of appeals.</P>
    <P>The estimate for grants under the derelict sites and amenity grants scheme, for which provision is made in Subhead G, shows an increase of £10,000 over the provisions for 1966-67.</P>
    <P>A great deal remains to be done to improve the appearances of town and countryside and I would like to see more widespread use being made of the grants available for that purpose. Grants of up to 50 per cent of approved cost are available to local authorities and local development groups towards the cost of parks, open spaces, the provision or improvement of walks and means of access, landscaping planting and other works of visual or recreational amenity.</P>
    <P>Progress was maintained during 1966-67 in speeding up the consideration of proposals for the compulsory acquisition by local authorities of land and water rights.  On 1st April, 1966, the number of cases on hands was 55. During the year 41 new proposals were received and 58 cases were decided. The number on hands at 31st March, 1967, was 38.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> Subheads K to O include provision for the scheme formerly administered by the Special Employment Schemes Office, with the exception of the provision for Miscellaneous Schemes (Minor Marine Works) transferred to the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.</P>
    <P>The Special Employment Schemes Office ceased to exist as a separate entity on 1st April last.  The staff of the Office has been transferred to my Department, and, pending the reorganisation of the administrative procedure, they are continuing to operate the schemes as a Section of the Department. The purpose of the transfer was to enable me to consider the re-organisation of the various services in the interests of greater efficiency and economy.  I now have actively in train certain measures to improve the method of administration.</P>
    <P>The grants for Urban and Rural Employment Schemes (Subheads K and L) will continue, as in the past, to be administered through the local authorities, but under the undivided control of my Department.  It is proposed to preserve the principle of allocating these grants by reference to the number of unemployed, and of requiring a local contribution.</P>
    <P>The staff of the Special Employment Schemes Office was occupied almost wholly in the administration of the Minor Employment, Bog Development and Rural Improvement Schemes.  It has been felt for some time that the maintenance of a separate organisation for this purpose was excessively costly and that the financial provision for the schemes and the personnel employed could be more effectively used otherwise.  The Government decided that these three schemes should in future be administered as a single scheme and that the county councils should be asked to operate it.  Some contribution by landholders will be involved in the case of every scheme, but for the poorer areas where the average land valuation is low, the rates of contribution will be minimal.  Thus, the landholders' contribution under the new scheme will be 2½ per cent for average land valuations under £5, compared <Col N="1389" /> with 10 per cent under the Rural Improvements Scheme.  Furthermore, unemployed persons registered at the employment exchanges will continue to get priority in employment.  Details of the proposed scheme have been notified to the county councils with a view to its being put into operation next year.  For the present year the existing schemes are being operated as formerly.</P>
    <P>The allocations of grants under the Urban and Rural Employment Schemes subheads for the current year's employment programmes were notified to the local authorities on 25th May last and schemes to absorb the grants are at present being received and considered in my Department.</P>
    <P>All Deputies representing rural constituencies were notified on 1st May last of the intention to allocate this year's grants under the Minor Employment and Bog Development Schemes Subheads.  All the grants for this year's Minor Employment and Bog Development Schemes have now been issued. The Rural Improvements Scheme provision has also been allocated in full.</P>
    <P>Subhead P of the Vote includes a sum of £18,500 for grants to An Chomhairle Leabharlanna under the Public Libraries Act, 1947.  Of this amount, £2,500 represents the State contribution towards the current expenses of An Chomhairle and the balance, £16,000, is to enable An Chomhairle to assist library authorities by providing grants of up to 50 per cent of the loan charges on library development projects.  Under this scheme of assistance, which was introduced in 1961, the library services have undergone a modest but steady improvement. Subsidies paid to library authorities amount to £9,683 in 1965-66, and £12,253 in 1966-67, compared with this year's provision of £16,000.  A number of projects are at various stages of planning, and I hope that the next few years will see a considerable improvement in the public library service.</P>
    <P>The value of purchases by local authorities from official contractors appointed under the Combined Purchasing Act, 1939, continues to increase. <Col N="1390" /> Purchases in the contract year ended 30th June, 1967, totalled approximately £5.58 million, compared with £5.40 million in the year ended 30th June, 1966.</P>
    <P>The total revenue expenditure in the present financial year of local authorities, excluding vocational education committees, committees of agriculture and harbour authorities, is estimated at £104.71 million, an increase of approximately £9 million on the actual expenditure for 1966/67.  This expenditure is financed from three main sources of revenue&mdash;State grants, rates, and miscellaneous receipts such as rents for local authority houses.  In the current year it is estimated that 52 per cent of expenditure will be met from State grants, 32 per cent from rates and 16 per cent from miscellaneous receipts. It is noteworthy that the percentage met by the Exchequer has been consistently rising in recent years. This percentage was 39.2 per cent in 1938/39, 42.6 per cent in 1956/57, approximately 50 per cent.  The increase in the present year is due in the main to the extended rate relief provided under the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1967, which in effect derated land valuations under £20 and gave further reliefs on a sliding scale in the case of land holdings in the valuation range £20 to £33.  Apart from this specific measure, however, the basic trend is clear&mdash;an ever-growing proportion of local authority expenditure is being met from State funds.</P>
    <P>The services provided by local authorities are vital to the well-being of the community and there is constant public demand for their further development.  This inevitably raises the question of meeting the cost.  There are obvious limits to the extent to which services can be transferred to the State or their cost met from State funds, without undermining the local government system as we know it.  On the other hand there are also practical limits on the independent revenue which the local authorities can raise under the present system.  There is no easy solution to the problems of local finance and taxation.  The inter-departmental committee which has been <Col N="1391" /> examining the question has submitted two interim reports, the first dealing with the valuation system and the second, with exceptions, from the remissions of rates.  I expect to receive a third report in the near future.  With a view to encouraging constructive public discussion of the matter the Government decided to publish summarised versions of the reports already received.  No decision has been made on the recommendations set out in these reports and I would like to take this occasion to invite observations from interested persons and bodies on these reports or generally on the question of local finance and taxation.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure by local authorities in 1966/67 is estimated to have amounted to £24.047 million compared with an actual expenditure of £23,246 million in the preceding year. Expenditure in the present year is expected to show a substantial rise. The bulk of this capital expenditure requirements comes from the Local Loans Fund.  The total net indebtedness of local authorities at 31st March, 1967, was estimated to be £210.17 millions, compared with £193.62 millions on 31st March, 1966.  These figures of indebtedness do not, of course, represent a deadweight burden on local funds.  To a considerable degree the repayments involved are subsidised by the State&mdash;as in the case of loans raised for housing, water supply and sewerage schemes&mdash;or are met by annuities payable in respect of loans advanced by local authorities for the purchase of private houses.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do so in order to register protest against the failure of the Minister to provide reasonable housing accommodation at reasonable rents for the lower income group and also as a protest against the failure of the Minister and his Department to organise financial assistance for the upper middle income group and the middle income group who are prepared to build houses for themselves if the Minister organises <Col N="1392" /> finance for them at a reasonable rate of interest.</P>
    <P>I also wish to register an emphatic protest against the complete and utter neglect by the Minister of rural Ireland, of the people of rural Ireland living in backward areas.  I refer to the lack of operation of the Rural Improvements Scheme.  I also wish to register a protest against the failure of the Government to implement the regional water scheme announced some years ago.  I also wish to draw the attention of the House and the country to the unsatisfactory operation of the provisions of the Planning and Development Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal with the housing situation first.  The Minister also made it the first item he dealt with in his speech.  That is only right because the housing of our people is of the utmost importance.  The Minister has given figures purporting to show that more is being done for housing now than was done in other times.  He compares one year with another.  He tells us that more money is being spent this year than was spent last year.  You can do almost anything with statistics.  It is unnecessary to repeat that they are unreliable. One knows, for example, that it takes more money to build the same number of houses now than it did some years ago.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to follow the Minister in this litany of figures and statistics. I propose to demonstrate that the Minister has failed miserably in his duty to solve the housing problem by pointing out that in the city of Dublin alone approximately 10,000 families are awaiting housing.  There were 267 more families seeking housing in the city in October, 1967, than there were in July, 1965.  The utter failure of the Minister in Dublin can be adequately demonstrated by again putting on record what is a fact: Dublin Corporation at present will consider a housing application only if it is made by a family of four, living, sleeping and eating in one single room.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> On the ground of overcrowding, where there are four people living in one room.  I say that is a disgrace.  It is an absolute indictment of the Government. The Corporation are really afraid to investigate fully the position of unsatisfactory and unfit houses because, if they did, the list would swell considerably. I do not know whether the Deputies opposite take the view that a good job is being done on housing. I do not know whether it is being suggested that the people have no complaint about the performance of the Minister on housing.  I believe the Taoiseach concedes that the housing situation is bad.  Speaking at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis recently, he is reported as having said:</P>
      <P>Local authority housing continues to command an urgent priority in the allocation of available capital resources.  Thousands of families are still living in unfit dwellings and in overcrowded conditions.  Thousands more are living in unsuitable dwellings or sharing with other families. We cannot accept that enough has been done in housing, or is being done until every family has a decent home of its own.</P>
      <P>That corroborates what I am saying, that the Minister has fallen down on housing.  According to the Taoiseach, there are thousands of people living in unfit and overcrowded houses.  I have just said there are 10,000 families in the city of Dublin seeking houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is much the same throughout the country.  Every Deputy who is a member of a local authority knows that when a house becomes vacant there are, without exaggeration, a couple of dozen applicants for it. Every Deputy knows that in rural Ireland proper, there are people living in unsuitable and unfit houses.  They are on a waiting list and are not and have not been housed.  The Taoiseach's <Col N="1394" /> statement is certainly a condemnation of the present Minister and his predecessor.</P>
    <P>In the First Programme for Economic Expansion, published in 1958, the Government put in black and white that our housing conditions compared favourably with those of any other comparable country in Europe and that money being spent on housing could be diverted to productive purposes. That is on record and can be quoted <i>verbatim,</i> if necessary.  It cannot be contradicted.  The same Government repeated that five years later in 1963, when they said that the statements and policies outlined in the First Programme were still valid.  That, in my opinion, shows that the Government failed to assess the housing situation in 1958 or 1963.  The statements contained in the First and Second Programmes are completely inconsistent with the Taoiseach's statement at the Árd Fheis that thousands of people are living in unsuitable houses and that we could not consider that enough had been done for housing until every family which wanted a house or was in need of a house had adequate housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>I could go on this theme of housing. I have given the House the figures for the city of Dublin, and I have given the House the Taoiseach's statement which appears to accept those figures, although some Deputies opposite do not.  The Minister should bring himself up to date with the housing position.  He should bring himself up to date with the cost of building houses.  Many years ago the Minister's predecessor fixed the subsidy value of houses at £1,650 and stated that he would contribute two-thirds, or one-third of the loan charges, as the case might be, of the cost of building houses, up to £1,650.  At that time £1,650 went a long way towards building a house. I suppose that a local authority house could have been built then for £1,750 or £1,850.</P>
    <P>We know now that the cost of building a local authority house has increased to £2,400 or £2,500 in the country, and more in the city.  Yet this subsidy ceiling of £1,650 still stands and nothing is being done about it, <Col N="1395" /> notwithstanding the fact that since that subsidy was fixed by the Minister's predecessor, the Government, by positive action, increased the cost of building houses by the turnover tax and the wholesale tax.  The net result is that when houses are built they are too expensive, and either have to be let at rents which are beyond the capacity of the tenants to pay, or a considerable impost has to be put on the rates.  Therefore I challenge the Minister to justify this subsidy ceiling of £1,650 in 1967.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to make is that the Minister's predecessor encouraged the local authorities to buy sufficient land for their own housing needs for the foreseeable future.  A circular was issued to all the local authorities breaking the then existing rule under which local authorities were permitted to acquire land for their immediate needs only.  They were told to go ahead and acquire sufficient land to meet their needs on a long-term basis.  That was a wise direction, but those local authorities were entitled to assume, because the contrary was not stated, that if they obeyed the Minister's direction and bought land, it would be paid for out of the Local Loans Fund in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>Some small local authorities were surprised, and very surprised indeed, to find that when they paid £6,000 or £7,000 for sites&mdash;which are considerable sums for a small authority&mdash;and applied to the Minister to sanction a loan in the ordinary way, they were told that no money was available, that the Minister would not sanction loans out of the Local Loans Fund at subsidised interest, and that they would have to go and raise money in the banks on short-term loans at full rates of interest without any assistance whatsoever, good, bad or indifferent.  I wonder was that the intention of the Minister when he advised the local authorities to buy land on the basis of their long-term requirements, because if it was he should have told them so.  Even at this stage the local authorities which committed themselves on the strength of the Minister's circular should now be assisted in the normal way by getting the subsidy <Col N="1396" /> towards the interest charges on this land.  Otherwise they will simply have to dispose of the land.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about the Government's failure to properly organise the private sector in its efforts towards house building.  Much credit is due to people of modest means who went ahead and built their own houses. If those people did not build their own houses, the housing position, bad and all as it is, would certainly be unthinkable. As I say, some people were driven into building their own houses and taking on commitments which they were unable to afford as a result of the failure of the Minister to provide local authority houses.  We know that farmers with valuations of less than £25 get substantial grants.  They can get as much as £900.  I am prepared to concede that that is a sizeable amount, and that it is a help, but it is still a great burden on a farmer with a valuation of less than £25 to build a house even with the assistance of a grant of £900. As I say, something has been done in that respect, and credit must be given for it.</P>
    <P>The class I want to deal with are the people earning £1,200, £1,400 or £1,500 a year.  In this day and age it cannot be said that those people are wealthy, or that they do not need assistance or encouragement to build their own houses. Yet, the position is that a man earning £1,300 in 1948 got a standard State grant&mdash;I am speaking of standard State grants now&mdash;of £275 towards the cost of the house, and the man earning £1,300 in 1967 gets the same standard State grant of £275, notwithstanding the fact that the effective value of that grant has been reduced to approximately £150 by the turnover tax and the wholesale tax and that the devaluation which has just come upon us will further reduce it.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any proposals to offset that reduction?  Does he think it reasonable that a man earning £1,300 a year in 1967 should get the same grant as a man earning £1,300 a year got in 1948?  I do not.  More encouragement should be given to that income group to build their own houses. It is a good investment to encourage people to build their own <Col N="1397" /> houses because a man who builds his own house will take pride in it and look after it.  Given the proper encouragement, people living in local authority houses will build their own houses and leave the local authority houses available for people who cannot afford to house themselves and who must be housed at public expense.</P>
    <P>Earlier today the Minister for Finance was questioned as to the effect of devaluation on housing loans and he stated, if I remember correctly, that the Government had decided that the present rate of interest charged under the Housing and Loans Acts would not be increased.  We are glad to hear that, but I know from my experience that the ceiling under the Housing and Loans Acts of £1,200 is inadequate.  A man earning over £1,200 a year cannot now borrow from the local authority under what was the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act and is now the Loans and Grants Act.  A man who is earning more than £1,200 approximately does not qualify for a small dwellings loan and has to seek a loan elsewhere if he wants to build a house.  If he is living in a small town, or, indeed, a sizeable town in one of the provinces, his application for a loan will not be entertained by a building society.  He cannot get the money from a bank.  The Minister may say in reply that the local authority can organise finance for that man by arranging a loan from the bank, but the Minister knows that that loan is a very short-term loan at a higher rate of interest, and whereas an individual could service a loan at £200 a year under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act it would cost him £300 a year under the other scheme.</P>
    <P>I sincerely urge the Minister to be more liberal with his grants to the £1,200 to £1,600 a year group and to be more liberal in organising for them finance which they are prepared to pay back.  If he does so, he will create national assets in the form of houses which in the long run will pay a good dividend both to the Government and to the country.</P>
    <P>Local authorities should be encouraged to service land for house building, that is, to provide water, <Col N="1398" /> sewerage and roads, because that is something that individuals find it impossible to do for themselves and if it is done by a contractor in a group scheme it adds considerably to the cost of the houses.</P>
    <P>Years ago, long before any talk of devaluation or of high interest rates came up, I advocated at the Association of Municipal Authorities that the Government should subsidise interest for house building in the private sector. It would be a sound investment which would show a good return.  There is an amazing number of people who are anxious to build their own houses. While one would admire them for it it often does appear that they are taking on more than they can afford, but it is evidence of their anxiety to own their own houses and that they would take a pride in having their own houses and would look after them well.</P>
    <P>Rents in general are being increased by the failure of the Government to increase the subsidy.  I should not say by the failure of the Government to increase the subsidy; I should say by the failure of the Government to keep the subsidy up to the level of the cost of building a house&mdash;the failure of the Government to bring the subsidy up to date.  I do not believe that differential rents should be applied indiscriminately or at all to houses which were built 30 or 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>The next item I have placed in my notes in order of importance is the extraordinary performance of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government in relation to the Rural Improvement Scheme.  The Minister dealt with it in a very brief paragraph in his introductory statement. As Deputies know, the Rural Improvement Scheme was a scheme under which dwellers in rural Ireland had the lanes to their houses repaired for a small local contribution with State aid.  It was a scheme whereby two or more people living in a lane could apply to the Rural Improvement Scheme Office for a grant, which was usually 80 per cent to 90 per cent of the cost of doing the lane.  Under this grant, a good job was made of the lane.  In many cases the lane was then <Col N="1399" /> taken over by the county council and maintained thereafter by the county council.  I often wonder if Deputies, city Deputies in particular, realise the plight of people who reside along these lanes.  There may be anything from two to ten families living along a lane for which nobody was responsibility. That lane is the only means of access to their homes.  In order to reach the main road they may have to walk a mile, or more, over a waterlogged, potholed lane; when they reach the main road they see millions of pounds being spent on their improvement.  This is very frustrating for them.  This is a serious contributing cause, I put it no stronger than that, to the depopulation of rural Ireland.  I am very familiar with this problem.  I am sure the Minister will accept something that was said at the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  He said:</P>
    <P>One of the real reasons for the low marriage rate was that many attractive young girls had gone away either out of necessity or by their own desire.</P>
    <P>There is nothing better calculated to driving young girls out of rural Ireland than having to walk ankle-deep in slush in order to reach their homes.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening speech, said that in the next 20 years the population of Dublin city is expected to increase enormously.  In support of that statement he quoted the consultant town planner for the city of Dublin. I should like now to quote the consultant town planner to Cavan County Council in relation to the population trend there.  At page 13 of the report, he says:</P>
    <P>The most serious implication of the decline in the numbers of young people in the county is that the level of population replacement is falling rapidly with the result that shortly the rate of depopulation may show an alarming increase.  In other words, for the first time in a century at least the birth rate is in danger of falling below the death rate and, as a result, the total population of the county will fall for a time, even if emigration is halted completely.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> Cavan is not regarded by the Land Commission as a congested area.  The Minister has plans to deal with the growth of population in Dublin.  I ask him now to bring forth plans to deal with the falling population in counties such as Cavan.  The abandonment&mdash; abandonment is all I can call it&mdash;of the rural improvement scheme will greatly accelerate the flight from rural Ireland.  If that is Government policy, then let us be clear about it.  This scheme was suspended for all practical purposes by the Department of Finance in August, 1965.  Since then it has been almost impossible to get a grant from the Board of Works.  We were told that as from 1st April this year the scheme was taken over from the Board of Works by the Department of Local Government.  There was no improvement following that transfer.  Now the Minister tells us he is handing the scheme over to the local authorities; it will be operated by them under the direct supervision of the Department of Local Government.  Actually he is handing over more than the scheme. He is handing over the scheme plus an accumulation of arrears, arrears it will take a considerable time to wipe out.</P>
    <P>I want to quote now from a communication issued by Cavan County Council to applicants under this scheme:</P>
    <P>A considerable number of applications which were not dealt with by the Department of Local Government Special Employment Schemes Section have been referred to this office for priority under the council's scheme.  Consequently it is not possible at this stage to state when this application can be considered.  An official application form will be forwarded to you in due course.</P>
    <P>That is the reply an unfortunate applicant receives, an unfortunate applicant who has to walk over a waterlogged, potholed laneway.  I am sure other county councils are in the same position as Cavan County Council.  Now why is this?  It is because the Minister is handing over the scheme to the county councils on the basis of a fixed sum averaged on the amount spent in the last three years. <Col N="1401" /> In the last three years it was utterly impossible to get any worthwhile grants for this purpose.  Cavan County Council is now being told to operate this scheme and bear all the expenses of operation.  They are being given the princely sum of £14,000 per year for the work involved.  I do not think I am extravagant when I say that £14,000 will provide considerably less than 20 average grants.  I appeal to the Minister now to do something to rectify the present unsatisfactory situation, and to get on with the improvement of these by-roads and access to people's houses. If he does, he will have the complete support of every Member of this House.  If any Deputy knew the real situation and appreciated the difficulties under which these people are living, he would energetically support my appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>When these boreens, lanes, by-roads &mdash;call them what you will-are repaired under these schemes, the various county councils are prepared to take them over and they then cost the Government nothing more.  I note from the Minister's speech that, under this scheme, there will be a local contribution. There has always been a local contribution: I am not saying for or against that.  However, if this local contribution is to continue, it should be compulsory and it should be levied on the ratepayers along the lane in their rates.  From time to time, one meets the impossible or difficult person or two who will not pay their contribution and who will hold up the whole scheme.  I suggest, therefore, that, if there is a local contribution, it should be compulsory and collected as the rates are collected.  There is no difficulty about that and there is plenty of precedent for it.  I leave the subject of rural improvement schemes on a note of great disappointment at the Minister's performance to date and in the hope that he will make himself familiar with the position and will urge the Government to make available a substantial amount of money to clear up this problem.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Opposition to be critical of the Minister's performance in these matters.  I now want to refer to the reduction in the road grants this <Col N="1402" /> year.  Just on the eve of the local elections, the road grants were reduced by, I think, £¾ million.  They were reduced all over the country by very substantial sums, by as much as £46,000 in one county and by as much as, I think, £100,000 in another county. I do not purport to give the exact figures but they were slashed and slashed considerably within months of an assurance from the Government that a vast injection of money would be made into the west of Ireland to keep up employment and the provision of amenities there.</P>
    <P>The reduction of these road grants means that fewer roads are being made and less employment is being given. Every county councillor who goes to the bother of making enquiries about the number of men employed this year on road-making, as compared with this time last year, will find that fewer men are employed this year for the reason that grants were considerably reduced. Again, it is the county roads that suffer as a result of the reduction in the grants.  Motor taxation has considerably increased and the Department of Finance now draw a substantial amount from the Road Fund.  I know that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government deny that it is a raid on the Road Fund and say that this particular increased taxation on motor vehicles was imposed for the general Exchequer but the fact of the matter is that more money is now going into the Road Fund, on the overall picture, while less money is coming from the Road Fund to the county councils as compared with last year.  I protest against that and say that the effect is that fewer roads are being made and less employment is being given.</P>
    <P>I come now to regional water schemes which were first mooted about 1959.  I think it was in 1959 that the Department of Local Government asked local authorities to speed up their piped water schemes in rural areas. The net result was that all the county councils employed consultants and planners and had long discussions at county council meetings, with big headlines in the local papers.  Everybody was led to believe that piped water <Col N="1403" /> would be available on practically the same basis as rural electrification and that every house would have piped running water at least within reasonable distance of it.  People's hopes were built up.  That was not bad enough but county managers&mdash;whether by direction from the Custom House or otherwise&mdash; proceeded to close down on the provision of pumps in rural areas.  They said it would be a waste of money to provide pumps because piped water was coming and that they could not justify the expenditure of money on the provision of pumps for groups of houses.  On the assurance that regional water schemes were on the way and that any money spent on other provision for water would be money wasted, they ceased to encourage water group schemes.</P>
    <P>Imagine the surprise of the people when, this year, they discovered that their county councils were told that all the regional schemes would cost £36 million, which it is far beyond the capacity to pay, and that they will have to revise the whole plan.  We do not know who will get regional water supplies now or when.  This is not the fault of the present Minister for Local Government but of his predecessor in office who was the great promiser, the great provider of plans, but the man who did not deliver the goods.  The net result of that promise in operation was that the people of rural Ireland are now worse off for water than formerly because the regional schemes will not come and the pump group schemes have been closed down.</P>
    <P>That sort of thing is not good enough.  People's hopes should not be built up only to be knocked down like that.  Water is most important.  I heard the Minister's predecessor waxing eloquent on this point at the Association of Municipal Authorities last year.  One would think the water would be there in a few weeks.  He spoke about the necessity for water and the drudgery of farmers' wives carrying water, and so on, but now the whole thing is knocked on the head so far as I can see from the statement issued some time ago and from the Minister's speech.  Elaborate <Col N="1404" /> schemes of this sort should not be announced unless there is some foundation for saying they will be implemented and unless there is a reasonably good chance of their implementation. It only leads to disappointment and frustration and people are worse off after the promise than before it.</P>
    <P>Something of the same kind happened in regard to swimming pools.  I remember the Minister's predecessor blaming local authorities and groups of individuals for failing to take up his swimming pool scheme.  He was disappointed that it had not met with a better response, that there was not more interest in it and that there were not more applications for the swimming pool grants.  Groups of young people came together in various towns, formed committees and made plans for swimming pools.  Then when they applied for a grant they were told: &ldquo;That is all shelved&rdquo;.  It is stated in the Minister's speech on this Estimate that swimming pools grants will have to be deferred.  Again, that scheme was introduced and publicised at a time when the Minister's predecessor must have known that the likelihood of implementing it was slim indeed.  That sort of playacting is not good enough. It leads the youth of the country to lose faith in promises of a Departmental nature.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to meetings where people that I regarded as very young, teenagers, were full of enthusiasm about the swimming pool scheme and on the assurances I had heard from the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, I assured them that there did not seem to be any difficulty in getting grants if they had plans and if their specifications were right but they know now that the whole thing was a nasty fairy tale.  Could the Minister assure even the groups who have perhaps acquired sites or in some way committed themselves as a result of assurances given, that they will receive financial assistance as promised?</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt at considerable length with the Planning and Development Act, 1963.  As he said and as I agree, there must be planning.  There must be some order in the building of <Col N="1405" /> houses and factories and the layout of parks and so on, but I want to tell the Minister that there is considerable dissatisfaction with the operation of the Planning and Development Act particularly in regard to appeals.  The fact that there are only between 1,000 and 2,000 appeals does not affect the matter.  I ask the Minister now to take politics out of the Planning and Development Act and I am certain there are politics and plenty of politics in it.  I am certain that a man who finds himself involved in a planning appeal now is much more anxious to get the ear of somebody who has influence with the Minister than he is to get a planning consultant or architect or engineer to fight his case.</P>
    <P>The people have no faith in the present system.  Why should they?  It can happen, and has happened, that two appeals dealing with a similar project go to the Minister on the same date.  The application which was refused by the planning authority is granted within a matter of a couple of months and the application which has been granted by the planning authority is put on the long finger for months and months.  Eventually, an oral hearing is ordered and the stage is reached where the other man has gone on and built his project and the point of the second appeal is, of course, completely lost.  It is not right that the political head of a Department should be in a position to make or mar an individual or that he should, by a decision, be able to add enormously to, or take very considerably from the value of property.  That is the position under the present system.  I urge the Minister&mdash;I know I cannot advocate legislation in a speech on an Estimate&mdash; to take politics out of town planning and until such time as he does things will go from bad to worse.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt at considerable length with road traffic and its problems. No doubt the enormous volume of traffic on the roads and especially in Dublin city has created a problem which needs to be tackled and the Minister will have the assistance of the House and every reasonable Deputy in any reasonable steps he takes to solve the problem.  I should like to make a <Col N="1406" /> very brief reference to the Naas Road. There was a certain amount of panic following a few unfortunate accidents on the Naas Road.  I do not think that the speed limits imposed have solved the problem.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling of fear and confusion once one enters that road at the present time.  There seems to be a fierce volume of traffic all moving along at about 50 miles an hour bumper to bumper.  I do not know whether there have been any serious accidents since the speed limits were introduced, but I fear that they have solved nothing.  I hope it is only a temporary expedient until such time as the Minister has received a full report on that road and until such time as he takes steps to make better entries to and exits from it.  It is not sufficient to say that it would cost too much.  The fact of the matter is that we have built a death trap here and we must make the road safe.  We have built a motorway without putting on the necessary safety valves.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the concluding part of his speech, dealt with taxation and the shifting of taxation from the local authorities to the Exchequer.  I do not know whether the Minister intends to revise the whole system of local taxation. I rather gathered from his speech that he may have something like that in mind.  What I want to put on record is that, as far as I am concerned, the present system of local taxation is out-moded. As I said before, it may have been all right at the end of the last century when only people of property possessed money.  Those conditions have gone, and it is a good job.  However the present system is inequitable.</P>
    <P>Take two local authority houses, side by side, with a £10 valuation, and take the rates, for easy calculation, at £3 in the £.  The income of one of those houses may be £25, and the income of the house next door may be that of an old person living on social security of some description or another; yet the two of them pay £30 apiece rates.  That is not equitable, and as far as I know, there is no way, under the present system, of relieving that person from the £30 rates.</P>
    <P>In many towns in Ireland small shopkeepers have been almost pushed <Col N="1407" /> out of business by big combines, supermarkets and so on, and yet those people are taxed on their valuation without any reference, good bad or indifferent, to their capacity to pay. That is unfair.  A system of taxation which has no regard whatever to the capacity of the person to pay cannot be justified.  The example I have given of the two local authority houses highlights that.  One can also take two shops in a town, one having a flourishing business, the other occupied by somebody who is doing a very small business, and they both have the same valuation.  Each of those people could be paying £80 in rates; it might be no burden at all on one of them, but it could be a very serious burden on the other.  As I say, the system is outdated and is unfair.  It needs a lot of new thinking and a new approach.</P>
    <P>There is one little thing about which I complained bitterly last year, that is, the operation of the derelict site grants scheme.  I am very glad to say that, as far as the constituencies with which I am familiar are concerned, my words here seem to have been heard, because there was a considerable improvement in the operation of the scheme during the year, and even the token increase of £10,000 this year is welcome.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered all the points with which I want to deal.  Let me conclude by saying I am completely and utterly dissatisfied with the Minister's performance in housing.  I am horrified with his decision practically to close down on the rural improvement schemes.  A shabby trick was played on the country by his predecessor in regard to the regional water scheme and the swimming pool grants.  I repeat also that the operation of the planning appeal machinery under the Planning and Development Act is totally unsatisfactory. For these reasons I am not satisfied with the Minister's Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies could not be blamed for assuming that the Minister for Local Government on this occasion had some truly wonderful and spectacular news to convey to us in this <Col N="1408" /> House and to the country, especially by reason of the secrecy concerning the presentation of his brief.  Heretofore the Minister has issued his brief to Deputies in advance.  On this occasion we had his speech practically in three stages, and we had rather formed the opinion that it contained some great news for our people that the Minister was loath to reveal to us in advance. Imagine our amazement, that having gone through the 45 pages of the speech in question we discover there is not in any page of it one iota of hope for our people in respect of the problems with which they have to contend at the present time, particularly those people who are condemned to live in abominable housing circumstances.</P>
      <P>Those of us who are thoroughly conversant with the housing problems of our people find it extremely difficult to understand the smug complacency of the Minister and his Government and the manner in which they try to cover up this great national scandal.  The Minister's speech contained on this occasion much the same as ever, the very same palliatives, the same amount of verbiage, the same attempt at juggling figures as we have heard here in recent years.  All this has been done to create the veneer of progress and pretend that all is well in matters appertaining to housing, water, sanitation and the like.  No amount of camouflage can conceal that which we all know to be the fact, that we have in this small country of ours, a situation so utterly bad, so distressing and so abominable in terms of human suffering and human degradation that the recent revelations in the press, TV and the radio have rightly shocked the conscience of all civilised, right-thinking people.  The spectacle of slums and squalor, of gross overcrowding in evilsmelling and insanitary hovels in this city and indeed throughout every town and our countryside, with its attendant moral and social evils, is no doubt a shocking revelation.  It is an indictment of our central and local government authorities and is a great challenge to all of us who value the dignity of the human person, and indeed an affront to what we term a civilised community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> Lest I might seem to exaggerate this situation, I wish to back up my case with the relevant figures.  The figures I quote are to be found in the main in the White Paper &ldquo;Housing Progress and Prospects,&rdquo; issued by the Minister's Department, the census figures of 1961 and the various statistical abstracts available to all of us.  According to the White Paper, there are 50,000 dwellings in use in this country which are incapable of repair at reasonable cost. Those 50,000 dwellings do not include the cities of Cork and Dublin.  There are a further 40,000 houses unfit for living purposes, again outside of Dublin and Cork, and at a conservative estimate there are 90,000 houses urgently required at the present time. The census of 1961 revealed that there were 63,000 overcrowded dwellings.  It also revealed that over 163,000 houses in the country were over 100 years old and I understand that 80 years is regarded as the normal life of a normal house.  Therefore, this is the kind of problem we have to contend with.  We also know, as public representatives, that apart from those figures, some 6,000 to 7,000 houses throughout the country become obsolete each year.  In order to deal with cases of urgent need, as a very minimum, we should be building at least 14,000 houses per annum and the fact is that we are only building half that number.</P>
    <P>The situation in respect of housing is becoming progressively worse and it is time this Government grappled effectively with the problem and recognised housing for what it is and must always remain, an essential social service, claiming priority with education and health.  This Minister should see to it that the necessary money is made available so that a crash programme can be embarked on to end the scourge of the homeless.  Lest the Minister or the Government be enamoured of the present situation or lest they might fool or dupe people into thinking that we were making reasonable progress in the matter of the elimination of the slums, let me assert that in spite of these grievous needs which have been with us for a long number of years, our rate of house building is the lowest <Col N="1410" /> in Europe.  According to a recent UN survey, we have been building houses in this country at the rate of 3.5 houses per 1,000 inhabitants, the lowest figure in Europe, lower than Spain, and Spain would hardly be regarded as being in the top ten of the progressives of Europe or as a very affluent society.</P>
    <P>The Government have been guilty of abject dereliction of duty in respect of the rehousing of our people and stand condemned from any viewpoint. We know that few local authorities build more than 25 dwellings a year. This is mainly because of the dead hand of the Department of Local Government falling so heavily upon them, withholding the necessary financial aid and impeding plans and programmes for the acceleration of the housing drive by every means which officials can devise.  This situation, Sir, has come about because of the ineptitude of our Government and their failure to grapple effectively with the problem.  As I have said, this Fianna Fáil Government, despite admonitions from these benches, have consistently refused to recognise housing as an essential social service which should not be left to private enterprise, in the hands of vested interests or the plaything of moneylenders, land speculators and property developers.  These people are concerned with profit but housing concerns people and we in the Labour Party are concerned about people.</P>
    <P>We find, too, that the Government while skimping in respect of housing, water, sanitary facilities, and the like, are lavishing money wastefully on unnecessary projects, in my opinion, such as skyscraper blocks of offices in this city and in other cities and luxury flats far beyond the means of the ordinary people.  Millions of pounds are available for wasteful expenditure of this kind, while at the same time, hundreds of thousands of our people are condemned to a life-long purgatory in squalor and misery.  We see this expenditure going on year in, year out, while at the same time, this essential service of housing is starved of resources.</P>
    <P>We know, too, that the Government have allowed land prices, interest <Col N="1411" /> charges and rents to rise unbridled. Not only have they allowed these increases to come about, but they have recommended increases in certain circumstances, such as the implementation of the rationalisation of rents policy initiated by the Minister's predecessor, and they have condoned and ratified increases in other spheres such as interest charges.  They have failed to acquire the necessary land for house-building purposes and it was particularly reprehensible that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should allow the building societies to increase the interest rates on all loans.  This, I contend, was indefensible.  These loans were secured many years ago at a rate of interest which the borrowers believed at that time was fixed.  It came as a shock and caused deep dismay to those who borrowed when it transpired, when somebody quoted from a portion of small writing in their agreement the proof, that they were entitled to increase the interest charges.</P>
    <P>There is, Sir, unfortunately, widespread indifference, callousness and a flagrant disregard for the plight of our homeless.  We as a Government and as a people seem to have forgotten altogether the importance of housing in the life of a normal family.  We seem to forget, as an allegedly Catholic and Christian community, that housing standards determine very largely people's attitude towards life.  It affects their health and their happiness and certainly influences children, in particular, in their educational careers.  The environment in which children are brought up will in large measure determine the kind of citizens they will be in after years.</P>
    <P>We believe the children of the nation have a right to be reared in decent homes, in at least frugal comfort, instead of the squalor which so many thousands of them have to contend with in this city, in particular, and, indeed, throughout the country.  We are all given to pious platitudes from time to time.  We pretend to make much of the family as a unit of society, and, indeed, the family has been given a great place of privilege in our Constitution which marks it down as the <Col N="1412" />&ldquo;natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law&rdquo;.  It is time, Sir, we gave practical effect to the high sentiment contained in our Constitution in respect of the family and that as a first priority, as a first essential, we saw to it as a Christian Government that they be provided with decent homes.  This then is one of the reasons why we say that housing is more important than the profit of the speculators. It is more important to us than the profit of the land speculator, property developer or the building societies.  We believe that it must be taken out of the hands of these vested interests and that the Government must involve themselves more and more in their commitment to the people by providing homes for them.</P>
    <P>With regard to this housing scandal, the Minister for Local Government and his Parliamentary Secretary should realise that they are sitting on top of a grumbling volcano.  He is a very deaf man indeed who does not hear the groaning and he is a very blind man indeed who does not see the signs of indignation and anger represented in so many forms throughout our country, anger in the press and anger in the mass media of communication about this social evil.  There is evidence, too, in the formation of tenants' associations and action committees, in order to pressurise the Government into action and bring home to them their responsibility in this matter.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the present policy of depending on private enterprise in the main to solve our housing problem has failed.  If it is to be tackled successfully, we must have a radical extension of Government involvement in home building.  The key to the solution of this social problem, as indeed to every other social problem, is money, and the Government must decide that the necessary capital is made available for investment in the housing industry.  As it is at the moment, capital is invested in large quantities in Britain through the banking system. Capital is obviously available for the building of luxury flats and office <Col N="1413" /> blocks, and for Jumbo Jets.  It is time this Government laid down their priorities for the use of the capital available.</P>
    <P>We say in this respect that housing should have an exceptionally high place and we therefore call on the Government to embark on a crash programme to end the misery of the homeless. We in the Labour Party realise that Ireland's most cherished assets are its people, not the people of vested interests involved in housing.  The welfare of our people comes before anything else.  Deputy Corish, the Leader of the Labour Party, went on record once again during our annual conference in declaring, in case there might be any ambiguity about it, that it had always been the policy of this Party, still is and always will remain, in respect of housing especially, to bring the banks, the insurance companies, the building societies and other financial institutions under Government control so that the essential capital will be available to eradicate this great social evil.</P>
    <P>Until this has been done, we will continue to witness this social inequality, this privation in the midst of plenty.  No nation, in the history of human endeavour, was ever inspired to great or greater things by the venal and selfish philosophy of &ldquo;I'm all right, Jack&rdquo; or the get-rich-quick mentality of the boys in Taca groups who have positive vested interests in housing, land and other property throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party say that we must reassert in the House and throughout the country the value of service above private gain, the welfare of our people before profit, that nepotism and vested interests have no place in the just society, in the Ireland of happy homes to which we in the Labour Party aspire.</P>
    <P>I wish once again to make a plea on behalf of two categories of people who are the last to be considered in respect of housing&mdash;the newly-weds and the aged.  We must give special attention to the problem of the newly-married couples.  There is no good reason why young couples should be condemned to a long purgatory of <Col N="1414" /> waiting until they are rehoused, why young lives should be blighted by rotten housing conditions and, mark you, open to every kind of unscrupulous exploitation by landlords. We have in this country a number of Rachmans.</P>
    <P>I recall that a man very high in the social standing of this country, a man with particular responsibility for housing in a wide area, said that newly-weds would have to wait on in this purgatory before they could be rehoused, that they would have to have a number of children which, in the normal course, meant years of waiting. With this kind of disregard for our young people, is it any wonder that so many of them go abroad as soon as they are married?  Is it any wonder that our marriage rate is the lowest in western Europe&mdash;five per cent of our population, a third lower than most European countries?  We have not been giving our young people a chance in respect of housing and my plea now is that in every sizeable scheme embarked on there should be provision for housing for newly-weds so that they can have some hope of not being condemned to interminable years of waiting, subject to the grossest exploitation by landlords which makes life so miserable for them that in desperation they go abroad, turning their backs on all this country stands for.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the rehousing of the aged is a grave problem here because we have an exceptionally high percentage of old people.  The 1961 census reveals that we had then 315,061 persons of 65 years or more.  We are rapidly becoming a nation of too few working adults and too many aged and we must pay special attention to this problem.  I should like to see our old people properly housed in community centres among friends and relatives.</P>
    <P>Neither do we show any worthwhile regard for the welfare of our young people, the children of the nation.  This is evidenced by the marked absence of playgrounds in most of our housing schemes, apart perhaps from some of the major schemes in this city and other large towns.  There is also an absence of playgrounds for adults. <Col N="1415" /> There is no provision made in the planning of our housing schemes for adult pursuits, recreation or athletic activities of any kind.  We surely ought to have regard to healthy recreational pursuits when building our housing schemes.  It is no wonder that we have so many thousands of young boys and girls and adults wandering around aimlessly in those housing estates, unable to kick a ball, unable to run a race or engage in the normal pursuits of youth without being involved with the police.  It is a great wonder that more do not gravitate towards crime and that the incidence of juvenile delinquency is not higher in this country.</P>
    <P>I would like to say also in respect of our housing schemes generally that they all appear to be of the stock type, drab, monotonous with little redeeming feature.  It is high time the Department laid down some restrictions so that we could have originality.  Some worthwhile planning in architecture should go into the building of our houses rather than having the stock type houses, the sticking together of three or four boxes, which are intended to be rooms, and slapping them up haphazardly here, there and everywhere.</P>
    <P>There are a number of measures to which the Minister adverted in his speech.  None of them is, in my opinion, of any real consequence for our people, especially those in need of new homes.  This is why I have dwelt perhaps a bit long on this matter of housing alone.  There are other aspects, such as the provision of piped water and sanitary facilities.  Doubtless all of us will agree that the provision of piped water and sanitary facilities is a very essential service which should be provided for every householder, every farmer and every cottier.  I believe this has been an aim of all Governments. It is very disconcerting to realise, having regard to the hardship imposed on thousands of our people as a result of the lack of piped water and sanitary facilities, that instead of accelerating the provision of piped water and sanitary facilities, this Government and <Col N="1416" /> this Minister have brought water schemes and sewerage schemes to a grinding halt during recent years.</P>
    <P>I submit, without fear of contradiction, in respect of sanitary services, piped water and the like, no progress whatsoever has been made in the past few years.  The situation with most local authorities has been absolutely static.  All our hopes for the extension of piped water and the provision of sanitary facilities have been completely disillusioned and come to a grinding halt because of the inability of the Minister's Department to provide the necessary money.</P>
    <P>One would not mind if some semblance of progress were being made in respect of the extension of those essential services but what this House and this country have got to realise is the fact that our record in this regard is gloomy indeed.  I said we had the worst record in Europe for house building. I assert now that our record in the provision of water, sewerage and the like is equally bad.</P>
    <P>The <i>Statistical Abstract of Ireland</i> for 1966 reveals that less than half our households have piped water laid on, 44 per cent have taps outside the house and 43 per cent use a fountain, a well, a stream or some other dubious source of supply for water.  I want to place on the records of this House that only 53 per cent of the households, a little more than half, have proper sanitary facilities, that is to say, a flush toilet. A little more than half of households have a flush toilet.  The rest of us, almost half of our people, are obliged to use the primitive methods of dry closets and, in the rural areas, the wide open spaces, with no sanitary facilities whatsoever.</P>
    <P>It is difficult in the light of those startling facts, and it is disconcerting in the extreme to understand how the Minister could issue this circular to all local authorities, which indicated clearly that the money required for piped water was proving too costly and admonishing all county councils to forget about their plans and their programmes for piped water and submitting that we should all do a complete somersault and go back to the idea of group water schemes instead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> I am very sorry to think that the Government are so utterly bankrupt of financial resources that the Minister for Local Government, Caoimhin Uasal Ó Beoláin, should have to do this dastardly thing to stop the wonderful progress being made in this country in the provision of piped water.  What chances now are there of having hygiene in the home or on the farm? What chances are there for increasing production, attracting new industries and providing better amenities all round for our people unless we have piped water as a first essential?  Apart from the statistics I have already mentioned as to the numbers who are without water, without flush toilets, one must not forget that quite large towns and villages, certainly in my constituency, have no sanitary facilities at all.  Here we have public houses, hotels, shopping centres and the like, all with dry closets.  There are towns with a population of 1,000 or 2,000, and even more, with no sewerage scheme of any kind.  Sewerage and water are twins; you cannot have the one without the other.  If the Minister is going to obstruct local authorities in the provision of water, we can forget about sewerage for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>I deplore the ineptitude of the Minister and his failure to deal effectively with the problem of piped water.  He is doing the nation a grievous disservice when he admonishes county councils that the cost is too great, that they must revise their programmes and have resort to the group water scheme instead.  It is only a short time since his predecessor was inviting us to avail of grants for the extension of piped water.  It is only a short time since our county managers were exhorting us to entice groups of people to embark on piped water schemes and telling us that the erection of pumps would be a monument to our stupidity and ignorance.  Having made no progress for the past few years in respect of the extension of piped water, we are obliged to fall back on these doubtful things, group schemes and pumps and the like, as temporary measures.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree with me <Col N="1418" /> that the provision of piped water is by far superior than to be depending on group schemes, on wells, and springs and the like.  There is no real substitute for piped water.  I earnestly appeal to him to reconsider his attitude in this regard.  In my own constituency of South Tipperary, we had a great record in the provision of piped water. We had won for ourselves the name of being one of the most progressive counties in all Ireland in respect of the extension of piped water.  We had spent over £4 million on it and had plans made to ensure that, where it was possible from an engineering point of view, every home would be provided with piped water.  But all our plans for the extension of this much needed amenity have been completely frustrated by the Minister's ineptitude and his clear inability to provide us with the necessary capital to proceed with this valuable work.</P>
    <P>I will give an instance of the bankruptcy of the Government in this regard.  The county council of South Tipperary, of which I have the honour of being present chairman, submitted to the Minister's Department final plans for the implementation of three major regional piped water schemes away back in the autumn of 1965.  From that day to this, over two years ago, we have been unable to get a brass farthing from the Minister's Department, unable to get sufficient money to get these important regional schemes off the ground.  The schemes to which I refer are: the Ardfinnan regional water scheme, for which a loan of £203,500 was applied for to the Minister's Department on 11th August, 1965; the Emly regional water scheme, for which a loan of £232,000 was applied for on 15th June 1965; the Dundrum regional water scheme, for which a loan of £407,000 was applied on 15th June 1965; and the Clonmel regional water scheme, for which a loan of £178,000 was applied for to the Minister's Department on 11th August, 1965.  There were other incidental schemes as well.  Despite raising this matter in the House on many occasions by way of question and argument and adverting to it in speeches on the Local Government Estimate, despite motions passed by my county council calling <Col N="1419" /> on the Minister to give us a reasonable allocation to proceed with these important matters, we have abjectly failed to get any response.  Not only is the Minister refusing to give us the necessary money, but he has done my county council the discourtesy of refusing to meet a deputation to discuss these matters.</P>
    <P>Is it not time we ended this hypocrisy about being concerned about the welfare of our people?  I feel that we shall have to wait for better times, better men and better Governments to solve these social problems of our people, particularly in this matter of water and sewerage.  The instances I have outlined in South Tipperary, one of the most progressive counties so far as the provision of sanitary facilities and piped water is concerned, are the pattern throughout the country.  The dead hand of the Department of Local Government has fallen flat on all local authorities in respect of water.  Surely this is a sign of bankruptcy?  No rational Government, having regard to the intrinsic worth of piped water for the home, the farm and industry, would consciously hold up or withdraw moneys or frustrate the efforts of local authorities to proceed with these essential services.  If there is an answer to it, let us have it when the Minister is replying.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to end this codology, to put an end to this insult he is offering to the county councils, and to tell us precisely where we stand. Can we at least have an allocation of money to get these schemes off the ground?  My council have been compelled to seek a loan from a foreign source for the purpose of implementing a piped water scheme.  We are awaiting sanction for that loan from the Minister at interest rates comparable with the interest charges in this country.  We want the money urgently.  If the Minister cannot give it to us, I sincerely hope he will not adopt a dog in the manger attitude and prevent us from getting this loan which we are now forced to seek abroad in Britain.</P>
    <P>I want to protest in the strongest possible terms about the slashing of <Col N="1420" /> the Road Fund grants this year.  When the Government, in the throes of the recent credit squeeze, felt compelled to rifle the Road Fund, it was self-evident that a reduction in the road grants to all our local authorities would follow. This has happened.  It happened this year to the tune of approximately £1 million.  Every county council has sustained a serious reduction in the amount of grants for main and county roads.  I want to dissuade the Minister of the foolish notion that this reduction had no effect on employment.  We all know it had.  We all know that a reduction in the road grants in many instances by an average of £40,000 or £50,000 for a county comparable with the one I represent&mdash;and £40,000 is a lot of money to a small county council &mdash;is bound, of necessity, to have adverse effects on employment.  We know that many workers have been let off already, and that it is only by scrimping and scraping that the county councils will be able to keep on their minimum labour force until the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>We see the evidence all around us as we travel up and down to Dublin. Work schemes are abandoned, and abandoned they will remain until next March when the estimates are considered again.  Machinery is standing idle, and we note the absence of men on the job.  That is a sign that the money has run out.  As a result of the rifling of the Road Fund and the slashing of the road grants, the money is running out fast, and the county engineers are obliged to cut their cloth according to their measure.  They are discarding all temporary workers, and they are down to a skeleton permanent force whom they hope by the Grace of God to keep in employment until the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>This has had a very bad effect, particularly on those who hire machinery to the various county councils. The machines are idle and the men who operate them are idle too. The temporary workers who look for employment with the county councils, particularly around Christmas time, failed to secure any this year, and the permanent staffs, as I as chairman of a county council know only too well, <Col N="1421" /> will be maintained in employment as a small permanent force until the end of this financial year next March by scrimping and scraping and scrounging. The reduction in the road grants was a severe blow to all our county councils and to the road workers who depend upon these grants for a livelihood. The Minister should not add insult to injury by pretending that the slashing of these grants had no adverse effect whatever.  The contrary is true.</P>
    <P>I wish to echo the appeal by Deputy Fitzpatrick in regard to the need for increased grants for new houses, and grants for repair and reconstruction. It is a long number of years since these grants were first introduced. These new house grants have stood at £275 for a long number of years. This is the type of grant which the ordinary home builder avails of in the urban areas.  I appreciate that some increases were conceded to the agricultural community in respect of new house grants in recent years, and that it is now possible for a farmer, depending on his valuation, to get up to £900 by way of grant for new house purposes.</P>
    <P>The urban dweller has had to contend with £275 for far too long.  This bears no relationship whatsoever to the very high cost of house building at this time.  The same applies to house repairs. For a long number of years these grants have been standing at £100, £120 or £140, depending on the number of rooms to be repaired in the household.  It is high time the Minister appreciated the vast number of increases in the cost of living, the cost of materials, and the cost of labour, and increased these grants proportionately.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of grants, I want to bring to the Minister's notice something about which there is a lot of anxiety throughout the country.  Grants for repair and reconstruction are widely availed of, and have proved to be a great boon in every town and city in the maintenance of property, the elimination of eyesores, and the avoidance of responsibility for re-housing by the local authorities, but anyone who thinks he got one of these grants without an obligation to repay <Col N="1422" /> is in for a rude awakening.  We now know that after the expiration of seven years from the day, on which one gets a grant for repair or reconstruction, one's property is not only likely to be revalued but is in fact submitted for revaluation, and we know that the revaluation in these instances has been excessive in the extreme.  Many local authorities have expressed their outright opposition to this.</P>
    <P>In cases where internal repairs only were carried out, not involving reconstruction, and for which very small grants were made, after the expiration of seven years, the houses are revisited by the valuers and the valuation is increased out of all proportion and, correspondingly, the rates are increased out of all proportion.  Many of the people concerned have been shocked and dismayed by what has happened to them as a result of their availing of the small grants for repairs.  I want to be fair in this matter and to say that in respect of reconstruction, the provision of extra accommodation or some positive improvement of that kind, one would understand property being revalued, but I protest very strongly about revaluing houses to which merely internal repairs were carried out in order to extend the life of the house and to keep it rain and weatherproof.  I would ask the Minister to see what he can do to restrain valuation officers from increasing the valuation of property of that kind. Many of the people concerned are workingclass people who simply cannot afford to pay the excessive demand for rates.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the lack of money in the Department for various purposes, particularly for the provision of piped water and sewerage facilities.  That cannot be denied.  The credit squeeze and the shortage of money in the Department of Local Government prompted the Minister's predecessor, in particular, to act in various ways for the primary purpose of replenishing the coffers of the local authorities, he, as Minister for Local Government, being unable to provide for them the necessary funds to maintain essential services, particularly in the sphere of housing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> In order to provide this extra money for local authorities the Minister for Local Government chose to rifle, in particular, the pockets of all corporation, urban council and county council tenants by implementing a graded or differential rent scheme.  The rationalisation of rents policy enunciated by Deputy Blaney, the Minister for Local Government, was a clarion call to all county managers to increase rents of all council tenants forthwith and this they set about doing.  There are countless houses of tenants whose rents were increased out of all proportion under the guise of rationalisation, on the pretext that this was being done to help the underprivileged, to help to rehouse those who could not pay high rents.  It was done on the pretext that those who needed to be rehoused would be rehoused irrespective of ability to pay rent.  We all now know that this was a positive revenueraising gimmick devised by the then Minister for Local Government to rob these corporation and council tenants and to fill the empty coffers of the local authorities.  Quite a lot of these rents were increased out of all proportion. Admittedly, some of them may have been small rents but they were increased by 300, 400 and 500 per cent in many instances.</P>
    <P>Even in the past year, under the present Minister's jurisdiction, more serious inroads have been made into the rights of corporation and council tenants.  Tenants who believed that they had entered an agreement with the housing authority to pay a fixed rent for their houses plus, of course, rates, were shocked and appalled when county managers and housing authorities simply discarded these agreements, tore them up as of no consequence and arbitrarily applied graded or differential rents.</P>
    <P>The right of tenants to purchase their homes on the basis of the original cost has also been taken from them by recent legislation and those people who had not purchased by 30th September last will now be obliged to purchase at present day values which will mean that the price will be very much dearer than the original cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> As far as county council tenants are concerned, they no longer enjoy the privilege of having adequate repairs carried out.  There is a stipulation in the new Act which means that they must be satisfied with the remedying of mere structural defects.  This is to be greatly deplored, as we pointed out when the Bill was going through the House, especially having regard to the fact that the Minister has admitted that some 80 per cent of appeals in regard to inadequacy of repairs carried out for the purpose of vesting are upheld in the Minister's Department. Having regard to the bad history of repairs to county council houses for the purposes of vesting, the Minister has done these unfortunate people a very great disservice.  He has said that 80 per cent of appeals coming to him were justified and that he was obliged to recommend to the county councils concerned that additional repairs be carried out.  These cottiers, if they feel like transferring their interest in these homes, will be in for a rude awakening because the new legislation provides that the county manager will be entitled to take from them upwards of one-third of the selling price.  That does not seem right, or fair, or proper.  I wonder on what criterion the Minister based that provision.  I know of no good reason why this should be done. When the Minister was searching for suckers from whom he could raise extra money, he picked on the corporation, urban council and county council tenants.  This was done presumably on the principle of helping the under-privileged, moryah!</P>
    <P>The differential renting system is a vicious one.  We in the Labour Party have always supported the principle of the differential rent.  Unfortunately the system has become odious in the eyes of a great many tenants because of the manner in which it is administered.  It is in administration that the flagrant defects of the system are revealed. Maximum rents in excess of the economic rent are fixed.  There are instances of tenants being stripped of the benefit of the State subsidy under this differential renting system.  We know that, when financial circumstances worsen and people seek a reduction in rent, <Col N="1425" /> reliefs are sometimes very slow and, if and when they are granted, they are granted grudgingly and only after a horrible means test, something the normal family bitterly resents.  We can understand the reaction to the system especially in the light of the evidence of a certain lack of humanity on the part of those who administer the system.  It is this inhumanity which engenders the reaction to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I want to appeal to the Minister to have regard now to the problem of emergency repairs to houses.  I understand small grants are available under section 5 of the old Act in order to keep houses in safe structural condition and to make them windproof and weatherproof.  There are many houses in urgent need of emergency repairs. The county council have approved the grants and the Minister's Department have likewise approved the grants but the repairs do not seem to be carried out.  They are seldom if ever carried out unless they are carried out by the housing authority by way of direct labour because the occupiers are very badly off, are usually extremely poor and invariably in receipt of home assistance. It is futile allocating grants to these people because, in my experience, no contractor will go in to carry out repairs since he has no confidence in the tenant being able to meet the difference between the grant and the estimate. These houses are in bad structural condition and contractors are fearful of going into them in case they find more work than they bargained for.  I know one case in which the side of the house fell down during repair work.  The Minister should have regard to the way in which these grants are administered.  He should ensure that the grants are not merely available but that the work is carried out.  I know of no way of doing this except by placing the responsibility on the housing authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt at great length with planning.  Planning is not a controversial subject since we are all agreed on the necessity for planning. Planning is essential to ensure that we shall preserve much that is beautiful and eliminate that which is ugly.  I want to refer to one aspect of planning which <Col N="1426" /> is, I believe, a source of anxiety to many people in public life.  I understand that the Minister has superimposed upon the country outside planning authorities with vast powers and it is they who will determine the future of our social and economic environment for many years to come. I understand that some of these gentlemen are foreigners.  Some of them are Englishmen.  Despite that fact, some of them are very eminent men but they are looking at this country through the eyes of an English economist.  They are simply not <i>au fait</i> with the problems of our rural people.</P>
    <P>I myself, and Deputy Kyne who sits beside me, remember vividly attending a seminar or a lecture by a representative of one of these outside planners who was charged with drawing up a plan for the whole south-eastern region of Ireland, including the counties of Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny.  I hope it is not remiss, Sir, to refer to the planning consultant concerned, a man of wide renown, highly respected for his gifts as a planner of society in Britain: I refer to Mr. Colin Buchanan.  I understand that this gentleman is charged with the responsibility of drawing up the social and economic plan of various regions, certainly the south-eastern region, containing the counties to which I have referred, and of reporting to the Minister for Local Government.  If, in his wisdom, the Minister for Local Government thinks fit to accept this gentleman's recommendation, that is the way our society will be formed for a long number of years to come.</P>
    <P>Those of us who attended that lecture at which were representatives from all the counties concerned&mdash;the chief engineers and public representatives from all these counties&mdash;were not fortunate enough to be lectured to on that occasion by Mr. Colin Buchanan himself but we had a very entertaining and enlightening lecture by one of his partners, I assume, Mrs. MacEwan. What she conveyed to us, as public representatives, of the Colin Buchanan plan for our region of the future was very disconcerting.  They were concerned with growth centres.  They were concerned with population trends.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> I was shocked and dismayed to realise that, in respect of my county of Tipperary, in their plan only one town of that county was designated a growth centre and that is my native town of Clonmel.  Of all the other important towns in that county&mdash;Tipperary, Cashel, Carrick, Cahir and, in the other part of my constituency, Lismore, Mallow, Cappoquin, outside of Waterford city which, of course, has been designated an industrial estate&mdash; there were very few growth centres as far as these economists were concerned. Their whole policy was that the labour in all of our towns and villages should be sufficiently mobile to move to these growth centres.  To us, this would mean the denuding, the depopulation, of our small towns and villages and even of our larger towns in this region.  We challenge this kind of economic thinking as applied to this country.  It might be economically wise to do this in Britain, in that vast industrial nation, but is it economically wise or is it socially prudent, in this agricultural country of ours, to apply these ways and means in respect of economic and social planning of the future?</P>
    <P>The most serious aspect of this matter was the plea which we, as public representatives from these counties, made that there should be established a liaison between ourselves and the Colin Buchanan group of planners so that our views could be expressed, so that there would be consultation and so that that we should be aware of what was happening.  However, our suggestions of representation were fobbed off as of no consequence.  I shall not say they were frowned upon or outrightly rejected but they were just set aside in a very discreet way as certainly unacceptable.</P>
    <P>If a regional plan is being drawn up for the counties of Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny by an outside planner such as Mr. Colin Buchanan, great and eminent as he is, I submit that we, the members of the local authorities within these respective counties, are entitled to a say in this plan or is <Col N="1428" /> it suggested that we shall not be consulted at all in the matter, that he will report, that it will be accepted or rejected by the Minister and that that will be the end of it?  I think that that would be showing flagrant contempt for the rights of the representatives of our various counties.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, before these plans are brought to fruition or before he considers them in any serious vein, to ensure that the members of the local authorities in each area concerned are fully consulted and their views ascertained before any segment of this plan is implemented.  It is particularly audacious that an Irish Government should superimpose on us planning of this kind.  It makes a mockery of our whole planning machinery in this country.  It places in question the intrinsic worth of the planning measures which we passed in this House.  If they were of any value, why did we have to go abroad for further consultants?  I am asking that, before any attempt is made to implement any part of these plans, the representatives of the councils concerned be consulted.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that the Minister did not advert at greater length to the Tidy Towns efforts in this country. I shall not deal at any length with the matter except to mention one pertinent point.  I believe that the appearance of most of our towns could vastly be improved if we could eliminate the many eyesores, especially the derelict sites, that mar our many towns.  I regard the grants for this purpose as totally inadequate.  If the Minister is serious about improving the appearance of our towns and villages, he will have to be more generous to our local authorities by way of extra grants for the elimination of derelict sites.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government to consider embarking upon a crash programme for the elimination of these eyesores and to increase the grants proportionally.</P>
    <P>In a very short time I believe we would see the elimination of derelict sites.  The Parliamentary Secretary may be assured of the willingness of local <Col N="1429" /> authorities to participate in any worthwhile campaign of this kind but the moneys offered by the Department so far have been less than would tempt them to embark on this work.  Clearly the work is of such a costly nature that it cannot be undertaken by means of money from the rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned traffic problems generally and I want to avail of this opportunity to ask the Minister to make a pretty speedy determination in regard to requests from local authorities for the application of additional speed limits in our towns and villages.  We have had many requests for such speed limits and we find that county councils have very little say in the matter which rests primarily with the Minister's Department. I ask him to facilitate those local authorities that have requested him to apply speed limits in their areas.</P>
    <P>How well it would be received if the Government were to make available once again money for the implementation of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  This Act is still on the Statute Book but it is sterile because of lack of money to back it up.  Pending implementation of our arterial drainage schemes on the main rivers hardship is experienced by large numbers of people as a result of periodic flooding.  In my own constituency arable land is inundated for many months of the year; roads are flooded and much damage and inconvenience caused.  Local authorities are unable to find money to deal with these problems or to bring about even temporary relief of flooding of this kind.  Draining of tributaries or certain portions of the main rivers is something we cannot tackle because of lack of money.  We are told to wait interminably for the implementation of the drainage scheme proper.  The arterial drainage of the river Suir, we are told, will begin some time in 1970.  Meantime we must contend with serious flooding of the Suir and its tributaries and we have no funds to deal with the problem. Apart from that, there is so much other good work crying out to be done which the Local Authorities (Works) Act provided for that some such scheme should be introduced to assist us in dealing with these local problems.  I have never <Col N="1430" /> accepted the viewpoint, expressed by Government spokesmen in particular, that the Local Authorities (Works) Act was money wasted.  Perhaps money was wasted because there was no follow up and no obligation placed on county councils to follow up, but those who witnessed expenditure of large amounts of money under the scheme saw valuable work done in return and worthwhile amenities provided. It is only a subterfuge to say that money was squandered.  Indeed, the Minister at the time if he allowed capital expenditure of that kind to be wasted, was himself guilty of dereliction of duty if that was the case.</P>
    <P>It is appreciated that county managers have wide powers.  Some managers use these powers wisely and well; others do not.  I do not wish now to castigate anyone; I shall reserve such comments for the appropriate local authority where I prefer to meet my adversary man to man, but it is high time county managers realised that while they possess executive powers in respect of staff matters and dealings with people they no longer have the right to hire and fire indiscriminately. I assert that before there is any large lay-off of men employed in local authorities there is an obligation on county managers as a matter of courtesy to consult the local councils and inform them of impending action as a result of redundancy.  It is an affront to a local authority and a grave disservice to the employees concerned that workers should be discarded indiscriminately without prior consultation with the local authority and an endeavour to find alternative employment.</P>
    <P>I speak of this because of the known views expressed by a particular local authority that between now and the end of the financial year next March every endeavour should be made to carry our work force over this period without laying off any man especially having regard to the volume of work requiring to be done particularly in respect of house maintenance and other essential schemes in the area.  It was also clearly conveyed that if the worst came to the worst the local authority would be prepared to make the necessary money available by way of a supplementary <Col N="1431" /> estimate so as to provide the wages of the men concerned and keep them on the job.</P>
    <P>These known views of the members of the Clonmel Corporation were conveyed to the manager and the town clerk, that there should be no lay-off. There was a superabundance of work, and if money was running out we as the corporation were prepared to bring in a supplementary estimate to provide money to put these people to work.  It was a shameful and disgraceful thing that these men were given notice without the corporation being consulted, and when a motion was put down and agreed to unanimously that the men be reinstated.  That motion has not as yet been acted upon.</P>
    <P>As I say, these gentlemen have wide powers, even dictatorial powers, but they have got to recognise that the day has come when they must treat labour with dignity and respect and that the day of hiring and firing indiscriminately has gone, and gone forever.  It was an example of the worst kind of relations which could exist between master and man, between employer and employee, something which I personally deplore, and something which I shall not allow to rest until it is remedied.</P>
    <P>With these sentiments, I shall conclude my views on this Estimate on this occasion.  I have dealt in the main with the greatest social evil in this country at the present time, the scandal of housing, a scandal which cries to high heaven for justice, and if there is any justice in this Government, it behoves them now to see that it is done and done quickly.</P>

      <P>If emotional speeches could solve the housing problem, Deputy Treacy would have solved our national problem in the past two hours. Unfortunately, we want something more than that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proud to be a member of Dublin Corporation, and it was appalling to have to listen to Deputy Treacy's abysmal ignorance in this regard.  There are various housing difficulties which affect any city whether it is Dublin Moscow, Rome or Stockholm.  The basic problem is the increase in population in these cities. Any living city will always have a housing problem.  The fact that the population of Dublin today is increasing both by reason of immigration and a natural increase, is something which we do not deplore but try to cope with.  There are few cities in the world, in proportion to their means and resources, which have done as much for housing as this city, and while I deplore the fact that there are many families who cannot get proper housing, it is no good making emotional speeches about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>No&mdash;smother it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of smothering it up.  We have to take the measures necessary to solve the problem.  I believe it will never be solved.  We may control it, but we shall never solve it.  That is the case in any living city, whether it is Moscow or Dublin.  The only difference between the two cities is that Dublin people are allowed to demonstrate against the housing shortage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second part of the problem to which I want to refer is the shortage of building land.  I believe that any man who owns land and wishes to sell to a local authority should be given a fair return.  I do not believe speculators <Col N="1433" /> should be allowed to hold some of our people to ransom.  It could be dealt with in a very simple way.  If, when a local authority purchases land for housing, the Minister, by bringing in new legislation, would refuse to recognise the added value of an extension of water and sewerage services, this would bring down the price of land.</P>
    <P>In the city and county of Dublin, we do know that there are people who, once they know the corporation or the county council have acquired land, will buy land close to that, realising that the local authority will provide drainage for the land, and they will cash in on it at a very small cost.  It is my belief that these people should be made pay the full cost of the drainage of their own land.  If the Minister would act as I request here, it would have the effect of bringing down land values, but, at the same time, it would give a fair return to the owner of the land.</P>
    <P>We hear clichés about crash programmes and so on when people talk about housing.  If we had all the money in the Bank of Ireland tomorrow and all the housing land we needed, there would still be a problem. It is reckoned in the Dublin Corporation that from the time the corporation decides to develop an area it takes at least three years before a flat or a house is built.  This is despite the fact that the corporation, like other authorities, have powers of acquisition and have, at the present time anyway, sufficient money to carry out these schemes.  It is impossible under our present system&mdash;and I do not condemn the system which gives any property owner a just profit for his land&mdash;to build houses any faster; even working as hard as they can the officials, and eventually the building workers, must take a considerable time to erect the houses or flats.  In the meantime the population is growing, and this is why we have housing problems.</P>
    <P>In the past 30 years or so Dublin Corporation have provided over 50,000 dwellings, and also, we must remember, they have provided money to help people with land to build their own houses.  Yet Deputies here tonight have been attacking the Dublin Corporation <Col N="1434" /> as if they had done nothing.  It is estimated that by 1971 Dublin city will need 17,000 dwellings, and the present plans of the corporation will give us 18,000 in that period.  The Minister has simplified many of the methods by which a local authority initiates a housing scheme.  Many years ago two or three submissions had to be made to the Department before permission was given to go ahead with a scheme.  Now one submission is sufficient, and the Minister in his brief here has said that no scheme is held up because of lack of money.</P>
    <P>This problem is a challenge to each one of us, to those interested in the city, whether it is the Government, the corporation or just the people themselves. I am convinced we can bring this under control in the next few years.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism, justified in some cases, of subsidisation of local authority housing.  Admittedly the subsidies have been generous in the past and by some standards could still be called generous but we feel that with the problems we have here in Dublin City that we have a case for special subsidisation.  After all, we are housing many people from the provinces and we feel that we should be given this special consideration so that we can let the houses at rents which people can afford.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the problem of itinerants.  It is a sad reflection on us that in the whole country we have only three settlements of itinerants.  The biggest one is in the city of Dublin where 39 families are or will be housed and that is only a start.  I feel it is a problem for our consciences. The itinerants may annoy us when they knock on our doors or even beg on the streets, but I feel we should not be happy or content until we have solved this problem either by integrating them into society or giving them special settlements for themselves.  A good start has been made and please God we will solve the problem fairly.</P>
    <P>A great talking point in Dublin city is the lack of swimming pools.  No one will deny there is a serious lack of them.  The last time the corporation <Col N="1435" /> built or bought a pool directly was about 50 years ago.  In the meantime, they have helped with the building of semi-public pools in colleges and institutions. At the moment we have, I think, 14 applications from schools and colleges for grants but we must be quite honest and admit that just at the moment we have not got the money for it.  We are hoping that in the new financial year money will be made available for at least some of these.  In the meantime the corporation are waiting to build two new pools; one at Townsend Street near the present one and one at Crumlin to serve that very densely populated area.  We had plans for many years for very big pools but things seem to have changed now and even the swimming interests would seemingly rather have a small local pool than the Olympic standard central pool.  I think the swimmers themselves would settle for anything once they had a swim during the winter months.</P>
    <P>Talk of road safety is something which one does not undertake with great enthusiasm because it seems that no matter what steps we take for road safety we are not arresting the annual slaughter.  All one can say is, as the Minister said, that without what we have done it could be worse.  I do not know where the solution to all this lies because if one looks at Continental countries like Germany where they have the most marvellous road systems they have still got a frightful slaughter every year.  I suppose it is oversimplifying the case to say that if every one took more care we would have fewer accidents but that is the only suggestion I can offer.  Whether one is a pedestrian, a motorist, a cyclist or anything else, unless more care is taken by each one of us we will not arrest the slaughter on the roads.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister referred to the rates position in his brief or even if it is appropriate to his Department but a committee is sitting at the moment, an inter-Departmental committee of civil servants, examining the whole rating system.  So far they have issued two reports and the second one starts off by saying that the present rating system is inequitable and should <Col N="1436" /> be replaced.  I do not think there is anybody in the city or country that would not re-echo this sentiment.  I feel that our present system is very heavy on people who just cannot pay.  If it were like income tax where one pays on one's earnings there would be some justice in it but there are many people living in the area which I represent who are elderly, who have kept on the family house when the family married and went away, and they are finding this crushing burden of rates just unbearable. I would ask the Minister to ask this committee to hurry up their findings so that the Government can introduce legislation which has been promised for some time in order to change the rating system and bring in a more equitable system for the benefit of those who can ill-afford to pay rates at the present time.</P>
    <P>Another thing mentioned by the Minister was fire protection.  I am a member of the Fire Protection Association, a voluntary body which tries to educate all the people into the need to take adequate fire precautions especially at this time of the year, coming up to Christmas, when we have the usual increase in accidents and deaths.  We had one in the city today where a child was burned.  I do not think we can drive home too much the terrible need for fire protection in the home especially.  While I hesitate to suggest any further imposition on schoolteachers, I feel that in the school and in the home the greatest effort could be made to inculcate in the children the need to be careful with fire because while we may deplore the annual slaughter on the roads and deplore the fact that we have not got houses, fire can bring much-tragedy and actual loss in the present housing stock.  Every year a number of houses are burned out which must be replaced at great cost.  Apart from that, it is depriving some family on the waiting list of a home.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism here of the corporation in its treatment of newly-weds and old people.  This, of course, is unwarranted because for the last 17 years the Dublin Corporation have been operating a scheme whereby newly-weds are housed in the first year <Col N="1437" /> of their marriage.  A speaker here said that they had to have children to be housed under this scheme.  This, of course, is totally untrue.  Every year we house 200 newly-weds.</P>

      <P>Seventeen years.  However it is a start.  About 200 couples every year are housed which means they do not have to live in a tenement room or with their in-laws.</P>
      <P>With regard to the housing of the old people, in each scheme the corporation includes a number of one-room flats for old people.  In addition, we have provided special schemes and chalet type dwellings where they are adequately housed.  I would like to pay tribute to the religious bodies in this regard.  The first one I think was the Methodist Church in Sandymount which built a wonderful place there for old people and this week the Corporation passed the plans of the Catholic Housing Aid Society who are going to build flats for aged people and young people also.  We are making a start in looking after the aged but it would give the corporation greater heart if more bodies would follow the example of the two I have mentioned.  I look forward to the day when all the housing will not be left to the corporation but citizens by their efforts will help out, apart, of course, from paying taxation for housing, to at least get the problems of this city under control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House very long but there are a few points I should like to make.  I expected something better in the Minister's statement.  Indeed, his statement was a big disappointment to me.  In the first place, I do not think there is adequate provision made for housing <Col N="1438" /> needs at present, especially in my constituency. Very little encouragement is given to people to build their own houses or even to reconstruct them.  I had expected that because of the increased cost of materials and labour there would be a substantial increase in grants for new houses, but especially for reconstruction.</P>
      <P>The increased grants for small farmers of under £25 valuation was very welcome, indeed, but there are two things of particular interest in that connection. The small farmer of under £25 valuation can get a grant of up to £900 from the Department of Local Government and the local authority and he can get £500 loan from the Irish Land Commission, to be put on to his receivable order.  That is £1,400. That looks fair to me and to everybody until you understand the position of the farmer of under £25 valuation as it is today.  The cheapest price at which you can erect a house is £2,000 and you are lucky if you can get one erected at that.  The question is where is the small farmer of under £25 valuation, who makes his living from the land alone, to get the extra £600 required. It is becoming increasingly difficult and it is likewise with regard to reconstruction.  The grant for a fiveroomed house is £140 and the local authority in Sligo pays an equal amount if the estimate is £420.  I have come across cases where the estimates for reconstruction were £700, £800 and £900.  Now, a man gets £420 by way of grant and he had to find £300 to £400 more.  Nowadays in the west of Ireland sizeable amounts of money like that are not to be found.  I had expected that the reconstruction grant would be increased and it is disappointing to find that it has not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency there are people living in desperate housing circumstances. I was in a house the other night in Sligo.  The woman of the house wrote and asked me to call.  Those people are married about a year or a year and a half and they have been living in a one-roomed house with a curtain drawn across dividing the room, where they slept, cooked and lived.  That poor young woman lost her health and her child due to the bad <Col N="1439" /> housing conditions.  Her doctor told her so and told her to get out as quickly as she could.  The walls were damp from the foundation up and they were covered with blue mould, even if wiped twice a day.  The walls were papered twice a month.  I also know of a case where a man, his wife and seven children are living in one room.  I give those two instances and I shall not quote any more.</P>
    <P>In those two instances there is a solution.  I should like the Minister to listen carefully to this.  There are two local authority vested cottages in the area.  These cottages have been vacant for some time.  The owners gave them to auctioneers and the auctioneers advertised them for sale.  The county council would not allow the sale to go through because they said they wanted the houses and, as you know, people cannot sell vested cottages without permission. It transpired that they were offered ridiculously low prices that nobody would accept&mdash;over £400 for houses in good condition and that was allowing for the redemption money.  It would cost £2,000 to erect a house for either of those two families and here you have two houses which up to now have not been purchased.  The answer I got was that the Minister would not sanction anything higher.  I should like the Minister to take that matter up with the Sligo County Council.  These two houses are depreciating in value.  The windows have been broken.  If the Minister wishes I shall give him the names of the people concerned afterwards. Those two families are languishing in unsanitary conditions and there are two houses available with nobody living in them.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention. It relates to the payment of grants. These payments could be speeded up a lot.  There may be a lack of sufficient inspectors but I think the time between the finishing of a job, reconstruction or erection, and payment should not be more than three weeks.  In my constituency it runs into two to three months.  That is too long.  The people concerned have to clear the builders' providers and the contractors and they <Col N="1440" /> are pressing for the money.  I would ask that inspection and payment of grants be hastened.</P>
    <P>I have also a case in point in connection with doubtful cases.  Where doubtful cases arise, I think the Minister's Department should give the applicant the benefit of the doubt.  I have a specific case in mind where a man applied for a reconstruction grant. He bought the house 13 years ago or thereabouts and he got a certificate of approval.  He did not know the regulations well and proceeded to start work before the statutory 15 years' limit.  When it came to the inspection of the house it was discovered that the grant was drawn for that house 14½ years before that.  The regulation was there and I do not think it could be got through.</P>
    <P>He then applied for a special second grant because of overcrowding and I think this is where he could have been met.  He has only two bedrooms in the house.  This man and his wife lived in the house with their son and daughter &mdash;two males and two females.  It was reasonable to let that case through and pay the man a grant.  However, it was rejected with the reply that the two males could sleep in one room and the two females in the other.  I suggest such a reply should not come from any official in any Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the provisions of old section 5 applicants.  They come under section 23 nowadays.  It was a fine section through which much valuable desirable work was done in my constituency.  If the Minister sees through the implication of the number of applicants from Sligo, it will show the state Sligo is in.  Section 5 was introduced to prolong the lifetime of a house, usually occupied by elderly people, so that it would last the occupiers during their lifetime.  It was generally assumed that when the old people died the house would not be inhabited again by human beings, that it would be converted to a cowhouse or an outhouse for cattle.  Now, there have been more than 1,000 applicants from Sligo alone and, reckoning that 75 per cent of them are genuine, it means we have between 700 and 800 <Col N="1441" /> houses which we expect to be closed down in the county during the next 10, 15 or 20 years.  That gives us an indication of what is happening in the West.</P>
    <P>Recently I asked the Minister a question about two houses that had collapsed in Sligo.  The occupants were lucky to get out of them with their lives.  An incorrect answer was given&mdash; not, let me say, the fault of the Minister. The Minister said the two people in one house, a brother and sister, had been housed by the local authority. They had not.  They are living in a boiler house belonging to a neighbour. They are sleeping and cooking in it. The Minister should direct those responsible not to supply him with incorrect information.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the rural improvement scheme.  This is a great scheme under which some fine beneficial work has been carried out.  In my county, a congested area, we had operating rural improvement schemes, minor employment schemes and bog development schemes.  There were no local contributions towards the minor employment and bog development schemes but there were towards rural improvement schemes.  From 1st April next, I understand, the three will be operated as rural improvement schemes with a local contribution payable.  It should work out all right and the only thing I have to say against it&mdash;and it is only fair to let the Minister know&mdash;is that in my county in the old days those schemes were operated by the Office of Public Works.  In Sligo, the Office of Public Works had not any staff, offices or engineers.</P>
    <P>Now that the schemes have been transferred to the Department of Local Government, local authorities have been asked to operate them.  They are to be allowed 10 per cent of the money allocated to operate the schemes.  I do not think Sligo County Council will agree to operate them on this basis. At a meeting yesterday we discussed it and it was decided to send a deputation to the Minister.  Our engineers are too busy with their own work.  They have been overloaded with extra work such as activities under section 5, repairs, derelict sites and other things.  Therefore, <Col N="1442" /> they cannot be allowed to operate the rural improvement schemes.</P>
    <P>Under the old system, the engineers were allowed 5 per cent costs.  Now, two things will happen: the engineers will lose a small bit of remuneration and at the same time have far and away more work to do.  There were about eight engineers&mdash;I am not sure of the number&mdash;operating there for the Board of Works.  If the Department of Finance seconded these engineers to the Department of Local Government to carry out the new work, and, of course, pay them, it would be a good system, much better than transferring the work to the local authority who have neither the time nor the inclination to do the job.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the rural improvement schemes are excellent and it would, therefore, be a pity to let them drop.  They can be used not alone for drainage purposes but for making boreens, making life more pleasant for the people living at the end of the boreens. As somebody said earlier, those boreens are a contributory cause of emigration from rural Ireland, particularly from the West.  It is very difficult nowadays to get a girl to marry a farmer who lives at the end of one of those laneways.  These schemes are excellent because they provide suitable passages to every house.</P>
    <P>I shall say a few words on regional water supply schemes.  When they were introduced by the Minister's predecessor in the Department, they were heralded with a fanfare of trumpets. Every woman in the country could see herself having piped water in a year or two.  It would take the drudgery out of housekeeping.  In Sligo we had grandiose plans drawn up which would cost £1.2 million.  Of course, we shall never live to see them completed.  I asked a question, which was not answered, how much had been paid in fees to the consulting engineer to draw up the grandiose schemes.  Nobody appears to know.  When the schemes are implemented is another matter.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a special word about group water schemes.  There is frustration and disappointment in Sligo about those schemes.  I asked the Minister today how many applications were in <Col N="1443" /> and how many had been completed. The reply was that there had been proposals for 25 schemes and that one scheme has been completed.  We have been pushing those schemes for all we are worth during the past three or four years.  I know a scheme 2½ years old which we have not got off the ground yet.</P>
    <P>I have been told by the engineer in Sligo that there is a lack of sufficient information available to them from the Department.  When I come to the Department, they blame Sligo County Council and Sligo County Council blame the Department.  The position is such that I have asked for a special meeting of Sligo County Council to deal specifically with group water schemes.  I have asked that the Department would send on someone to that meeting so that we will be able to find out who was wrong, what was wrong and when we can start.  I have letters here from the Department which are muddling and contradictory and I do not propose to go into them.  I want to impress on the Minister that this question of getting group water schemes off the ground in County Sligo is in a complete muddle and a complete mess.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to rates.  I consider the present system is archaic, outmoded and unsuitable and I think a long time ago some other system of collecting money should have been adopted.  I can see nowadays, in the west of Ireland at any rate, in small towns that small shopkeepers and urban dwellers will be absolutely squeezed out of existence.  Their overheads are going up year by year with increased rates.  The small shopkeepers are being squeezed out between that and the supermarkets.  There does not appear to be any hope for them.  The urban dweller has the same grievance. There is no abatement and no hope of getting a reduction under the present rates system.  I would appeal to the Minister especially on behalf of those urban dwellers and small shopkeepers to have something done immediately before it is too late.</P>
    <P>The last point I would like to make <Col N="1444" /> is to appeal to the Minister to provide moneys under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That was one of the finest Acts and beneficial work was done under it.  The Act is there but I understand that no money is being provided to implement it.  Under that Act drains, roads and those boreens I mentioned could be attended to.  I heard a Minister of the present Government once saying that it was a waste of money.  It might be wasted money in other counties in Ireland but it certainly is not wasted money for the congested areas.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at that and to make provision under that Act for the congested areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of this debate, we have heard much talk in relation to the Government's lack of progress but I must say it is clear from the Minister's report that good progress is being made.  In 1964 it was stated that it would be the aim to have between 12,000 and 14,000 dwellings built by 1970.  It is good to note that 11,000 were completed in 1966-67 and at the present rate of progress during the present year there will be approximately 11,500 or more completed by the end of this financial year.</P>
      <P>It is also worth nothing that the amount of capital provided from public sources for the building and reconstruction of houses has risen from £9 million in 1960-61 to an estimated £25 million in the current financial year.  This, to my mind, is no mean achievement.  It is a good indication of the amount of money being allocated by the Government for houses and the priority which they have fixed in relation to houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also worth nothing that out of the total capital allocation of £25 million approximately for 1967-68 a sum of £12.5 million was allocated originally for local authority houses and that this provision has since been increased by £.75 million for 1967-68. This in itself shows the manner in which the Government are prepared to get our building programme going and accelerated at a pretty steady pace. I would also like to compliment the Minister on making provision in the Housing Act, 1966, for payment of a <Col N="1445" /> subsidy at the rate of £150 per developed building site.  This should encourage urban dwellers to acquire and develop housing sites for private building.  In many towns, particularly towns with an increasing population, with industries and with a young population, it is estimated that there will be a great demand for private houses within the next few years.</P>
    <P>It is only right that the people who are willing and able to build their own houses should have the sites made available to them.  I feel the local authorities should be the proper developers of sites for private houses.  One of the greatest needs, and the one which should get very urgent attention, is the repair of county council houses.  There seems to be some slowing down in the repair of those cottages by county councils over the past few years.  It appears to me that the same provision is included in the Estimate of expenses every year without due regard to the fact that many of those cottages are deteriorating and also without due regard to the fact that the cost of repairing and maintaining those cottages is increasing.  I feel as well as that that the fact that some of those cottages are falling into disrepair prevents people from purchasing and from availing of the special cottage schemes.</P>
    <P>I also think the Minister should take up this matter with the housing authorities, particularly the county councils who do not pay supplementary reconstruction grants.  I know, for example, that Kerry County Council is one of the councils who do not pay supplementary reconstruction grants.  It is hard to understand the reason why because the repayment and the loan charges on the loan which would be raised for the purchase would have a worthwhile impact on the rates.  It is very hard to explain to people who are reconstructing and improving their houses in County Kerry why they are not getting, or why they are not entitled to get a housing reconstruction grant, when their neighbours across the county bounds in Cork are getting the grant.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies in the case of new house erection grants.  It is very hard to explain to applicants for <Col N="1446" /> county council supplementary housing grants why their neighbours in similar circumstances with similar occupations can get more grants in another county just because they are under the control of another housing authority.  This is a matter which should be taken up immediately with the housing authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the scheme for essential repair grants, but I feel it is not being availed of sufficiently by local authorities to make any further impact on the repair and improvement of old houses, particularly houses occupied by elderly people and those not likely to remain too long in the district.  In some of our smaller towns, rather than have the local authorities embarking on grandiose housing schemes to rehouse all those in need of rehousing, some little thought should be given to repairing some of the older houses.  At the moment, because of leaking roofs and faulty chimney stacks, these may not be fit for habitation, but use could be made of this grant to put them in order.  This would relieve old people with small incomes from the necessity afterwards of paying rent to the local authority for a county council house.</P>
    <P>There seems to be much controversy regarding the scheme under the Housing Act, 1966, for the sale of vested cottages.  No doubt the vendor must pay over to the local authority at least one-third of the purchase price. Normally this is fair enough, but in the case of an old cottage occupied for 40 or 50 years it is not right that the vested owner should have to pay one-third to the local authority.  In such cases the cottage is probably 40 or 50 years old and the owner has already paid a good share of money in rent to the council down the years.  Special exemption should be made in the case of very old cottages.</P>
    <P>The differential rent system is great, provided it is operated fairly by the housing authorities.  Deputy Treacy stated that this scheme has fallen down in its administration.  It is up to the housing authority to ensure that the scheme is administered properly.  It is not the fault of the Government or of the Department.  It is only just and right that wealthy people in occupation <Col N="1447" /> of local authority houses should be made pay a good rent and so make their contribution towards the cost of subsidising a house for a poorer person. I do not agree with some local authorities who increased the rent on all the cottages and then sent out a questionnaire to the tenants asking for particulars of their incomes.  That was wrong and has given rise to much comment and suspicion.  It has turned people against the differential rent system.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government not to pursue vigorously the carrying out of regional water schemes has been commented on during this debate.  Personally, I believe the group water scheme is a good answer.  It is a great thing to see 20 or 30 householders coming together and carrying out a scheme to supply their households and farms with the water they need.  It definitely cuts down public expenditure on the provision of piped water.  In ensures that the water is provided where required and to people really interested in getting it.  In addition, it is a good thing to see community spirit and cooperation by local authority, land-owners and householders.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilhawley said it is pity so much money was spent already on the preparation of the regional water supply schemes.  But the money spent on these has come in useful in the development of the group schemes.  I found, for example, in cases where people came to me looking for advice and help in relation to group schemes, that when I went to the engineering section of Kerry County Council the people there could tell me from the plans already prepared the estimated cost of the group schemes, whether they could be carried out, whether the source was good and what reservoirs, if any, should be erected.  They were able to give good advice to these groups because of what they learned during the preparation of the regional schemes. Therefore, the money already spent on the preliminary preparation of these schemes was money well spent.  It will be useful to those wishing to carry out group schemes to have so much information available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> As I am on sanitary services, I believe more thought should be given to the provision of swimming pools in some of the larger towns.  I should like to see the State exercising more authority over swimming pools built by way of State grant.  I know one town where a swimming pool was constructed by way of State grant and it has now been bulldozed away.  More authority should be exercised over the administration and control of these pools after construction.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take up with the county councils the question of the maintenance of machinery and plant, and the question of the supervision and control of quarries where materials are produced.  It is in the interest of the county council workers that these matters should be looked into.  I know a case where a county council are operating a quarry for the production of road materials.  The plant in that quarry is obsolete.  It is very hard to expect the cost of the chips and the materials to compare with the costs of production by private enterprise. This is no fault of the workers.  It is no fault of the planners or supervisors. It is the fault of the county council. They have not modernised these quarries by putting in modern equipment. It is very hard on these workers to see private enterprise developing a quarry within a mile, knowing very well that the day will come when private enterprise will be able to supply chips and materials to the council far cheaper than the county council themselves can supply them.  The Minister should direct the attention of the county councils to the necessity for maintaining, improving and modernising the plant and machinery in these quarries.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot of talk in relation to high rates, particularly in the urban districts where there is no grant or subsidy towards the payment of rates. It is very hard to say what could be done to relieve that situation.  There is no doubt that the services must be paid for and, according as the years go by, as the demand for the services increases, they will cost more and more. The time has come when we must give very serious thought to what can be <Col N="1449" /> done to help the workers and the persons in the lower income group in the towns, and particularly in the towns where few houses carry high valuations. I suggest to the Minister that he should take up with the local authorities the question of allowing the ratepayers to pay in instalments.  Some system should be devised by every rating authority to provide for the payment of the rates by monthly instalments.  This would be of great help particularly to the wage-earners.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the rather high increases in valuations in many cases.  Deputy Treacy referred to the high increase in valuations following the payment of reconstruction grants. I should like to point out that the valuation is increased whether or not the grant is paid.  The public should be aware of this because many people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>These cases are submitted to the Valuation Office after the expiration of seven years.  They are sent up deliberately and of set purpose for revaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not interrupted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person gets a housing reconstruction grant his valuation is not increased for about seven years, but if he gets no grant his valuation goes up almost immediately.  This should be pointed out to persons who think they should not apply for a grant. Their valuation will be increased whether or not they get a grant, but they will get some concession if they get a grant.  That in itself is worth nothing.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to planning and to the carrying out of development plans by local authorities.  I think it was Deputy Treacy again who said that planning is not controversial.  If he lived in Kerry he would know what controversial planning is&mdash;and probably in many of the tourist counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pretty controversial about it myself actually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we <Col N="1450" /> must have regional planning.  County planning is no good without regional planning.  I cannot see any point in preparing a development plan for a certain type of development in County Kerry, let us say, and going off at a tangent and preparing a different plan to provide for a different development for West Cork or West Limerick.  The time has come when we must have regard to the region.  This country is small and our counties are small indeed by comparision.  The time limit given to planning authorities to consider applications&mdash;a period of two months &mdash;is too long.  It is very hard on people who want to carry out development in a hurry to have to wait up to two months before getting permission.  It is harder still when there is no time limit on the Minister in considering appeals.</P>
      <P>There should be more exemptions from planning permission.  It is very difficult to explain to a person who lives a mile off a main road why he must get permission to extend his dwelling or carry out other types of development.  It is very hard to explain to him that if you make an exemption for one person you must make it for everyone.  Serious thought should be given to the provision of more exemptions in the exempted development regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will conclude by asking the Minister to give serious consideration to the question of efficiency in the local service.  The time has come when more thought should be given to efficiency through work study in that service. The service has been in operation for years and the question of its re-organisation in general should be examined. We should ask ourselves whether there is overlapping of work or whether certain sections and departments should be amalgamated.  Personally, I believe that there is great scope in local authorities, particularly county councils, for the employment of work study engineers.  Too much work is let out on contract.  More house building and other schemes should be carried out directly by the councils under the supervision of a work study engineer.  If it pays a contractor to do local authority work, how much <Col N="1451" /> more would it pay the ratepayers if the same job could be carried out more efficiently by the council, without profit, under the supervision of a work study engineer?  In that way money could be saved.  The local authority service could do with some investigation in this direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few general remarks with regard to this Estimate and to deal also with a few particular matters in connection with the constituency I represent.  Perhaps it might be better to deal briefly with the particular constituency matters first and I do so in the confidence that the matters I refer to will be within the knowledge of the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary and I know they will have his goodwill and, I hope, that of the Minister in dealing with them.</P>
      <P>One of the first matters I want to refer to&mdash;I know that this is not in any way peculiar to the county of Wicklow but is common, I am sure, to many rural constituencies&mdash;is the question of the taking over by the local authority of various roads that could more properly be called lanes throughout the county that require repair and attention and then to be kept in a state of repair.  I am not saying this in criticism of the local authority.  I know that in a number of cases any local authority, including the local authority in Wicklow, finds it cannot take roads or lanes in charge because they are private property.  There are cases also where the local authority finds it difficult to make readily available the finance required to carry out the repair work to lanes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to mention in particular four that have been brought to my attention recently and to ask the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary to use their good offices to have done whatever can be done with regard (a) to the carrying out of necessary repairs and (b) to having them taken in charge by the local authority.  One I want to bring to the attention of the Minister is Coolross lane in Clonegal. The position there is that if it has not <Col N="1452" /> already been done, not only are the local authority aware of the problem but there is their goodwill towards trying to deal with it.  The second&mdash; and again I express the hope that this might now be in hands; it probably is &mdash;is one that has caused concern to the people in Newtownmountkennedy for some time, that is, a road which serves the schools, the presbytery, the parish hall, the playgrounds in the town and also the local dump.  I know that this matter has been brought to the attention of the local authority there and, as I say, I hope that it is now in hands.  If it is not, I would strongly urge the Minister to use his good offices with the local authority to have this particular road dealt with. It is one which carries very heavy traffic, as the Minister will appreciate from the fact that the two schools are serviced by it, the parish hall and also the playing fields.</P>
    <P>There is another road running beside the Catholic church in Shillelagh which services also some county council cottages, and there is the Glenmalure-Greenane road.  All of those are roads that have been brought to my attention and I feel it right to bring them to the attention of the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>On local matters also I should like to inquire generally from the Minister what is the position now with regard to the question of the tenant purchase scheme in Arklow?  The Minister will be aware from correspondence which the Arklow Urban Tenants' Association have had with his Department that there has been a great deal of discontent amongst the Arklow urban tenants because of the fact that the 1954 tenant purchase scheme was not operated or approved recently by the Minister.  I understand that there were difficulties in the way.  The last I heard of it was that there was legal opinion being obtained on each side.  I do not want to say anything that will prejudice the position of the association or of the urban council or of the Department but if the Minister is in a position to give information with regard to it I would be glad if he would do so. <Col N="1453" /> There are two other matters that I would ask the Minister to look into and deal with if he can.  They relate to requests made to have speed limits imposed in Enniskerry and Kilmacanogue. The position so far as Enniskerry village is concerned is that a canvass was carried out there by the Enniskerry guild of the Irish Country Women's Association and about 98 per cent of the adults resident in the district, who would be concerned with or affected by a speed limit, were in favour of a speed limit being imposed. This matter has, I think, being taken up with the Minister.  The position, unless I am mistaken, is that the view has been expressed that this would fall to be considered in the general review of speed limits and what I seek to do now is to put on record for the Minister the fact that this canvass was carried out and that 226 adults living in 91 dwellings in or near the village signified their support for the establishment of a speed limit in the village.</P>
    <P>Representations have also been made to me&mdash;I am sure they have been made independently to the Minister&mdash;with regard to the question of a speed limit in Kilmacanogue.  I am sure the Minister is familiar with the area.  The fact is that there is a very lovely and very fine motorway along that stretch of the Bray-Wicklow road; it is a stretch which certainly would tempt any driver to put his foot down on the accelerator. It would, I think, be for the benefit of the district generally, and for motorists themselves, that a speed limit should be imposed and I would ask the Minister whenever the review is taking place to bear these remarks in mind and also bear in mind the representations which have been made to him on behalf of the local people.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have spoken about housing.  I do not want to take up the time of the House on this topic because I believe it is recognised by Deputies on both sides that very many thousands of people are living in unfit housing.  My collegue, Deputy Fitzpatrick, has referred to the speech made by the Taoiseach at the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis in which he referred to this matter; I do not think anyone can <Col N="1454" /> disagree with the views expressed by the Taoiseach with relation to the dimensions of the housing problem still facing us.  I think, however, that many of us when we talk of housing are inclined to think in terms of Dublin city, Cork city and other large city centres.  I am sure the Minister appreciates that in many ways the problem is just as acute in rural areas and in the larger urban centres in rural constituencies. I know that in my own constituency of Wicklow there is an acute housing problem in many areas.  Representations have been made to me.  I know, too, that the local authority are tackling the problem in many of the affected areas and are endeavouring in Bray, for example, to make a dent in the problem there.  In other areas housing schemes are in hand and some of them are nearing completion.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if those people who are inclined to be cynical about the work of Deputies and the duties of Deputies realise the extent to which Deputies are called upon to assist in problems such as the housing problems of their constituents.  I should like to read for the House some letters from constituents, letters which I have received in the past few months, seeking my assistance in getting them proper housing accommodation.  To those who think the housing problem is confined to the larger cities some of these letters will certainly be eye-openers.  I shall not give the names of the correspondents. Here is a letter from a man in Bray, seeking housing accommodation:</P>
    <P>My daughter, who is very frail, needs plenty of fresh air, which she is not getting.  My wife is attending the doctor&mdash;and the writer names the doctor&mdash;with her nerves since she was at school and this place is not making her better.  If you could only get me a house my wife and I would be so grateful before I am driven insane.</P>
    <P>That is a plea from one constituent. Another writes from Rathnew giving a list of 16 people waiting for houses there.  Here is another letter from Grangecon from a person seeking housing.  Here is another from Bray again:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> I am writing to ask you if you could help to get a house for me.  We are on the housing list four years.  There are four of us in one small room.</P>
    <P>Another writer from Bray says:</P>
    <P>I am eleven years on the waiting list for a house.</P>
    <P>Yet another letter from Bray says:</P>
    <P>I have five children and I am living in a two-roomed flat upstairs.  I have no garden back or front.  The children play on the main road.  The bedroom is very damp.  The plaster is coming off the wall and it is very small for seven.  I dread the winter coming in as I have just had a baby and this place is so damp, if any of the children get a cold or flu he is bound to get it too as we are all on top of one another.</P>
    <P>There are several more letters stressing the very difficult conditions in which many of these people are living. Another writer from Bray says:</P>
    <P>For nearly ten years I am on the housing list of the Bray Urban District Council.  I have no toilet whatsoever of any kind.  My wife and children are losing their health owing to the state of this house.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to read all these out.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the type of housing situation that exists in many areas.  I have referred to some of these extracts because I want to make the point, which I think has been made by other speakers and which I think is a very valid one, that, in a number of these cases where people need housing accommodation, the unfortunate people are being driven to distraction. Mental stress and strain are created because of the housing conditions.  If for no other reason, I think that, as a matter of charity, we should endeavour to expedite the housing drive as best we can and help as best we can in any efforts to provide proper housing and proper housing conditions for our people.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have referred to rates.  I gather from what has appeared <Col N="1456" /> in the newspapers in the past day or so that there is a bit of a shock in store for Dublin ratepayers.  It is a shock that is becoming almost an annual event not alone in Dublin but in most areas.  Is the Minister in a position to make any pronouncement on the result of the investigations into the rating system?  Certainly, in many ways it is unsatisfactory.  A glaring weakness in our rates system, as we know it, is that the demand for rates is in no way related to the means of the ratepayer.  That can lead to very great hardship.  Consider a widow who remains in the family house when the breadwinner has died.  Although the income going into the house may dramatically be reduced, the rates levy is exactly the same.  There is no relationship between what has to be paid in rates and the ability of the ratepayer to pay.</P>
    <P>We in these benches have advocated and have included in portion of our policy <i>Towards a Just Society</i> the idea that there should be a rates abatement scheme for necessitous people.  There is no reason why such a scheme should not operate and operate successfully. The Minister would be more <i>au fait</i> with the matter than I am, but I think I am correct in saying that, within recent years, such a scheme was put into operation in Britain and, so far as I know, has been working successfully. The kind of case I have in mind, the kind of case to which I have referred where the income is dramatically reduced by reason of the death of the breadwinner, is the deserving case that could be catered for and I think should be catered for in a rates abatement scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary referred to the payment of rates by instalments.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong but I think it is open to rate collectors to accept payment by instalments if they chose to do so.  I do not know if there is any legal sanction for such an arrangement.  I do not know whether Deputy O'Leary had this in mind&mdash;I think possibly he had&mdash;but, if he had, I would support him in regard to it.  We should go farther than that.  It should not merely be a question of leaving it <Col N="1457" /> to the discretion either of the local authority or individual rate collectors. We should give a statutory right to ratepayers to pay by instalments if they prefer to do so.</P>
    <P>National taxation and local taxation have risen to such heights that it is now extremely difficult even for the wealthy in the community to keep up with the demand.  So far as the local authority is concerned, while exactly the same amount would be collected and paid to them at the end of the year, it might be of great assistance and greatly in ease of the hard-pressed and harassed ratepayer that he should, as a matter of right, be entitled to pay his rates in instalments throughout the year.</P>
    <P>Also in our policy <i>Towards a Just Society,</i> we have advocated the establishment of a citizens' advice bureau in each local authority area.  I strongly recommend this to the Minister.  It may seem small and in some ways a bit of a nuisance to consider it but for the ordinary citizen, in whatever local authority area he may be, it could be a great boon and a great blessing.  From the point of view of many Deputies and local public representatives, this might prove of considerable benefit in reducing the work they have to do.  I am not advancing the proposition on that basis but very often matters about which Deputies and county councillors and urban district councillors are approached relate to benefits to which the people making the approach are entitled.  Very often, they get it into their heads, either because they do not understand the position or because they have a wrong idea about it, that it requires &ldquo;push&rdquo; or &ldquo;pull&rdquo; to get a housing grant, an old age pension or to benefit under one or other of the various schemes.</P>
    <P>I think I speak for many Deputies when I say I would welcome a situation whereby some machinery would be established in each local authority area which would provide the people with a knowledge of the services available to them, with a knowledge of and information about their rights, so that they would not feel they have to go, cap in hand, to anyone, be he a Deputy, a county councillor, an urban <Col N="1458" /> district councillor or anyone else, to secure their rights.  It would be well worth the Minister's while to consider adopting that part of the Fine Gael policy.  After all, in various other matters the Government have not been reluctant to adopt points of the Fine Gael Policy for a Just Society.</P>
    <P>I want to finish by saying a few words about road accidents and traffic control generally.  When the question of speed limits was first proposed in this House, I did not feel very keen about them.  I have forgotten whether I spoke then about the speed limit idea: if I did, I was probably critical of it because I felt that part of the problem in driving was caused by drivers who were too slow.  I now say, in any event, that the imposition of speed limits has worked well and satisfactorily and it was worth while imposing these limits, but, by and large, it is still true to say that we cannot effectively legislate against road accidents, and if we are going to have any substantial decrease in road accidents, it will only be if we can get users of the road, whether motorists, cyclists or pedestrians to realise their own personal responsibility to take care when using the roads.  I know that by means of publicity and propaganda of all sorts, every effort is being made to instil that idea of personal responsibility into road users and as far as I am concerned the more propaganda and publicity there is to that effect the better it will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This happened before when the Minister was called when it was my turn.  This Estimate is being taken around the time when any citizen may be interested in his or her fundamental right to be included in the register of electors.  He or she has an opportunity of looking at the electors list to see if his or her name and names of members of the family who are entitled to vote are included in the list.  This is a fundamental right which belongs to every citizen.  Every Deputy, I think, has had occasion to reflect that it is only at election time that people realise that they have the right to vote but quite often under the present legislation, due to haphazard methods of registering electors, they find their names are not on the list.  In far too many cases they look for some sinister influence behind their disfranchisement and fail to realise that in them is resident the right to claim a vote, and if they do not do so, nobody can have much sympathy for them.  In most cases this disfranchisement is due to the carelessness of the elector himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even since the compilation of the register was taken over from the county registrar and vested in the local bodies there has not been the improvement generally in the compilation that one would expect.  In various parts of the country, I have seen the registers and they have been prepared in a most haphazard fashion.  Indeed I was told a story which I fully believe, getting it from the source from which I did get it, that in one area the rate collector saved himself much foot-slogging by going to the local school, <Col N="1460" /> stopping the little boys and girls coming out and asking: &ldquo;Is that your daddy?&rdquo;&ldquo;Is that your mammy?&rdquo;&ldquo;Is your brother gone to England?&rdquo;&ldquo;Is your sister 21 yet?&rdquo; That sort of thing is happening.  In my own constituency where the rate collectors do not do this job, there are also areas that are very badly compiled although, happily I think those in the constituency know that is more the exception than the rule.  I mention these bad areas so that those people who say that this is a job for the unemployed will realise that they are talking from their hearts more than their heads.  Compiling the register is quite difficult and requires a certain standard of intelligence and education which local authorities should look for.</P>
    <P>Speaking at local level, I should like to pay tribute to the system of advertising which is maintained in Cork and was started, I think, by the county registrar in his day.  It is now maintained by the local authority and under it no citizen with eyes in his head can possibly fail to see that now is the acceptable time to claim his vote and if he does not do so, he might well be disfranchised when an election takes place.</P>
    <P>Still on the local level, one thing which continually causes me the greatest disquiet is that for some time now Cork Corporation have been discussing and planning for the construction of an auxiliary fire station on the north side of the city.  The plans for this fire station are not going ahead with the expedition I would look for and I would ask the Minister, if any aspect of this matter comes before him for sanction, that he would treat it as a matter of great urgency.  There is no doubt in my mind, and I do not think there can be one in the mind of any Deputy representing my constituency, that at peak traffic time between half past five and 6.15, if there were a fire in an institution&mdash; and there are many institutions on the north side of the city&mdash;where there are old and infirm or very young people in large numbers, with the very best will in the world and co-operation by motorists, pedestrians and everybody else, the fire brigade could not get to <Col N="1461" /> the assistance of that institution.  It is quite possible that if any outbreak like that took place there would be a holocaust at which we would all hold up our hands in horror and say that somebody had blundered.  I ask the Minister to treat this matter with urgency if it comes before his Department.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much the Minister's announcement that he is going to publish the little booklet for the use of would-be house purchasers.  This is the first instalment, I think, of the Minister's adoption of our citizens advice bureau suggestion in the Fine Gael policy for a just society.  It is important that young couples who are anxious to set up house, who are ready almost to take any risk to do so, should get a list of do's and don'ts from the Department which would assist them in the purchase of their houses.  When the booklet is published, I hope it will be as outspoken as is possible with the laws of defamation, because there are about 67 different varieties of chancers against whom young house purchasers should be protected and against whom they should be warned.  While I am speaking about young couples and housing, this probably is the acceptable time to refer to the housing problem as we find it in Cork city.  The Minister, in his speech today, said that some 1,800 houses would be built in probably four to five years.  Of course, these 1,800 houses which are to be built in four to five years, have been a feature for the past two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They were a feature of the by-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been a feature of the housing programme for the past two years.  The Minister solemnly promised to start building the houses in 1965, so that even if they are built in the next four or five years&mdash;I hope they will but I doubt it, because the Minister's <i>bona Fides</i>, if they are to be tested on what already transpired are gravely open to suspicion&mdash;it will mean, in effect, that the people of Cork are getting in seven years what they should have had in five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection there is one thing about which I think I am well entitled to protest.  During the recent by-election <Col N="1462" /> campaign in Cork, three of the four candidates who stood for election there were members of Cork Corporation.  During the campaign in Cork, the Minister, for reasons best known to himself but guessed at by me and many others, decided to inspect the site to which I am referring.  He was accompanied, and rightly so, by officials of the corporation.  He was accompaniel, and rightly so, by the Lord Mayor of Cork.  I do not object to that, although the Lord Mayor of Cork is a Member of this House and a member of the Minister's Party.  However, one thing which I consider was both mean and scandalous and which must be commented upon is this, that of the 30 other members of the corporation, only one member of it was asked on that tour of inspection. He was not the Fine Gael candidate; he was not the Labour candidate; he was the Fianna Fáil candidate, now Deputy French.  His photographs appeared in the press and he appeared on the pre-election programme which Fianna Fáil put on Telefís Éireann, accompanying the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite entitled to invite his friends anywhere he likes.  He is quite entitled, in his view anyway, to use things like that for any political purpose, but I do not think he is entitled, by implication, to give rise in the minds of some of the less educated people in Cork, to the belief that the only Party candidate standing for election in the Cork by-election who was interested in re-housing the people was the Minister's colleague, now Deputy French.  I think that was wrong, and I should like to protest, in the presence of the Minister, on the matter.  We inquired in Cork Corporation and we were assured both by the City Manager and the Lord Mayor, both of whom are honourable men, that no member of the corporation was invited to take part in that tour of inspection.  We can take it, therefore, that what the Minister did was for purposes which are transparent and which can only be deplored.</P>
    <P>Again on the question of the 1,800 houses to be built, the Minister will recall that he sent his lavish circus, if you like to put it that way, his <Col N="1463" /> lavishly decorated caravan through the streets of the city of Cork during the election campaign bearing the slogan: &ldquo;More houses than ever&rdquo;.  Those of us who are familiar with the rate of building maintained by Fianna Fáil realise that that is ambiguous and an almost unappetising phrase, because it would not be hard to be building more houses than Fianna Fáil ever built. Again there was implied there, and it was taken by some people as a promise, that the building of the houses would start immediately.  I shall watch with interest and with hope the future of this housing scheme, because we had in Cork Corporation a solemn undertaking from one member of the corporation who was also a Fianna Fáil Deputy that the building of houses in that scheme would start next February. If it does, nobody will be happier than I.  I may say that nobody will be more surprised.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider very seriously the proposition to build 11-storey high flats in Cork.  This, of course, is my own personal view, but it is based on the experience of one who has been a member of Cork Corporation for 22 years and a Member of this House for 14 years.  In both of those capacities, I have, time after time &mdash;and I think Deputy Healy and other Members who represent my constituency here have had the same experience&mdash;had people coming to me, people who were housed in flats, thinking of the flimsiest excuses to get out. The fact is that people do not warm to flats, even two- or three-storey flats, and their reaction to 11-storey flats, in my opinion, will be most unappreciative.</P>
    <P>I look upon the building of houses as not purely the provision of accommodation for people.  You could accommodate a person in a hovel, or you could accommodate him in a mansion and he might not still be happy.  What we want to build for the people of Cork, the people of Dublin and of other cities, are homes where they will be contented, with a certain amount of privacy, with a certain amount of togetherness which is not affected by the person who is upstairs <Col N="1464" /> or downstairs, the person using the common stairway or the common lift. You deprive the ordinary man and woman and their families of that privacy when you house them together in 11-storey flats.  It is all very well for people to say: &ldquo;I was in Sweden and I saw them, and everybody was delighted.&rdquo;  We are not in Sweden here. We have not been brought up in that tradition.  You are not going to change this generation, the next generation or the generation after that to accept high-rise flats of this nature and to live happily in them as one would like to see one's own family living.</P>
    <P>When the Minister talks here about criteria in respect of housing, he quotes figures of the amount of money being spent compared with the amount of money spent before.  That is not the proper criterion to apply to the building of houses.  What we want is the number of extra roofs, the number of extra houses, the number of extra foundations laid, as compared to other years.  We must not forget this, that due to Fianna Fáil deliberate policy in reducing the number of houses built, we now have to build houses at vastly inflated prices.  The number of houses you will now build for £3 million is not at all as great as the number of houses you could have built in the past, and I can give statistics to bear out what I say.  In 1957, for instance, Cork Corporation spent £670,000 and built 491 houses.  In 1967, they spent £335,000 and built only 128 houses.  Therefore talking in terms of increased expenditure is a useless criterion that I would ask the Minister not to use.</P>
    <P>With regard to delay in the building of houses.  I have said here before, and many Deputies have said the same, that I do not see the reason for what seems in a large number of cases useless duplication of scanning of plans and tenders and various other things for housing schemes and other schemes of that nature.  We should make sure that the local experts we put in charge of house building and various other matters are of such a calibre that they can safely he relied upon in regard to the preparation of building schemes and the ultimate building of houses. <Col N="1465" /> At the moment you have to send up a draft lay-out of the scheme and the Department sends it back and recommends certain amendments.  Then you send the revised lay-out up and down it comes again.  Tenders are sent up; they are kept there; and then come down again, and in several different ways you will find that there can be avoidable delays in regard to building schemes and such matters.  I remember one member of Cork Corporation&mdash;a prominent member of the Minister's Party&mdash;regretting at one time that we would never build a scheme called the Closes scheme if the Minister held up the sanction for some section of it which I cannot recall now.  There is much too much of that.  The Minister should realise, as I am quite sure he does realise, that housing problems are so urgent that delays of that nature should not take place.</P>
    <P>I speak subject to correction on this but I understand that housing grants are reduced if some of the materials put into the houses are not of Irish manufacture.  This is commendable as a principle, but on the other hand, when we are drifting or going headlong into a free trade area, I wonder is this a sort of concealed protection for Irish manufacturers of certain commodities which are not up to standard compared with British ones.  I have been told by a close relative of one commodity which costs £17 10s and is manufactured in Ireland.  Another commodity of the same nature but of a better quality costs £13 10s but they have been told that if they put this British commodity into a house, their grant will be reduced.  This is the sort of protection we should not give to people of that nature.</P>
    <P>With regard to town planning appeals, I do not want to go into legislation but on the administration side, I and many others are dissatisfied with the manner in which decisions of local councils in those matters are completely disregarded by the Minister. They come up to the Minister; the appeals may be heard in public or private or be written or oral evidence and nobody quite often knows what happened.</P>
    <P>I do not want to keep the Minister <Col N="1466" /> much longer but on the question of road construction, I have on many occasions here advocated another look at our plans in this regard and I have drawn, by Dáil Question, the Minister's attention to a reference in a trade paper recently which deplored the Department's obvious policy of building dual carriageways in places where they would not be needed at all.  I feel a lot of this is useless expenditure and I would ask the Minister to look into it.</P>
    <P>The traffic survey in Cork has not yet been completed and that has a significance all its own.  It means that we are still left with the greatest anachronism of a bridge in this country.  I refer to Parnell Bridge opposite the City Hall where there are only two lines of traffic on one of the busiest entries to the city.  We are told that this is held up because the traffic survey at present in course of operation in Cork has not been completed. I would be glad if the Minister could give us some indication as to what the plans are in regard to Parnell Bridge for the future or whether he has heard anything in recent times from Cork Corporation in respect of Parnell Bridge.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to pollution of air.  I wonder have we continuous monitoring of the air by automatic analysers so that we establish pollution levels for every hour, day and place.  I have advocated this before.  I do not know if the Minister intends to do anything about it but it is an important matter.  This time last year, my colleague Deputy Healy referred to the same thing.  Can the Minister tell us whether anybody has been seconded from the Institute of Research to look into this very important matter?</P>

      <P>Anyway, at the outset I should like to compliment the Minister and the Government on the amount of money that has been provided <Col N="1468" /> for housing and housing services this year.  The fact that a sum of £26 million as against £9 million in 1961 has been provided shows the effort that has been made by the Government to try to come to grips with our housing problems.  We would, of course, in view of the demands that are made on us all over the country for houses at the moment require at least £50 million, but it is all too easy to speak of what should be done, but to find that type of money today is anything but an easy job.  If it were possible to get our hands on that type of money, the Government would be most anxious to remedy the colossal backlog that we have arrived at where housing is concerned.</P>
      <P>I was rather amazed to hear Deputy Barrett from Cork referring to the number of houses that have been built in Cork city.  To me that is comparable with the position in my own county where Killarney Urban Council over 15 years built 12 houses, notwithstanding the fact that we built over all County Kerry 2,000 houses in that time.  Kerry County Council cannot be blamed for the position in Killarney and I am sure the Government cannot be blamed entirely for the position in Cork.  Corporations must be at fault where this type of backlog exists.</P>
      <P>We had a meeting of the housing committee of the county council yesterday and had a general check-up on the position facing us there.  We need a total of 900 houses of all types to meet our present housing needs.  In that position we have arranged to build at the rate of 210 houses over the next three years, which will give us 600 houses. We hope to have 100 small-type houses built for the old, the husband and wife or the man and woman who have no children, erected within that period and we hope to have 200 essential repair grants carried out which will more or less cover existing needs.  We do not expect that we will get to the end of the housing shortage as we know there will be ever-increasing demands.  We will always have demands for more houses and there will be more present day houses getting out of the necessary habitable condition and the standards our people need today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> It seems a pity that the Minister cannot see his way to increase the amounts payable by way of grants.  Unfortunately, I suppose with the demand for more houses, it is difficult in view of the shortage of money.  I do think, however, that we should consider increasing the reconstruction grants.  The fact is that £140 to cover water and sewerage is all that can be obtained today for a house that might cost up to £1,200.  One-sixth of the total is entirely unlikely, in view of the fact that a person can get one-third of the cost.  I think there is room for improvement in reconstruction grants, with a view to getting all the old houses that can be improved reconstructed which will save us having to get new houses erected.  This saving would be possible by increasing the reconstruction grants to £200.  I would ask the Minister to try and have this done if at all possible.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to hear Deputy Barrett say that materials going into our houses in this country could be obtained cheaper and of better quality outside.  My firm is particularly engaged in the supply of materials for houses and I can assure everybody in this House that that statement of Deputy Barrett is far from correct. There is no British material that Deputy Barrett can find outside that can be superior to anything we have <Col N="1470" /> here.  There is a position whereby large quantities of British material of substandard quality are sent in here to compete against our own materials and these materials are going into houses which are served with grants.  I particularly refer to felt because it is coming in produced at substandard grade and the British make no bones about that. It is purchased and sold to our people who pay less for it.  There are many other articles not from Britain, but which also come from outside, of the same standard but every bit of Irish material, whether cement, plaster, hardboard, boardbond, or blockboard, is of first-class quality and the highest quality that can be obtained in any part of the world, and that is the major part of the material used in any house outside timber.  The timber is imported in any case and I do not have to refer to that.  All the material, whether it is the earthenware products or anything else, has to comply with and conform to certain standards and they are of the highest quality and standard obtainable.</P>
