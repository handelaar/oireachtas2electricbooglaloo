    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether CIE have notified him of their intention to increase fares; if so, the extent of, and the reasons advanced for, the increases proposed; and if, having regard to the need to keep down the direct cost of transport he will have steps taken to increase the subsidy paid to CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE notified me of their intention to increase rates of fares because of increased costs arising from increases in salaries and wages and other improvements in conditions of service granted to the Board's employees and also in the costs of materials.</P>
      <P>Details of the increases and the reasons therefor have been given in a comprehensive statement issued by the General Manager of CIE on Thursday, 7th December, 1967.</P>
      <P>Under section 6 of the Transport Act, 1964, CIE's annual subvention of £2 million cannot be varied before 1st April, 1969.  The amount of the subvention will be reviewed after that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out to the Deputy that the taxpayer would have to bear the cost of any increase in CIE's annual subvention.  An increase in the CIE subvention of the order of £2 million per annum, which is the estimated yield of the proposed increase <Col N="1810" /> in rates and fares, would be the equivalent of an addition of almost 4d per gallon to the tax on petrol.  I see no merit in transferring the burden of the increased charges from the users of CIE services to the taxpayer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary say when he received notice from CIE of their intention to increase the fares?  That is No. 1 No. 2 is: having regard to the fact that CIE are now, for the third time since 1964, increasing fares and also to the fact that costs have gone up by over 25 per cent in the intervening period, would the Government now increase by at least £500,000 the subsidy to CIE so as to restore the position which existed when we were discussing the 1964 Transport Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of answer to the first part of the question, CIE had been contemplating this increase for some time.  In regard to the second part of the question, I do not think, in view of what I have said in the reply, that an increased subvention of £500,000 would go anywhere in solving the problem, in view of the fact that it would take £2 million to do so and this, as I have said, would be equivalent in tax to an increase of 4d per gallon on petrol.  This is what is required to meet the increased subvention which CIE would need in order to bridge the gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the Government will collect from £3 million to £4 million additional income as a consequence of devaluation and the increased yield in turnover tax and wholesale tax, would the Government not allocate half of that £4 million to CIE to help to relieve the shockingly grave burden which will now be imposed on families in this city and elsewhere throughout the land in meeting this frightful increase in one &ldquo;go&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot possibly accept the suggestion that the Government can expect to have an increase to their coffers of £4 million, as I think the Deputy said.  I cannot see how his mathematics work out in that regard. <Col N="1811" /> It is a question of whether the users of CIE or the taxpayers as a whole meet this increase of £2 million, and it is the decision that it be left to the users of CIE to pay the increase and to bridge the gap that has been brought about mainly by way of increases in the wages and salaries of CIE personnel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that parcels of clothing from the part of England affected by foot and mouth disease were delivered in the Turloughmore area of County Galway recently; and what action he proposes to take to prevent the danger of infection from such parcels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Investigations by officers of my Department have traced one such parcel delivered on 27th November and arrangements have been made by them to have the contents disinfected.  If the Deputy is aware of any other case, I shall be glad if he will give me particulars. The British postal authorities have been asked not to accept parcels containing used clothing addressed to people in this country.  If such parcels arrive they will be returned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries what further steps he proposes to take to <Col N="1812" /> prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease to this country; and if he is satisfied with the precautions being taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Deputy put down this question, the following important measures have been announced:</P>
      <P> (1)  a prohibition on any person arriving from Britain from entering within 21 days of his arrival, any building or land to which livestock have access.  The onus for ensuring compliance with this prohibition rests on the owner of the premises as well as on the traveller from Britain.</P>
      <P>(2)  Restriction of sailings and flights during the Christmas period.</P>
      <P>(3)  Disinfection of everyone arriving in this country from Britain.</P>
      <P>(4)  A ban as from midnight on 13th December of sales of livestock in marts except for immediate slaughter or immediate shipment.</P>
      <P>(5)  Appeals by me through all available media of communication to Britain asking people not to come to Ireland at this time.  </P>
      <P>The question of additional measures is under constant review and I shall not hesitate to take necessary steps which seem desirable and practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether any steps are being taken to ensure that people do not come in from Northern Ireland through the uncontrolled roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, as the Deputy is probably aware, facilities in operation at the entry points in the Six Counties which do a screening similar to that which we ourselves were doing in regard to disinfection until we changed over to complete disinfection for all, quite recently.  In so far as movement through from there is concerned, again we have been establishing at our approved road frontier posts a number of our people right round the clock, who are aided by the Garda, to ensure that nobody coming in through the Six County ports of entry can proceed through the land frontier into the Twenty-six Counties without being subjected, as regards their baggage, <Col N="1813" /> to scrutiny, and everything that is prohibited from being brought into our ports of entry will be prevented from coming in at the land frontier posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied this is actually taking place?  Last Thursday a man went to a funeral in England, came back by Northern Ireland, and passed through a place called Aughnacloy, and he was not asked by anybody whether he had undergone any disinfection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I have his name?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I can give the Minister his name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If he was coming from the other side, he should not have been coming through Aughnacloy, unless he was devising a means of codding the people at the customs post that he had not been anywhere except in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister further aware that since I raised the matter of private buses going up for shopping in the North of Ireland, this is being used now to divert traffic from the private bus owners who have a licence to CIE, and that organisations that heretofore have been employing these buses have now been told they cannot get to the North of Ireland unless they go by CIE bus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I not correct in believing that there is the closest correspondence between the veterinary precautions taken by the Government of Northern Ireland at their ports of entry from Great Britain and the precautions taken by us at our ports of entry?  If there is not, may I assume the Taoiseach in his recent excursion to Belfast has taken some steps to ensure that such co-ordination does and will continue to exist until this danger is over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, as the Deputy has said, the closest contact and co-ordination between the measures being taken here and in the Six Counties. However, this is not to say that cases such as complained about by Deputy <Col N="1814" /> Clinton may not still arise.  I should hope that everybody outside this House as well as within would keep in contact with the Department through my officers, to let them know of cases in which people may try to get in by devious routes and cod us into the belief that they have not been out of the country when in fact they have, and possibly in a danger area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that people who had to go to England for personal reasons and who have returned and reported the fact that they were in England, have been refused permission to resume their employment as farm workers?  These people have now no source of income at all.  Would the Minister say what the Government can do to see that these people do not die from starvation while waiting for the foot and mouth disease to subside?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If all the regulations that we have made and that we are making are strictly adhered to, a number of people will find themselves suffering certain hardships.  As to what can be done, this can only be examined as it comes to light.  I am not aware of the specific cases the Deputy has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will examine them, the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Social Welfare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A suggestion as to who would examine them would probably be taken as an acceptance of liability. Therefore, to say who should examine them with this in view, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether he is aware of the growing concern among the farming community about the number of people who are entering this country from foot and mouth disease infected areas in Britain; and whether he is satisfied with the precautions being taken to ensure that such people do not transmit the disease to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the existing regulations, persons coming into this country from Britain are prohibited for 21 days after arrival from entering cattle sales, abattoirs, meat and bacon factories, AI centres, creameries, etc. or any land or building on which animals are present or to which they have access for the time being.  Every person arriving from Britain is served with a notice of this prohibition and contravention entails heavy penalties. In addition everyone arriving is now disinfected and his baggage carefully examined.  Stockowners in the country have a special responsibility in this matter and they should see to it that no visitors from Britain are allowed on their premises.  In fact they are committing an offence if they allow this, and so of course are any visitors who go on such premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In consideration of the fact that scheduled air services are operating to this country from airports within the affected areas in Great Britain, for example, from Manchester and Birmingham, will the Minister consider the possibility of prohibiting passenger traffic on these routes which would minimise the risk of bringing infection into this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in regard to the landing of all aircraft at any of our airports is today and at the moment being finally sorted out, as to the numbers of people who will be allowed to enter through these airports. As to the companies who will carry them, whether they be charter, our own company or different companies, or how they will be restricted in the carrying of passengers, this I cannot say at the moment.  However, that there will be an overall restriction is on the cards. <Col N="1816" /> It is a general numerical limit that is being put on the ports and the airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest to the Minister from my experience that the attempted mitigation of the problem by the segregation at the ports of those who have not been on infected land and those who have been leaves a very grave lacuna in the precautions, because there are unscrupulous persons who have been on affected land and who, knowing that they will be disinfected strictly if they have been on affected land, will claim they come from urban centres?  In the grave circumstances in which we find ourselves, would the Minister not think the House would feel justified in saying that that kind of segregation must cease and that anyone coming here must submit himself to the disinfection procedures applying to a person coming from infected areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, this is now the case.  There is no segregation any longer.</P>

    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether he will now consider prohibiting the entry to this country of people from the foot and mouth disease infected areas in Britain; whether such a step will be feasible; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already considered this and have come to the conclusion that effective enforcement would not be practicable.  Furthermore, I understand that the Six County authorities, for constitutional reasons, could not have a similar prohibition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Orders recently made by me provide that all persons entering this country from Britain are prohibited from entering, within 21 days of arrival in this country, any cattle sale, abattoir, meat or bacon factory, AI centre, creamery, cold store, flour or grain mill, feeding stuffs premises, or any land or building on which animals are present or to which animals have access.  A notice to this effect is served on every person arriving here from Britain.  This notice binds not only the visitors but owners of such premises in this country. All persons from Britain are now disinfected <Col N="1817" /> and the baggage carefully examined.</P>
    <P>7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will give a progress report on the results of the Government's campaign to persuade Irish people in Britain not to return home for Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's appeals to persons in Britain not to come here for the present have been given very full publicity through all available media of communication in that country, including press and television. I have also arranged for the distribution of a personal letter carrying this appeal to Irish workers engaged in combating the disease in Britain.  Our Ambassador in London has asked the Catholic clergy in Britain to ask their congregations not to travel to Ireland at this time.  He has also distributed many thousands of copies of a similar appeal through the various Irish clubs and societies in Britain.  As announced at my press conference on 7th December, transport companies are being asked not to provide increased sailings or flights between now and Christmas.  Every passenger arriving from Britain will be subject to disinfection and thorough customs examination, and will be prohibited from entering any farm premises, etc., for twenty-one days after arrival.</P>
      <P>I understand that these measures have already met with an encouraging response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that the danger is not sufficiently grave at present to warrant a decision to close the ports to passenger traffic for a week before Christmas and a week afterwards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply I gave earlier may have given the impression&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that I could not do it.  It is important that the question itself should be read when considering the answer.  I was asked if I &ldquo;will now <Col N="1818" /> consider prohibiting the entry to this country of people from the foot and mouth disease infected areas in Britain&rdquo;.  As I say, segregation is not practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister given any consideration to the possibility of providing some from of assistance for those exiles who have elected to remain in Britain and who, as a result of their patriotic and unselfish decision, will suffer inconvenience and, judging by recent newspaper reports, severe hardship during the Christmas period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as those who have listened to our pleas not to come here are concerned, I hope that, through the kindness of other Irish people living in Britain and through the activities of the various Irish groups and associations over there, all efforts will be made to try to make their stay in Britain during Christmas as pleasurable as possible.  I am not in a position to comment on what further could be done.  We are conscious of the position and know that a definite effort is being made by all the organised Irish groups in Britain to get entertainments going that normally would not take place at Christmas.  In addition, Irish people who have homes in Britain are being encouraged to bring their work-mates home for Christmas.  That idea is catching on and we hope that by Christmas it will be more widespread so that the people who refrain from coming here will find, while they may miss coming home, they will not be left out in the cold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. P. O'Donnell</b> asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will request the Foyle Fisheries Commission to refrain from increasing the licensing fee for salmon net fishermen in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Any proposed increase of licence duties for fishing in the Foyle Area would require the making of amending regulations by the Foyle Fisheries Commission with the statutory approval of the fishery authorities in Dublin and Belfast.  I shall consider <Col N="1819" /> this matter fully if such regulations come before me, but I do not think I should interfere at this stage with the normal working of the Commission which is the statutory body set up by the two Governments to manage and administer these fisheries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister received, as some of the rest of us have received, complaints from the fishermen that they have been informed by the authority that the rate of the licence fee is to be raised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  So far as I know, what has given rise to the question by my two colleagues from Donegal is the fact that the Foyle Fisheries Commission have circulated to the members of the advisory council certain proposals for their comments and suggestions. That is all that has happened so far.  These proposals encompass certain matters bearing on an increase in the licences and other things to do with the days on which fishing is allowed. These have been circulated to the council members, who will report back to the Commission as to what they think about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 20, 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The extent, if any, to which existing legislation may be inadequate to enable the Dublin city section of the Grand Canal to be closed temporarily to permit Dublin Corporation to lay sewerage drains under the canal and to restore the canal over the drains is being examined.  The question of introducing legislation will depend on the outcome of this examination.  For the purposes of the examination, the corporation are arranging consultations with CIE.</P>
      <P>As regards consultations with other organisations, I would emphasise that agreement to the temporary closure is in principle only, and is subject to confirmation at a later stage if it is established that a scheme on the lines envisaged is feasible.  All aspects of the problems involved in the scheme are being fully considered, and it is not proposed to hold a public inquiry into the proposed temporary closure.</P>
      <P>I understand that the City Manager has indicated that the recommendation by Professor Schaecterle that a road should be constructed along the line of the canel as part of the urban road network is being studied in association with other recommendations relating to this network.  No proposal for such a road has been submitted to me nor am I aware that any such proposal has been submitted to the City Council.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the date on which he decided that the holding of driving tests for applicants for class E driving licences at Dungarvan, County Waterford test centre should be discontinued; what were the considerations that influenced him to take such decision; and why the fact that this decision has been taken is not shown in booklet D.10, <i>The Learner Driver</i>, issued by his Department to applicants for Class E licences who are ordinarily resident in this area of County Waterford and who could be considered likely to opt for the centre which is shown as being available for the carrying out of these tests at (7), <Col N="1826" /> Appendix II, page 18 of this official publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The holding of class E driving tests in Dungarvan was discontinued early in 1965 during the first year of operation of the driving test scheme.  Experience had shown that the conduct of such tests should be confined to the centres of highest population where a reasonable road network exists and where varied traffic conditions are experienced.  The majority of test centres, therefore, are not used for class E tests.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the informative leaflet, D.10, is to convey advice to persons taking up driving for the first time and in an endeavour to keep the leaflet within reasonable limits, information which does not affect the vast majority of applicants is kept to a minimum.  Applicants for class E tests, who are a small fraction of the total number taking tests and few of whom are taking up driving for the first time, are advised, immediately on receipt of the application, of the position and informed of the class E centres nearest to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the Deputy, the endeavour was to keep the leaflet within reasonable limits.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The informative leaflet D.10 and the appointment cards which were issued to the persons concerned make it clear that the vehicle to be provided at tests must be representative of the class of test involved.  The vehicle provided for the tests referred to in the question did not comply with this requirement since it was fitted with a pre-selector gear box.  The description in the leaflet of the types of vehicle which are accepted as representative is intended primarily for the guidance of persons taking up driving for the first time and is not intended to be complete and exhaustive.  However, in order to obviate possibility of doubt in the future, steps will be taken to advise applicants for class E tests of the position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1828" /> This leaflet was designed for the guidance of the vast majority of applicants and could not, without becoming unwieldy and complicated, cover all cases arising or likely to arise in changing circumstances.  Individual cases involving exceptional circumstances which occur from time to time are dealt with as they occur.  Where such cases become sufficiently numerous or where the statutory regulations are amended, an appropriate addition to the leaflet is made.</P>

The Planning Authority said that &ldquo;the structure would be liable to cause traffic hazard due to difficult road layout&rdquo; but did not indicate how such hazard might arise.  The area is one of mixed development, not unsuited to the display of a limited amount of advertising, and I did not consider that the grounds stated by the planning authority justified rejecting the appeal altogether.  There was no question of sight-lines at the corner being obstructed. Accordingly, I decided to grant permission subject to a condition regulating the number, size and height of the panels.</P>

As of now the main relevant figures at my disposal for County Galway, in respect of the two-year period ended 31st March last, are that a total of some 11,600 acres was distributed amongst 862 allottees, including 4,400 acres by way of enlargements to 450 smallholders and 5,250 acres by way of migration and rearrangement to 240 tenants who surrendered lands in exchange.</P>

Quantification is, of course, essential if national targets are to be established and progress in subsequent years measured against expectations.  This purpose can be achieved by limiting the published quantifications to the main economic variables; as a minimum these must include, on the one hand, gross national product and its main constituents such as industry, agriculture and services, and, on the other, gross national expenditure and its main constituents such as private and public consumption and investment. <Col N="1836" /> Preoccupation with figures, however, must not be allowed to divert attention from the main task of policy formulation and implementation. </P>

      <P>Regulations under section 7 (i) of the School Attendance Act, 1926, were not made because it was felt, subsequent to the passing of <Col N="1844" /> the Act, that the requirement that all children under 14 years of age must attend school regularly was adequately covered under its other provisions.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the employment of juveniles is dealt with in the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, and the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Acts, 1936 and 1942.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Coal importers gave me advance notice of price increases due to devaluation and, on the basis that they were not increasing their marging of profit, I raised no objection. I am concerned to ensure that the price the merchants charge for coal is related to the price they pay for it and that their margin of profit is not excessive. It would not be practicable for me <Col N="1846" /> to exercise control over the quality of the coal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves the Summer Time Order, 1967, made by the Minister for Justice under the Summer Time Act, 1925 (No. 8 of 1925). </P>
      <P>This Order fixes the period of Summer Time for the year 1968.  The period of Summer Time will extend from 18th February to 27th October.</P>
      <P>The House is, no doubt, aware of the background to the making of this Order.  The position is that the British Government announced earlier this year that legislation would be introduced to provide for a new Standard Time in Britain (and Northern Ireland).  They have made an Order fixing Summer Time for 1968 from 18th February to 27th October and they have circulated a Bill for a new British Standard Time effective from the 27th October 1968.  The proposal in the Bill is that Britain will have a new Standard Time all the year round, which will be one hour in advance of Greenwich Mean Time and will be the same as that for Western European countries generally, that is the equivalent of the traditional Summer Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Standard Time in this country has been the same as that in Britain since 1916, that is Greenwich Mean Time. The Summer Time Act, 1925, provides <Col N="1851" /> that during the period of Summer Time the time is to be one hour in advance of Greenwich Mean Time. The period of Summer Time is prescribed in the Act but the Act empowers the Minister for Justice to vary the period either generally or in respect of any particular year or years. An Order was made in 1926 extending the period in the Act slightly to accord with a change that had been made in Britain.  The period fixed by the 1926 Order is the normal Summer Time and it would apply in any year since if the Minister for Justice did not make a specific Order varying it. Many such orders have been made.  If no Order had been made for 1968 the period of Summer Time in that year would be from 21st April to 6th October.</P>
    <P>In the light of the British decision to adopt a new Standard Time the Government decided that the period of Summer Time for 1968 should be fixed by Order to commence on 18th February, which coincided with the date in Britain, and to end on 27th October.  This will allow time to have a full examination made of the whole question and, if in the light of that examination, it seems right to do what the British are doing, it will be possible to have the new Standard Time in operation by 27th October, 1968.</P>
    <P>There will, in any case, be ample opportunity on a future occasion for a debate on the whole subject of the desirability or otherwise of extending Summer Time.  As Deputies are no doubt aware, I have invited the public to make known their views on the subject. Copies of a note on Standard Time and Summer Time are available on request from my Department and copies are also in the Library.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I ask the House to approve this Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £30,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1968, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Labour, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Grants-in-Aid. </P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of the purpose of this Supplementary Estimate and the circumstances which have made it necessary.</P>
      <P>The factory of John Rawson &amp; Son (Ireland) Ltd., Dundalk, was destroyed by fire on 13th August last and this, unfortunately, led to the closure of the undertaking and the dismissal of some 500 workers.  The disaster aroused widespread public sympathy for the workers because of the unforeseen circumstances in which they lost their employment at very short notice.  The Government was, of course, very greatly concerned at the hardship for the workers and their families and it was clear that there was considerable support both in Dáil Éireann and among the public generally for the idea that special measures should be taken to relieve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will remember that at the Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders at which it was decided to put the Rawson Company into voluntary liquidation a resolution was also passed which recommended all shareholders to contribute 5 per cent of their shares of the assets to compensate the workers who had been disemployed. It was estimated then that, if all shareholders accepted this recommendation, the amount of compensation which would become available <Col N="1854" /> from the assets would be in the region of £20,000.  The Government considered that, even if the full amount of £20,000 could be provided and paid out quickly, it would not be sufficient to make a real impact on the unfortunate plight of the Rawson workers. The fact is, of course, that a sizeable portion of the compensation which would be provided in this way would probably not be available for a considerable time ahead, when the affairs of the company were finally would up.  In these circumstances, it decided that special State assistance should be given to the workers as an exceptional measure.</P>
    <P>A suggestion which was very widely made was that the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Bill then before the Dáil should be applied retrospectively to the Rawson case.  The House is aware for the reasons which I explained at length of the various stages of the passage of the legislation both here and in the Seanad, that the Government could not accept the principle of retrospection in relation to the Bill and there would, of course, have been additional objections to making the provisions retrospective to cover a single particular case.  Other possible methods by which special compensation might be provided by the State were, therefore, considered.  One such possibility was that the provisions of the redundancy scheme operated by a number of firms in the footwear industry might be applied to the Rawson workers, but this was not regarded as suitable by the Government, principally because the scheme does not extend to female workers.</P>
    <P>Having examined the various possibilities, the Government felt that the most equitable basis on which compensation should be paid was by way of a scheme for lump sum related generally to the terms of the Redundancy Payments Bill.  It decided therefore, to make lump-sum payments to the former Rawson workers at the rate of a half-week's pay for each year of service to every worker with a minimum of four years service over the age of 16 years, subject to a maximum lump-sum equivalent to 20 weeks pay in any particular case.  The total cost of these <Col N="1855" /> payments will be in the region of £75,000, although the exact amount cannot be stated with certainty pending inquiries which are still proceeding about a small number of individual cases.</P>
    <P>To illustrate what this will mean for the workers, I might mention that over 80 per cent of them will receive payments. Of these about 8 per cent will get sums of over £300, 32 per cent will receive between £200 and £300, 29 per cent £100 to £200 and the balance will receive payments of less than £100.  I am sure that Deputies will agree that these payments are very generous and should do a great deal towards alleviating the hardship for the workers and their families.</P>
    <P>A question that may be asked is why the terms of the compensation to be provided by the State do not differentiate on the basis of ages of the workers.  I can assure the House that the Government are in complete sympathy with the idea that the older, long-service workers should, in cases of redundancy, be given more favourable treatment, as evidenced by the more generous provisions for such workers in the Redundancy Payments legislation. The feasibility of exercising similar preference on age grounds in allocating the State payments for the Rawson workers was fully considered, but the Government decided that they would not be justified in asking the general taxpayer to contribute more than the very substantial amount of £75,000 asked for in this Supplementary Estimate. A substantial additional sum would be necessary in order to enable more favourable treatment to be given to older workers.  The only alternative would have been to reduce the amount of payments to workers in the younger age-group but this course also would be open to objections.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that a good solution to this question would be if the compensation which is expected to be made available by the Rawson shareholders were devoted to the older long-service workers.  I have conveyed the views of the Government in this regard to the liquidator of the company, <Col N="1856" /> who will have the responsibility for allocating these funds, and I hope he will find it possible to adopt this course.</P>
    <P>One point that will, naturally, be of interest to the workers concerned is when the payments are likely to be made.  I indicated recently in reply to a Dáil Question that I hoped to be able to make payments before Christmas and this is still my intention.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, from the sentiments which have been expressed since the disaster at Rawsons took place and from the various representations which I have received about the matter, that there will be general agreement in the House that the case is an exceptional one which merits exceptional treatment.  I am sure, therefore, that all Deputies will welcome the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate, which I now recommend for the approval of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>They will get only portion of the benefits they would get under the Redundancy Payments Act. First of all, I should like to bring the workers in this case within the ambit of the redundancy payments scheme. It is something which everybody in the House would support.  I am afraid this is only a half measure.  These workers in Dundalk have been abused.  If we are bringing them into the redundancy scheme, we should bring them into it totally and not in this halfhearted way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> on 17th October last reported a meeting of the shareholders.  According to the report, <Col N="1857" /> about 30 of the 1,200 shareholders were there and on a show of hands, there was a vote of 17 to seven in favour of the liquidation resolution.  As this did not give the required three-quarters majority, there was a vote, and 349,203, representing 87,300 units, voted for as against 9,012, representing 522 units.</P>
    <P>Of 1,200 shareholders, only 30 turned up and in the poll eventually, it was the large shareholders who voted for liquidation.  A certain group there have been making money out of the firm and they are catching the small shareholders.  The small shareholders invested their money at a high premium and were led astray by the original founders of the company who started business under protection. Eventually, it was the man in the job who invested £100 or £200 who was caught.  It was not the small shareholders who were in favour of this voluntary liquidation.</P>
    <P>The report I have quoted went on to say that Mr. William Cunningham, Chartered Accountant, Dame Street, Dublin, in a statement asked the liquidator to make a contribution to alleviate the hardship of the workers. In the breakup of the firm, the liquidator expected the figure to be £344,947 net.  That would be a conservative figure because he could not have valued the factory, the machinery and other things.  The Minister's figure provides for only half a week's pay for every year worked instead of a week's pay for every year between the ages of 41 and 65.  I now ask the Minister is this £75,000 a grant or is it recoverable from the employees and from employers in the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This firm with the money they made over the years should be asked to pay&mdash;whether they do or not is another matter&mdash;more than 5 per cent.  I would say 10 per cent or 15 per cent, particularly if the amount of money they realise is greater than that which the liquidator forecasts.  He forecasts £345,000 in round figures and they are willing to pay 5 per cent.  If they got £450,000 surely the Minister should ask them to pay 5 per cent or 10 per cent more.  The shareholders, in other words, would have a greater net figure than forecast.</P>
      <P>The latter history of this company is very bad.  It was formed into a public company and the five shilling shares were sold for ten shillings which meant that the original private company if they sold all their shares would make £300,000 and if they retained 50 per cent they would make £150,000.  This £150,000, approximately, was made up of £100,000 cumulative preference shares at £1 each and 600,000 ordinary shares at 5/- each which made up the £250,000.  In 1958 there were £60,075 undistributed profits and this increased their capital by £50,000.  In other words the shareholders at that time got a bonus share for every three shares they held, that is, the 600,000 shares are now 800,000 shares.</P>
      <P>The original owners, the Rawson family, had at this stage 230,000 shares out of these 800,000 shares.  I am speaking of the ordinary shares.  This is 29 per cent of the ordinary shares which in a public company in practice usually means a controlling interest.  They reckon that 25 per cent is a controlling interest here.  In England or in a bigger company it is lower.  This share capital in 1963 was reduced by its original holders to 60,000 shares.  In 1966 those shares dropped to 16,000 shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1963 the profits made by this company were £99,303 before tax and £52,023 net after tax.  This on the investment is 33 per cent return on the money invested, which is no mean return. In other words, the company in three years got their money back pre tax.  In this case they made 33 per cent before tax.  In 1963 the holding of the original owners of this factory dropped from 230,000 shares to 60,000 shares, <Col N="1859" /> which means that they sold when the market was away up at its peak and they made a very good return and good profits.  In 1964 they made £105,443 profit before tax.  I think the only thing which might have been taken off was the directors' fees of approximately £1,600 to £2,000.  The net profit was £56,205, 35 per cent return on capital.  I am reckoning the capital at £300,000, although the original capital was £250,000 but there would have been a certain amount of inflation during this period.</P>
    <P>In 1955, they made £51,000 before tax and £39,726 after tax, which is 17 per cent of turnover.  That is not too bad.  They would probably have made more but in most manufacturing industries there is a certain amount of risk capital.  That was their first bad year.  The particulars for 1967 will not be out until this months as their year ends in September.  The figures for 1966 show that their gross profit was approximately £20,000 and their net profit £13,219, that is 6? per cent.</P>
    <P>The capital in 1963 and 1964 was outrageous, particularly when you consider that there are people in business in this country who are now under price control.  Although workers cannot get an increase in wages, this firm could get 35 per cent and 33 per cent profit in two years.  The second thing this firm did, which I thought was one of the worst things any firm could do, was to put out of the national pension scheme for boot and shoe operatives &mdash;the only firm in that industry in Ireland to put out of this scheme.</P>
    <P>This firm went into liquidation before the Redundancy Bill became law.  Their staff were let go without any concern.  Many of them had 25 to 35 years service.  There is absolutely no doubt that this firm tried to avoid this Redundancy Bill.  I want again to quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 17th October, 1967, which stated:</P>
    <P>At the shareholders' meeting it was stated that if the resolution to liquidate were deferred until the Redundancy Bill came in it would mean they would have to pay about <Col N="1860" /> £30,000 more than the five per cent mentioned in the resolution as compensation.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no doubt that this firm were trying to avoid the Redundancy Bill.  The Minister is giving a grant of only £75,000.  The grant should be greater.  It should be equivalent to the redundancy payments.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that the fire on August 13th closed the women's shoe section.  He did not say that section but it was in that section that the fire occurred but the fire was not the reason for closing.  There is no doubt about this.  It is completely incorrect to state that the fire was the cause of the closure.  The children's shoe and sandal department was closed long before this.  The fire closed down the whole factory.  There were three or four sections still free to work.</P>
    <P>During the week starting August 24th and finishing September 1st 5,000 pairs of men's shoes were made in this factory.  Therefore, they started closing the factory long before the fire occurred because they could not sell their shoes. After the fire two-thirds of the factory was put into production and in one week they produced 5,000 pairs of shoes.</P>
    <P>The workers in that factory would be completely destitute if it were left to Rawsons to help them out.  I am afraid if the Government do not give them something, although they are not directly responsible for this, those workers, who have been working for 30 to 35 years in that factory, will not get one penny.  This firm right down the line have been trying to get out of giving their workers anything.  The workers have now ended up with no pension and no rights.  They only get a lump sum after 30 to 35 years.  They have tried to get jobs in Dundalk but the manufacturers in the boot and shoe industry are at the moment fully staffed and even if those workers moved down to Cork or Limerick there is very little chance of their gettings jobs again.</P>
    <P>The main sufferers in this matter are the workers and the new shareholders. The old shareholders did well.  They <Col N="1861" /> made a fortune out of this business and they have succeeded in doing it with Government protection.  I am not saying the Government knew they were doing it but with Government protection they were doing it.  I wonder would the Minister tell us the amount of money given in grants to this company when it was a public company and when it was a private company.  This company arrived here in 1932 when their factory at Leicester was doing badly and my information is that they were not pro any Irish worker having a share in this factory.  They moved in here under protection and formed a company and they made a killing of at least £150,000 when they formed the public company.  They moved on and sold their shares in 1963 and 1964 when their profits were at their highest, selling to small Irish investors.  Small Irish investors and small Irish wage-earners got caught up in these things. Since they came in here their employer/employee relationship has been diabolical to say the least of it and they have shown by their attitude at the liquidation meeting and also through the way money was made and the firm was used to make money for people, to make capital profit and get out, that they had no normal interest in the workers whatsoever.  Not one of them cared&mdash;I am speaking now of the original directors because the newer directors bought on the market to get an income out of it, I presume.</P>
    <P>Where a town like Dundalk or even smaller towns have a big industry such as this and a crash comes and there is complete unemployment there is no alternative factory to take the workers as there would be in Dublin, Cork or any of the main cities.  I feel, that being the case, that the unions themselves should have bought a number of shares in this company.  They would then have had a knowledge of what was happening and would be pre-warned of the various things that were happening the company and would be getting information quickly and not getting it a year later.  The funds at the disposal of the trade unions should be invested in companies of this type particularly if it is a big business in a small town.  In this way they would know both sides <Col N="1862" /> of the business and regulate their members to suit both the industry and the area.  In a town of this size you have workers there and the unions get more members to join expecting this factory to continue for ever, whereas if they had a small interest in management or a small shareholding they would know the limitations of the factory.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister was there much money given in grants to this factory over the years because if there was a large amount given I feel he should have some control over the money, and if it was given for machinery what chance has he of recovering this machinery or its saleable value? I would also like to know how far the Minister has gone to start a new industry here or for part of the factory to be taken over by some firm.  There are rumours going around which I am sure the workers have heard that there is a certain firm in that part of the country taking over a section of it.  Has the Minister any idea of this or will he give the travelling allowance under the redundancy legislation to workers who may want to travel to Monaghan, Cork or Limerick to get similar work? Are they entitled to that?  Are they entitled to resettlement?  I would like the Minister to point out if money was given by the Government, the amount of it, and can be recover any of the money that has been given grantwise if this company goes into voluntary liquidation and does not fulfil its obligations but gets out just to meet the Bill as has been pointed out even at the firm's meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The passage of this Supplementary Estimate through the House reflects, in our opinion, credit on neither the Minister for Labour nor Rawsons of Dundalk&mdash;on Rawsons of Dundalk because we see no reason why they should have closed this factory; on the Minister because this legislation should have been brought in many years ago.  We have called for its early introduction and the necessity now for passing a Supplementary Estimate in the case of these workers arises because the Minister for Labour did not bring that Bill before the House.  Admittedly, there <Col N="1863" /> were very important political Party tactic in-fighting matters to be brought before the House like the infamous Marts Bill which were of more importance than some of the human problems raised on redundancy.</P>
      <P>The whole thing gives us in a sort of small fashion a crazy example of the kind of situation that continues in this country and that most Deputies in this House subscribe to the continuance of &mdash;a crazy system where you have a company situated in Dundalk which came in here in the easy years for industrialists under protection, they make quite a large profit over those easy years in a market guaranteed by tarriffs put up by the community and when the going gets tough they pull out.  Nobody believes that the fire which occurred some months ago is sufficient reason for this firm to pack up their tents and go back to Britain.  Nobody believes this sufficient reason for them to depart but the whole occurrence should at least, even if we do not subscribe, as people in my Party do, to a fundamental change in this whole private enterprise system and meaningful participation by the State in their boards of management, at least this should give Deputies of this House plenty of material to question some of the things that they appear to have accepted up to the present.</P>
      <P>There is now a situation where Rawsons, who received quite an amount of State aid over the years, quite apart from receiving the tariff protection, now decide that it is in the interests of the profits, mark you, of their own majority shareholders to pack up this business.  They do not worry about nor consider the fate of the 500 unfortunate human beings in Dundalk who have established families and bought homes on the basis of their jobs in this firm.  They are not worried about their future.  In fact, we have reached a situation now in which Rawsons directors give their workers, some of whom had service of over 35 years with the firm, a Christmas present of a bye-bye with damn-all else coming with it.</P>
      <P>What do Rawsons directors do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1864" /> The eternal milch cow, the State, once more carries out the obligations of Rawsons directors to Rawsons workers and these directors, these cannibals&mdash;because that is all you can call those human cannibals&mdash;who in any other normal community would be put before a trial of people and condemned for this extremely bad anti-social behaviour on their part, leave the shores of this country without a condemnation other than the things some of us here may say.  Their relationship with the State throughout has been grants to their firm, tariffs to their firm and when they were going, the State took over and in a meagre way met their obligations to their workers.  This is an extraordinary situation.  If anybody should pretend to consider that that system is the one most realistically designed to bring this country into any free trade of the future, he has not examined the facts.</P>
    <P>If anybody understands in a small way the amount of suspicion or alienation that workers experience in their jobs, he must know that they are merely tools to be kicked about, and discarded when the opportune moment comes.  If anybody wishes to understand the origin of this, let him look at Rawsons of Dundalk.  There are other cases also.  There are many firms in Dublin switching from the technical names of their companies to different names to avoid the small obligation they may have under the Redundancy Bill which will come into operation in January.  This is happening throughout the country.  We advised the Minister that there should be a registration clause.  There have been cases of firms over the past year who have let their workers go.  We are suspicious, because we only have cases where workers were let go during this year so that firms will avoid their obligation in January to pay these workers under the Redundancy Bill.  One notable case comes to mind, that of Galway Textiles. The workers were let go and one wonders why they could not be covered under the Redundancy Payments Bill.</P>
    <P>The workers in Rawsons may be covered under this Bill to some extent but they will not get the same treatment <Col N="1865" /> as workers will get next year. They will not get the resettlement allowance and they will not get the repayments.  A figure of over £300 is described as the maximum figure to be paid to workers under this Bill. This is a figure to be given to workers with over 35 years service, by way of a Christmas present, with no possibility of an alternative job.  We begin to see in its true dimension the unfortunate situation of these working people in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>The Minister has to some degree responded in this case and has brought in this Estimate to cover these people but the terms they will get will not be as good as those next year under the main Bill.  There has been pressure to bring forward this legislation for some years from the Labour movement, not from the so-called Labour Party opposite.  If in the course of the 18th Dáil, we have repeatedly called on the Minister to bring in this Bill, I do not think we can make any move of self-congratulation and say what decent people we are by sharing out £75,000 to Rawsons in Dundalk.  If we had been serious in the matter, this Bill would have been operative beforehand and we would not be asking why people cannot be included under this redundancy scheme.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem facing these people is that there does not seem to be any likelihood of any alternative work in the town of Dundalk, which is suffering from unemployment.  Let us understand that provisions under any redundancy legislation, however generous, are no substitute for a job. The provision in January next will in no way equal that available to our fellows under a Tory Government in Northern Ireland; it is a poor relation of the Bill that will be operating in the Six County area.  Let that be understood in the country.  We have repeated throughout and what we want understood is that redundancy provisions, however generous, are no substitute for a job.  It is jobs, a right to earn their living, the people of Dundalk want.  Redundancy legislation, however generous, can only be taken in conjunction with provision of <Col N="1866" /> an alternative job and there is no such provision in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>Again, I say it is a remarkable thing that a board of directors can get away with the behaviour that Rawsons got away with without being brought before a court, without receiving a severe sentence, from our community. It puts the law in the position that it does not apply in such cases.  A man who has not his bicycle lamp lighting at night is brought before the court, but in a case like this, where men are deprived of their work, nothing can be done about it.  It is a really good example of the kind of thing we have been hitting at.  How can this country face competition in any free trade area when we are depending on units of management like Rawsons of Dundalk?</P>
    <P>The attitude of mind of Rawsons is not by any means untypical of many Irish managements.  I ask those people is there no way to change the present system for people working in private enterprise.  If private enterprise gets grants and carries out its obligations to workers that is the kind of enterprise we believe should not be changed; but Rawsons have been acting in the extreme as selfish animals.</P>
    <P>In the Shelbourne Hotel, the shareholders decided to consider only their own financial interests, to ignore the possibilities of the predicament of the 2,500 employees of Dundalk, and decided to lock up shop.  There was not sufficient reason given why they should have done so.  The firm should have continued and we believe that the State, if it grants money, should be a particular participant before any firm can decide to close shop and depart from the country.  If the State gives help to any firm, it should to some extent call the tune.</P>
    <P>It is doubtful whether the Minister for Labour is in fact interested in his own job.  He has lately departed from what we consider his real responsibilities and has become precisely a political crier.  We saw in the past few weeks part of the campaign he is mounting.  Is he aware of the immense damage he is doing to the particular <Col N="1867" /> job he holds and has he any real interest in carrying out his job?  It is extraordinary the way the Minister for Labour has attacked one of the largest employee organisations in the country. If he thinks that bringing politics into his job will help industrial relations in the year ahead, which is promising to be a tough one, he is mistaken.  When the Ministry was being set up we pleaded that there should be a neutral man in charge to deal with any delicate situation.  In the past few weeks, the Minister has deluded us and has attacked individuals in the employment movement here.  There are other individuals in the Government equipped to carry out this job.  The role of the Minister is on a higher level than the level to which it was brought down, as I saw, in the past few weeks.  There are many Ministers who are better equipped for the position but the Minister for Labour has seen fit to participate in this behaviour in the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate reflects no credit on him.  The full provision should have been before this House long before now.  It certainly reflects no credit whatever on the directors of Rawsons of Dundalk.  The question is: Can we afford a continuance of a situation where shareholders' management can do this in our country with impunity?</P>

      <P>If there is one thing clear to me from the cheap and caustic remarks made here today by Deputy O'Leary about the Redundancy Payments Bill and the Minister for Labour, it is that Deputy O'Leary would very much prefer if this Supplementary Estimate had not been brought before this House at all.

      <P>We, who are very close to this problem in Dundalk, are very perturbed about the manner in which this factory was closed.  We have explored every avenue to see what we could do in relation to this firm.  If there was anything the Government could do, it would have been done.  The fact is that the Minister is now introducing a Supplementary Estimate for £75,000 to help the workers of Rawsons factory.  On behalf of the workers and on my own behalf, I want to thank the Minister for doing so and particularly for accepting that this was an exceptional case.  I have been dealing with the Minister about this matter for some considerable time now.  I fully appreciate and the workers in Dundalk fully appreciate the difficulties he faced in having to introduce this Supplementary Estimate as an exceptional measure, particularly when he did not find it possible to make the provision of the Redundancy Payments Bill retrospective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody can reasonably quibble with the fact that this is an exceptional case.  Rawsons was a big industry.  It employed a very conabl <Col N="1869" /> siderable number of workers.  It was established more than 30 years ago. Many of the workers started working with this firm at the very beginning and spent their whole working life there.  Suddenly, without any warning, because of a fire, this factory was closed down.  One can imagine the consternation of the workers who had every reason to believe they were secure in their employment, on finding themselves suddenly unemployed.</P>
    <P>The case was further complicated by the fact that, for a number of reasons, their unemployment benefit did not last very long.  I trust that the shareholders of Rawsons will make good their word and make available as quickly as possible the money they have promised to give to the Dundalk workers.  The Minister mentioned that he is doing his utmost to have the money now being voted paid before Christmas.  I am particularly anxious that that should be done.  It should be clear to everybody that the workers are in difficult circumstances and that the quicker this money is paid the better.</P>
    <P>With regard to future employment in Dundalk, as everybody is already aware, the Undeveloped Areas Act applies to Dundalk.  Already its effects are to be seen in relation to one industry. Rawsons factory was taken over by another boot and shoe company.  It is hoped that this will help the unemployed workers of Rawsons.  At the moment we are trying to interest an American firm of boot and shoe manufacturers in Dundalk: I trust we shall be successful in this venture.  If we are, it can have a very beneficial effect so far as the unemployed Rawsons workers are concerned.  The only type of industry that would be of real value at the moment, particularly in relation to these workers, is a boot and shoe industry.  Many of them are now in middle age and it would be difficult for them to retrain for other employment.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the Irish Shoe and Leather Workers Union for their Trojan efforts on behalf of the workers.  It was a pleasure for me to co-operate with them.

In my view, those who represent the workers in Dundalk should be ashamed to see this happening around them and do nothing about it.  It was not only the fire that was bad in Rawsons.  It was the behaviour of the people who controlled it.  Undoubtedly Deputy Faulkner and Deputy Aiken must have been aware of this.  What did they do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner and Deputy Aiken are answerable to the people in Dundalk who, I am satisfied, will give them their answer at the first available opportunity.  Certainly, they will not get away with this kind of thing.  Perturbation is expressed by Deputy Faulkner.  Why did these people march from Dundalk to Dublin?  Why did they find it necessary to demonstrate? Why did they time their march to the <Col N="1871" /> shareholders' meeting?  Was it not all because of the known behaviour of these same shareholders?  I have not seen any evidence that Deputy Faulkner or Deputy Aiken made representations to these people.</P>

      <P>Reference was made by Deputy Faulkner to questions Deputy O'Leary put down and at the end of his speech Deputy Faulkner complimented the union concerned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it.  For example, I can say that I was asked by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to put down a question in connection with this matter.  I did so and I offer no apology to Deputy Faulkner for doing so. Naturally, the union concerned was in touch with the body to which it is attached in regard to the way these people were treated and the way Rawsons were allowed to go on down through the years.  Naturally, they tried to get Deputy Faulkner to get assistance if they could not get Deputy Aiken because he was away in New York.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the decision made at the shareholders' meeting that five per cent of the shares should be put aside and distributed among the workers.  The Minister indicated that he has got in touch with the liquidator in regard to this matter with a view to having the liquidator arrange for the people with long service to get this money.  I do not know if that is correct. Is it legal to do this?  The decision at the shareholders' meeting was that the money would be distributed but it was not stipulated that it should go to all the old hands.  I certainly agree with that idea but I am concerned about its practicability.  I also want to ascertain if it is the Minister's intention to pursue this point and are we to understand that when it comes to the time for dispensing this money the Minister will have, or endeavour to have, a say in the fulfilment of what he wants to bring about?</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind that the unfortunate disaster of the fire brought all this about and also knowing that this Bill provides for the payment of £75,000 I think it is pertinent to ask the Minister if he made any representations to the directors of this company since the fire, or immediately after it, to ascertain from them, having regard to the &ldquo;kill&rdquo; they made down through the years, if they were disposed to giving any money.  As regards the decision taken at the shareholders' meeting I should like to know if it was put up to those people that they should do the right thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that is certainly highlighted <Col N="1873" /> in this whole matter is the necessity for the Minister to amend the Redundancy Payments Bill as soon as possible for the purpose of ensuring that there will be no repetition of this happening and that in a case of this kind in future the workers concerned will not be left to the whim of the board of directors or to an after-thought on the part of a Minister at the instigation of a group of people who got around the Minister to try to claim political kudos for bringing about the right thing.  Obviously the Minister should amend the Bill to ensure that people who make such a &ldquo;kill&rdquo; as Rawsons did will be required to make substantial payments to employees when they fold up in circumstances such as Rawsons did and that such payment will be independent of the benefits workers would be entitled to under the Redundancy Bill.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the point the Minister has made about the retrospective aspect of the matter.  On these benches we know that we urged the Minister when he was putting the Redundancy Bill through this House that he should begin at some date earlier than 1st January because we were conscious that there had been a number of cases where workers had been declared redundant and because of the date being in the future, they would not be included. We were also aware that in a number of cases the employers knowing that the Redundancy Bill was on the stocks sheltered behind it and used it as an excuse to avoid payment.  We recently had a case of this kind in the city, not far away from this building, and we had the employer concerned blandly telling those union representatives: &ldquo;We will not close until next January and because of that the workers will get redundancy payments.&rdquo; This indicates that a number of people had that idea fixed in their minds, that that is all they should give.  In other words, the minimum benefits in the Bill are becoming the maximum in the employers' minds.</P>
    <P>Is it too late to ask the Minister, bearing in mind the disaster of the fire at Rawsons, as he described it &mdash; and which it was in many ways &mdash; and <Col N="1874" /> bearing in mind that it occurred in August, to do something for people, whether in large or small numbers, who were declared redundant since August of this year and for whom nothing was done, people who have not got a Tánaiste in their area who required that sort of face-saving?</P>
    <P>I know of a case where we had a former Taoiseach in the area.  I am referring to the Wicklow Hotel which closed down only this month and the workers concerned got no redundancy payments.  The union concerned is chasing the former owner and trying to get him to make some contribution to people with 30, 40, or 50 years service.  But there is nothing doing so far.  The latest explanation we got for his inability to meet the union was that he was held up in England owing to foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>Here we have a group of workers, approximately 70, who did not get a penny piece after giving all their time in the Wicklow Hotel.  The hotel just beat the Redundancy Bill.  Surely that is a disaster.  One wonders that a match was not put to the place.  If that had happened it would have been called a disaster, redundancy brought about by fire.  Happening the other way, it does not seem to pay out.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I suppose that the Minister will say that he cannot make any more exceptions but it is hard to explain that to people who find themselves caught up in this bad treatment Bill, that is, putting people off hoping and getting nothing.  We cannot easily explain to people who have been laid off in June or May or at the beginning of the year why the Rawson people are being paid when they were laid off in August.  I do not want anyone to misunderstand my attitude towards this Estimate.  I am glad somebody has found it possible to arrange to give money to these people before Christmas. However, I deplore that it had to be done this way.  We should take a lesson from this and take steps to ensure that there is no repetition of this by providing a penalty in the redundancy payments legislation to catch every one of those who are setting out to do the wrong thing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1875" /> I should like the Minister to take the opportunity when he is replying to indicate what are the prospects of getting employment for those 500 people in Rawsons.  He does not say anything about it in his Bill, and Deputy Faulkner referred to the problem only in a brief way.  I do not expect him to go into any detail, but we have heard the rumours and speculation that are in circulation; numerous people have said that these Americans are just around the corner, that they are looking at the place and so on.  Can the Minister give this House an indication as to what progress, if any, his Department have made in this matter?  Have they made any serious or fruitful efforts to provide employment for any of the 500 people concerned?  Apart from giving them this dole for Christmas, which I am satisfied will be most welcome to them, can the Minister say whether any number of them will be employed early in the New Year?  Can he colour the story a little better by indicating that some of them have already been employed?  I presume I am correct in saying that having obtained this employment they will not be debarred from this compensation, and that they do not have to remain redundant to get the benefit of this compensation.</P>

      <P>I have very little to say on this Bill, but despite the carping criticism of Deputy O'Leary, I think the Minister deserves credit for having introduced this Estimate which will be a help to the Dundalk workers who lost their jobs.  Having said that, I should like to ask some questions about this firm.  I am not very well briefed on the background to it, but there are certain questions which come to the mind of even the least instructed Deputy.  First of all, was the fire thoroughly investigated? It seems very strange that a firm should fold up shortly after a fire. I am quite sure they got a hefty sum <Col N="1876" /> of insurance as a result of this occurrence, and I should like to know what has happened to it.  I should like to see this money being utilised to start a new industry or the continuation of a viable footwear industry in the factory. I do not deplore the fact that these people got grants over the years.  I imagine the money helped to keep the workers in employment in this firm.</P>

      <P>The point is that their action in clearing out when they did must stand condemned by everybody. The Minister has taken whatever steps he could in order to help the workers in Dundalk who are so badly affected, and I am sure these workers do appreciate the Minister's concern for their future and for their present circumstances. I wonder have any steps been taken by the employment exchange to try to place workers in comparable employment in other centres and have inducements been offered to any of them to leave Dundalk if they so wish. No matter what payment is made by way of redundancy, a man wants to work.</P>
      <P>This Estimate raises many matters, because in this city we have some motor trade workers who are badly affected not by a firm closing down but by the fact that a firm extended so much that it absorbed a second firm, and the workers in the second firm have become redundant.  Is there any way of giving these men something for Christmas?  The Dundalk man will have a happier Christmas thanks to the foresight of the Minister for Labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very human problem and it has been dealt with in a very human way by the Minister for Labour.  I can well understand Deputy O'Leary's anxiety on seeing the Supplementary Estimate being introduced to benefit these workers.  Maybe it is not enough but, to my mind, workers can never get enough, and this applies to the unfortunate workers who lost their jobs in this firm.  I should like to know myself and I would ask the question of other Deputies, if, in fact, Rawsons have jumped the gun.  Earlier in the year we said here that if the Minister had concrete evidence that a firm was jumping the gun in relation to redundancy payments, they would be made toe the line.  If Rawsons have done so in this case, their shareholders should be made toe the line and the commitment should be met in full.  I do not know whether this is a fact or not.  Like many others, I am somewhat in the dark in relation to the question of the shareholders and the restarting of the concern after the fire.  A thorough investigation should be made into this.</P>
      <P>Although we have very good employers in this country, we have some unscrupulous employers who will use every loophole to get out of their responsibilities to their workers.  We have been conscious of this problem over the years and many Bills have been introduced here by Ministers of Fianna Fáil Governments to enable us get away from the situation whereby we had sweated labour and other problems. These problems were solved to a large degree.  Now the Minister has indicated that the Conditions of Employment Act is to be examined to see if other improvements can be made so that workers will get that to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate is an expression in <Col N="1879" /> concrete terms of the Government's desire to assist workers who, through unfortunate circumstances, are thrown on the labour market.  It is being done in the only way possible, by a Supplementary Estimate.  The question of whether or not it should have been introduced at an earlier stage is another matter.  It is being done now.  As they have done in the past and as they will do in the future, the Government, recognising the need for action to solve problems concerning the Irish worker, have taken the necessary action.  They have brought about a situation which the bulk of the workers have accepted as a real contribution.  The only Party who have ever brought in any measure to assist the worker have been the Fianna Fáil Party.  On this occasion the Minister has made a genuine effort to ease the situation.  As he said, when you read his speech in relation to redundancy payments, you know his views and the views of the Government on these payments.</P>
    <P>I do not blame Deputy O'Leary for being perturbed about the fact that the workers are receiving payments.  As long as Deputy O'Leary can keep the workers in a state of discontent, his organisation will flourish.  The members of the Labour Party are like political market gardeners who have a cartload of carrots and are dishing them out all over the country.  They have been doing this for years and this year above all other years.  But the workers do not fall for carrots all the time.  They may take them for a time but then they come back to the Party they know, the Party they respect and the Party concerned for their rights. Deputy Belton and Deputy O'Leary spoke about what should be done. What did they do when they were in power?  They did not bring in a Redundancy Payments Bill.  When they deliberately kicked workers out of employment, they did not give them very much redundancy pay and the trade union leaders and the Labour Party backed them up.</P>
    <P>Now something concrete is being done and will be done to meet any situation that deserves consideration by the Fianna Fáil Party.  They will continue <Col N="1880" /> to contribute just as they have in the past when workers were deliberately kicked out of employment by some trade union officials during the period Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in power.  You brought in no legislation when you were in power. Now you are concerned that you cannot keep the workers in a state of discontent.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has dealt with this problem and met the workers.  I do not consider the workers have got all they are entitled to, but that is because of the set-up in Rawsons in relation to jumping the gun, which I hope the Minister will investigate. We got a promise that, if the gun was being jumped by management, a full investigation would take place to ensure the workers got what they were entitled to.  This is a very human problem and it is being tackled in the only way possible.  I hope these people will find new employment in the future.  I am sure that the Government in their endeavour to attract new industry will attract industry to this area in order to ease the position of the workers there. I hope this will be done at an early stage so that there will be no undue suffering by those workers.  I am sure they are well aware that their problems are understood.  I only hope that, if there is a division on this tonight, Deputy O'Leary will vote in favour of the motion necessary to make the money available.  I hope he will not vote against it.</P>

With my colleague, Deputy Moore, I am concerned that the necessary machinery will be put into operation in order to ensure that commitments are fully met, and that the workers will not be left wanting for something to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a risk that the introduction of a Supplementary Estimate for one company would bring down upon our heads all the matters that have been raised.  This was something that might have discouraged me from taking action to help the workers in this particular case, since I could clearly anticipate what would be said and the pressures which would be put upon me on this occasion.  However, I thought it worthwhile to come to the Dáil and allow the discussion which would inevitably take place if, at the end of it, I got from the Dáil £75,000 for the workers in Rawsons.</P>
      <P>The discussion seems to have followed two main lines: one, what should have been, and the other what might have been.  I have to deal with the facts, and the facts of life are that whatever form of social structure, or whatever form of control, could be applied to our industrialisation programme without bringing it to a halt or interfering with employment, does not change the situation which exists in regard to the Rawson organisation. Talking about systems of society will not help the workers in any way.  Since it is left in the hands of the shareholders of the Rawson factory to decide whether to pay this five per cent, I should prefer not to condemn them roundly but to encourage them to pay this money to the workers.  I hope they will not be discouraged by the harshness of some of the remarks made here.  It would be no consolation to the workers if they lost money for the sake of a theoretical change in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other line taken was what might have been if the redundancy scheme <Col N="1884" /> had been brought into operation at an earlier date, or made retrospective.  The delay in preparing the scheme and the legislation &mdash; and there was delay &mdash; was due mainly to the wide degree of consultation, and patient consultation, with the trade unions and the employers' organisations, and to other factors.  This could have been avoided if I had come in here with a Bill and said: &ldquo;This is the way it will be done regardless of anyone.&rdquo;  I took the view that we should consult the trade unions and the employers' organisations.</P>
    <P>I can tell the House, as I said before, that we got very full co-operation, and that a great deal of time and energy was devoted by the representatives of the trade unions and the employers in getting together as near as was possible. We got co-operation on the same lines in the Dáil, and the Bill has now been passed.  I told the House before the Summer recess that if I got general permission then to go ahead with the administrative arrangements necessary in anticipation of the passing of the legislation, I would have a scheme in operation on the 1st January.</P>
    <P>By the device of anticipating the passing of the Bill with the permission of the House we are able to have the scheme on the same date as if the legislation had been taken at the time the Marts Bill was passed.  I explained all this before and I do not think it necessary to explain it again.</P>
    <P>On the question of &ldquo;jumping the gun&rdquo; in relation to the scheme, in the specific case of Rawsons the estimate which I have been able to make &mdash; and I do not say this from the point of view of trying to defend anything in the company's behaviour except in relation to what they would pay &mdash; is that if the scheme were in operation their commitment would be about £30,000. It was recommended to the company's shareholders to pay five per cent and, depending on the value of the assets and so on, I expect the figure to be between £20,000 and £30,000.  I intend to keep in touch with the situation and to help in any way to get a good sum for the workers.</P>
    <P>As regards instances of &ldquo;jumping the gun&rdquo; I should like to have details <Col N="1885" /> of all the cases where this is considered to have taken place.  I have had a few specific complaints because I asked for them and I have had investigations made.  I have not found that the people involved were acting in this irresponsible way.  If widespread &ldquo;jumping of the gun&rdquo; is taking place, this House should legislate to do something about it but I would require to have supporting evidence.</P>
    <P>The £75,000 in this Supplementary Estimate is the taxpayers' money and it is very necessary, therefore, to justify helping one case and not doing the same for all others.  If you give retrospection for one month, what about the people who became redundant two months ago?  Some of the examples given in the House went back to June and others went back to April.  No matter how far back you go there will always be a group of people excluded by the commencement date.  Every bit of social legislation put through this House has had an excluding effect on some people because of the commencement date.  We have to face that.</P>
    <P>The money being provided here is not, of course, the total answer to the shocking catastrophe which visited 500 workers and their families suddenly and unexpectedly by reason of a fire. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has informed An Foras Tionscal that he wished to declare Dundalk an area in respect of which the Board of An Foras Tionscal should for a period of 12 months exercise their powers under section 2 of the Industrial Grants Act, 1963.  In effect, this will mean in the case of a suitable undertaking proposed for establishment in Dundalk that the maximum grant can be two-thirds towards the cost of the factory site, site development, factory buildings, machinery, <i>et cetera.</i> This concession should prove a most useful asset in attracting industry to Dundalk.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have seen recent press announcements that one positive project for the Dundalk area is expected to provide substantial employment and also that a local firm in the shoe manufacturing business has taken over the Rawson premises.  The possibility of introducing a new shoe manufacturing firm is also being actively pursued. <Col N="1886" /> Deputies can rest assured that, whatever the Government can do to bring employment to this area, as to other areas, it will be done.</P>
    <P>I feel I should thank the liquidator of the Rawson company here, not only for his personal interest in getting something done for the workers, but for his willingness in furnishing at very short notice various details which were needed by the officers of my Department, such as the details of employment records required to make the assessment of the compensation payable in individual cases.  I very much appreciate his courtesy and co-operation.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute, as Deputy Faulkner has done, to the manner in which the trade union concerned has pursued its representations on behalf of the Rawson workers.  It presented the workers' case in a very forceful way and yet in a way that permitted the Government to take action, and that is more than I can say about other methods used to influence governments from time to time.</P>
    <P>I hardly need to mention the efforts made by An Tánaiste and Deputy Faulkner.  They have been referred to already by Members of the House.</P>
    <P>The question of the part played by the Employment Service in helping the workers to find new jobs was raised.  I understand from the union concerned that considerable assistance has been given by the Employment Service of the Department of Labour to the workers involved.  Indeed, I have had tribute paid to the staff in Dundalk for the way in which they have tried to help.  They have not any means of creating employment suddenly for people who suddenly come to look for it but they have succeeded in placing some of the workers.  I understand that about 70 workers have been placed in employment.  This, of course, does not take from the entitlement of these workers to payment of a lump sum.</P>
    <P>Much of what Deputy Belton had to say is not for me to comment on.  I should hope that we are not fossilised in our minds about the structure of our society and what we will have to do for it in our time but I have had to <Col N="1887" /> deal with the situation which exists for 500 workers and their families in society as it is today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton did ask about the grants paid to Rawsons.  They were paid an adaptation grant of £3,500.  I do not know if I need to go into the merits or not of giving adaptation grants.  The purpose is to make firms adapt to meet conditions of competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to enable the election of members of the Dublin District Milk Board to be held in 1968 instead of in 1967 as required under existing legislation.  The Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936, provides that an election of members of a milk board must take place every third year.  An election of members of the Dublin Board is due this year but in view of the situation arising from the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Britain it is most desirable that this election should not now be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past elections of members of milk boards were conducted by postal ballot.  This, to my mind, is not a satisfactory system for such elections, because secrecy cannot be assured in all cases and also because there is a possibility of abuse.  For example, there is a risk that some ballot papers may be used by persons other than those entitled to vote.  Accordingly, before the foot and mouth disease outbreaks in Britain had created a major crisis for us, I had arranged for a change in the election system so that in future voting for members of milk boards would take place by secret <Col N="1889" /> ballot at special polling stations to be provided for the purpose by the board concerned.  I might say here that I am looking into the question of making a similar change in the election of members of An Bord Bainne.</P>
    <P>In view of the foot and mouth disease emergency, it is most important that the congregation of voters at rural polling stations should be avoided at present, and accordingly that the election for the Dublin Board should not be held until next year.  Section 1 of the Bill, which provides for this, will not affect subsequent elections to the Dublin Board and these will, therefore, take place in 1970 and each third year thereafter.  Also, it will not affect elections to the Cork District Milk Board which is the only other board established under that Act.  An election to that Board is not due to be held until next year.</P>
    <P>The saver provided for in Section 3 of the Bill is required because of legal doubts as to whether the power under the 1936 Act to make an order appointing an election day automatically includes power to revoke such an order. Section 3 of the Bill will remove any such doubts in respect of the recent order revoking the 1967 election day order for the Dublin Board.</P>
    <P>I now commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The real reason for the Bill, as the Minister says, is precautionary, in case we would be unfortunate enough to have foot and mouth disease introduced into this country.  It is a necessary and desirable precaution to ensure that all contacts, as far as possible, as between farms and farmers are avoided wherever possible.  This is one precaution that is eminently desirable and deserving of the support of everybody in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that when this election is held it is desirable that it should not be a postal vote election. The elections in which postal votes have taken place in the past have shown themselves, as the Minister rightly says, to be unsatisfactory.  For this election, therefore, proper booths <Col N="1890" /> should be set up in convenient centres at which those concerned may attend personally to register their votes and the election should be conducted in a proper and safe manner.  It is only right that these precautions should be taken in what I consider a very important election indeed and the arrangements made, therefore, should be such as would have due regard to the importance of the board to be elected, the importance of the work that board will be expected to discharge and the importance of the responsibilities the board will be expected to undertake. The responsibilities of this board are increasing with every year that passes. The members of the board are responsible for the sale and disposal of milk over a very large area, an area in which milk production is increasing every year, an area in which we have now reached the point of having a surplus of 5,000,000 gallons, a surplus for which the producers get the very poor price of 2/2d a gallon approximately.</P>
    <P>I mention these things to emphasise the importance of the election and the importance of ensuring that it is carried out in a proper manner.  This surplus milk has to be disposed of, as I said, at 2/2d per gallon, and that in relation to producers who are engaged all the year round in the production of milk.  Because they are so engaged their expenses are extremely high.  The liquid milk producers are, unlike producers in the creamery areas, denied the subsidy paid in creamery areas of approximately 6d per gallon.  I do not for one moment think that the producers in the creamery areas are getting too much for their milk; I think they are getting too little.  This incoming board will have the responsibility of bringing to the Minister's attention the good reasons that exist for increasing the price of milk in the liquid milk producing areas.  If an increase is not given I do not think they will be able to go on producing milk.  In the creamery areas the milk is produced seasonally in the flush grass period and the producers in those areas are not involved in anything like the same expense as the liquid milk producers are.  Devaluation will cause further difficulty.  It will increase the cost of <Col N="1891" /> winter feed because of the increased cost of imported protein in particular.</P>
    <P>This proposal on the part of the Minister is just one additional precaution. Indeed, many people feel that, while he has gone a long way to meet the very grave situation with which we are confronted, he has not gone far enough and that additional precautions should, in fact, be taken.  I hope the Minister will see his way to taking these precautions.  If he considers it sufficiently important to bring in this Bill to prevent farmers from coming together in order to elect a milk board, then I am afraid that some of the precautions taken by the Minister in other directions will not meet the situation to the extent he apparently believes they will.  I refer to the restriction on the movement of cattle from marts, etc.  I think we will now have farmers and dealers visiting farms and farmers all over the country, picking up animals, with a consequent dangerous spread of possible contacts.  We all hope we shall be spared the scourge of foot and mouth, but today I gave an instance to the Minister of the dangers that exist. I told of a man attending a funeral in England from the North of Ireland and coming back through Aughnacloy; no one asked him to disinfect; no one asked him where he came from or what precautions he had taken.  He himself complained that this was the case; it was not someone trying to escape notice.  He was quite disappointed to find it was possible for him to come back in this way.</P>
    <P>We have, too, people in England complaining that, while approximately half are voluntarily undertaking the sacrifice of not returning home for Christmas, the other half are coming home.  In the last couple of days we had a priest in England saying it was time to stop the fooling and give up depending on the willing co-operation of the people; it just will not come. Those who are co-operating are disappointed that the Minister has not gone further and decided to close the ports for a couple of weeks against incoming passenger traffic.  Closure would not involve any loss of employment because merchandise would continue <Col N="1892" /> to come in and continue to be properly disinfected on entry.</P>
    <P>I know this is not a discussion on foot and mouth disease but the reason for the Bill is the existence of foot and mouth disease in England.  The Bill is necessary and desirable.  Indeed, any measure taken by the Minister deserves the fullest support of every Member of the House, of every citizen of this State, and of every person entering the country.  The disease is widespread and the concern is equally widespread.  The concern is tantamount almost to panic.  It is not confined to the farming community, who would be directly affected, but it is also evident in the cities and towns.  Thinking people realise that in the last analysis the prosperity and welfare of the industrial and commercial sectors of our economy depend on the state of Irish agriculture.  It is because of that that they are concerned about the spread of foot and mouth disease.  We are getting a great deal of co-operation but we cannot depend on the unscrupulous, the selfish and the &ldquo;couldn't-careless&rdquo;. We will always have them with us.  No country is without them.  These are the people against whom we should feel compelled to take every necessary step to safeguard our own position.  The Border appears to be wide open.  I believe the time has come for bringing out the Army to safeguard the Border.</P>
    <P>There is a certain vagueness in the Bill itself which I do not particularly like.  The Minister does not attempt to tell us even roughly when the election will take place.  I should like to feel that the election will not be indefinitely postponed, certainly not postponed longer than is necessary.  If we pass the Bill the Minister will be free to postpone the election until 30th December, 1968, irrespective of whether or not the dangers of foot and mouth disease have completely disappeared. I should like to hear the Minister saying that it is his intention to hold these elections at the earliest possible date and that that date will be as soon as possible after the lifting of the restrictions imposed because of the foot and mouth disease.</P>

      <P>There are a couple of matters here on which I should like to comment briefly lest they might be taken up and misunderstood.  The question of the disposal of the surplus milk in the Dublin area is being gone into by the board and the solution may well be through creameries to be processed by the creameries or milk processing plants near the fringe of the Dublin supply area.  It is not correct to say, if Deputy Clinton intended to, that the Government support for milk is not being passed on to these people in regard to the disposal of this surplus. It is being passed on and the creameries and other people involved have the advantage of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite different. You might as well ask why certain co-operatives pay so much and other co-operatives pay less.  This is something which puzzles me.  The Government support for milk is and will continue to be available to the Dublin Milk Board area suppliers in regard to the disposal of their surplus to the creameries and to the milk processing plants.  So far as the delayed election is concerned it is, without question, intended to hold it as soon as possible after it is evident that the danger of foot and mouth disease has passed. Further than that, I am sure the Deputy and the House are fully aware, I am scarcely able to go because to try to tie it down definitely would be well-nigh impossible.  I had fixed the date by order for the 14th of this month and I have rescinded that.  I feel sure the House will be satisfied that the true intention is to have the election after the dangers of the foot and mouth disease have passed.</P>

      <Col N="1894" /> The main purpose of this Bill is to make statutory provisions for the establishment, development, operation, management and control of five major fishery harbour centres at Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Killybegs, Galway and Howth and also to provide powers for the acquisition, by agreement or compulsorily, of lands required for the establishment and development of these five major fishery centres.</P>
    <P>The establishment and development of these harbour centres is in accordance with the Government's plans for the development of the sea-fishing industry as set out in the programmes for economic expansion, in the White Paper relating to the programme of sea fisheries development which was published in 1962 and in more recent public announcements.</P>
    <P>As many Deputies may recollect, an experienced and renowned Swedish Harbour Consultant was commissioned in 1958 to examine the position as to harbours in relation to our sea-fishing industry and to advise on (1) the desirability and feasibility of concentrating the main fishery efforts at a few places, (2) the places at which the main fishing activity could best be concentrated and (3) the nature, extent and relative importance of the works and facilities to be provided at each of the places selected.</P>
    <P>The decision to employ the harbour consultant was motivated by the need to concentrate our main fishery activities at specially developed modern fishery harbours with adequate berthage, flotation and shore facilities to facilitate our fishermen in the effective use of larger craft geared to employing the most up-to-date fishing methods.</P>
    <P>The harbour consultant made an extensive survey of the Irish coastline and a searching examination of our various landing places.  His report, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, was a comprehensive document and provided most useful information and advice for a long-term plan for fishery harbour development. Following consideration of that report it was publicly announced in 1960 that the Government had authorised preparatory <Col N="1895" /> work to be put in hands for the development of five ports as major fishery harbours at Castletownbere, Galway, Killybegs, Howth and Passage East.  Dunmore East Harbour was substituted in 1962 for Passage East as the subsoil conditions at the latter were disclosed by trial borings to be unfavourable.</P>
    <P>It was also publicly announced that legislation would be prepared to provide, among other things, for the future maintenance and operation of these harbours and for the acquisition of the necessary properties which would be required for their development.  The hope was then expressed &mdash; and reiterated on a number of occasions since then in the course of the annual debates on the Fisheries Estimates &mdash; that negotiations for the acquisition of properties essential for the five harbours would be concluded without the exercise of compulsory powers.  That hope has been realised in respect of some properties but, I regret to say, for various reasons compulsory powers are now required to acquire lands and properties in a number of remaining cases.</P>
    <P>All the necessary preparatory technical and other investigations are completed for the five harbours and work has been proceeding at three of them for some time past &mdash; since July, 1963, in the case of Dunmore East, at Killybegs since April, 1964, and at Castletownbere since June, 1964.  The development work at all five centres will take some years to complete.  So far, over £½ million has been expended at the five centres on preparatory work, on dredging and constructional works. It is estimated that a further sum of about £300,000 will be expended on these harbour works in the current financial year.  These harbours which are reasonably well distributed around the coast will provide good berthage, shelter and flotation for our fishing fleet together with essential ancillary shore facilities.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to emphasise that the programme of major fishery harbour development will not prejudice in any way the <Col N="1896" /> improvement and development at other places &mdash; especially the small fish landing places around the coast which are used by many inshore and other fishermen. These small ports and landing places will not be neglected.  Where improvements are needed to maintain or expand local fishing activities they will continue to be provided with State assistance.</P>
    <P>The Bill consists of thirteen sections and a schedule which lists the five harbours coming within its scope.  Section 2 empowers the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to make an order in relation to any of the five harbours mentioned in the schedule declaring the harbour and land adjoining it, as shall be specified in the order, to be a fishery harbour centre.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this section is to transfer the five harbours to the Minister's control and to constitute in him a new and single harbour authority which will be responsible for their operation, management, development and maintenance.  The object of acquiring land adjoining the harbour is to ensure that adequate space will be made available for essential harbour facilities and related purposes including ancillary industries.  For obvious reasons, it would be the intention to include in a harbour centre for only such area of land as would be absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>The effect of a fishery harbour centre order will be to transfer to and vest in the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the harbour and any land in question which shall be the subject of that order together with all the related property, assets and liabilities of the existing harbour authority. Existing harbour authorities and their officers will cease to carry out any functions in relation to the harbours and for the future the Minister will exercise these functions.  The effect of the orders will be to transfer to me Castletownbere Harbour from the Cork County Council; Dunmore East and Howth Harbours from the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland; and Killybegs Harbour from the Killybegs Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    <P>On and from the transfer of Killybegs <Col N="1897" /> Harbour, the Killybegs Harbour Commissioners will stand dissolved as there will be no longer any reason for their continued existence.  In the case of Galway, the new fishery harbour centre will be adjacent to the commercial harbour which will continue to remain the responsibility of the Galway Harbour Commissioners under the Harbours Acts, 1946 and 1947.  Provision is, however, contained in this section that a fishery harbour centre order shall not be made by me in relation to a harbour now under the control and management of a harbour authority mentioned in the First Schedule to the Harbours Act, 1946, without the consent of the Minister for Transport and Power who is the responsible Minister for commercial harbours.</P>
    <P>This relates specifically to Killybegs Harbour and also to Galway Commercial Harbour in so far as the proposed new fishery harbour centre at Galway may impinge on the area of the commercial harbour or otherwise affect the Galway Harbour Commissioners. Safeguards are also provided for any person who may be affected by a fishery harbour centre order.  Notice must be given to the public of my intention to make the order and consideration must be given to any objections raised.  If the objections are not withdrawn a public inquiry may be held.  It is unnecessary for me to elaborate at this stage on the other consequential matters provided for in section 2.</P>
    <P>In the provision of a properly designed fishery harbour centre it is necessary to provide not only adequate shelter, flotation and berthage for the fishing vessels which will use the harbour but also to provide necessary shore facilities.  The shore facilities include the servicing of the fishing vessels, space for the handling and sale of fish, fish processing industries and, where appropriate, facilities for boat repairs and maintenance.  Some land has already been acquired for these purposes at the centres by agreement but due to difficulties about title in some cases and because of failure to reach agreement or unwillingness to sell in others, it is necessary to seek <Col N="1898" /> statutory powers for compulsory acquisition.</P>
    <P>Provisions to that effect are made in section 3 which is drafted on standard lines.  Public notice must be given of the intention to enter on and acquire land by compulsory powers and in addition there is a special provision whereby land, or rights in relation to land or water, used in connection with the operation of commercial shipping or the exercise of the public right of navigation shall not be acquired compulsorily without the consent of the Minister for Transport and Power.  Provision is also made that in default of agreement on the amount of the price or compensation which will be paid for any land or right acquired under this section the matter shall be determined in accordance with the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries shall be responsible for the management, control, operation and development of each of the five major fishery harbour centres on and from the commencement of each relevant fishery harbour centre order, provisions are made in section 4 of the Bill to give me necessary and adequate power to perform those functions.  This section will enable me to make whatever bye-laws are necessary and desirable for the management, control and operation of the harbour centres and to make orders fixing rates, tolls and other charges for the use of facilities and services in the centres.  Existing orders, regulations and bye-laws relating to these harbours which are in force at the time of transfer will continue to apply to the harbours in question until they are amended or revoked.</P>
    <P>In addition to having the responsibility of providing adequate facilities at each centre for the sale of fish landed at the centres, the section will enable the Minister to require that fish landed at the centre shall be offered for sale at the centre and will also enable him to regulate and control the manner in which sales shall be conducted. Whether it will be necessary for me to use any or all of these powers will depend on circumstances from time to time but at this stage I <Col N="1899" /> should make it perfectly clear that I will have no hesitation in invoking these powers if the unorthodox practices at Dunmore East do not cease.</P>
    <P>When orders or bye-laws relating to the management and control of harbour centres are to be made it will be obligatory on the Minister to publish notice of his intention to make them and to state the purposes for which they are to be made.  A period of 21 days is specified within which interested persons may submit objections to the proposed instruments.  Having considered the objections it is provided, however, that the Minister may make the order or bye-law with or without modification as he may think proper.  Notice of the making of the order or bye-law must be published in <i>Irish Oifigiúil.</i> The usual provision is also made for penalties on persons or bodies who contravene orders or bye-laws or who may be involved in such contraventions.</P>
    <P>The appointment of staff necessary for the management and control of the harbour centres is provided for but it may be convenient and economical for the Minister to delegate the exercise of some of his powers and functions to a body such as the Commissioners of Public Works.  Provision is made to permit the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to arrange for such a delegation of powers.  A similar provision is also made in section 3 for the delegation to the Commissioners of powers in relation to the acquisition of land in fishery harbour centres.</P>
    <P>The provisions in section 5 are customary and concern the use to which I may put any property vested in me under the Bill when enacted.  Section 6 provides for the future maintenance of harbours in fishery harbour centres.</P>
    <P>Taking sections 7, 8 and 9 together, it will be noted that I propose to establish, maintain and manage a fund to be known as the Fishery Harbour Centre Fund.  The account of this fund, which will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General each year and laid before each House of the Oireachtas, will indicate the annual income and expenditure related to the <Col N="1900" /> fishery harbour centres.  All moneys received in respect of rates, tolls and other charges and non-repayable grants from the Exchequer will be paid into this fund.  Out of the fund will be paid all outlay and expenditure in connection with the operation and management of the harbours.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it appears to be setting out to provide facilities in five of the major fishing harbours that, indeed, are long overdue.  The Minister referred to a report by a Swedish expert, and I noticed he appeared deliberately to avoid mentioning this man's name.  I had some difficulty trying to pronounce it and I wonder if the Minister could tell me how I am to pronounce &ldquo;Bjuke&rdquo;.  Is this to be called the &ldquo;Duke&rdquo; report or how are we to pronounce it?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the name, I had an opportunity to glance through the report and it is obvious the intentions of the Bill follow closely the recommendations made in the report which struck me as being the result of a very thorough investigation of the possibility in relation to the development of major fishery centres.  I was glad to hear the Minister emphasising that the legislation being introduced now will not in any way interfere with the work that is going on and the work it is intended to carry out in the future in the smaller fishing harbours.  This is extremely important and it was emphasised in the report of the American survey team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was emphasised in that report that those smaller harbours had a contribution to make, both socially and economically, to the Department as a whole.  I welcome the fact that we at last seem to have reached the point in this country where we cease to look at the fishing industry as a sort of social service, a way in which a certain number of people adjacent to the sea coast were able to supplement their incomes to a point which made life <Col N="1901" /> tolerable and without being an undue burden on the State.  We have failed for far too long to see the potential that is obviously in the fishing industry in this country.</P>
    <P>I believe a new dawn arrived on the occasion when the late President Kennedy decided to assist us in this matter with the experts he sent over to join our own people to explore the possibilities of the development of the fishing industry in this country.  This is a further step to enable that sort of major development to take place in the fishing industry.  I have deplored on occasions before the lack of confidence there appeared to be in the whole prospects of the fishing industry.  I feel this was amply borne out by the fact that capital investment by the Government over the years in the fishing industry has been deplorably small and that they themselves had no faith in the future of the fishing industry.  They showed this by their refusal to invest money in the fishing industry.  This was going on at the time when other projects with much less prospects were receiving attention and considerable capital sums from the Government.</P>
    <P>Five harbours have been selected for development and some work has been started and is in progress in certain of those harbours.  I was a little bit disappointed in not hearing anything at all from the Minister about the harbour which is nearest to the constituency which I represent, that is Howth Harbour.  I remember going out to Howth some time last year and watching the performance there and the work that had to be carried out with the landed fish there because of the inadequacy of the harbour and the inadequacy of the facilities provided there.  If my recollection serves me properly, in 1960 when this report came out it was estimated that the improvement of Howth Harbour to bring it up to the standard required and desired would cost approximately £650,000.  That figure has certainly not diminished since then.  It is obvious that if that harbour is to be developed along the lines recommended in that report it would now cost anything up to £1 million or £1½ million.</P>
    <P>Howth is a first-class centre because <Col N="1902" /> it is adjacent to the biggest market we have in this country for fish, namely, Dublin city.  It is also adjacent to the export market.  I appreciate and realise that if the fishing industry is to be developed as it should be developed in the future we will have to look to the export market for outlets for the increased landings we hope to get, and which we are bound to get, provided we show confidence in the industry and give the facilities, which are needed, to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the intention behind this Bill is to give him compulsory acquisition powers to secure sufficient land and sufficient property, if necessary, in the region of those five major harbours so that all the facilities required for up-to-date and fairly large fishing centres could be provided.  It is my opinion, when buying land, that we should err on the side of having too much land.  It is certainly easier to dispose of land than to get it when we need it with the increased building going on.  It is much cheaper to buy too much land because we would then have it on hand.  If we are to have major fishing harbours with all the facilities required by way of processing factories, proper storage accommodation, cold stores, ice banks, handling facilities and auctioneering facilities, it will require considerable space.</P>
    <P>It is also mentioned, I think, in the course of the report that it would be desirable to have a net factory in the same general area.  It would also be desirable to have boat repairs carried on in this area and also boatbuilding. All those facilities must be provided near where boats are landed. Otherwise you will have fishermen, who are really producers, who are really people out to land fish, not able to do so.</P>
    <P>The interests of fishermen should be looked after and they should be enabled to land their fish efficiently and the entire marketing operation from the moment the fish are landed on the pier should be taken care of.  Those fishermen who have borne the hazards of the sea should get a fairly reasonable reward so that they will continue in the business.  I confessed here last year that <Col N="1903" /> my acquaintance with the fishing industry was, indeed, very meagre and very slight.  During the holiday period of this year I was in Dingle and I availed myself of the opportunity to go out in a trawler for a day's fishing to see what the men went through and to see how hard it was for them to earn a living at sea.  I can certainly say that those men said that they had an average day's fishing.  They went out at 5 o'clock in the morning and they returned at 5 in the afternoon.  That is a long day at sea but there was no fortune in the catch.</P>
    <P>I consider that in those circumstances every possible facility should be provided for those people.  The investment in that 50 foot boat was £20,000. I know there are fairly generous facilities provided by way of grants and loans in order to obtain boats, but nevertheless, it is a pretty large investment. It is a fairly hazardous life requiring a lot of skill.  Unless we provide those people with modern up-to-date facilities for handling, packaging, processing and marketing I do not think the fishing industry is likely to develop in the way we would all like it to develop.</P>
    <P>Again, if my memory serves me correctly, in the report it was stated that it was desirable that the control of the operation of the various fishing ports should be in the hands of one local authority.  We have obviously departed from this idea and now the State is taking over entirely and absolutely the control of those fishing ports.  I do not know whether that is a good thing or not.  It may perhaps be a good thing that that should happen at the start.  It may be a good thing that the State should undertake and that the Minister and his Department should undertake the responsibility of setting up those harbours on a proper footing and ensuring that all the facilities are provided and that they are worked efficiently.</P>
    <P>However, having done that, my own personal view is that it is extremely important to involve the fishermen at every point.  I feel that you must get the people in the industry with you, <Col N="1904" /> and if they are not with you, you are in serious trouble and will not have success.  Serious consideration should be given to the co-operative management of these fishery centres eventually.  I am not saying at this point that the time is ripe for it. Indeed, the experience which the Minister has referred to in Dunmore East is a sorry one and is indicative of the fact that some authority must move in and take over if people cannot settle their own differences and work in harmony and for the good of their own industry.  I would like to see consideration given to the question as to whether there is an alternative or no alternative to the State moving in and taking over completely the establishment, the running and the management of these ports.</P>
    <P>There is one point mentioned in the Bill &mdash; I went through it roughly &mdash; and it was that fish landed at a port must be offered for sale there and then. Personally, I do not like the sound of &ldquo;must be offered for sale there and then&rdquo;.  I would hate, as a producer of any commodity, to be directed by the Minister or by any other authority in the land to sell it at a particular spot and in a particular way.  There is something wrong and something dictatorial about that.  If a man or a company for that matter that has invested money in boats and gear and are able to land fish at a port feel that there is a better market somewhere else or that they can make a contract and send the fish direct to some destination or other and that the question of quality standard can be guaranteed and supervised, I do not think they should be denied that opportunity.  It is indicated quite clearly in the Bill that the intention is that that must happen.  I hope that when the Minister is replying he will refer to this.  It is, perhaps, not extremely important but, nevertheless, it is a feature that I would object to.</P>
    <P>One of the things I felt about this Bill was that it hardly had gone far enough.  It covers five ports and five ports only.  I feel that in some way it could be left open to include such other ports as the Minister from time to time felt should come within the scope of the legislation because I feel <Col N="1905" /> that it is quite on the cards that other centres and other situations may arise where it might be advisable to move in and do something about putting a particular harbour on a proper footing.</P>
    <P>I have put a couple of question marks here on section 4.  I shall read it to get my own memory working on the thing:</P>
    <P>The Minister may ... by order, fix rates, tolls and other charges for the use of facilities (including the harbour) and services in the centre and provide for their payment and collection and for penalties and remedies for their non-payment (including distress and sale of ships, boats and goods in respect of which any rates, tolls or charges are payable),</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is just a re-enactment of something that is already in harbour legislation that I am not aware of. There is another paragraph which reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may ... provide, or arrange for the provision of, facilities in the centre for the sale of fish landed at the centre and require that fish so landed be offered for sale at the centre and that sales of fish at the centre be conducted in such manner as the Minister may specify.</P>
    <P>I take it that that probably applies particularly to Dunmore East and the difficulties that are there but it is unfortunate that it has to be covered in this way.  The power here should be conditional on circumstances arising where it would, in fact, be necessary for the Minister or some authority to move in and take over where undesirable practices were being carried out.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the takeover of personnel who are in existence at the moment at some of those ports. Galway apparently is an exception in so far as any development that might take place in Galway would be a completely separate development and would not be in any way associated with the commercial harbour there.  I think it was part of the report that, in fact, the present harbour position is not by any means the best position for a fishing harbour and that it would be cheaper and much more suitable to site <Col N="1906" /> the fishing harbour at a point adjacent to the present processing factory. Apparently there is no question of people becoming redundant.  I would like to ask the Minister when he is replying to refer to the question of the taking over of people at whatever level they happen to exist at the moment and the safeguarding of their positions and their rights.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister if in providing the facilities that he feels will be necessary if we are to have up-to-date and worthwhile fishing centres whether it will be necessary to take over private houses or private property of that sort.  If so, is it the intention that regardless of the attitude of the people concerned their property will, in fact, be taken over by compulsory purchase and that it will be paid for in the usual way that property is paid for as a result of compulsory purchase and arbitration proceedings? I assume that that is the intention and one only hopes that too much inconvenience and too much disturbance will not arise as a result of taking the necessary measures to secure sufficient property adjacent to the harbours to ensure that we have the facilities we need.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the amount of fishmeal that is imported here annually &mdash; I was told recently that in the past year we imported three-quarters of a million pounds worth of fishmeal &mdash; I wonder if it is the intention that that would be one of the facilities that it would be necessary to provide adjacent to harbours or is it wiser to move the fishmeal plant farther away from such ventures?  I know that a recent decision to establish a fishmeal factory on the east coast has met with a considerable amount of opposition in an area that was being developed more or less as a tourist centre.</P>
    <P>I know it is not in order to bring within the scope of the discussion in relation to the five specific harbours the fact that the Minister also mentioned small harbours.  If an insurmountable difficulty arises in Laytown, and the people in Loughshinny are anxious to get this industry and have a site available for it, the Minister should take a note of it in passing. <Col N="1907" /> The reasons for the selection of the various harbours were amply explained in the report and it needs no further discussion or explanation, at least to my mind.  They were obviously selected for good reasons; they are sited at a convenient distance to the fishing grounds and are fairly close to facilities for selling the fish to suitable markets.  There are adequate sites available in the area.  Such centres should be fairly attractive residential areas and this is an aspect of fishery development that should not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>In the past we were inclined to overlook the social services that were necessary and desirable in our fishing harbours. The provision of housing accommodation and suitable schools and other social services is called for if we are to keep our fishing people in the area.  We must make work in fishing as attractive as we can for the people in it.  Otherwise, they leave and go to somewhere else preferable to them.  It is important, as well, to have a fairly safe harbour, safe in all weathers, and it is extremely essential to provide artificial shelter if it is not naturally there.  These are the considerations, I take it, which have motivated the decision to develop these five centres.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that it will not in any way interfere with, or hold up, development of other harbours.</P>
    <P>There is one harbour in my constituency and its extension and development has taken many years.  I do not think a start has been made there yet even though we have all the preliminary plans.  I was hoping the Minister in introducing this legislation would explain why it has taken so long to get to this area.  A decision was taken as far back as 1960, repeated in 1962 and we were told in 1962 that this legislation was being prepared.  We were told in 1965 it was being drafted.  What is the reason for the hold-up?  Why are we dragging our feet so much in relation to the fishing industry and why have we failed so completely to show our confidence and make the investment necessary in the industry?</P>
    <P>I put down a question about a week <Col N="1908" /> ago about the amount of capital investment in the fishing industry in the past ten years.  It is in the region of £2,250,000.  Most of that went into boats, not harbour development or facilities for processing or handling of the fish and the marketing that is required. I hope this Bill is an indication that the Government have now made up their minds to tackle this industry seriously and make the necessary investment available for progress so as to reach the full potential of the industry in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>I know that the development of harbours &mdash; marketing facilities at the harbours, landing and processing facilities &mdash; is not everything.  The fish must be caught, for instance.  This aspect cannot be neglected either; the two things go hand in hand.  The training of fishermen is also of paramount importance.  On them depends whether we have any fish to process and I am glad to see this measure coming in.  I do not know whether it is a good thing that the State should take this on completely.  I have some doubt in my mind about that.  I would prefer to have this done by co-operatives.  This may be the best move in the first instance, the State to move in and put it on a proper footing, and then when the time is ripe to hand it over.</P>
    <P>I see scope for the selection of appointees to various positions and I see the possibility of preference for people because of the colour of their eyes or one thing or another.  When it comes to making the necessary appointments to man the harbours I hope these people will not be appointed because they happen to be members of the local cumann but that the real abilities and work of the people will be the deciding factor.  It is wrong that a Government Department or a Minister of State should have control of direct appointments in anything of this kind. There should be an independent authority to do this.  Otherwise, we will arrive at a situation where it will be like the appointment of a postmaster or postmistress and there will be endless rows in this House about the appointments.  If there were some way by which an impartial authority could make the appointments of the various <Col N="1909" /> people who will be necessary it would be preferable so that the business of these harbours will be properly conducted and carried out.  There should not be hand-outs or be seen or suspected to be hand-outs; this is very important.  We should not do anything that will in any way affect the future of the fishing industry.  This is an industry in which I, personally, see great potential if it is handled properly and if we treat it with the confidence we should and make the investment in it which I believe is called for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one who has always believed that the State has not been investing sufficient capital in the fishing industry.  When one sees a measure such as that before us tonight one cannot but feel heartened that something positive will be done to help to expand our sea-fishing industry.</P>
      <P>I have great hopes that with the successful implementation of these five major harbours we will see a great leap forward in that sector of our economy, sea-fishing, which I feel up to this has been rather sadly neglected.</P>
      <P>In my area on the west coast of Ireland there has been more rapid development in the sea-fishing industry over the past five-six years.  It would be fair, I think, to give some credit to the various State agents who are working towards this end and reporting to the officials in the Department, and also to Bord Iascaigh Mhara, who I feel are at this time doing an excellent job for the development of our sea-fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, I had not time to read fully through the Minister's speech but there is a special reference in it to my own constituency and to the development of one of these major harbours in Galway.  I note that there is reference to the fact that there will be some difficulty for the harbour commissioners there with regard to property in order to facilitate the development of the fishery harbour. As a member of Galway Harbour Commissioners, I would say to the Minister and, indeed, all the interested bodies who are involved in helping to achieve this very worthy development that they can be assured of my personal assistance as a harbour commissioner. <Col N="1910" /> The other members of the Galway Harbour Board intimated to me that they are only too anxious to help if there are difficulties so as to ensure that a satisfactory arrangement can be arrived at between the Galway Harbour Commissioners and the Fisheries Branch.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not be forced to use compulsory powers or to seek the permission of the Minister for Transport and Power to acquire the land which I understand is so necessary for the development of the Galway harbour.  I would lay very strong emphasis on the fact that the people in Galway and the fishermen in the area want this major fishery harbour to start very soon.  We are getting slightly impatient.  We realise there may be slight difficulties in our area but we feel these could have been overcome long before now.  We hope they will be overcome in the very near future.  We trust there will not be any further delay in starting actual construction work on the major harbour in Galway.</P>
    <P>If one pays a visit to Galway Harbour and inspects the berthage provided there for the Galway Bay fleet of fishing trawlers, one cannot but agree that the situation is ludicrous.  The berthage is not sufficient even for two or three trawlers.  Yet, the whole fleet has to tie up to very dangerous side entrances which never were intended for fishing trawlers but that is where they have had to tie up for the past three or four years.  In unfavourable weather or in a storm, some of these boats have to be taken out by the fishermen and they must ride out the storm in the bay lest the boats should be damaged in the inadequate and inefficient berthage provided for them at the moment.  These men have devoted their life savings to the acquisition of their boats.  The cost of them is very high.  It is a big risk to ask any person to tie up his boat in a place which he knows is not safe.  This position has obtained sometimes with 15 trawlers: the number varies.  It depends on who is in and who is out, which boats are in Aran, and so on.  I cannot lay too much emphasis on the fact that the situation in Galway is one of <Col N="1911" /> extreme urgency.  I appeal very sincerely to the Minister and to the officials of his Department to get cracking on Galway Harbour.  Let us see some progress there and let us see the construction work starting.</P>
    <P>We have seen the development that has taken place in three out of five areas.  We do not see why Galway should again be last on the list or why, if there are five names on the list, that of Galway should be last.  I appeal to the Minister and to his officers to put their heads together so as to get going on this without delay.  Certainly, we cannot tolerate a continuance of the present position.  It is lucky that we have not lost any boats so far.  If any boats are lost between now and the time work on the harbour is completed, some responsibility must fall on some of those who have not acted in the proper manner in which this work could have been set in motion long before now.</P>
    <P>I have been in Dunmore East and seen the fine work carried out there.  I fail to understand why such progress was made down there while we in Galway are left at the tail-end of the race.  Even if we are behind at this stage, we shall not accept any further delays.  If pressure is required, I would ask the Minister to exert it.  I only hope that the Galway Harbour Commissioners will co-operate fully when it comes to a decision and that we shall not have to resort to any extreme measures in order to ensure that the work at Galway will progress.</P>

      <P>Is Deputy Clinton talking about castles in the air?  I want the Minister to dispel a rumour that is circulating in Galway that there is a possibility of Galway losing its major harbour and this development.  I should like him to refute that statement clearly because it is discouraging to those involved in the fishing industry.  It is most discouraging to those who are making plans for subsidiary factories in the surrounding area and, generally, it creates an air of indecision about this <Col N="1912" /> whole project.  We should like a clear statement that the work in Galway will start in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>Some difficulties have arisen in Galway as regards the setting-up of factories subsidiary to the fishing industry. The Minister is aware of them.  Under this legislation, a certain area of ground will be made available for people interested in building factories connected with the work of the fishing fleet.  I refer to canning factories and, generally, to any type of work attached to fishing.  We had difficulty in siting a fishmeal factory.  The county medical officer of health refused permission for the siting of this factory in the vicinity of Galway Harbour and eventually it was set up outside Tuam, 18 miles away.  That is not very economic for the owners and promoters of that project who were anxious to develop the fishing industry and who saw the need for a fishmeal plant in the area.  It is a second-hand plant which was in Killybegs but it is working satisfactorily. However, it is situated 18 miles from the fishery port.  One can appreciate the expense and annoyance of transport costs from Galway to Tuam for processing. Certainly it is not the most economical or most efficient manner in which this industry could have been set up.</P>
      <P>There are people interested in setting up fish factories in and around Galway city.  We want to help them to come there and to set up industries there.  They can do so only if this deep fishing harbour is constructed.  That is why we are so anxious to see that development takes place immediately. The grant to fishermen purchasing outboard motors was withdrawn recently by the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I would ask the Minister to re-introduce that grant.  A lot of fishermen were caught on the wrong foot.  We had hoped to see a continuance of that grant.  There must be incentives to fishermen if the fishery harbour in Galway is to be a complete success.  We must encourage <Col N="1913" /> owners of trawlers to get into bigger boats.  One of the biggest difficulties in taking that step is that if they are doing well now in 50-footers, they are reluctant to go into 70- or 100-footers. We know that the development of fishing and the need for this harbour which it brings about depends on larger boats and I appeal to the Minister to see if there is some new way in which successful fishermen can be encouraged to go into bigger boats. The fishing industry is probably one of the least tapped of all our national resources and we shall make no substantial improvement on the present situation unless we can encourage successful fishing skippers to purchase larger boats and go out into the deep sea and be able to stay out.</P>
      <P>We are helping to provide facilities for this in providing major harbours and with that I am asking the Minister to encourage as far as possible the acquisition of larger boats by successful fishermen.  Even if it means a further injection of capital I would suggest that the Minister should go ahead because the larger harbours will not be much use unless we have the fishermen using them for bigger boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  We agree that this is an excellent idea.  Anybody travelling around the centre of the country would never realise that we are an island country because we do not seem to have been very interested in the development of fishing up to now.  The Minister may say that £500,000 was spent recently but I understand that includes money spent on boats and supplies as well as on various projects for fishing, but surely the Minister must agree that for a number of years until very recently the fishing industry was badly mishandled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fishmeal factory was set up at Killybegs some years ago and there was some difficulty with the local fishermen who, I suppose rightly, wanted to sell fish to the highest bidder and if there was a market for fish they did not want it to go to the factory.  The people running the factory, in an effort to make it pay, went to Greenland and bought two <Col N="1914" /> 75-foot boats and brought them home but the Government promptly made an order that nothing bigger than a 70-foot boat could ply with the result that the fishmeal factory then closed down with substantial loss not alone to the Government but to the Irish people who had taken it over and to the fishermen, if they had realised it.</P>
    <P>Later, I saw fish caught at Clogherhead taken by CIE trucks across the width of Ireland to Killybegs.  This latest development appears to be an attempt to improve five fishing harbours that are fairly evenly placed.  I should like the Minister to comment on one or two aspects and one is the fact that the compulsory powers being taken appear to give the Minister the right to use in any way he wishes the land and water he takes over.  I am sure he will agree that in many cases there are fishing rights held by families dating back many years, perhaps 100 or 150 years.  The Minister should be very careful about that.  Secondly, it appears that some people, because of the dissolution of one or two harbour boards, may be out of a job and if that happens, since somebody would be required to do the work, would the Minister suggest that where possible these men should be re-employed or compensated in some way?  As it stands, it is the Board of Works that would get the job of the management or control of the areas taken over by the Minister and it is possible that people many years in employment with the harbour commissioners may lose their jobs.</P>
    <P>I had a question down to the Minister about the pension scheme which harbour commissioners have and I was surprised to find that, apparently, it was not operating too well.  Accordingly, the Minister will understand why I am concerned about people losing their employment without having a pension scheme and why they may be in an awkward position.  We in the Labour Party agree that it is about time that a definite effort was made to improve the fishing industry. We believe the amount of money being made available will need to be stepped up considerably because at present we are apparently trying to buy goods and <Col N="1915" /> services which are not available for the amount we propose to spend.  I wish the Minister the best of luck in his efforts to improve the fisheries not alone in those five harbours but in the others throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of matters were raised by the few Deputies who spoke.  The matter of investment in the fishing industry was mentioned and there was an allegation that we do not take it too seriously. Possibly this is fair enough comment but, on the other hand, who is accusing whom of not taking enough interest in this industry?  For the first time now &mdash; and, of course, we are being criticised because we have not done it earlier &mdash; we are providing a major Fishery Harbour Bill which will enable a great deal of development in a real sense to be contemplated for the future. It will be the basis on which I hope a great deal of development of our fisheries should take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that a few million pounds were invested in recent years in this industry not including the moneys now being spent on the major harbours I have mentioned.  There is no doubt that more money will be spent but while we talk about developing fisheries I wonder how many people stop to think what we must do in order to achieve this development.  It is not a question of somebody not being interested over the years, or of not doing what they might have done but it is purely the hard facts that first, we need the fishermen, then the ports and the facilities.  It is doubtful which of these should come first but what we have been doing recently is tackling the matter on this comprehensive basis and trying by various devices, possibly only short-term, interim measures, to provide more fishermen with the necessary skills to go to sea and fish, not in currachs or inshore boats but with bigger boats and deepwater trawlers that are a necessary part of any major development in our fisheries.  That is the most essential element of the three required.  We undoubtedly have available the factor that makes everything possible, the fish and the fishing <Col N="1916" /> grounds available near our coasts, with an abundance of fish of a quality comparable to that of any other part of the world.  Given that, we need more fishermen, more boats and more facilities for landing, handling, processing, storing, selling and distribution.</P>
    <P>It is on this broad basis that I think our fishery people have been working, including Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and I think that what is required now is a sharp injection of speed into the process. They are on the right lines and have laid the proper foundation and what we are dealing with here is a great part of that foundation.  What we will need is the will to go forward more quickly than in the past and that will entail greater expenditure on additional facilities for the fishermen.  This is probably the most vital aspect of all. Side by side with this naturally will develop the demand for bigger boats and for training and this will require greater help from the Government. These major harbour developments will benefit smaller harbours which have been serving the fishing industry for a long number of years.  Because of the development of our major harbours many of these other harbours will benefit because they will be complementary to one another.  Therefore, the fact that we are taking these steps is in no way to be taken as an indication of any lessening of our interest in other harbours. As I say, they must all go together in the building up generally of our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>There is an interest in fishing particularly among our younger people today that has not been evident for generations past.  It is probable that the public are responding to our long-term propaganda, if you like, in regard to the big future for fishing here.  The expansion of our fishing industry depends, first, and foremost, on the provision of trained personnel to man the boats efficiently, and potential fishermen seem to have accepted the fact that there is a bright future for them.  We are moving in the right direction, probably a bit slowly for many, but certainly in the right direction, providing educational facilities for those who wish to make a career in this industry.  We must also provide <Col N="1917" /> for the development of offshore facilities, processing, storage, ice plants and so forth.  There is need for a certain amount of impetus on this side of the industry and this is being provided. The return from fishing today for the amount of capital invested is, perhaps, the best return of any compared with any business you care to name.  It can be seen now that there is a place in this industry for many thousands of our people rather than the hundreds that are participating in it now.</P>
    <P>As regards the various points raised, Deputy Clinton mentioned the matter of Howth which he said was scarcely mentioned.  &ldquo;Canon&rdquo; Burke has arrived, and it is appropriate time to mention Howth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not ask to have it added, as I am sure Deputy Burke would.  On the question of Howth it was estimated some few years ago that it would cost something over £600,000. The Deputy, I am sure, will be happy to know, as I am, that instead of going up that Estimate seems to have come down and that the money required will be around the £500,000 mark for what is recommended.</P>

These are matters which we shall have to face when we come to them, but as far as starting is concerned, it is certainly not the wish of my Department or myself that they should be delayed in any way.  I would hope that we can get ahead with them at the earliest possible time, and I have no doubt we shall get the fullest co-operation <Col N="1918" /> from Deputy Clinton and his Party in putting forward this very necessary project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may indeed.  In regard to the sale of fish, Deputy Clinton raised the question as to whether the fish once landed had to be sold there.  This is not absolutely essential.  In fact in section 4 (2) (c) it will be seen that the term used is that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo; do this, that and the other. Therefore, it is not obligatory to proceed on the basis outlined by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In regard to compulsory acquisition, there will be compulsory acquisition where it is necessary but only where it is found necessary.  Unfortunately, we already know a great many places which require this sort of provision in order to clear title.  There are certain spaces and certain lands very much needed for these developments and these lands which will be acquired compulsorily or otherwise will be for the purpose of enabling land-based activities to be carried on, in other words, ice-plants, handling sheds, and possibly factory space for processing, net mending or net manufacturing, but net mending in particular and, of course, the servicing of the boats themselves. All these facilities are a very necessary part of any development, and without them, the whole concept of the Bill would be nullified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of the legislation. There was no real urgency about this legislation until such time as the progress on these places was reaching finality.  In more recent times they were coming up against the real problems we had already anticipated and, therefore, the Bill is needed to enable the job to proceed.  The fact that it has not come before us until now does not mean we have been doing nothing with regard to development.  There has been upwards of £650,000 already <Col N="1919" /> spent in various ways on a number of these harbours, and a further £300,000 is in the course of being spent before the end of the present financial year. With or without legislation, it will be seen that we have not been sitting down crying out we have not got the power to do things.  We have been doing them in the most effective way by getting on with the job, and at fairly considerable cost to the State. Now we need extra powers in order to finish the job in a number of these cases.</P>

      <P>And more will, Deputy. There was mention of the existing fishmeal factory at Killybegs and the question of fishmeal processing.  Fishmeal processing may be carried out at any harbour where there is a sufficiency of supply surplus to their ordinary needs.  The selection of Mornington on the east coast was made only after an examination of all the likely places along the east coast.  It was not a question of sticking a pin in a map and saying that is where the factory should be.  There was the fullest evaluation by the people concerned in consultation with the Fishery Branch of my Department and Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  It was selected on the basis of its suitability.  Maybe there are better places along the east coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Loughshinny claims to be a good harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That could well be. Perhaps Deputies from County Dublin will have thoughts about that, just as other Deputies from the east coast counties will have.  The fact is that Mornington was selected after a full evaluation.  We wish it luck.  If there is room for others along the east coast, the sooner we find them the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of staff could be exaggerated. To begin with, the number involved over the five harbours is only nine.  Only nine people might be upended by this takeover by me.  The point is that these nine people need not necessarily be disbanded and cast away.  There may be certain roles they <Col N="1920" /> could fill adequately or even well.  This will be gone into very fully before anybody is left out.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Clinton that it is wrong for a Minister to have the right of making appointments and that they should be left to some independent tribunal or commission.  I have always felt &mdash; I may be wrong about this and I may live to change my mind &mdash; that when a Minister makes an appointment he has to stand over it. But when another body is set up to do it, most of us may not even know who they are.  They are anonymous and remain so.  We are not always satisfied with what they do, but there is nobody we can have a whack at and say that they should not have done it that way. The Minister is quite different.  He is open to all sorts of wallops from everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede that.  But we are not always satisfied with what these allegedly independent bodies do either, and we are at the disadvantage that in many cases we do not even know who they are, nor have we any opportunity of challenging them on what they have done.  Even if we could, they are not in a position that our challenge would in any way hurt them. But we, on the other hand, have to carry any of these charges with us out of this House before the electorate, which we have to face every so many years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot to be said for that.  If the Minister takes over holus-bolus the entire operations of these five major harbours, would it not be strange if he should hand over to someone else the appointment of those who will run those harbours in his name?  There would not be a lot of sense in that, apart from my view that <Col N="1921" /> a Minister should make appointments and take responsibility for them afterwards, rather than duck behind some anonymous body we have no opportunity of challenging.</P>
      <P>In regard to Galway Harbour, if one were to judge by the demand in Galway it is not Galway Harbour as we know it that would merit consideration but further out in Galway Bay towards Connemara, where fishing has been a traditional way of life down the years for a great number of people. If it were possible to have this sort of major development further out in the bay, I believe it would be a good thing.  But physical conditions make it impossible to do this and Galway city has been chosen.  I hope that the interests in Galway so alive to the commercial development of the city and its shipping activities will find a place for us and not crowd us out.  I hope they will appreciate what this major development can mean to Galway and will give us a fair crack of the whip so that we can get the fullest co-operation.  Some people incline me to believe that the value of this major fishing harbour development in Galway is not fully appreciated, that some people feel it may conflict with commercial development which may be of a more passing nature than the development of fisheries.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that we have been somewhat lax in getting on with the development in Galway and there is a plea for us to go ahead.  I am making a plea in reverse: that those in Galway really interested in fisheries development should appreciate the long-term value of the harbour development in Galway city and that the more transitory benefits from the commercial trade should be weighed in proper perspective.</P>
      <P>Of course, the local cumann was mentioned.  When you get down to it, along the west coast or the east coast, if you want a good man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he is obviously in the cumann.  There is no doubt about it.  He is bound to be in it.  However, that is not really the exercise we are <Col N="1922" /> engaged in at present.  I hope this Bill will get the speedy passage it deserves. It is undoubtedly needed, whether you regard it as coming too long after its time or in time.  It can do a very good job, and it can be a beacon, as it were, in the development of our fisheries.</P>
      <P>We as the Government are fully alive to the undoubted long term big business potential of fisheries for so many of our people.  We want our people to accept this as being of real worth.  No one can set a limit on it at this stage.  The potential of development in fisheries is enormous for a country like ours, particularly in the west, where so many people can be usefully and profitably employed not only for their own benefit but for the benefit of the economy in general.  If we can only get across fully and completely the lesson now being learned by those who are participating in a progressive way in fishing, we will not have any great difficulty in getting fishermen and providing them with boats, and the landing and processing and selling and storage facilities which are essential. We want people to appreciate the worth of fishing so that they can influence young people to go into fishing and this in turn will enable us to provide them with boats of the necessary size and with the proper gear.  This Bill is now attempting to provide in a big way for future development in our fishing industry.</P>
