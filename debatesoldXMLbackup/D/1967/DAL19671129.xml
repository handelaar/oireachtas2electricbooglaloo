      <P>and <b>Mr. T. O'Donnell</b> asked the Minister for Transport and Power if his attention has been drawn to a report that a British air company (name supplied) acting with considerable foresight were able to save themselves a substantial sum of money by the prompt action of the Chairman in purchasing American aircraft immediately prior to devaluation of the pound sterling; and why similar action was not taken by Aer Rianta.</P>

      <P>According to reports I have seen, the company in question purchased dollars for which they already had official foreign exchange approval in respect of aircraft already ordered and delivery of which was imminent. No such circumstances applied in the case of the Irish air companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes.  Could they not apply to the Minister for Finance?  I can only ask the Minister for Transport and Power the question.  The Minister for Finance usurps his function to reply. Was it not perfectly open to the State board to make suitable representations to the Minister for Finance to get permission to purchase forward dollars to provide against the contingency of any devaluation arising, in view of the magnitude of the expenditure they were undertaking, and are not such transactions of daily occurrence in the City of London by mercantile companies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The report of the Joint Committee on Co-operation in Electricity Supply which reported to myself and the Northern Ireland Minister for Commerce in March, 1966, recommended inter-connection of the two electricity systems and observed in their report that the total demand for electricity on the inter-connected system would be substantially greater than the demand on either separate system and, since there are considerable economies of scale in nuclear power plants, inter-connection could advance the date when a permissible nuclear installation would be economical in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Commerce and I, on behalf of our Governments, formally agreed to the inter-connection of the two electricity supply systems in October last and the Electricity Supply Board for Northern Ireland and the Electricity Supply Board here are now drawing up detailed plans for the implementation of this decision.</P>
      <P>The desirability of acquiring a nuclear power plant is under continuing study by the ESB and, if it appears that there would be advantages in acquiring such plant, I will explore the possibilities of a joint project with the Minister of Commerce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will consider abolishing the ESB special service charge in counties along the western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, the ESB are required to fix their charges for electricity <Col N="952" /> so that, taking one year with another, revenue will be sufficient to cover all proper charges against it.  Where a supply of electricity is provided in any area the Board are precluded from giving preferential treatment to any consumer in that area.</P>
      <P>I recognise, however, that, despite the generous State subsidy, some special service charges are extremely high.  The whole question is at present being reviewed to see whether any relief of general application can be granted but, at this stage, I cannot say what improvement, if any, can be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get a ray of hope from the Parliamentary Secretary as far as the special service charge is concerned.  Many people, particularly people in Galway, have asked me to approach the Department of Transport and Power regarding this problem.  I have done so but with little success.  If there is new legislation pending whereby these people could get an electricity supply without the special service charge, I would appeal to the Minister and to the Parliamentary Secretary to expedite such legislation as much as possible.</P>

      <P>The position at the moment is that 86 per cent of house-holders are supplied with electricity. That is quite a major step forward in the 25 years since the inception of rural electrification.  From that point of view, we can be assured that progress has been made.  It is as a result of a statement made by both the Minister and myself that this particular matter is being reviewed that these questions are being asked.  It was that statement that prompted these questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware of the need for the development of Wexford Harbour; and, if so, if he will be prepared to give generous aid for this purpose to meet any local proposals submitted to him by the Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation and development of Wexford Harbour is the statutory responsibility of Wexford Harbour Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The harbour has been closed to commercial traffic for the past five years because of heavy siltation on the bar and in the channel despite earlier substantial dredging with the aid of a large State grant.</P>
      <P>A number of schemes for reopening the harbour to commercial traffic have been examined but have been found technically to be unsound and disproportionately costly having regard to prospective trade at the harbour.</P>
      <P>Wexford county is already served by two good harbours at Rosslare and New Ross.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are always quite prepared to give sympathetic consideration to good proposals.  Wexford Harbour Commissioners had been asked to give a comprehensive report of expected traffic in the event of improvements being carried out but that improved traffic should not result in robbing the two harbours at Rosslare and New Ross.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary must be aware that freight traffic no longer exists in Rosslare and that this places Wexford Harbour in a much improved situation as compared with heretofore?  I mention that only because the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned Rosslare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs why five men who were working as temporary labourers at Monaghan head office were laid off work and others employed in their place, some of whom left other employment to take the places of the men laid off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Seven temporary labourers were laid off in Monaghan at the beginning of August, 1967, when the need for their services ceased. When more temporary labouring work became available in September, the employment exchange was approached in accordance with normal practice for nominations.  Of 13 men nominated, one did not attend for interview; seven of the remaining 12 were selected locally as the most suitable for the work and they were taken on as from 25th September.  One left after a few days and the next most suitable candidate nominated by the exchange was employed.  Three of the men who had been laid off in August were re-employed; the four who were not re-employed were regarded as less suitable for the work than the men selected.</P>
      <P>I understand that some of the men taken on in September were in other employment before being taken on as temporary labourers.  The fact that a man is in employment is not a barrier to his employment as temporary labourer provided he is nominated for the work by the local employment exchange.</P>

      <P>I am talking of five: here are five men put out of work because their jobs came to an end. The work recurred and the employment of labour became necessary again. These men applied to be re-employed. Some of them were taken back; some of them were not.  Then they were told that at least two&mdash;in fact, there were three or four&mdash;replaced them because the Department of Posts and Telegraphs had chosen them from a list of <Col N="958" /> names submitted by the employment exchange in Monaghan as suitable persons.  Is there any Deputy who does not believe that the function of the employment exchange is to submit to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs a list of unemployed persons seeking work?  I assert that two of these men left employment; I can name the firm in which they were working and I can name the men.</P>

In the case of Carrigans, a compulsory purchase order has been submitted to me and is at present being considered.

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands when the Land Commission propose to allocate the lands in their possession in the parish of Ahabog, County Monaghan, some of which have been going wild during the years they have been in their hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The lands in question consist of four separate properties, comprising some 250 acres, which were taken over by the Land Commission between May, 1965, and March, 1967.  I am aware that the lands are in need of rehabilitation and, to that end, substantial expenditure totalling £4,000 has been authorised for mole drainage, liming and manuring.  Until such time as this work has been carried out it is not possible to forecast when schemes of division can be planned.  It is expected that the work will be put in hands early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that some of the lands have been in the possession of the Land Commission for two years? Is he aware that this is a very congested area?  Some of the lands have <Col N="970" /> not even been let, not to mind divided. Can he say definitely that they will be divided not later than the financial year beginning 1st April next?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We can take it that, as all the land was acquired between 1965 and 1967, the Land Commission were probably waiting until they had it all acquired to deal with the division. As I pointed out, the land is in need of rehabilitation and I am sure that, when this work is done, the land will be divided as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider the desirability of preparing a scheme of allocation so that those who will ultimately get the land when it has been rehabilitated will have that sense of security, that their holdings are going to be enlarged, and which might induce them to carry on rather than abandon their uneconomic holdings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 44 to 46 together.</P>
      <P>The considerations which influenced the decision to decentralise the Departments of Education and Lands cannot be presented in mathematical terms as the matter was examined in the light of a number of important national considerations such as the need to redress the imbalance of population in the country and to revitalise the west of Ireland by action on a wide and imaginative scale.  The Departments of Education and Lands emerged as two Departments which, by reason of the nature of their work, were particularly suitable for transfer to a provincial location.  The selection of Athlone and Castlebar had regard to the Government's policy for regional development.</P>
      <P>The choice of Departments and provincial centres was a matter of extreme difficulty but the Government were convinced that no progress would be possible until a definite programme had been announced.  It is not possible at this stage to give the estimate of cost sought.  It should be borne in mind that these costs will be offset by the accommodation released in Dublin.</P>

      <P>There was traditionally an allowance for lounge amenities, which was a halfpenny or something per bottle, permissible where stout was served in the lounge.  Why does the Minister consider it expedient to make a special order in regard to the publicans of Clones any more than any other place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the publicans there as a group, with two exceptions as a result of visits from officials of my Department, had decided they were deliberately going to charge prices higher than those allowed under the prices control order.  This is the reason I made the order in question. The reason I made no distinction as between bar and lounge was that, as I said, the lack of co-operation was such that I was unable to get the details to enable me to make such distinction. I should add that in two cases publicans there informed me that they made no difference in the charges between the lounge and the public bar.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that such a differential normally exists? Would he not agree with me that it would be an abuse of his powers under the prices regulations machinery to impose a penalty on a particular town by depriving the publicans there of the customary differential on the ground that he was vexed at what he describes as their failure to collaborate?</P>

If there is any question of punishment, it is not the town of Clones that is being punished.  However, this is not my attitude; it is that the necessary information which would have enabled me to make the distinction which the Deputy wishes me to make was unavailable to me because the publicans in the town were not prepared to cooperate <Col N="983" /> with my inspector.  I have said I am prepared to review the matter but I shall, in reviewing the matter, require satisfactory undertakings that the publicans in Clones are prepared to comply with the order and to cease overcharging their customers.</P>

Or was the Minister's officer so dependent on the individual publicans that he could not find out?  Two publicans in the town are apparently collaborating; could he not get the information from them?

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point yesterday evening that our main concern in regard to the forced consequences of devaluation must be the effect it will have on our employment and the whole progress of our economy in future years.  The point this Party has been making is that the policy of this Government, its uncritical acceptance of utter dependence on the British economy, robs us of the benefits of a national monetary system which would give us a full employment situation. We have pointed out that, although it was necessary for Britain to devalue because of the problems of sterling throughout the world, our domestic needs did not call for such a course but that our dependence on Britain thrust such a course upon us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, in the future, we are to be given some manoeuvrability in this regard and not to be reduced to a sixty-second pursuit of a decision by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, we must have a second look at our monetary policy and we must, if possible, give to the public authorities some say in credit formation and we must give some say to our central banking system.  While the Central Bank, as <Col N="988" /> at present constituted, has some say in latter years in regard to credit in the country it has not the same powers as central banks in other European countries. We cannot say that it has comparable powers when the bank rate and such matters as that are completely outside its control.  Since we are in one money market with Britain, it is obvious our Central Bank can only follow and imitate policies in that country.  Therefore, we impose at the very start a very severe limitation on the functions of our Central Bank.</P>
    <P>When the British bank rate goes up, we must follow suit.  It is no argument to say that, in two recent instances when the bank rate in Britain changed, we did not follow it fractionally.  This cannot be claimed as an example of our independence of this policy in Britain.  If we are one capital market with Britain, one money market with Britain, our bank rate must keep pace with the British bank rate because this is the only way we can avoid Irish investors transferring their money to more lucrative outlets in Britain.  It is quite obvious that, when we accept complete mobility in money between Britain and here, we must keep parity even in our bank rate.</P>
    <P>This must reduce the role of any banking or monetary policy.  It must reduce it to keeping our interest rates in step with those of Britain.  It must deprive us of one great weapon in monetary policy.  The interest rates being charged by our banks have a very important bearing on the level of our economic activity.  If we deprive ourselves of the influence the State could have on these, we deprive ourselves of a great national weapon.</P>
    <P>It is time to consider once more the whole question of parity with the British £.  If, because of our complete dependence on the British economy, we have been forced to devalue because of an uncritical acceptance of the procedure in Britain we should at least take a lesson from this experience and attempt to understand our dilemma. We are in this dilemma because of our complete dependence on British financial decisions and institutions.  It <Col N="989" /> is time to take from the filing shelves the Report of the Banking Commission of 1938.  It is time to look at some of the minority reports of that Commission, the minority report of people like Professor Busteed, Professor O'Rahilly and Professor O'Brien.  I know that some of the economists of our own day are somewhat critical of the economists of that period but it would not be an intelligent appraisal of our situation to ignore the possibility that we should look once more at the relationship of our £ to the British £ and consider whether the creation of a money market entails some new look at the parity of our £ with the British £.</P>
    <P>While those minority reports may not be quite up to date in their realisation of all the limitations of our economic position, at the same time they point to very serious problems in this country.  Overall, the report of that commission, accepted, too uncritically perhaps, the situation they had inherited of having a sort of follow-the-leader aspect in regard to British monetary policy.  We should look at those minority reports and see what can be done.  We must get some kind of control procedure to prevent capital movements out of the country.</P>
    <P>In the minority report, one of the professors remarked that this was a weird country to live in and said:</P>
    <P>Short of capital for ourselves, we have to keep £230 million invested in another country; and our economists turn pale with fear at the thought that they may be utilising some of these claims&mdash;accumulated from exports not paid for by imports&mdash;to develop our own country.  We have on hands an immense work of development, long overdue after centuries of neglect and misrule; yet, by some inscrutable decree, we have to ship off our manhood to work as navvies for another country. </P>
    <P>They point out the contradiction of large investments of money in Britain over which the Government have no control and the complete freedom to invest capital in Britain both on the short term and the long term.  We <Col N="990" /> could also look at no better authority than <i>Progressio Populorum</i>, the Papal Encyclical which referred to the social attitude of people who invest money abroad when their own country needs it.  There is no need for any great ideological fervour to the right of the Left to claim that there should be control over capital movements but it is essential that some control should be held over the capital movement of money.  There is an old economic decree that where the capital goes the labour follows and if we allow Irish capital to be invested in Britain we cannot be surprised if Irishmen and Irishwomen follow that investment. There must be some control over the right of capital to go to areas of highest return.  We must ask our institutions which invest their surplus in Britain and elsewhere to consider that they have a social obligation to a larger community than their shareholders. They have an obligation to the entire community.</P>
    <P>We need a cheap credit policy and if the position in Britain is that they need policies of deflation and have needed them over the past three years why should this country follow a course that does not suit our requirements? One can ask what is the use of esoteric exercises in economic planning if we ignore the large picture of our entire dependence on Britain. There is no point in having a National Industrial Economic Council if the State continues to accept this dependence on Britain.  Obviously we cannot control our interest rates and obviously we lose our grip and our control over economic affairs when we continue to allow the situation of complete <i>laissez faire</i> to continue between this country and Britain.  We need a massive injection of capital and not a further flight of capital from the country.</P>
    <P>As I say, this does not call for any particular political commitment.  Such a suggestion that we should do something about creating these institutional requirements has been recorded already in several economic exercises published recently by the Economic and Social Research Institute calling for such an arrangement for this country whereby the capital needed for short-term <Col N="991" /> investment purposes would be made available by the State to bring about a situation in which people would not have to go to the money market to which most of our investors go, the City of London.  The State should have some control over externally invested capital to make sure that some of this capital is channelled into investment opportunities at home.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that this was a businesslike decision and he was at pains to point out that it was not what we said it is, an action that followed automatically from our utter dependence on the British economic position.  The Minister says it was a businesslike decision and he mentioned some other countries that took the same course.  He neglected to say that, in the case of Spain, the Government had been considering devaluation and that the British Government did the Spanish Government a good turn by devaluing at this time.  The position in New Zealand is exceptional because it is a storer of wool.  A great deal of speculation against wool went on in recent months.  Such a course was forced on them.  The economic position of Israel has been cited for some time by experts as adding up to an artificial entity in economic terms.  It was described by one journal as an economy chronically subject to devaluation.  We will not go so far as the Fiji Islands or suggest what forced a devaluation on them.</P>
    <P>In all cases these countries can cite valid domestic reasons as to why devaluation was a course they would be adopting.  I would suggest that our own domestic reasons did not call for such a course and I would say that it is straining the logic of the situation to suggest that what the British Government did we can now quote as something that answered particularly our requirements.</P>
    <P>We have pointed out that it will be extremely important in the situation arising from devaluation that we look at this cost of living that will certainly be figuring in a lot of discussions in the months ahead.  We know that the British Chancellor and the British <Col N="992" /> Prime Minister, in their discussions of this matter of devaluation and in their statements, have made quite clear their intention of freezing dividends at the pre-devaluation rate.  I do not know if there are any such statements going to be made in this House or whether, again, since we are one money market with Britain, we are just leaving the situation to continue, willy-nilly, to take its own course but they have suggested that dividends will be frozen and that they would look very carefully at any rise in dividends.</P>
    <P>The position as regards wages and the cost of living affecting the majority of the people in this country is that, even before devaluation, such has been the erosion in living standards, there would have had to be, devaluation or no devaluation, some compensatory increase given to the vast majority of working people in the early months of 1968 and, in fact, before devaluation was heard of, unions in this country were already consulting with their members up and down the country to determine what kind of movement should be made for increased wages. Therefore, it would be hypocritical to suggest, now that the cost of living is increasing quite artificially and as a result of measures beyond the control of this Government, that people up and down the country should accept even more sacrifices because of circumstances beyond their control when, in fact, they were moving towards a compensatory position in regard to their wages.  It would be unrealistic to expect such a reaction from these people and it would be quite impossible for the unions at this time to call for restraint from their members.  A movement on their part was inevitable at this time.</P>
    <P>But we will have to keep a very sharp eye on the people best situated to profit from the present situation, the people whose profits in our situation are not subject to the controls that wage-and salary-earners are subject to One can tell to a &ldquo;t&rdquo; the amount of a wage or salary that the taxation people can siphon off, to the farthing what exactly is owed by each wage or salary earner, but, when it comes to business elements, they are not in a position to extract what should be got from these <Col N="993" /> people in taxation.  Nobody is better equipped to do well out of devaluation than the person of property and wealth in this country.  In fact, it is no secret that there are quite a number of people in this country, possibly in the realm of a few thousands, who have made substantial sums of money out of the recent devaluation by the British Chancellor.  I should like to know how many Irish nationals holding sterling in London have over the last few weeks transferred to another currency in expectation of speculation in sterling? How much money has been made by Irish nationals involved in this exercise of devaluation?  In fact, it has been the &ldquo;in&rdquo; talk in Irish business circles in the last few weeks as to what switches they have made in their investments and how many thousands have been made by this or that individual.</P>
    <P>We may well ask what crazy system it is that can reduce the standard of living of the majority of the people of a country while giving windfall fortunes to people who have merely to sign their names to a form transferring from one shareholder to another.  What intelligence or rationality is there in a system which allows this kind of spendthrift speculation as a means for accumulating wealth?  How can we call for planning when we see such windfall fortunes falling to people whose only exercise was to sign their name at the bottom of a form supplied by some broker?  This is the situation we are talking about and this is the kernel of this crazy system that my Party believe we must bring an intelligent approach to bear on and subject to public policy and scrutiny.</P>
    <P>In this situation, obviously, we cannot expect the majority of the people who now face a misfortune fallen from the skies through the agency of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer to accept a standstill or freeze in their wages over the next year or two.  It would be unrealistic.  The Minister has responsibility for economic planning. While we may be preoccupied in this debate with the matter of devaluation, he is responsible for employment and economic planning.  The Second Programme at this point in time is, as we <Col N="994" /> know, statistically in ruins on the growth rate, on the employment targets. This is a programme whose chief value now to us is in seeing by how much and by how many thousands we missed the targets and objectives.  The most useful thing we can do is to attempt to learn what went wrong, why the programme did not achieve the targets expected of it, and start afresh. Accepting the limitations of our monetary policy and Government economic policy, if we accept the limitations of being, a secondary economy with that of the British and if we accept that our economy can only do well on a kind of surplus from the British economy, then, realistically, we can only hope for improvement to come at the end of a British boom every four or five years. I do not think we need take this forever as a constraint on our economic planning but, realistically, this would be the experience of recent exercises in economic programming.  For the first year of that Second Programme we achieved a growth rate of 4.5 per cent. In 1965, we achieved a growth rate of 2.5 per cent.</P>

      <P>Well, we will split the difference&mdash;five per cent in 1964 and 2.5 per cent in the following year. In 1966, we come down to something like 1.1 per cent and it is expected that in 1967 we will be back to a position of something around four per cent. The economy which does not register some improvement has come to a full stop and you could explain the increase in 1967 as being, at least, a somewhat limited recovery on the near failure in the previous two years as regards targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the decade from 1960 to 1970, the OECD initially described this as a period of growth and expected of <Col N="995" /> its member countries that they would have an increase of 50 per cent in real terms in the gross national product&mdash; an increase annually of 5 per cent.  At the half-way stage where does the Irish economy stand in this league over those ten years?  In fact, we occupied the second last place in the years 1965.  That was the position of the Irish economy at that point.  The country below us is Britain.  At this point the average growth rate over these five years in our case is 3.8 per cent and below us is Britain with 3.3 per cent and the OECD average for these five years is a something like 4.9 per cent.  This is a pretty sorry record and this record, considered in the context of the kind of economic planning we have carried on, proves more eloquently than any Opposition argument, because OECD has no particular animus against or dislike of this Government, that our planning procedures have categorically failed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can select his own figures.  These are the ones taken out of OECD.  We are second last in Europe.  For too long we have accepted the position uncritically of being a secondary economy.  We react to every change in the metropolitan economy across the water because it is a metropolitan economy from the point of view of our relationship with Britain and our economy ends in being a regional or peripheral economy if we continue our present course.  So long as we accept that situation, so long will we go on accepting the crumbs of Britain's prosperity, when there is prosperity.  We have no control.  So long as there is depression and deflation in Britain, so long will our position be that much worse.  When there is even a limited prosperity in Britain, there will be a certain fractional increase on this side to coincide possibly with fantastic claims for prosperity and success achieved here on the Government's part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment position is most alarming.  I know the Minister will claim there has been an increase in <Col N="996" /> employment but, whatever figures may be introduced later, as at this moment there is an overall drop of 14,000 in those at work.  In agriculture, in which there was a projected increase of 15,300, the actual drop is in the order of 32,000.</P>

      <P>There has been a drop between 1964 and 1966.  Looking at the field of economic planning, on the figures available, we must accept, remembering the targets set out for achievement, that the first two programmes have failed.  It is not sufficient to argue <i>ad infinitum</i> that every failure must be the basis of a fresh alibi.  The situation is too serious to look for alibis.  We must try to understand the causes for the failures and remedy those causes.  It is no answer to suggest that we should delay the Third Programme until we know how our EEC expectations may turn out or what we may expect exactly from EEC <Col N="997" /> membership.  One can argue that we will be in the EEC later rather than sooner&mdash;I suggest we should consider a period of something like five to six years before we tie ourselves up in any relationship with the EEC.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that our application is tied to that of Britain because of our secondary economy relationship with Britain.  It is equally clear that it will be quite some years before there is any kind of tangible relationship formed between this country and the EEC.  In these circumstances, we cannot delay declaring what steps we propose to take in the matter of economic planning. My advice is scrap the remainder of the Second Programme.  I know it is supposed to continue until 1970 but, if the targets are not being achieved, then the programme has no relationship to reality.  Scrap it.</P>
      <P>Now is the time to take stock and find out exactly what we have to do-and what targets we should set ourselves. We must decide overall before we start on any new approach.  We must declare&mdash;this is something we have not done so far&mdash;a strategy of industrial development.  There has been no really deep Government examination on the kind of industrial development and the kind of industrial investment we need.  There has been a policy of establishing a factory, say, for the manufacture of rolling-pins in one area and a factory for the manufacture of washing boards in another, without any proper overall consideration of integrated economic regional development.  Artificial industrial islands have been established in rural solitudes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ensure that our industrial development programme is one interrelated to overall economic development. Entire regions must be linked up in such development.  The State must take on the role of an investment corporation.  It must not stand idly by and see its role as merely one of handing out skilful doles to this private enterprise or that private enterprise.  It is no secret that this Party believe private enterprise has failed.  We point to the total lack of achievement by private enterprise.  We suggest that a great deal of State <Col N="998" /> money is at present being poured into private enterprise to bolster up this mistaken reliance which could more usefully be employed in proper economic planning and development by the State.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why the State should not play a greater part in mineral development?  Why should the State stand aside seeing its role merely as one of accepting royalties while external interests reap the real rewards? Some years ago nobody thought there were any important minerals in this country.  That alone is evidence of criminal neglect on the part of successive Governments in exploring the mineral resources of the country and assessing their value.  Our mineral wealth was discovered practically by accident and not until we had leased almost the entire country to foreign mineral companies.  Is there any reason why the State should not invest in such areas?  This whole policy must be re-examined.</P>
    <P>This management to which we entrust so much money for so many enterprises up and down the country has been condemned by their own institute.  The level of training and management in Irish industry is poor and the decisions must follow the same pattern.  Yet the State entrusts the tax-payers' money to enterprises that do not apparently repay that kind of trust. While the hope, in doing so, may be that extra employment will follow and that the community in general will benefit, it seems to me that experience of the record of many of these enterprises does not give much confidence for the future.  Many of them have a death wish and are waiting for takeover bids by one cross-Channel company or another.  We must cast a cold eye indeed on Irish industrial development and decide where to start afresh. A severely practical approach is needed.  Various governments, by no means politically motivated by socialist principles, were forced to start industries in certain areas.  The plight of the community cries out for new responsibility by the State.  No longer can the State be regarded as a milch cow by a private enterprise system which has failed to develop and expand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> There is no point in having economic planning in this country unless we take on some of the responsibilities of the sovereignty we are always at pains to say we still have.  Though we may doubt the extent of such sovereignty and realise its limitations nevertheless we still have some.  While having such sovereignty&mdash;on paper, at any rate&mdash; there is not reason why we should not should some of its responsibility.  No Government in this country can stand by in a caretaker capacity in conditions of freer trade and greater competition. Our Minister for Finance should not be reduced to the stature to which he was reduced in the past week of being merely the call-boy of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We must give greater control to our Central Bank over the banking interest in this country.  We must somehow qualify the position whereby, in the past, we have been merely one money market with Great Britain.  The Irish investor has not a divine right to transfer his money to any part of the globe where he can get the highest return.</P>

      <P>The Minister understands my point about having one money market with Britain.  It does not give an Irish Minister for Finance much opportunity of getting his teeth into some policy which he might consider necessary in the interests of the Irish economy.  If we do not take steps <Col N="1000" /> to remedy these very serious defects then we are doomed in advance.  Our economic planning programmes will be merely esoteric economic exercises, with no relevance to the economic condition of the country, unless the publicly-controlled economic authority has some control over the credit facilities available in the State.  The Central Bank has some control but it must be given wider control.</P>
      <P>I accept that there must be some inter-dependence between one country and another but I know of no country which has such utter and complete dependence on another economy as we have.  We must find some way out of this utter dependence.</P>

      <P>We wish to break some of the public complacency generated with such competence by members of this Government on public media so that it will clearly be understood by everybody that we are not embarking on a Roman holiday and that the next few months will be rather a tough period for us all, due to circumstances beyond our control.  We must examine our position of complete parity with the British £.  We should get a value which is true to Irish conditions for the Irish £.  It may not be in the best interests of this country to accept that it should be a permanent arrangement that our £ should have utter parity with the British £ which, in the past, has been merely for commercial convenience.  I would ask the Minister to depart if possible from clichés in this matter in his reply.  Even if we must stray out of an area in which we may not be absolutely skilled, and no Deputy, I am sure, is an expert on higher finance, we have a duty to look at the facts and, however naïve our ideas may be to consider the problems.  There is little relevance in having a Parliament <Col N="1001" /> if we do not discuss our most important economic issues.  I will be looking forward to the Minister's reply tonight and I hope he will treat the suggestion seriously of looking for more independence in the monetary sphere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether or not I am right in thinking that the Minister was being sensitive to the suggestion that we might not have acted quite as independently as possibly some of us would have wished when he inquired from Deputy O'Leary whether or not he had touched on the position of Denmark in his review of countries which have devalued. There are a number of questions which arise from the Government's decision to devalue, questions which arises regardless of the Government's position from an independence point of view or not.  Some of these questions have already been posed to the Minister and, at the risk of boring him, I want to repeat some of them because it is important that these questions should be asked and that they should be answered.</P>
      <P>The first question that arises in connection with devaluation is whether or not devaluation of our currency by the same amount as sterling was in fact the best possible course to adopt and, if so, why.  Another question arises as to what extent there was an examination by the Minister and the Government of the alternatives involved, what were the alternatives involved and what advice did the Minister and the Government get in relation to whatever alternative courses might have been open.  The Minister in opening this debate referred to weighing-up the pros and cons and he said that, having weighed the pros and cons of alternative courses of action, they had decided it would be a serious disadvantage to the economy to disturb the existing parity with sterling.  He then referred to the free choice of the Government and he said that the decision to devalue was the free choice of the Government, after careful consideration of the various alternative courses of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister, and Deputy O'Leary has already touched on this topic: is it not a fact that the <Col N="1002" /> free choice to which the Minister refers was in fact very must more apparent than real and that that is so because of matters to which the Minister referred both in his opening statement and in replies to supplementary questions on the 22nd of this month?  I want to suggest that, by reason of the fact, as the Minister himself has pointed out, that we are legally obliged as the law stands at present to maintain parity with sterling, there was not in fact any very great freedom of choice open to the Government; that whatever free choice was available, whatever exercise of weighing-up the pros and cons took place, it must have been within a very limited framework indeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister, apparently on the assumption that defence is the best method of attack, both in reply to the Parliamentary Question to which I have referred and in his opening statement on this debate, seemed to feel that, if there was to be any criticism of the Government's action, the best thing to do was to try to turn that on the critics and to say to them that devaluation had been in the air for months, that it had been under the surface for some time and that, if anyone wanted a situation to be created here where the Government would have a free hand, where they would be their own masters in coming to their own decisions for the benefit of the country, then it was the job of the critics to raise the matter and presumably to seek amending legislation.  That argument does not impress me in the slightest. Whenever the Government are dealling with farmers who want to effect a change in Government policy, or dealing with trade unionists who want to seek better conditions for any section of the workers, then the Government's attitude is that it is the Government's responsibility to govern and that they are not going to abdicate that position for the sake of any section of the people.  If any Opposition Deputy or anyone else had suggested in the past few months that action should be taken by the Government to amend legislation in order to free the hands of the Minister for Finance and the Government in relation to the equality of our £ with sterling, I wonder what attention <Col N="1003" /> would have been paid by the Minister and the Government to that request.</P>

If it is the Government's job to govern in relation to some matters, it is certainly their job to govern in relation to this matter.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at least to free their hands so that they might be in a position to take another decision, if it were to the advantage of the country to take it?  It would at least have inspired a certain amount of confidence if the Government, when they knew devaluation was bobbing along under the surface, were at least to unlock the door that had enclosed this Government and this country in a situation where, as I say, any choice they could exercise was more apparent than real.  I am not at all impressed by the defensive manoeuvre, as it seems <Col N="1004" /> to me, of the thinking which inspired the Minister for Finance to say, as reported at column 469 of the Dáil Debates of the 22nd November:</P>
      <P>We are following Britain in devaluting. Deputies should realise that the statute law of this country is that parity must be maintained between our £ and sterling.  We have no option, as the law stands, but to devalue fully in accordance with the British devaluation.  This question of devaluation has been in the air for many months now.  Any Deputy who wished could have come along at any time in the past four, five or six months and suggested that we change the law.  It is a bit late to come along now and talk in that strain.</P>
      <P>There was a similar reference in the Minister's opening statement when he said:</P>
      <P>Anyone who now wishes to criticise the Government's action in devaluing should bear in mind that they could have raised the question of a change in our exchange arrangements well in advance.</P>
      <P>I would be interested in knowing what reception any such suggestion would have got from the Government. The Minister has indicated in an intervention here, unless I have taken him up wrongly, that the decision of the Government would have been the same in any event.  Consequently, it is reasonable to say if that suggestion had been made it would not have been received with any great heed by the Government.  Accepting the fact that we are obliged legally by our own law to maintain parity with sterling and having regard to the fact that the possibility of devaluation, to put it no stronger than that, was at or nears the surface for the past five or six months, either the Government failed to appreciate the need to take action by way of amending legislation to free the hands of the Minister and the Government or else they deliberately chose not to free their hands.</P>

      <P>Be that as it may, I disagree with the Minister.  I want to ask him clearly now does he intend to act on the suggestion which has now been made.  The Minister has pointed out that this decision has been taken and the pound devalued, whether for good or ill.  We can now look at the situation created by the existing legislation without any possibility of the panic the Minister spoke of being created.  Will the Minister let us know unequivocally in the course of this debate whether, now that this suggestion has been made in a serious way from these benches, is it the intention of the Government to act on it?</P>
      <P>In the course of his opening statement, the Minister said there was nothing to recommend devaluation greater than the amount of devaluation done by the British.  He said to do this would raise doubts about the basic soundness of our economy and cause a loss of confidence.  I see the validity of those remarks.  But, now that the decision has been taken, I would again say to the Minister that a show of confidence on the part of the Government, a bit of independent action in relation to this matter, might be of assistance to us in the future.</P>
      <P>The decision having been taken, really all we can do in this debate is to consider the possible effects of the decision.  The Minister was reported in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 19th November as saying he could see no reason why the cost of living should be affected here as a result of the devaluation of the pound by Britain.  I do not know whether the Minister when he made that remark was talking without consideration or not.  In any event, in opening the discussion here he said:</P>
      <P>It is too early to weigh up exactly the impact of devaluation on our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> Here we have what I presume is, firstly, an off-the-cuff view of the Minister, that he sees no reason why the cost of living should be affected here by the British devaluation.  Then, having had an opportunity of considering the matter further and preparing his speech for opening this debate, the Minister says it is too early to weigh up exactly the impact of devaluation on our economy.  I have already referred to the Minister's statement, and the reiteration of that statement, that devaluation has been in the air for months.  If that is so, I would have thought that, when devaluation first became a prospect, the Minister would have endeavoured to assess the situation, that he would have sought advice as to the possible consequences of devaluation on our economy and on the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister was any detailed assessment or examination of the possible consequences made during those months when the Minister himself says, that devaluation was in the air, and, if it was not made, why was it not made.  Why is the Minister put in a position, as soon as devaluation is announced, of saying he sees no reason why it should affect the cost of living?  Why is he put in a position that, introducing what he knows is going to be a discussion on devaluation in the Irish Parliament, he has to say that it is too early to weigh up exactly the effect of devaluation on our economy?  The Minister, on his own case, has had several months in which to get an assessment made of the effects of devaluation.  Why was that not done?  If it was done, will the Minister give us the results of the assessment and the examination?</P>

      <P>We know that very well in the context of the Second Programme.  If the Minister wants to draw me on that, I can speak on it.  Surely the Minister should give us the results of the assessment, if it was made, or is the Minister saying that no such assessment was made? <Col N="1008" /> If it was not made, was the Minister or the Government asleep for the past six months?</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will.  I am not asking for an <i>ad hoc,</i> off-the-cuff, assessment made since devaluation.  What I am asking the Minister is whether or not during the past six months when, to his knowledge and to the knowledge of the Government devaluation was just under the surface, any assessment was made then, or whether any effort was made by the Government seriously to assess the situation, what advice the Minister got, and will he give us the benefit of that advice and the result of the assessment.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, the position is that we are still guessing.  The Minister has made what is presumable an informed guess when he thinks that the overall effect of devaluation on the price level here will be in the region of two per cent.  I heard an estimate from another source yesterday, that, within six months or so&mdash;I think the time stipulated was by May next&mdash;the cost of living will have risen by about five per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may not accept that but I think it is relevant to point out that there is roughly a five per cent increase in the cost of living associated with every year of existence of the present Fianna Fáil Government, that every year there is a Fianna Fáil Government in existence the people are paying by an increase of five per cent in the cost of living.  I do not think it is unreasonable to assume that that pattern will continue and that this year will see an increase again of at least five per cent in the cost of living.  Of course that has enormous consequences for the people.  It does not matter to the person to whom hardship is caused whether the increase in the cost of living is as a result of devaluation or as a result of other factors, but, if there is an increase of five per cent in the cost of living, it means that, so far <Col N="1009" /> as the items in the cost of living index are concerned, the workers' pay packet is worth five per cent less, that everyone is five per cent worse off.  I do not think the Minister will argue against that point of view.</P>
    <P>I heard an example being given here yesterday with regard to the effect of the erosion of money values on housing grants.  It is well that we should keep that kind of practical example in mind. As I recall it, it was mentioned that the housing grant, the grant which was first fixed in 1948 to encourage people to build their own houses, was fixed at a figure of £275 and that recently, as a result of the combined operations of the turnover tax and the wholesale tax, in respect of what nowadays would be regarded as an average costing for a private house, in the region of £4,000, £150 of that grant is recaptured by the Exchequer.  Therefore, the net remaining grant is £125, and that is not taking into account the further erosions in money values that have being going on all the time.  I think it is true to say that, within the past decade since Fianna Fáil came back as a Government in 1957, the increase in the cost of living has been in the region of 40 per cent; that, for every £100 it cost them to live then, it now costs them £40 more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making when the Minister first interrupted me some time ago was in relation to the value of housing grants. These were fixed in 1948 at £275.  It has been estimated, as I indicated to the Minister, that just two Fianna Fáil efforts, the turnover tax and the wholesale tax, have reduced the value of these grants by £150, so that, if no question of other taxation were involved, if no other erosion were involved, if no other increase in the cost of living were involved, the Exchequer has already recaptured £150 on the average house in respect of those grants.  That is a situation which the Minister and the Government must look at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> It has been suggested from these benches&mdash;and I want to support the suggestion&mdash;that one way the Government could deal with this situation, and alleviate it, is by subsidising interest rates in relation to house purchase.  As I understand the position, this grant was made available because of the acute need for houses at the time, a need which&mdash;and I think Deputy Fitzpatrick, as a Dublin Deputy, will agree with me on this&mdash;has by no means diminished since and is just as acute this year&mdash;perhaps not just as acute but it is still a very acute need&mdash; and, in order to encourage people to build their own houses by means of their own resources, their own efforts and diligence with the assistance of building society loans or bank loans, they were given what was called a bonus, by the State.  The value of that grant has now been whittled away to practically nothing.  Interest rates have gone up in the meantime, and gone up enormously.  As a result of this devaluation, even bank rates have gone up.  A number of these people may have been afforded bank accommodation which enabled them in their particular circumstances not to rely on building society loans.  As I say, the Minister must watch this situation and must deal with it.  One way of doing that is by subsidising loans for housing purposes.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the cost of living, devaluation will have other effects.  I am not sufficiently expert in this field to talk with any great authority on them but it has been mentioned that there is a danger of an adverse effect on the balance of payments.  The position there as I understand it is that we import from non-devaluing countries about one and a half times more than we export to them.  In that situation there is, to put it mildly, at least a danger of an adverse effect on the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the effect on the cost of living and the bringing about of price increases and, of course, all that constitutes a danger to a further depressing of our economy.  Suggestions to meet that situation have been put forward from these benches.  There was the suggestion of subsidising interest <Col N="1013" /> rates as I have mentioned; a suggestion that the Government should cut the duty on petrol; that they should cut the duty on tobacco and that they should improve social welfare payments. These are matters of practical importance which it is open to the Government to carry out.  Their hands are not tied in this respect.  They are not tied by legislation.  Here they have a choice which is real in every sense.  It is a choice which the Government are in a position to exercise.  If they choose not to do them, then these things will not be done.  It is open to the Government to do them: the choice and the decision rest with them.  That is all I propose to say on the question of devaluation.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words with regard to another matter of topical importance to which the Minister referred in his opening statement, that is, the question of decentralisation.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to refer to decentralisation. The House is already aware from the Taoiseach's announcement on 16th November, 1967, that it has been decided that the headquarters work of the Department of Education be transferred to Athlone and that of the Department of Lands to Castlebar.</P>
    <P>Neither in theory nor in practice am I opposed to decentralisation but I do think it is of paramount importance that in any decision or any operation of this kind there should be proper and effective consultation with those who are affected by the decision.</P>
    <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question today, the Minister referred to consultation having taken place.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong in this but I think it was with the staff associations of the members of the service involved, in any event presumably with some representative body.  In reply to a supplementary question put to him by me, the Minister was frank enough to make it clear that the consultation of which he was speaking took place only immediately preceding the Taoiseach's announcement of the Government's decision.  I want to say that I do not regard that as effective consultation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I am complaining about.  It is only starting now after the announcement was made, after fears and anxieties have been created.  As I say, I am not against decentralisation either in theory or in practice but the proper way in which the Government should have moved in this connection&mdash;and I am not trying to select as between one Department and another as to which should be moved, although there is room for argument there&mdash;was first of all to make a clear decision and announcement setting the target for the implementation of the decision some number of years ahead so that there would be time for all the preliminary work to be done and for all sorts of complications that are bound to arise to be ironed out and sorted out.  Until the effective consultation that I have spoken of had taken place there should not have been an announcement by the Government of anything more than a decision in principle, and, the decision in principle having been taken and having been announced, the consultation would then take place in an atmosphere which would be fruitful, which would bring about the maximum amount of goodwill and the maximum amount of co-operation.  As things are, I think the Government have succeeded in raising a lot of fears and a lot of anxieties.  That situation should have been avoided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>In the main, the debate has been on the subject of devaluation.  I am rather surprised at some of the points made by Opposition speakers, such as loss of independence, and so on, but no Opposition Deputy has been strong enough to say that we should not have devalued.  Opposition Deputies like criticising but they do not like suggesting alternatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the reasonable approach to this matter.  At least 60 per cent of <Col N="1015" /> our trade is with Great Britain, a country that has devalued her currency. Our manufacturing industries and our cattle trade would be placed at a grave disadvantage if our goods had to be sold on the British market at a lower price.  A year ago, when cattle prices were low, we heard a great deal about it.  A somewhat similar position would obtain now if we did not devalue our currency.  Industry would be placed at a disadvantage and would have to look for new markets.  We all realise how difficult it is to obtain alternative markets and can imagine the expense involved in publicity and market research. This country would suffer severely for at least a period of two or three years if we did not devalue.  It was a matter of commonsense to follow the British decision and the Minister and the Government are to be complimented on having their mind made up and being in a position to say immediately what they would do, once Britain had made the announcement on Saturday 18th, so that we would not have here the situation which arose in Hong Kong where the Government devalued at 14.3 per cent and, within less than a week, had to revalue the currency.  It is a very good thing to have a Government who know where they are going and who can make proper decisions at the right time.</P>
    <P>When the Free Trade Area Agreement was made two years ago, a good deal of criticism was expressed by the Opposition but there is not a word of criticism about it now because the advantages accruing to the country are apparent.  It should be remembered that it took quite a long time to get the Agreement through.  It is a function of a Government to foresee advantages to be derived from a trade agreement or in other spheres of activity.  Only time can show the advantages derived by this country from the Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins criticised the Minister for not announcing devaluation first in this House.  In my view, the Minister was perfectly correct in appearing on television and letting the people know the position.  It would be <Col N="1016" /> the wish of the people that the Minister should make such an announcement on television and not wait until the Dáil assembled on the following Wednesday to make the announcement.  From what one can gather, devaluation will have advantages for this country, particularly for our exporting industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to a rise in the cost of living.  The cost of living has been creeping up in every country in the world.  In Europe, the standard of living has been rising.  It is better to have a slight rise in the cost of living than to have the position that obtained in 1951 and in 1956 when the Opposition were in power.</P>

      <P>We can see the results today of good government and good management over the past few years. With regard to devaluation, even though we have had to devalue we have not been compelled to adopt the same credit restriction and austerity as Britain has.  That is because our economy is healthy and we have a trading surplus.  Had the bank rate not been increased, there would have been an outflow of capital from this country. We increased the rate but we kept it at a figure something lower than the British rate.  An outflow of capital would adversely affect our economy. We increased the bank rate as the lesser of two evils and no doubt the rate will be lowered again in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins bewailed the turnover tax and its effects on housing grants.  He did not see fit to mention that housing grants have increased by 50 per cent since the introduction of the turnover tax for the assistance of small farmers and others. The increased grant more than compensates for any small increase that might occur as a result of the turnover tax.  It has always been the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government to help the less fortunate members of our society.  That typical example would not have come to my mind had not Deputy O'Higgins refreshed my memory.  I compliment the Minister on taking the action he has taken and on making a clear, quick decision.</P>

      <P>As far as I am aware, the only difference is that on that occasion the devaluation was substantially greater, roughly double what it is at the moment.  What the House and the country are really interested in now is getting from the Government some definite statement of the precise effects of devaluation on our economy. When the Minister spoke on radio and television immediately after the British announcement&mdash;I thought myself the timing was rather stage-managed&mdash;he gave the impression that everything would be just the same even after devaluation had occurred.  The overall impression created by all his public utterances and by his speech introducing the Estimate for his Department yesterday was that devaluation would have very little effect.  That particular reaction does not tally with the reaction of commentators, commentators who are not politicians, with regard to devaluation.  It does not tally with the reaction of people who have no political axe to grind.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason that we question the alarmingly complacent attitude of the Government.  What is alarming is the self-satisfied approach, the bland assumption that everything will continue as before.  That contrasts sharply with the general concern expressed in Britain, a concern not confined to the Labour Government but shared by the Opposition and echoed by every reputable financial journal and press commentator who expressed views on the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Devaluation will affect this country in a number of ways.  It will hit our balance of payments, although that may not be the most serious consequence, because our imports from non-devaluing countries will cost more and perhaps <Col N="1019" /> they are half as big again as our exports to such countries.  Our money will buy less and therefore it will increase the cost of commodities such as timber, which is essential for building. Already, firms have been notified by suppliers that timber prices will rise. Public notification has been given that coal imports from certain sources will be affected in cost: likewise, oil imports, imported feedingstuffs and fertilisers.</P>
    <P>Devaluation has an insidious effect. Its influence, in most cases, is not immediately felt.  A Budget decision to raise the price of a pint of stout, a glass of whiskey or a gallon of petrol becomes effective immediately and is immediately felt by the consumer.  It is different in the case of devaluation.  The consumer does not feel the immediate impact and, when it does make its impact, the people forget that the increased cost is due to devaluation and attribute it to some other factor.  The inescapable fact is that, due to devaluation, the commodities I have mentioned will, sooner or later&mdash;some sooner than others&mdash;increase in price.  Naturally, the lower-paid workers are the people most likely to be affected as well as social welfare recipients and persons on fixed incomes.  Their position is worsening as a result of an increase in the cost of living, due to devaluation, and naturally it is with that situation we are most concerned.</P>
    <P>A mathematical calculation of a 2 or 3 per cent rise in the cost of living is never borne out by events.  A chain reaction is set in motion which affects the cost of living and results in price increases, in the main exceeding the actual mathematical calculation.  When devaluation occurred in 1949, the cost of living remained relatively stable for 12 months: there was then a very competent Government in office here.</P>

      <P>Over and above that, there were lower import prices and the problem being created for the British Government was entirely different in many respects from the present problem. <Col N="1020" /> There were then price rises resulting from the Korean war.</P>
      <P>It is essential, in the circumstances of today, to get some indication of Government thinking in relation to devaluation.  For the past two years, we have experienced a severe credit restriction which has operated for longer than was necessary and which was not eased until the Economic Research Institute and critical comment by some Members of this House forced the Government to take action in respect of hire purchase. That form of incentive is no longer available.  I understand that certain easements in hire purchase arrangements were announced in September, although the Economic Research Institute had recommended a considerable time earlier that action be taken to stimulate the economy and, from the point of view of the ordinary businessman, trader or individual, to get it moving again from the depressing situation which had operated as a result of an unnecessary form of restriction which had depressed our economy to such an extent that, over the preceding period or in the earlier part of this year, there was a substantial increase in the numbers on the unemployment register seeking work. Therefore, so far as this country is concerned, the stimulus which could be provided by an easement in hire purchase restrictions is no longer available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take interest rates.  Because of British interest rates, we no longer have available to us the incentive of having a much lower interest rate. Some credit has been taken for the fact that this country operates at a one per cent differential at present compared with Great Britain.  It is well that credit for that decision should be given to Deputy Sweetman who was the first Minister for Finance to introduce that decision, which has since been followed.  Apparently, the previous speaker had not heard of it.  The only way, therefore, in which this country can be got moving again is by direct Government action in the way of reducing taxation and easing the burden on large sections of the community <Col N="1021" /> who have felt the effect of a rise in taxation on a wide variety of commodities, particularly commodities such as petrol, oil, spirits, beer, and so on.  This appears, at the moment, to be the only way in which some expansion can be generated in the economy.</P>
    <P>It is true that it is hoped that, because of certain action in Britain, some benefits will flow to this country. It is well to examine that matter.  One of the criticisms expressed by the Economic Research Institute is that when action was taken here either by the Central Bank or by the Department of Finance it was taken too long after it was required and, in most cases, was too little and too late.  Very severe restrictive financial measures now operate in Britain and, in certain ways, we can expect to gain from that policy.  In fact, the conclusion that has been drawn by a number of observers of the British scene is that they have endeavoured to operate two policies simultaneously which are mutually contradictory.  They have endeavoured to deflate the economy and inflate or operate an expansionist incentive.  Indeed, some commentators in quite reputable financial journals have expressed the view that it may not be possible to do this successfully.  Only time will show which of these will prove the more decisive.  The Minister suggested that this was well known for a considerable time and what we want to know is, if this was anticipated for the length of time which the Government appear to indicate it was, what action was taken to cushion ourselves against or to forestall the consequence of this action.</P>
    <P>We have had a suggestion that price control is going to be made effective. The experience not merely of this country but every other country has been that if imports increase in price you either pay the price or do without them.  With the exception of whatever goods have already been landed, or whatever goods are in transit, future imports must be paid for at the new price.  When the price of oil, or coal, or timber, increases, we have no option but to pay the increase.  It is completely wrong to suggest that we can effectively operate a system of price control <Col N="1022" /> to offset the increases.  There is certain evidence from at least one private firm that in anticipation of devaluation, they speeded up dollar purchases in order to offset the price increases which would be effected by it.  There is often a great deal of talk here about ministerial directions to State companies and about policy discussions and we are entitled to know what action did the State companies take to lessen the impact of devaluation, if this knowledge was available to the Government and to the Department of Finance?</P>
    <P>For the past two years this country has suffered from a policy of credit restriction, a policy under which it was difficult to get credit to expand industry or to expand the economy. That situation continued beyond the time when it was required.  It was initiated to correct a false boom created by the Government in 1964 for the purpose of winning elections.  That is the situation that has developed over the past few years, that we have operated between stop-go policies, started and ended because they coincided with political circumstances which necessitated some rescue operation by the Government to save them political embarrassment.  That is a situation which cannot be allowed to continue in the present serious circumstances.</P>
    <P>The decision to devalue has been claimed as likely to result in an increase in earnings from British tourists.  That is a highly questionable assumption. That assumption was made two years ago when a restriction was imposed on British tourists spending sterling outside the sterling area.  Deputies will remember that at that time, when British residents were prohibited from spending sterling outside the sterling area, it was commonly thought that our tourist trade would benefit as British tourists would have no alternative but to spend their holidays within the sterling area, which meant, in the main, in Britain or this country.  Last year our experience was that for the first time for a decade tourist earnings here dropped by a substantial amount. There is no justification for the facile assumption that because there is now a financial advantage because of devaluation, <Col N="1023" /> tourist earnings will increase.  It may be that if we keep cost competitive, if we provide the necessary attractions, if we ensure that the best possible value is given to those who visit here, we will attract the tourists from Britain but, as I say, our experience, when restrictions were imposed on the expenditure of sterling outside the sterling area, was that it did not result in an increase in the number of tourists coming here.</P>
    <P>The position which will arise as a result of devaluation of sterling <i>vis-á-vis</i> most currencies is one in which there are likely to be a number of effects to our economy and we believe that it is essential that people should be told the full facts.  Our economy must be affected by imports from countries where we have to pay a higher price as a result of devaluation.  This applies to capital goods and also to commodities such as oil, the price of which affects the costs of distribution. It is inevitable that increases in the price of oil will also affect public transport. It may be that these increases will be delayed because stocks are available to carry us over for a period. I hope the Minister will deal with this point.</P>
    <P>The increase in the cost of living which will occur as a result of these increases will mean for a great many people that their money will buy less, unless steps are taken.  Commentators on this aspect of the matter have said. that wages and salaries will buy less, and that aspect of the matter will have to be considered by the organisations concerned in their negotiations.  The more seriously affected will be pensioners, social welfare recipients and others on fixed incomes.  This situation therefore is one which cannot be met by the complacent and self-satisfied attitude the Government have shown up to now.  We do not suggest that all the results of devaluation will be bad.  If we take advantage of certain changes and if we are prepared to exploit the advantages in certain markets, some economic improvements may be secured.</P>

It is only fitting that Dáil Éireann should hear a little about the disabled persons and did show some concern for their condition.  I am sure the Deputies will not complain about being dragged from their sausages and <Col N="1028" /> mash.  Let me proceed with the position of the disabled and particularly with the remarks of Deputy Carty on this Bill made in March last.  One of the things Deputy Carty was at pains to make crystal clear to the Dáil was his abhorrence for anything British. When I said I had taken as a model for this Bill the Disabled Persons Act as enacted by the British Government and as operated by the first post-war socialist British Government, Deputy Carty threw up his hands in horror and turned green with nationalism at the thought that anybody would mention such a thing in this House.  Anybody who did not know him and who might have strayed into the Gallery for a casual visit might have been persuaded that he was not, in fact, the gentleman that he is, that he was not a member of the Party whose hands are dripping red with the blood of the Union Jack since the Trade Agreement when they made their peace with England and we enacted the Act of Union last year.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is interrupting my train of thought and my carefully prepared speech.  The Minister who is not here this evening unfortunately&mdash;he is in the Seanad&mdash;intervened last week and, for want of a better excuse, trotted out the old argument that I was seeking to do by compulsory methods what the employers of Ireland were yearning to do by goodwill and voluntary methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> This brings me to the net point of disagreement and difference as between members of this Party and members of the two conservative Parties occupying the benches around us.  We feel as a firm and deeply held conviction that the State has an obligation to regulate the relationship as between different sections of the community in a manner which will secure the maximum equity for all concerned. The State has an obligation to do this.  The Government take the stand that, if we leave things alone, in the sweet by and by we will eventually come to a position where everyone will be happy and those who are humble will be exalted by the goodwill of those who humbled them.  I do not accept that.</P>
    <P>The whole history of the social services and social legislation which is to be found on an examination of any other country apart from this&mdash; and, after all, the history of our efforts is relatively short in comparison with the experience of other continental countries as well as Britain&mdash;demonstrates clearly that any social improvement which has come about has arrived as a result of a conscious re-organisation of society on the part of those who were in control of the Government of that country.</P>
    <P>We hold to the proposition that, if we leave the situation as it is, while there are in existence excellent voluntary bodies&mdash;and I know perhaps as much about some of them at least as any Member of the House, and the great work they are doing&mdash;at the same time, the greater part of this problem of providing for the disabled will never be solved, or come within any distance of being solved, unless and until the Government take the courage and the trouble&mdash;perhaps &ldquo;the trouble&rdquo; more than &ldquo;the courage&rdquo; would be appropriate&mdash;to act in respect of these maltreated citizens. Every effort that has ever been made in any country in the world&mdash; particularly in the countries with which we are most familiar, Britain and the continental countries, but taking Britain specifically&mdash;to improve the conditions of any group of citizens <Col N="1031" /> who were oppressed, or downtrodden, or neglected, or suffering by reason of the indifference of the people generally or the central authority, has invariably been classed as harmful to the State, inopportune, wrongheaded and, in the long run, economically disastrous.</P>
    <P>In mid-19th century Britain, the economists tried to justify the employment of infants in the various industries and factories and, when there was agitation to reduced the working hours for little children from 12 hours to 11 hours per day, the economists, those with the long polysyllabic words, of whom we have our share about us even yet, were able to prove to the satisfaction apparently of the British House of Commons, to the satisfaction of the majority of those who had the franchise in Britain at that time, that if those little children were not worked for the full 12 hours per day, and if they were let go after 11 hours, industry would make no profit whatsoever, that all the profit was made in the twelfth hour.  They made that argument and it was accepted and used to defeat in the British Commons the first weak effort at social reform which was introduced there.</P>
    <P>Every subsequent Bill and every subsequent proposal right down to the present day, right down to our own discussions here and now, met with the same mentality and the same argument. It is nearly 20 years since I had the great privilege and the great good luck to introduce a Private Members' Bill here which provided that agricultural labourers, farm labourers, would get a half day in the week.  This House resounded with eloquent argument which demonstrated to the last detail and particularly that, if this dastardly proposal were to go through, the Irish economy would suffer a staggering blow from which it was doubtful that it would ever recover.  That was 20 years ago, but we pressed on and we secured the passage of that Bill.</P>
    <P>I am happy to see in the House yet members who supported the passage of that Bill, apart from members of my own Party.  I recall that Deputy <Col N="1032" /> O'Donnell of Donegal was one of those. We got the Bill passed and it was an extraordinary thing but we lived in a period of relative political liberalism then.  There was an inter-Party Government in power and it was possible to come in here and make a case, and, if it was convincing, you had a chance of getting a majority of Members of the House to go with you in your arguments. Under the iron rule of Fianna Fáil, no such liberalism will be permitted. No such independence of thought will be permitted.</P>

      <P>I am trying to do that and, indeed, having been speaking on this matter about which I feel so deeply for over four and a half hours, I cannot be accused of that most heinous parliamentary sin of repetition which your predecessor referred to in a recent interview as being the most insufferable of all, with which sentiment I most heartily agree; nor would I be at all guilty of such a thing as repetition if I could possibly avoid it unless I am dragged into it by the interruptions of Deputy Carty.</P>
      <P>I want, if I may, to draw a parallel between what I am trying to do here and the obscurantist opposition I am meeting with and the efforts which have been made in the past by social reformers and the methods by which it was attempted to defeat their aims. Every attempt at improvement of the condition of people who are suffering is met by the self-righteous by shouts about goodwill, charity and so on.  As one very eloquent cartoon has it, reforms are all right as long as they do not change anything.  At the back of this pretence at sentimental sympathy with the conditions of the disabled there seems to be a desire to keep things as they are, to keep the ship floating along as it is and not to rock the boat unduly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people in this country who find the economic set-up to their liking.  Most of them have come to this happy situation through what are called business operations.  One could embark upon a lengthy disquisition in regard to the <i>bona fides</i> of business operations but I will leave that for another time.  The vast bulk of the people comprise persons who are living at subsistence level.  I am referring to the wage-earners and salary-earners and <Col N="1035" /> those on fixed incomes.  Below those again there are what are loosely called the social welfare classes.  At the very bottom of the social welfare classes are disabled persons&mdash;almost 20,000 of them.  It seems to me that this House would not be worthy of being called a parliament if it did not take seriously to its heart and to its mind consideration of the plight of these people.</P>
    <P>There was some question in the minds of contributors to this debate as to how the Disabled Persons Act has operated in Britain.  I went to the trouble of trying to get some information about this because the allegation &mdash;not the allegation but the innuendo, the half-truths and half-lie&mdash;was that it did not work at all, that the Disabled Persons Bill which was introduced in Britain had reference only to persons incapacitated as a result of war action, and so on.</P>
    <P>I have here the <i>Consumers' Guide to the British Social Services</i>&mdash;a Pelican publication.  The following is an extract:</P>
    <P>The disablement resettlement officer: The key worker to help over the Ministry of Labour Services outlined above is the DRO.  Each Employment Exchange has one; his job is to deal with applications for registration from disabled people and generally to help and advise them about getting suitable employment. </P>
    <P>In my Bill I propose a register of disabled people, as Deputy Carty and others will have observed, as a first effort to get a census of the number of disabled persons in the country and as to the number of employable disabled persons in the country.  One of the early sections in my Bill proposes that there should be set up a register of disabled people and any disabled person should be free to apply for registration in that register.  This is the register referred to in the paragraph I have been reading.  It already exists in England.  The job of the disablement resettlement officer is to deal with applicants for registration and generally to help and advise them about getting suitable employment. The DRO register has two sections: <Col N="1036" /> one for those able to work in ordinary conditions and the other for those unable to work except in sheltered conditions.</P>
    <P>There are special resettlement officers to help blind people, but not at every employment exchange.  The suggestion to register with a DRO is usually made by a doctor or the hospital, sometimes by the YEO, employers or trade unions, welfare officers or other social workers.  But any disabled person can call at his local employment exchange and ask for an interview with the DRO.  A detailed form giving medical evidence of your disability&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>obviously this is addressed to the disabled person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>has be to filled in&mdash;usually by your own doctor or the hospital &mdash;to help the DRO know what work you are able to undertake and also to ensure you are eligible for registration.  The period of registration varies between twelve months and ten years but is in any case renewable where necessary. Only employable disabled people can register and in this way the register differs from that of the local authority Welfare Department, which can include anyone who is severely handicapped whether employable or not.  Registration is voluntary and without obligation but it has advantages.  For example, all except small firms with less than twenty employees must employ a percentage of registered disabled people, who cannot be dismissed without good cause.  Then again the DRO has special information and knowledge about suitable employment and vacancies in his area. Clearly it is not always easy or possible to find the right job for every disabled person and, inevitably, a good deal will depend on the keenness and understanding of the DRO you come across, as well as your own situation.  In fact, there are well over half a million men and women registered with DROs.  About eight out of ten of these have jobs&mdash; though not necessarily all found through the DRO. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> That is a factual statement of the position resulting from the passage of that much earlier British Act, on which I, to the distaste of the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Carty, based my proposals.  It was an enlightened Act. It behoves us now to beat our way out of the fog and shadow of Chauvinistic exclusiveness we have built up in this country.  We should take a good example where a good example is to be found.  It is a remarkable thing that in matters of social legislation we have to take our example from what has happened across the water.  This is due, of course, as every student of history knows, to the advances made by the labour movement in Britain over the past 60 years and the enlightenment in education prompted by the great socialist pioneers in Britain, who were ahead of their time and many of whom were of Irish parents.  A great part of the corpus of social legislation, as we know it today, emanated from the writings of men like Davitt and, before him, from the influence of the Irish who were concerned in the Chartist movement and various other democratic socialist movements for which England became so well known in the last century.  We see the work of our own countrymen reflected more effectively, in fact, on the British Statute Book in matters of social legislation than it is reflected in our own legislation.  That is a sad commentary upon ourselves.  Surely charity should begin at home, if it is to begin anywhere at all?</P>
    <P>Disablement has had some extraordinary end results.  There are many instances in world history, and even in the history of our own country, of disabled people rising to great heights in every sphere of human activity.  In the artistic world, Toulouse Lautrec was cruelly treated by nature.  Davitt was a disabled man; Lalor was a hunchback; Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the great American liberal, suffered badly from polio and was crippled by that disease. But these are exceptions.  These are the men who accepted disability as an extra spur to greater endeavour, another challenge that had to be met and overcome.  One cannot expect the vast run of disabled people to have the qualities displayed by these outstanding <Col N="1038" /> men.  I think it was Confucius who said he cried because he had no shoes until he met a man who had no feet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very lucky and we should avail of our luck to do the right thing for others.  I am not asking for pity, or compassion, or anything like that.  I am not appealing to any sense of righteousness or sentimentality. I am talking about an obligation on two very practical levels. We are throwing away productive potential in the shape of many thousands who could be turned to remunerative and productive employment.  We are doing worse than euthanasia.  We are doing worse than killing the spermatozoa in the womb or the misshapen child at birth.  We allow the human being to grown up to become part of a family, loved by that family and part of the social unit.  Yet, we treat these people with ruthless disregard. Flag days salve our consciences. We put a couple of pennies in a box and we go along the street thinking we are great fellows.  We tell ourselves there is stacks of goodwill.  We have sympathy for the man on crutches or the man in the wheelchair.  That is not good enough.  Sympathy and pity are useless.  They are an insult to the intelligence of most of these highly intelligent people.</P>
      <P>That is why we put down this Bill for the kind consideration of this House.  Nobody, surely, can argue that it is a threat to established society, although Deputy de Valera said he was afraid it would disturb the balance, to which I make the reply that that is exactly what we want to do because the balance is loaded against the under-privileged, the poor and the weak of the world.  This cannot disturb the balance and yet it is rejected by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am persuaded that this Fianna Fáil Party which is now in power places before all other things the conviction that whatever is to be done in the country must appear to be done by and to originate from within the <Col N="1039" /> Fianna Fáil Party.  I have no doubt that, with the passage of time, the principle underlying this Bill will be incorporated in Fianna Fáil policy for the purpose of capturing a few votes. There are no votes now, at any rate, and I do not care two damns whether or not there are.  I do not care if I offend the susceptibilities of the employing class by trying to insist that they have a social responsibility by proclaiming here that we are not content that they should exist only to make profit.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of Bill for which this Parliament was created and which Parliament, to say the least of it, is utterly disappointing to many of the thousands of disabled who no doubt voted for Government Party nominees in elections in various parts of the <Col N="1040" /> country and who may probably be misled into doing so again.</P>
    <P>There is very little for me to say upon the principle I have tried to get accepted here.  I have given a good deal of thought to it and, it may be said, squandered a great deal of the time of the House on it.  Again, the words of our national poet, Pádraig Pearse, come back to mind: &ldquo;I have squandered the splendid years.&rdquo;  If I had the time of the House, I would squander it all over again for these people.  There are many classes of disabled persons on whose plight I have not had time to do research and on whose condition I should have wished to dilate at length.  I think of the deaf people and the many others who must go through life disabled&mdash; but what is the use?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Fine Gael Party believe that this legislation should not remain permanently on the Statute Book, particularly at this time when an effort is being made, and necessarily so, by the Minister for Labour to set up co-ordinating arrangements between trade unions and management to bring about better labour relations and better productivity. To continue to keep this Act on the Statute Book at this time is a mistake.  The very heavy penalties set out in section 9 are not in line with general thinking in the country today and the effort being made by all responsible politicians and people to see that in the sphere of worker management relations, there are fewer trade disputes.  In a State company it is wrong to have permanent legislation under which a person on summary conviction, can find himself subject to a fine not exceeding £25 and in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding £5 for every day the offence is committed.  If a trade union is guilty of the offence, the penalty is far greater.  Subsection (4) (b) prescribes a penalty on conviction on indictment of a fine not exceeding £5,000 and in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding £100 for every day the offence is continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe sincerely that if we are <Col N="1043" /> to have a just society, then we have to have workers, employers, the Minister for Labour and everybody concerned in this field coming together to do their work in a free atmosphere.  If at the same time the Government have, even in respect of a State company providing such an essential service, such legislation standing permanently on the Statute Book, then the climate of goodwill so necessary will not be forthcoming either from management or workers.  The Government could give a lead by creating the better climate so desired by all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Bill.  The House remembers the circumstances of the introduction of the Act to which Deputy Donegan referred.  I justified it at the time on the basis of ensuring the supply of electricity.  It is hardly necessary to recall the atmosphere at the time.  The supply of electricity had in fact been interrupted with consequences that nobody in this House wanted.  The measure was enacted with the support of Fine Gael and was opposed by the Labour Party.  I understand the Labour Party's point of view; I understand my own; but Fine Gael wanted to support it and not support it. This is a follow-up to that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Congress of Trade Unions came to me and asked me to repeal this legislation.  From their point of view, this Act was unreasonable.  We had a discussion.  I put my position, which I believe to be reasonable.  This was to be a negotiated agreement.  I said that if by any other method we could ensure, or reasonably ensure, the continuity of electricity supplies for the consumer, I would ask the Government to move to repeal the legislation.  Arising out of that request by Congress and our discussion about it, discussions have been taking place with the management, the unions and an officer of <Col N="1044" /> my Department and with Congress as well.  These discussions are still going on.  I have not yet received any document, any agreement or any evidence that there is now available an alternative method of reasonably assuring the continuity of electricity supplies.  It is only logical for me to await such reasonable assurance before repealing the Act brought in to protect the continuity of supplies.  If it were necessary to protect the continuity of supply at one time, then it is necessary to protect it at all times.  I think I am logical, the Labour Party are logical, but the Fine Gael attitude of removing it now without anything to put in its place is not logical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Our position from the beginning has been pretty clear and consistent.  We did not believe the rights of the employees concerned could be put in cold storage for any particular period.  We did not believe the right to withdraw your labour, which is accepted in this State, could be abrogated for any period, however brief.  Therefore, when this Bill came up in the first place, we opposed it, not in any spirit of wilful opposition but because we felt it was tampering with the voluntary nature of employer-employee relations here and that the negotiations resulting therefrom would set back rather than improve the possibility of better industrial relations.</P>
      <P>At this moment of time the present Minister for Labour, even if a late convert, is now definitely converted to this point of view.  We have been glad to note that various stringent measures. which earlier in his career he wished to promote, are now being quietly dropped.  We are glad of this conversion. We would say it is a realistic appraisal of the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The function of all interested and concerned to see a better climate existing between employer and employee must be to improve the organisational structure, to make sure that negotiation procedures are such as to avoid disputes which need not occur.  That is a modest proposal <Col N="1045" /> but it is an intelligent and realistic approach to some of the problems that arise.  From the start, we have noted that it is not our job to try to end economic clashes that may take place about what part of the national income the various sectors of the economy should take.  We want to bring about structural improvement and to ensure that the proper structure is there to make negotiations effective and speedy.  We pointed out that part of the problem in the ESB was a defective negotiating procedure.  In the course of the debate, we made several constructive suggestions for improvement of the machinery then existing between management and employees in the ESB. The problems that have arisen in the ESB can be settled under the ESB negotiating procedure and we suggest that the machinery should be fully availed of and, where defective, should be improved.  We pointed out at that time that the separation between the management workers and the clerical workers should be ended and that negotiations take place on a global basis within the ESB.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said in his short statement that the particular problems which arose in the ESB at that time were settled because he brought in the Bill.  That is not in accord with the circumstances at that time.  In fact, negotiations which had been going on during the time this Dáil was discussing the Bill finally solved this problem. There is no substitute for this kind of negotiation, and we have pointed this out repeatedly.  I suppose that because most of our support comes from the section of the population who work for a living, no Party in this House has greater awareness of the importance of industrial relations than the Party to which I belong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no wizard solutions to these problems.  There is no substitute for honest negotiations between employers and workers.  We believe that the voluntary system of negotiation must be maintained and improved wherever possible.  There should be no tampering with the system of collective bargaining.  We have consistently supported improvements to the Labour Court machinery, but will always resist <Col N="1046" /> any tampering with the voluntary system of arriving at decisions acceptable to both sides in the Labour Court. We do not make any alibis for our stand against this measure.  We opposed it at the beginning and we shall oppose such measures in the future.  We do not think it is helping to improve relations between the Board and its employees, and we do not think the waving of a big stick by any Minister for Labour will improve industrial relations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill has been explained by Deputy Donegan.  I do not think it is necessary to amplify greatly what he said, except to say that the time to establish workable machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes, for the regulation of wage or salary claims and generally for the discussion of a settlement of conditions of employment is not when there is a crisis or when there is a cessation of supplies such as was threatened when the Act was passed in 1966.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances in which that piece of legislation was passed, we felt there was a possible risk to the lives of people, particularly those in hospitals who might be in need of immediate action through operations or facilities such as iron lungs and so on.  We made it quite clear that that piece of legislation could be justified only in very exceptional circumstances.  Those circumstances which were then anticipated as likely to arise have now passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is correct to say that the investigation which was initiated at the time by the Minister and which was regarded as established for the purpose of dealing with the problem of certain categories of ESB employees has been finally put on a permanent basis, or that there is available machinery which would enable the matters which were in dispute to be discussed in a rational and reasonable fashion.  It seems to us, therefore, that now that the undertaking concerned is in calm waters, certainly compared with the conditions that existed at that time, this is an opportune time to consider in a rational way, without any rancour and without the immediate <Col N="1047" /> threat which appeared to exist then, the establishment of permanent workable machinery.</P>
    <P>We believe that this Act which was passed in particular circumstances to deal with a potential immediate threat could only be justified in exceptional circumstances.  In normal circumstances it is not desirable to have legislation of that sort.  If such legislation can ever be warranted for particular undertakings, it should be considered divorced from the situation such as occurred at that time.  If there is any justification for providing powers of the character contained in this Electricity (Special Provisions) Act, then these powers should be divorced entirely from any immediate threat or from the pleading which is naturally associated with the introduction of special legislation.  At the time we assented to the enactment of this legislation, it was on the understanding that the measure could only be regarded as a temporary one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> Therefore, after allowing adequate time to pass and allowing the circumstances which then existed to pass, we decided to introduce this amending Bill for the purpose of repealing the legislation. I believe we can consider the matter now in an atmosphere different from that which existed when the earlier Act was passed.  The establishment of conciliation and negotiation machinery has, of course, been a gradual growth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I can finish on this. The establishment of this machinery has been a gradual growth, has been extended and has potentialities for further development.  It is for these reasons we believe this measure should be enacted to repeal the Act which was passed in 1966.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying before progress was reported, we consider that the immediate impact of devaluation is adverse and that certain new measures are called for to offset the adverse effects in order to get our economy moving again and to protect the weaker sections of the community from the hardships that devaluation will bring if suitable remedial action is not taken.  We can detect no sign in the Minister's statement or in Government statements that the Government are alive to the urgency of this problem. In fact, it is difficult to understand why the Government are impervious to the economic effects of devaluation and, in particular, to the social effects.</P>
      <P>During the past two years, particularly since the false economic boom that was created in 1964, the effect on the economy of restrictive measures has been particularly severe.  These effects were pinpointed by the references made, not merely by the Economic Research Institute, but by the NIEC Report, and in particular in the comments contained in Report No. 11 of the NIEC.  That report adverted to a number of factors which contributed to the situation, such as the excessive rise in incomes, the avoidance of which in the future would require a planned development policy, a planned policy for wages and incomes.  It referred to the excessive aggregate growth of demand requiring effective action in future to prevent demand rising at an excessive rate particularly when it was stimulated by Government policy.  It also adverted to the need for a flexible banking and credit policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to these comments which <Col N="1051" /> have been referred to already in the debate, because they confirm the comments that were made and the remedies which were proposed in the policy document <i>Towards a Just Society</i> published by Fine Gael in respect of Government economic and credit policy.  The failure of the present Government to institute an incomes policy, to control its own expenditure and to operate a flexible and effective credit policy necessitated and resulted in the deflation of the economy in 1965.  This deflation or restictive policy, as I said earlier, was so severe that during the first half of 1966 and, indeed, for a great portion of that year, it brought the economy virtually to a halt.  When the Minister speaks of a growth in this year in the gross national product levelling up to what was the target laid down in the now defunct Second Programme account must be taken of the fact that a great deal of slack had to be filled in due to the failure in 1965 to measure up and, indeed, last year the economy showed a growth of something like only three-quarters of one per cent.  I think the up-to-date figure shows that it was less than one per cent.</P>
    <P>The Economic Research Institute commented severely on the fact that this policy of restriction or deflation had continued for much longer than was needed.  The time has now come to get the economy moving again.  Faced with that situation, with the exception of the relaxation of hire purchase restrictions which was announced belatedly, the Government have done nothing.  Time has passed and no action has been taken or was taken to stimulate growth.  In fact, but for the comments of the Economic and Social Research Institute no action whatever would have been taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is well to quote the comments of the Institute on the economy during the last three years.  The Institute commented that an unstable boom was allowed to develop in the early part of 1964 and to continue until the middle of 1965, that the increase in money earnings could not be regarded as the sole cause of the boom which took <Col N="1052" /> place because consumer credit was allowed to rise <i>pari passu</i> with industrial earnings; that had hire purchase controls been tightened and the growth of personal advances been checked early in 1964 the rise in personal consumption would have been modest.</P>
    <P>Similarly, they said, the jump in Exchequer expenditure in 1964 cannot be attributed solely to the increase in wages and salaries; that the increase in the volume of Government expenditure in that year was the highest in the period under consideration; that had action been taken to offset the increase in wages by some curtailment in the volume of Government consumption rather than to augment it by an expansion, the pressure of Government spending on final demand would have been less severe.</P>
    <P>The report went on to say that the authorities were mistaken in 1964 in failing to counteract, by appropriate policies, the volume of public expenditure and the availability and attractiveness of consumer credit.  The action that should have been taken in the fields of credit control and public spending in that year was finally forced on those in authority in the middle of 1965.  The Institute report went on to say that the action taken was probably too vigorous; it was clear, and this was pointed out at the time, that the restrictions introduced in 1965 were maintained for too long.  The final comment was the most severe: &ldquo;Official mistiming has aggravated, if not indeed caused, the economic difficulties of Ireland since 1964.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I mention these things because I believe the time has now come for a review of the methods and system by which economic policy is operated.  We have had admissions from the Government that the Second Programme has been abandoned, abandoned because the review has been postponed.  Efforts have been made to confuse that review with the annual review next year. Action must be taken now to stimulate the economy in order to ensure that deflationary and depressive policies operated in Britain will not creep in here and operate to affect our economy in circumstances which are entirely <Col N="1053" /> different.  In that regard it is, I think, well to point out that, if we take the import figures for September and October, we see there has been an actual decline despite the relaxation in hire purchase and the impression created that hire purchase facilities are now more liberal.  Actual import figures show a drop for September and October.  Allowing for the rise in the cost of living, retail sales for that period indicate that the measures taken to stimulate the economy have not been sufficient.  Some more radical measures are necessary to pull our economy out of its present depressed state.  National expenditure on investment and on consumption has risen very little and the living standards of our people have been unnecessarily depressed over the past 18 months.</P>
    <P>The question is: what action should be taken now to stimulate the economy? We are in a different position from that of Britain.  A mere decision to relax hire purchase is not of itself adequate.  It is for that reason we advocate effective action in respect of social welfare designed to cushion social welfare recipients against the increase in the cost of living.  Nobody suggests that the tax cuts recommended should be other than temporary; they should be designed to offset the increase in the cost of living as a result of dearer imports.</P>
    <P>One of the immediate effects of devaluation will be to increase the cost of a number of products, particularly oil products; this will push up distribution costs, thereby affecting transport costs generally and impacting on the national transport undertaking. Tobacco will be affected.  Normally a relaxation in respect of tobacco, for a number of reasons, including that of health, might not be recommended, but some relaxation is essential in present circumstances.  We are not wedded to one particular commodity more than another except from the point of view of stimulating the economy and, in particular, reducing taxation where it impinges most heavily and where it affects adversely the less well-off sections in the community.  Despite the fact that our interest rates are being kept at one per cent lower than Britain&mdash;that <Col N="1054" /> decision was originally taken by Deputy Sweetman as Minister for Finance&mdash;the rise in interest rates will put up the cost of distribution.  It will affect house building and therefore house purchasers. Many have commented on the adverse aspect of devaluation in relation to housing.  Imported timber is mainly used in house building; indeed, it may be exclusively used in housing construction.  The rise in interest rates must affect house building.</P>
    <P>Many problems arise.  Earlier this year there was widespread concern at the decision of building societies to raise interest rates.  The present basic grant under the SDA loan system, with minor variations, is the same as it was 20 years ago when building costs were substantially lower.  Again, we are not wedded to any particular form of assistance; the only qualification is that it must be effective.</P>
    <P>Another matter that arises is the question of the annual Budget.  This is looked upon now as out of date.  Here we have had numerous mini-Budgets. We have had action taken by the Government from time to time increasing Post Office charges, increasing charges for this, that and the other. This action has been divorced entirely from the Budget.  If we are prepared to take action imposing penalties and additional burdens then we should likewise take effective action to the extent necessary to stimulate the economy. For that reason we believe it is unrealistic to wait until the Budget in March or April next without taking action to stimulate the economy in the interim.</P>
    <P>The question of the sterling link has been debated here.  There are few topics on which there is more sentimental nonsense talked than there is on the sterling link.  That does not mean that the present position should not be reviewed clamly and as a financial and economic matter rather than a sentimental one.  It is an economic fact that more than threequarters of our trade is with Britain.  That means that any action taken by the British Government must affect our economy.</P>
    <P>We have had, in the course of this discussion, to consider the present position whereby, by statute, we retain <Col N="1055" /> parity with sterling.  I believe, as was said in the course of this debate and even here this evening on an entirely different topic, that the time to consider this is when there is no immediate crisis.  Such matters are better considered when there is no impending crisis or urgency.  As I understand it, there was an announcement some time ago by the Central Bank and the Department of Finance that new banking legislation was on the way.  If there is one criticism that can be levelled against the Central Bank it is that it is too lethargic in its action and that criticism can also be expressed against the Department or the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Decisions affecting business and commerce must be taken quickly if they are to be effective and if the action is to be of benefit to the interests concerned.  I believe that one of the criticisms expressed in the report of the Economic Research Institute and implied in the report of the NIEC, if not expressly made, I think, in one comment in it, was that the action taken was too long-delayed to have effect; that, in some cases, action was too severe and, in others, because it was too long-delayed, was ineffective.</P>
    <P>The present development over devaluation highlights the need for this country to make strenuous efforts to diversify our exports.  We have undoubtedly so endeavoured in the past and negotiated a number of bilateral trade agreements.  With the idea that EEC membership was a possibility in the reasonably near future, action to review and revise these agreements was deferred or postponed.  It is now quite obvious, and I think we must face it, that the possibility of EEC membership has receded.  We must see what steps can be taken to secure either through bilateral agreements or through direct negotiations, alternative outlets for our exports.  It is, therefore, essential that the question of trade in general be considered in its widest context.</P>
    <P>The question I was commenting on&mdash; action in respect of legislation to deal with this problem&mdash;should be considered <Col N="1056" /> detached from a crisis or a situation such as now exists or was present in the past week.  Nothing is less conducive to economic progress than panic or uncertainty.  In the past week, we have seen across the water scenes the like of which have not been witnessed since the 1929 financial crash. At the same time, the lethargic approach, the traditional approach, of the Central Bank is entirely inappropriate in modern conditions. After an announcement that legislation is being drafted, action should follow introduction of the legislation.  I want to urge that this problem should be considered on its merits and, if necessary, to give this country statutory powers which would enable a government, by Order, to take a decision rather than have it copper-fastened in a particular piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>One of the matters the Minister adverted to in his speech was the effect this would have on our trade.  I believe this decision now makes it imperative that we review the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  That agreement was initially negotiated and accepted on the understanding that it was an essential preliminary to ultimate membership of EEC.  If we continue under the existing terms of the agreement, and with EEC possibilities getting dimmer and obviously being more remote than they were or we were led to believe they were, then it is essential that we examine the effects of a continued reduction in tariffs in respect of industrial goods.  All the comments that have been made on devaluation would appear to indicate that while the prospects in respect of agriculture, in respect of livestock, in respect of foodstuffs, may be reasonably satisfactory, the prospects in other respects, in respect of industry because of the increased cost of raw materials, and so on, must mean that we should review and avail of the provisions in the agreement to review the effects of them at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The effects of devaluation make it essential that we review this agreement, particularly bearing in mind the continued reduction in tariffs and the emphasis now being placed in Britain on increasing exports.  The steps being <Col N="1057" /> taken there to provide an incentive for industrial exports will have repercussions on industry here and may well affect employment and cause problems for which immediate action is essential.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate, reference was made to the decision to transfer certain Departments or sections of Departments to provincial areas.  I want to try to find out from the Minister and the Government if there is any plan for decentralisation.  In 1957, when Senator Dr. Ryan was made Minister for Finance, he announced in his first Budget a plan for reorganisation of the Civil Service and promised a reduction in the number of civil servants. That plan is now like the Second Programme.  It has disappeared under the carpet.  If the numbers are taken, it will be found that there are now not fewer civil servants but more civil servants.  When that decision was taken, it was welcomed by newspapers and commentators as imaginative and progressive and every adjective considered suitable was applied to it.  It is as dead as mutton.  In 1966, the present Taoiseach, when Minister for Finance, announced the establishment of the Devlin Commission to review the position.</P>
    <P>Now, obviously without any plan, without any thought as to the problems and, worst of all, without any consultation with the interested bodies representing the civil servants concerned, a decision was taken to locate some undefined section of the Department of Lands in Castlebar and some section of the Department of Education in Athlone.  I think everybody accepts, and it was made clear in the course of this debate, the desirability of securing a proper spread of economic development throughout the country.  The present situation in which most growth is concentrated in the area immediately around Dublin while large parts of the rest of the country are left in decline is highly undesirable.  That situation has developed because of a lack of long-term economic planning over many years.  It can only be remedied by the adoption of a properly thought out plan and by implementing Government policies designed to bring about <Col N="1058" /> permanent and continuing economic development.</P>
    <P>These policies are needed not only in the agricultural but in the industrial fields.  To suggest they can be solved by spreading Government Departments around the country is both dangerous and irresponsible, because not only will this action not contribute significantly to solving the underlying problems of these areas but serious damage could be done to the efficiency of our public service at the very time when the Government are urging industry, agriculture and other interests to become more efficient either to face the competition of free trade or the competition inherent in membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, when he was Minister, particularly Minister for Industry and Commerce, criticised the fact that in his earlier years as Minister his Department was located in different buildings.  He waxed eloquent on the delays, the frustrations and the problems which militated against the effective running of a Government Department because it was dotted all over the city.  Here, without any plan, we propose to dot different portions of Government Departments not in the city but piecemeal in the country.  It is essential that we have the highest standard of efficiency in the public service.  What I want to know is: when are the Government going to adopt a plan and stick to it?  We had the Ryan plan in 1957 and we had the present Taoiseach as Minister for Finance establishing a committee in September, 1966.  I do not know who is the father of this plan; apparently the parentage is divided.</P>
    <P>The committee set up by the Taoiseach as Minister for Finance was to inquire into the operation and working of the public service.  It is now being provided with certain additional assistance, according to the Minister. The issues involved in the committee's investigations are so far-reaching that before taking any final decision, there should have been an exhaustive public discussion.  It is obviously unsatisfactory to take a decision of this character in advance of the report of <Col N="1059" /> the Devlin Commission.  Experience has been that traditionally various branches of Government are concentrated in the capital city to be in close proximity to Parliament, to have public advisers available for the Ministers and to ensure that they will be reasonably accessible when required for consultation and discussion.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other objections to the proposal.  We have consistently urged the need for administrative devolution but there is no evidence that there is to be administrative devolution. At present a variety of functions are administered by the Department of Local Government which act in a restrictive way on local authorities from exercising their responsibility. Housing schemes, water schemes and a lot of schemes of a particularly local character come up time and again for examination and discussion with the Department of Local Government and inevitably delays occur.  Even with the best will in the world, not to mention the restrictions which Ministers have been operating in recent years to prevent or delay housebuilding programmes being put into effect, the result is delay and frustration.  Apparently that situation is to continue.</P>
    <P>That is the type of situation in which proper devolution of authority and responsibility could be regarded as effective policy but merely to send a couple of sections of several Departments to some provincial centre is a political decision taken for a political reason.  I am all in favour of building up provincial centres, but on a sound basis and not on the basis of a political decision to keep a centre satisfied until after the next election.  The general experience of Deputies and Senators who are members of local authorities and, indeed, of members of local authorities who are not Deputies or Senators, is that local authorities are frustrated by the number of occasions on which matters have to be referred for decision to the Custom House, and by the complication created by the fact that the manager in most cases is not certain whether he is the servant of the local authority or the servant of the Minister for Local Government.  Under <Col N="1060" /> the Act, the manager is subject to the local authority but experience has shown that a great many managers are trying to do a tight-rope act, keep the local authority on hands and not offend the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>This particular policy appears to have little to recommend it.  I suppose one town feels as much entitled to this as another.  It seems extraordinary that of all the Departments, it was decided to transfer the Department of Lands to the constituency of the Minister for Lands and to transfer the Department of Education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Department of the Gaeltacht would be particularly suited for location in the province of Connacht and there would be a great deal to be said for having it in Galway but it is to be left in Earlsfort Terrace. If ever there was a justifiable case for transferring a Department, there is one for the Department of the Gaeltacht, and Galway would be the appropriate place in which to have it.  However, that is digressing.</P>
      <P>There is an even more fundamental question involved.  What consultation has taken place with the staff associations concerned?  As I understand it, they were told by the Minister that this scheme was proposed and that consultations would begin.  There is undoubtedly a great deal of uneasiness among civil servants who have family and other commitments.  This is not a question that can be regarded as a simple one.  Civil servants are buying houses and paying off mortgage loans; they have arrangements made to educate their children; they have them booked into schools or some of them are attending universities and other institutions; they have a whole multitude of personal and family commitments, entered into on the understanding and reasonable assumption that they would be stationed in a particular place and, in the main, stationed in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that if this operation is <Col N="1061" /> proceeded with, and if decentralisation is carried through, it should be on a phased basis, allowing time for adjustment and allowing for volunteers as well as for new recruits who have not settled in Dublin and who would not have the same commitments or undertakings to go to new centres.  Dislocation of families or homes would thus be avoided.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies are familiar with the provisions of the Treaty whereby under Article 10&mdash;admittedly in different circumstances&mdash;civil servants were allowed to retire.  There were similar provisions made when the railways were amalgamated in 1924 and subsequently in the 1944 Transport Act and in the 1951 Act, although I must say experience of the working of the redundancy provisions in these Acts has not provided any example that could be followed in detail.  But the principle involved, both under the Article 10 arrangements and also in the railways, is to allow civil servants who found their conditions were worsened to retire and provide compensation. Also under the County Management Acts provision was made for certain board of health officers to retire when those Acts came in.</P>
    <P>Those aspects of the matter require very serious consideration.  The other aspect is that some action should be taken by the Government to acquire sites and to ensure that housing and site prices in the towns concerned will not rocket by reason of speculators acquiring sites and taking advantage of the serious position in which a number of civil servants will find themselves.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I wish to advert to.  It is the question of providing adequate facilities for the Opposition to carry on effectively the work of the Dáil in modern conditions. The Minister is in the fortunate position that he was never in Opposition and most of his time here he has been in office.  Only Deputies who have had responsibility for a reasonable period in Opposition&mdash;this applies in the main to Front Bench responsibility&mdash;can fully understand and appreciate the magnitude of the work that has to be undertaken by Deputies to provide <Col N="1062" /> themselves with some sort of assistance and brief comparable with that available to the Government through ministerial Departments.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly in other times this was not as necessary because the business of Parliament was less complicated and the various aspects of legislation were less numerous.  The number of statutes which had to be examined and details collected was less.  The reports of different bodies and organisations on economic and social matters were far less numerous.  Whether that was a good thing or bad thing is not the question.  The fact is that nowadays this assistance is necessary if the Dáil is to work effectively.  This question has never been properly examined, or when it was examined many years ago, the pressure of Parliamentary business was very different.</P>
    <P>The problem for Front Bench Deputies who have the responsibility of acting as spokesmen on Government Departments to brief themselves without the skilled personnel readily available to the Minister imposes on Deputies a very severe burden.  It imposes physical and mental burdens.  It is essential, if discussion is to be continued at the level it should be and matters considered in an informed way, that some service should be provided. It is true that for many years an allowance has been paid to the Opposition for these purposes.  It is entirely inadequate and was never intended for the amount of work it is now necessary to do to discharge effectively the responsibility of an Opposition.</P>
    <P>That matter requires to be reviewed. It is only fair to say that, no matter who has the responsibility of carrying on the Opposition for a particular time, this is not in any sense a service providing a personal benefit to the people concerned.  It does not involve personal financial gain.  The only gain is that it enables them to be briefed by providing them with an up-to-date service essential for the effective working of the Dáil.  For that reason it is a matter which should be reviewed.  I know it has been discussed on a number of occasions.  But there is no doubt, now that we have experience of the <Col N="1063" /> working of the Dáil for many years and in particular of the complexity of modern legislation, that some action should be taken to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is this. In the course of his introductory speech, the Minister said he had followed the lines taken by the inter-Party Government of 1949 and had followed what had been done in Britain because he regarded it as the right action in the circumstances. There is only one thing he has to do to complete the job and that is to do as Mr. Callaghan did: resign.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The effects of devaluation have been discussed in considerable detail.  There is general agreement on all sides of the House that there was nothing that could be done in the present circumstances except devalue. Certain views were expressed about the rather bland way in which the Minister dealt with this matter and the way he put it over on television.  That did not surprise me.  I have had the experience of sitting opposite the Minister and hearing him make very bland statements when he had no case at all. It did not surprise me, therefore, that he was able to put over something that was not exactly true: that this was going to have partically no effect on anybody, that things would continue as they are and that if there was any increase in the cost of living, it would be extremely slight indeed.</P>
      <P>The Minister has tried to get the people to accept that view.  It might be a good thing if they did, but I do not think the people in the lower income bracket will accept it when they know that increases in the prices of essential commodities are inevitable.  They are not going to accept that this sacrifice must be made when no example is forthcoming from the top.  It is foolish to expect that this is going to have no effect and that there will be no further demands arising out of this whole situation.  I do not want to go into this in detail but there are aspects of it that have not been mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One that occurs to me is in relation to agriculture.  Straight away the cost <Col N="1064" /> of imported proteins will go up by 7 per cent and the cost of other feeding grains will go up.  The Minister has made no mention of what the Government propose to do to counteract the effect of this.  It is going to have a very serious effect on the pigs and bacon industry&mdash;an increase of £7 per ton on imported proteins and an increase on a considerable quantity of other imported feeding stuffs.  Have they any plans whatever to produce a source of protein at home?  Is there any experimental work being done on the possibility, for instance, of providing protein from grass through maceration and separation of the digestible and indigestible proteins?  This is something that has been done in other countries.  There is nothing here that could be done of more value than to follow what we know has already been achieved in other countries.  This would not only be a valuable source of protein for pigs but also possibly for young ruminants.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as a former Minister for Agriculture, will be familiar with what is known as slurry feeding of pigs. This provides an example of a situation where we could do an enormous job. We are researching in many directions where we have the results already in other countries.  This is a type of research in which we could become involved here and profitably involved, because nothing has been started on it. An immense amount of money has been spent on research in other fields from which we shall not get immediate results, and it has now become extraordinarily urgent.  When the cost of imported protein is going to go up by £7 a ton immediately, this is the time to get research going.  The plant wherewith to decide whether or not this is possible is a comparatively inexpensive piece of equipment, is something that could be established in one of the pig producing co-ops, and should provide valuable information and a valuable source of protein from Irish raw materials.</P>
    <P>We go from that to fertilisers.  Some people seem to say very positively that fertilisers will increase in price automatically as a result of devaluation.  My view is that is doubtful enough. <Col N="1065" /> The fact that ICI have started to establish themselves here is a good thing, and although it is hard to know what will be the outcome of the present situation.  I am hoping it will not result in higher prices for fertilisers or, if it does, that the increased costs will not be very significant.</P>
    <P>There will, however, be an increase in the cost of imported grains and imported wheat.  The House has a right to know from the Minister what will be done about these things.  What will be done to counteract these effects?  Is it proposed to increase all grains in the coming year and, if so, by how much? The people are entitled to know these things at this point of time.  Every year we have the same delay in relation to these decisions and farmers do not know whether to plough or not.  It is at a critical time like this that this House should be told the facts.  We should not be brushing them under the carpet and saying this will have no illeffects, that in the long term this will be an advantage, get the people to accept that and make the sacrifices, and hope they will forget the whole thing. They will not forget.  A far better attitude and the one that would be expected from a responsible Minister and from a responsible Government would be to say: &ldquo;We are aware this is going to happen.  We cannot avoid it happening. It is the direct outcome of devaluation and we are prepared to overcome the effects by increasing the price of grain and by experimenting with other sources of supply of the various commodities that will become more expensive as a result of this decision to devalue the pound.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This sort of information has not been provided and it is quite unfair blandly to come along and give so little information about the Government's future intentions in relation to the problems that will inevitably arise as a direct result of the decision to devalue the pound, with which, I think, all sides of the House are more or less in agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to hold the House very long, because Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Cosgrave dealt extensively with the whole question of devaluation <Col N="1066" /> and the other aspects of the Minister's speech.  I just want to make a few comments on this whole business.  First of all, I am convinced the Minister has been far too complacent about the possible and probable consequences of devaluation. There is no doubt whatsover that the Minister exaggerated the advantages and minimised the disadvantages of devaluation.  He certainly created the impression in his television interview, following on the announcement of devaluation, and in his speech, that devaluation would make very little difference to us in this country.  However, over the past ten days, there has been almost daily new evidence of the ways in which devaluation is beginning to affect the cost of living and the cost of production in industry and agriculture.</P>
      <P>My main criticism of the Minister is that at this stage, ten or 11 days after devaluation was announced, there are far too many questions of vital interest to this country which still remain unanswered, and the Minister in introducing this Estimate for his Department did not make any attempt to answer them.  I shall be more specific in referring to the important questions that remain unanswered.  On Thursday, 23rd November, I asked a question of the Minister for Transport and Power, as to what would be the likely consequences, if any, of devaluation on our export industries at Shannon Airport. These are industries which vitally affect the people of my constituency, and the Minister, in his reply at column 684, volume 231, of the Official Report of 23rd November, 1967, said:</P>
      <P>It will be some time before the full effects of devaluation, beneficial or otherwise, can be assessed either for the country as a whole or for the export industries at Shannon Airport. Export industries at Shannon Airport and elsewhere should tend to benefit from devaluation though there may be temporary difficulties in some cases.</P>
      <P>Further on, in answer to a supplementary question by Deputy Donegan, the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not prepared to give any further answers to the question <Col N="1067" /> because this requires assessment by the industries concerned and it would be quite impossible for me to speculate on what the ultimate detailed effects will be on individual industries at Shannon.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech introducing this Estimate, has not thrown any more light on this matter.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries a question on the same date, 23rd November.  I asked him what will be the likely consequences, if any, of devaluation (a) for the dairy products export industry and (b) for the cattle trade.  In his reply at column 689, volume 231, of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The prices obtainable for Irish exports of dairy products to Britain, which is the predominant market, are not directly affected by devaluation but there may be a certain indirect gain arising from the fact that some of the other principal suppliers of dairy produce to that market have not devalued.</P>
    <P>In a supplementary question, Deputy Dillon pointed out that our two main competitors on the British market for dairy produce, Denmark and New Zealand, had both devalued and that, therefore, the Minister was completely off the mark when he attempted to argue that devaluation might bring &ldquo;a certain indirect gain arising from the fact that some of the other principal suppliers of dairy produce to that market have not devalued.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there is a lack of information.  Certainly I am not satisfied that there has been a detailed analysis of the possible effects of devaluation on industry and agriculture, or tourism, for that matter.  More and more people are asking more and more questions as to what will be the effects of devaluation on this, that and the other thing.  It is pretty certain now that the Minister underestimated the situation when he said that devaluation should not have the effect of increasing the cost of living by more than two per cent.  We have seen in the past few days reports of increases in the price of certain commodities and it would seem <Col N="1068" /> that the price of other essential items of food and so forth will also be increased.</P>
    <P>The whole situation is indeed very vague.  I hope that when the Minister is replying to this debate he will endeavour to answer some of the questions which are being posed by the people, and some of the questions which have been posed by Deputies here.  It is essential that these questions should be answered and the Minister for Finance is the person who should be able to answer them.</P>
    <P>I believe that the only sector of our economy which stands to benefit from devaluation is the tourist industry.  It would seem that devaluation is putting us in an advantageous position in relation to the American tourist market.  I hope the Government have plans to take advantage of this position, and that the tourist promotion efforts in the North American continent will be intensified. The position regarding the effects of devaluation on the British tourist market is very uncertain at the moment, due to the unfortunate epidemic of foot and mouth disease.  We do not yet know what the outlook there is.  It is vitally essential that the Government in their tourist policy should endeavour to capitalise on and take advantage of the North American market because the tourist industry is now playing a very large role in our balance of payments position.</P>
    <P>Many people are worried about the possible effects of devaluation on the price of houses.  Deputy Cosgrave dealt in detail with this question.  Due to the fact that the building societies have increased their interest rates recently, it is vitally essential that there should be no further increase for a good while to come.  Another matter arises here. How will devaluation affect our industrial development policy and particularly the steps the Government have taken to attract foreign industrialists to this country?  Will this be placed in a more advantageous position or will it be put at a disadvantage?  I have particularly in mind the Shannon Industrial Estate and the fact that recently it was announced that nine new industries would be established <Col N="1069" /> there over the next 12 months.  I want to know, and the people I represent want to know, whether devaluation will have any effect on these proposed new industries.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about another consequence of devaluation, that is, the fact that it may result in increasing the cost of living.  I am particularly worried about the effect it may have on the hundreds of old age pensioners and other pensioners who are living at near subsistence level, and in many cases at starvation level.  I am conscious of this fact because recently a survey was carried out in my own city, Limerick, into the conditions in which old age pensioners are living.  We were horrified to find out from that survey that a considerable proportion of the old age pensioners living in Limerick were living on the verge of starvation. I shudder to think what even a small increase in the cost of living would do to this unfortunate section of our community.  This applies also to widows and orphans and social welfare recipients.  I want to endorse what Deputy T.F. O'Higgins said last evening when he called for an immediate increase in social welfare benefits and in pensions.  It should be the aim of the Government, and particularly the Minister whose Department are responsible for implementing the economic policy of the Government, to have every effort made to counteract whatever disadvantages may follow from devaluation.  We should use whatever benefits have accrued from it to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>The other main point in the Minister's speech dealt with decentralisation. I must confess that I am not very impressed by the reasons put forward by the Government for moving two Government Departments to the West.  I suspect that this move was influenced mainly by political considerations.  While there are many arguments in favour of decentralisation, I want to say I do not believe that the transfer of two Government Departments, one to Athlone and the other to Castlebar, will solve the economic and social problems of the west of Ireland.  The problems of the West, emigration, <Col N="1070" /> depopulation and lack of industrial development, will not be solved by the mere transfer of some hundreds of civil servants from Dublin.  The problems of the West have been discussed time after time and year after year in this House and outside it.  The Minister makes brief reference to the question of western development in the opening part of his speech.  I want to say that I have no faith or confidence whatsoever in the ability of this Government to solve the economic and social problems of the west of Ireland or, for that matter, of rural Ireland.  I have pointed out here and want to repeat that, to my knowledge, from the research I have done into the whole question of rural depopulation, this is the only Government in western Europe who have failed to tackle the problem of rural depopulation.</P>

      <P>In that matter, this Government have a hopeless record and now as a last resort, dictated by political expediency, they have decided to move two Government Departments to two centres in the west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The problems of the West can be solved by a realistic, dynamic Government policy which will ensure that the natural resources of the area are developed, that the small farmers will be given a chance of earning a livelihood on their holdings, that the rural towns and villages will be encouraged to establish small industries.  This is the way that rural depopulation can be counteracted and this is the way the West can be saved.</P>
      <P>I am not impressed by the argument that the transfer of two Government Departments will solve the economic and social problems of the west of Ireland, but, while we are on this question of decentralisation, I should like to ask the Minister on what grounds and by what process of reasoning were the two Departments selected for transfer?</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister for Education is from Limerick, one would have imagined that it is to Limerick the Department would be transferred. Surely, if there is an argument for transferring a Government Department to rural Ireland, the first and the obvious and the logical Department for transfer is the Department of Agriculture?  I should like the Minister to give us some additional information as to the reasoning which led to the selection of the two Departments for transfer and the selection of Athlone and Castlebar as the towns to which they would be transferred.</P>
      <P>The final remarks I want to make relate to an important aspect of the work of the Minister's Department.  As far as I am aware, the Department of Finance is the Department concerned with economic planning, or economic programming, as the Minister prefers to call it.  I was rather amazed that the Minister last night made very little reference, if any, to the Government's examination of the causes of the failure of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>

      <P>The Minister made very little reference to his or the Government's intentions regarding the whole approach to economic development. In view of the failure of the previous programme and the fact that a third programme is on the way, it is vitally essential that a new approach should be adopted to this question of economic development.  Something more than the mere fixing of targets and writing out of programmes is necessary.  As has been pointed out in one of the reports of the National Industrial Economic Council, there is no use in fixing targets unless the means of achieving these targets are clearly worked out.  It is vitally essential to get away from a mere academic exercise, which the Second Programme was, and to get down to the hard facts of reality.  Not merely should targets be fixed but the road by which the targets can be reached should be clearly marked out.</P>

      <P>The Minister introduced his Estimate with a flourish on the subject of decentralisation and he had the impudence to tell us in his opening speech that he &ldquo;set up a group in September, 1966, with the following terms of reference:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Having regard to the growing responsibilities of Government, to examine and report on the organisation of the Departments of State at the higher levels, including the appropriate distribution of functions as between both Departments themselves and Departments and other bodies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Chairman of the Group is Mr. Liam St. J. Devlin.  The other Irish members are persons prominent in business and the public services.  A member with special experience in the organisation field has generously been made available by the Norwegian Government.</P>
      <P>You, a Cheann Comhairle, will be interested to hear:</P>
      <P>The Group began their activities in October, 1966, and have been very active since that date.  To help them in their deliberations they have, with my approval, engaged the services of an international management consultancy firm.  The main charge against this provision is the cost of the consultants.  I hope to have the report of the group next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And, while he is waiting for the report, Education is gone to Athlone and the Land Commission is gone to Castlebar. Is there any strange coincidence here that Deputy Michael Moran, Minister for Lands, lives not too far from Castlebar and that Deputy Lenihan, Minister for Justice, lives not too far from Athlone?  Could we look around the constituencies of all the Ministers and see the excogitations of <Col N="1075" /> Mr. Liam St. J. Devlin being anticipated before he has time to report, with the assistance of his Norwegian consultant, and his foreign firm of business advisers?</P>
    <P>Fraud is a loathsome characteristic in any Government, but it is something we are becoming accustomed to in this country in dealing with the Government we have at present.  Modest fraud is depressing but arrogant fraud for a Government like this, supported by an absolute majority in this House, is a menace to free institutions in this State. I know the result of the proposal to send the Department of Education to Athlone and the Department of Lands to Castlebar.  We will end up with two Departments of Lands and two Departments of Education.  We will have one sitting in Castlebar and another doing the work here in Merrion Street.  We will have one Department of Education down in Athlone and another doing the work in Marlborough Street.  Nobody imagines for one moment that Mr. Donogh O'Malley, Minister for Education, is going to take up residence in Athlone, Anyone who thinks that has another think coming.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy Michael Moran, Minister for Lands, is &ldquo;lepping&rdquo; to take up residence in Castlebar, Belmullet or the Aran Islands, if he has any prospect of retaining the Ministry of Lands.  He knows blooming well that the hatchet men are out for his scalp. They are waiting to get him and the struggle to put the Ministry of Lands in Castlebar is a desperate last effort to give poor Michael another chance.</P>

      <P>I can charge the whole Government with fraud and a more fraudulent action it would be hard to find from here to Vladivostok, and you can travel on foot the whole way.</P>
      <P>This, Sir, is a gimmick.  It is not a bad gimmick because it is surprising how much talk it creates.  Naturally it creates talk in a town like Castlebar in Mayo and in Athlone and the vicinity of Athlone.  It is a good gimmick, decentralisation.  But, to show you the fraudulent essence of it, there could be more decentralisation tomorrow morning by a simple regulation, without moving a single civil servant from Dublin.  There could be more decentralisation by one simple regulation than all this transfer of civil servants and their families and the duplication of Departments could possibly create.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> If we want decentralisation&mdash;I take it that is the purpose of the gimmick &mdash;here, Sir, is the way you can decentralise in the morning.  Wind up the Department of Local Government. Every housing scheme, every drainage scheme, every activity of every local authority in the country is formulated by their staff of engineers, surveyors and experts.  It is then submitted to the Department of Local Government.  It is all gone over again and it all goes back to the local authority; and the Minister says they are to have half a million pounds to carry out a programme of housing, but &ldquo;Show us your plan&rdquo;.  And the plans come up and the plans go down, and the plans come up and the plans go down, and the houses that were going to cost half a million, by the time they finish going up and down, up and down, cost £650,000 or £700,000 because, by that time, the Government have managed to depreciate the value of money that much.</P>
    <P>Declare tomorrow that the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government begins and ends by determining whether a responsible local authority is entitled to build houses, or to make drains, or to provide water, or to carry out some scheme; and, once he has determined and approved the expenditure of the money and the raising of the loan, the terms on which it is to be made, let him then say to the local authority: &ldquo;Now go and build the houses; now go and put in the drains; now go and carry out the water scheme.&rdquo;  And, if that is not satisfactory, let the ratepayers vent their wrath on their own local representatives who have wasted their money.</P>
    <P>There is decentralisation.  If, Sir, you do that, you will transfer out of the Custom House two-thirds of its occupants. You will throw down to the local authority the work it is supposed to do, and it will not cost the Exchequer one sixpence.  And no family in the public service needs to be disrupted.  But, of course, that proposal has no appeal for this Government. There is no gimmick in it.  There is no announcement that we are going to build a metropolis in Athlone.  There is no announcement that Deputy <Col N="1078" /> Michael Moran will build an office block costing £1 million, with all its appurtenances, in Castlebar.  But if you want decentralisation that this country can pay for, there is one way to start it.  I venture to swear, if Mr. Liam St. J. Devlin knows anything about his business, we shall not have to call on a Norwegian or a body of foreign business consultants&mdash;and, if the truth were told, neither the Norwegian nor the foreign body of consultants know B from a bull's foot about the problems that concern this country.  Why the heck we have to go to a Norwegian or to a body of foreign consultants to help us to run our country is a mystery to me.</P>
    <P>I do not mind bringing in business consultants to advise us on the reorganisation of the internal office workings of any Department of State: I think it is a very sensible thing to do. But surely to God, with a Parliament, with local authorities and with one of the best Civil Services in the world, we are able to run the day to day business administration of this country, without having to go to Norway or to a body of foreign consultants?  I do not see the Norwegians coming to us and asking us to run Norway.  If they came to the Minister and asked him to advise them on how to get the elks there to grow longer horns, would it not be for our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to say to them: &ldquo;Go home and ask your own veterinarians to advise you. We have not had elks in this country for the past 2,000 years and our elks grew horns without help from anybody.&rdquo; It makes me sick.</P>
    <P>I hate their business gimmickry.  I hate the fraud that is becoming the common currency of our public life.  I think there is a certain dignity about the resignation of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer which was announced tonight.  I think there is a certain proud consistency in a man, who has pressed a policy for his government in good faith and fought for it with great courage and resolution, declaring, when that policy has been frustrated by events, that he desires to be relieved of his responsibility as soon as the head of the <Col N="1079" /> government to which he belongs is free to relieve him of his duties.</P>
    <P>Here, I feel the Minister for Finance has a very special responsibility in introducing his Estimate on this occasion inasmuch as he announced that his introduction of the Estimate was designed to provide the Oireachtas with an opportunity of discussing the consequences of devaluation.  I think he has a special responsibility to tell the House and the country what the event of devaluation really means.  Let us face it: if we are to speak not only as citizens of this Republic but as citizens of the world, as participants in a common field, shared by the democracies with whom we are proud to march, devaluation of the currency of sterling at this time, under pressure, is an unmitigated disaster for freedom in the world.</P>
    <P>I want to remind Deputies of the words of a very distinguished man who should be no stranger to those who have taken an interest in Irish economic affairs.  I want to quote here the words of the late Per Jacobsson who, as Deputies will remember, came here to assist in the deliberations of the first Banking Commission.</P>

      <P>No, I shall quote the Minister's favourite economist, Mr. Keynes.  The elevating thought Mr. Keynes has to contribute to similar considerations is this.  In passing, I may remark that Keynes is reported once as having said that the perfect standard of good manners for a gentleman attending a party is to maintain precisely the same level of sobriety or inebriety as the rest of the company. I do not want to expand on the moral concepts which inspire Mr. Keynes. If the Minister would wish to investigate this more closely, I can recommend him to the current biography by the man who wrote <i>Eminent Victorians,</i> Mr. Lytton Strachey.  There he will find, in the flowing correspondence of the Bloomsbury Group, the moral standard of that distinguished thinker of which the Minister is an economic disciple&mdash;and I say &ldquo;economic&rdquo; advisedly.  There are two men in the history of this world, in our time or in the centuries to which we belong, who have wrought great havoc on the public mind.  The first is Jean Jacques Rousseau who, with his detestable neo-pelagian delusions of the perfectibility of mankind demoralised the philosophy of the nineteenth century. The second is Keynes.  Keynes is the man who sought to make inflation respectable.  Keynes is the man who has preached the economic doctrine that a little heroin is an excellent thing, that a little of what you fancy does you good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem. The Minister is a disciple of Keynes and the disciples of Keynes take the view that controlled inflation is a necessary part of progress.  I want to make this clear.  We might as well speak of controlled drug-taking as of controlled inflation.</P>
      <P>I want to recapitulate for the House the truth about inflation.  I want to put it on the record that inflation:</P>
      <P>is the prince of thieves, robbing the defenceless and passing by the experts in the manipulation of money. It is the broad high road so pleasant to travel until it reaches its destination of anarchy, begotten of the collapse of money as a store of value.  Then, indeed, Fisher's equation operates to destroy the foundations of a free society until in the ensuing anarchy people turn to authoritarian forms of government to arrest the breaking up of society; and all too often the society discovers too late that inflation has destroyed freedom, and that the price paid politically to restore stability has been the surrender by free men of their birthright of freedom, with the prospect of generations of struggle and perhaps bloodshed to get it back.</P>
      <P>You may think that those are exaggerated words but when I hear them, I look not only to the left but to the right.  How many Deputies were looking at BBC television on the night devaluation was announced?  I wonder were the Labour Party looking at television the night devaluation was broadcast.</P>

      <P>The President of the Confederation of British Industries came to give us the benefit of his advice and he was asked what would be the best thing to do.  His answer was: shut <Col N="1082" /> down Parliament for six months.  You cannot run big business; you cannot run something as big as a Government, if you are subject to the daily invigilation of the common people.  That is one side of the story.  The alternative is that we should not have a Parliament at all; we ought to have a one-Party State run in the interest of the people. I remember the time when the Minister's Party&mdash;he was not in it then&mdash; believed in the one-Party State.  I remember fighting in the streets of this country for the right to differ from Fianna Fáil.

      <P>Every bit as good.  I would be honoured to come from the Minister's stock.  Do not let there be any illusion about that.  I make no reflection on him.  I hope the Minister will prove himself worthy of the stock from which he comes.  I hope to think that had he been active in public life, I could not have taken this example from my own experience of the effort to establish single Party Government in this State.  Do not imagine that because there were those who broke that effort down, who smashed it and who cowed those who sought to suppress free speech&mdash;do not imagine that because we, a Celtic people, had the spirit and courage to defend free speech and to vindicate it at great cost, free speech or freedom is safe the world over.  This House should note and well remember the glaring and incomprehensible combination of the President of the French Republic and the Cominform today.  I do not understand <Col N="1083" /> it.  I regard the President of the French Republic as a great and distinguished figure to whom it would be almost improper to refer in our deliberative Assembly, were it not for his activities affecting the lives of every citizen in every State in the world.</P>
      <P>It fills me with horror and dismay when I see him throwing not the puny power of France, which is insignificant, but the mighty prestige of a great soldier and a great President into the struggle of the Cominform to undermine the foundations of freedom all the world over.  I wish I knew the reason.  I wish I could tell it.  I wish I could argue with him but I do not know and I have not met anybody who could tell me.  A most careful study of the statements of the Ministers of the French Government give me no clear indication of what is happening in the Elysee Palace.</P>
      <P>Is there anybody who knows why the President of France should try to strike at the foundations of the currency of the defender of freedom in the world?  If the United States of America should suffer an embarrassment to qualify her power of resistance, who can benefit?  Who, who loves freedom and individual liberty, can hope to benefit?  And yet for that very purpose, one of the greatest free men living, President de Gaulle, has linked his hands in the bloodstained hands of Moscow in a common effort to destroy the integrity and independence of the United States and its capacity to act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us face the facts: there are two world currencies in the world today. It is an illusion to speak of gold as a world currency; it has not been that for years.  There are two great world currencies, dollar and sterling, and it is all cod to be comparing the devaluation of our currency, in step with that of Great Britain, with the devaluation of sterling itself.  We devalued sterling because we had to devalue sterling.  We devalued sterling for exactly the same reason as we devalued it in 1949.  Let the Minister of Finance in 1967 mark it well.  There was no fraudulent pen to fill the columns of the popular press in this country with articles designed <Col N="1084" /> to misrepresent the Irish Government and mislead the Irish people.  What was the title of Deputy MacEntee's article?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder did the Minister for Finance expect that we would publish an edited version of &ldquo;Diddlumdandy&rdquo;? If we had not, does he ask himself the question sometimes: what is the difference between the politics of today and those of 20 years ago?  The difference is a gap in credibility. Twenty years ago, our people believed what their public men said.  It is becoming more and more true that they find it hard to believe anyone in public life now.</P>
      <P>We devalued because Great Britain devalued and we had no other course open to us.  Denmark and New Zealand also saw it.  It is all nonsense to say we are dragged at the tail of the British pound.  We can change the parity and value of the Irish pound in an hour of legislative time any time anyone wants to.  Any Deputy can bring in a Private Bill in the morning to change the parity of the pound.  Let us argue out here the pros and cons. Let us once and for all make an end to the fraudulent pretence that our right to fix the parity of the Irish pound is in the control of the Bank of England or anybody else.  It is controlled by the Oireachtas of the Republic of Ireland, and nobody else has anything to say about it.  If we maintain parity with the British pound, it is because we think it is expedient for Ireland to maintain that parity.  Of course, it is; in just the same sense as it is expedient for New Zealand and Denmark to do it.</P>
      <P>I have just been given that dirty publication for which Deputy MacEntee was responsible in the press. We know how to use it.  It will suit very well as a doormat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us distinguish between the devaluation we carried out, which any sane man or woman will realise we had to carry out without any cavil or hiccuping about it, let us contrast that with the devaluation of sterling by Great Britain.  I have watched with <Col N="1085" /> sympathy and admiration the struggle of the Government of Great Britain to defend sterling.  I would invite the special attention of the Labour Party to this.  The Government of Great Britain are a socialist Government. Whether we agree with them or not, none of us will deny the reality and validity of the convinced socialism of Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister; of Brown, the Foreign Secretary; of Callaghan, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as he was; and of Jenkins, who has now become the Chancellor. We all know that struggle to save the pound and to maintain its parity was carried on by them in an atmosphere of wide incomprehension among their own most ardent supporters.  But they knew what is unquestionably true, that it is impossible to overlook the fact that this is the third devaluation of the British pound in 35 years.</P>
    <P>I have seen them all.  Remember the international financier, unlike individuals amongst us, never grows old. They know <i>in persona</i> or vicariously what I know, my father knew and my grandfather knew.  I heard the protesttations of Sir Stafford Cripps from his sick bed.  I remember Ramsay McDonald waving a pound note in the British House of Commons and warning the House of Commons that, if they departed from the gold standard, that pound would shrink to half its size.  I heard the spokesmen of Wilson's Government protest in Geneva on the Saturday before the fatal Friday that it was no part of the plans of the British Government to devalue the pound.</P>
    <P>That is in my lifetime alone.  Roll back the pages of history from that fatal day in 1931 when this began.  The farther you go back, the more remarkable it is that the currency of England was the standard of the world.  Who can say that today?  If I have to record that fact, I record it with profound regret, because the demoralisation of an international monetary unit is a catastrophe for freedom and free men everywhere.  I admit freely that I hoped and believed that catastrophe could be averted; I hoped that while the rich were shifting their money, as I knew they would shift it in preparation for <Col N="1086" /> such a contingency, and while the poor were preparing themselves to live on their incomes, which I knew would shrink, I still hoped and believed that the resources of freedom still could be mobilised effectively to burn the hands of the speculators in money and to preserve the purchasing power of the wages of those who labour that they may live. But I was wrong.  Largely as a result of the approach, incomprehensible to me, of the President of France, there has been brought upon us this unqualified catastrophe.</P>
    <P>Now, some astute operators may go back to what I said 20 years ago as Minister for Agriculture when we devalued in 1949.  There is nothing I said then that I would not have nailed upon Nelson Pillar, if it were there, or on the Post Office for anyone to read.  I said two things, and I was proud to have the late Bill Norton and some of his colleagues with me in saying them.  One thing I said is that the price of bread would not be allowed to rise.  I can remember I had authority from the Government of this country to say that, whatever the cost, one thing is certain: the price of bread will not be allowed to rise.  But in 1949 Great Britain stood in a far different case from that in which she stands today.</P>

      <P>We are not now dealing with an ignoramus.  I give that to the Minister for Finance.  When I speak of Jacobsson and when I speak of Keynes, he knows what I am talking about.  Look back to 1949&mdash;that interjection, incidentally, was designed to break the thread of my discourse; it should be unnecessary to remind the Minister of his folly in attempting the impossible&mdash;Great Britain then faced the world with all the burdens on her of having defended freedom singlehanded for 12 months against the Nazis while the Americans stripped her <Col N="1087" /> of every penny she had.  Do not let us forget it.  For 12 months England stood alone.  Deputies will remember with edification that we were then neutral, but at least in those 12 months, we did not steal up behind her to strip her naked of all but the armour she bore against the Nazi foe.  Everyone in this House knows I am pro-American, and proud to proclaim it, and perhaps the marshall Plan did something to redeem the reputation of the United States for that bestial act of plunder. I do not deny that Lend-Lease did something to repair that shameful deed, but let us not forget that in 1949 Great Britain had the right to say: &ldquo;For 12 months we fought off the common enemy with one hand, and we fought the battle for the United States of America who were not yet prepared to fight their own.&rdquo;  England was hungry in 1949.</P>

      <P>1949, after the War.  I was in England.  England was hungry. I remember going into one of the most fashionable clubs in Pall Mall and being told all that was on the menu was fish-pie.  I never knew such fish swam in the sea as were produced in the fish-pie served to me in the Reform Club in Pall Mall.  I was criticised because in 1948 I said to the British in the course of the trade negotiations: &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;We want a supplier.  We want eggs.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;We will drown you in eggs.&rdquo;  Yes, I was proud to say it, and we did.  We sold millions and millions and millions of eggs to England.  They would have taken everything we had, but we had to control most strictly the export of butter, the export of bacon and the export of meat, because if we had opened the doors, Great Britain would have swept the larder clean.  Her people were hungry.  She had stood before the world fighting the cause that Per Jacobsson speaks of even at the cost of asking all her people to go hungry. This was because in the glorious years &mdash;and perhaps General de Gaulle might remember this&mdash;she harboured General de Gaulle and many other free <Col N="1088" /> men who, if they had not England, would have nowhere else to go.</P>
      <P>But today, in 1967, she is the affluent society.  She proclaims before the world that she has one of the highest standards of living of any people on the earth and yet, in voluntarily adjusting her exchange rates, she is reluctantly forced off the exchange rate on foot of which she borrowed millions not only from the foreigner but from her own poor.  That is something people here forget only too readily.  Where do the funds of the Prudential, the funds of the Pearl, the funds of every industrial life assurance company in Great Britain and Ireland go?  As to a large proportion, they go into Government Funds.  It is conceived to be their duty to take their share of Government securities.  What are those funds?  They are the savings of the poor.  What are the deposits in the Post Office?  What are the deposits in the savings banks?  I am not talking about the joint stock banks.  Wherever the savings of the poor are, there the thief of inflation gets his full share.  Have you ever met a rich man yet who has his money in an industrial life insurance company?  Have you ever met a rich man yet who had invested his money in the Post Office except up to the level at which he gets exemption from income tax and corporation profits tax, and that means up to £2,000?  We may take a bit of satisfaction from the fact that he has lost some of the advantages of that operation in the course of the past fortnight.  But have you ever seen the savings of the rich invested in the savings bank?</P>
      <P>I sometimes almost feel despair that it is the very representatives of those who are being most ruthlessly robbed who rejoice most noisily about the act of robbery.

For the reason that I want to impress upon the Minister for Finance that because these things are true, he has upon him a very exceptional responsibility of telling the people it is true and explaining to them what a catastrophe devaluation is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This devaluation has not been born of any just sacrifice for freedom.  It <Col N="1090" /> has not been born of any burden that had to be borne beyond the resources of the British people.  This devaluation derives directly from the same source of conduct as was followed by our Government under the pretence of the first plan for economic expansion&mdash;&ldquo;programme&rdquo; was not that the word? &mdash;the first programme for economic expansion, a cloak of respectability to throw about inflation which I regard as the economic whore of society.</P>

      <P>The First Programme for Economic Expansion was simply a disguise for the revolt of inflation that it begot.  The Second Programme for Economic Expansion was born of the pious hope that a little inflation would be a useful thing, and then the needle began going into the arm oftener, and oftener, and oftener, until eventually not only the Minister and the Government but the whole of our people were put under restraint to wean us off the drug.  Mind you, no Minister of State gave up his saloon car.  No Deputy of Dáil Éireann lost any part of his £1,500 a year, including myself, but my neighbours in Monaghan, and my neighbours in Mayo, brought their cattle to the fairs and could not sell them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What will be the consequence of devaluation in this country?  I will tell you.  It will mean a rise in the cost of living.  If you try to particularise on that at this stage it is quite impossible to do so.  Fifteen per cent has gone on <Col N="1091" /> transport already.  There is a substantial rise in the price of timber for house builders.  There is a rise in the price of oil.  That was absolutely inevitable.  I want to remind the House that there will be a rise in the cost of building, and a rise in the cost of building means a rise in the rents paid by every young couple in this country who seek to build a house for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the House about something of which the Minister speaks very euphorically.  This is one of the <i>tours de force</i> of the Minister's statement. At page seven of the statement with which he was courteous enough to furnish us the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Striking a balance within the effects of devaluation on the import and export side of the external accounts, one can say that there need be no substantial alteration in the balance of payments position as a result of devaluation.  Even if some disimprovement takes place, this can be faced since we are at present in surplus.</P>
    <P>If we are selling the furniture and the contents of the house we can say with every dissolute drunkard that we are at present in surplus if we still have the upright piano and the spring of the bed, and as long as we have them we need never be hungry.</P>
    <P>Having delivered himself of that pearl of economic wisdom the Minister went on to say that among the principal commodities we import from non-devaluing countries are crude and partly-refined petroleum&mdash;and may I say in parenthesis that I do not give a damn about that&mdash;wheat&mdash;again in parenthesis that is most insignificant when we consider that 50 per cent of the domestic loaf is made from imported wheat&mdash;coal&mdash;I suppose that does not matter and the Minister's acquaintances largely depend on electricity and gas&mdash;fertilisers and certain animal feeding stuffs, tea, tobacco, certain fresh and dried fruits, wines and brandy and various raw materials.

      <P>I am aware of the fact that there is a depression in the price of wool.  Possibly the Minister does not recall that our carpets are made from domestic wool.  They are one of the few commodities we do make from domestic wool.  Carpets now contain 50 per cent man-made fibre.  I could go on with the list of raw materials which this country has to buy in order to export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I freely admit that these problems confront Great Britain in an even more acute way than they confront us, but they are problems of a formidable character which it is only natural for us to pretend are not confronting us as a result of this catastrophe of devaluation.  I think some Deputies have already referred to it.  We are going to benefit in the price of meat and cattle.  I hope the presence of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs gives us promise of his personal attention after 10.30. It will be a pity if he goes away now when we know he is here so late.  But, in regard to dairy products and in regard to a variety of other products such as cheese and dried milk, <Col N="1093" /> this country is not only going to find itself in exactly the same position as it was before from the point of view of competitiveness but it is going to find its problems complicated by the fact that New Zealand has outdone us in the matter of devaluation.  Quite distinctly, they announced that when they were going to devalue, they were going to keep in step with Australia rather than with Great Britain.  Only the sophisticated realised that the Australians, when they decimalised their currency, had already carried out a devaluation of approximately 5 per cent. We are going to be about 5 per cent worse off against New Zealand than we have been heretofore and that covers butter and lamb in the British market.</P>
    <P>I want to try to emphasise this if I can to Dáil Éireann: the strictly economic consequences of this devaluation are relatively&mdash;and the operative word is &ldquo;relatively&rdquo;&mdash; insignificant.  I find them relatively so insignificant as to make it difficult to concentrate my mind upon them. The real tragedy of this development is the threat it constitutes to free society all the world over.  Make no mistake about it, without stable currency we are on the road in this country and every other free country in the world to unstable government, unstable society and the grave danger of totalitarian regimes from the right or the left.</P>
    <P>I think it is appropriate that I should end what I have to say by recalling again the words with which I opened my reference to the problems that confront us now.  I set the wisdom and the foresight and the experience of Per Jacobsson against the fairytale and dreams and corrupt mentality of that child of Bloomsbury, Keynes. I reject his illusion that the heroin of inflation is healthy for society if taken with restraint and I accept without qualification this definition of the indispensable foundations of ordered society in a free country:</P>
    <P>It seems to be a lesson of history that without stable money neither justice nor progress can be assured, and that the human spirit cannot give of its best if it is harassed by all the uncertainties to which <Col N="1094" /> rapidly changing money values give rise.  Nations, too, must have their self-respect (which is something other than nationalistic pride), and enjoy the esteem of other nations; but this cannot be obtained without the benefits of a sound currency.</P>
    <P>Does it not seem odd that we should associate with something so noble, so indispensable to human dignity, as freedom, currency and coin?</P>

      <P>It is a reference to a quotation from a Per Jacobsson lecture delivered by M. Frére and I have referred to it before, Sir, at Volume 223, No. 5, column 811.  But it is not so strange, as I notice and I wonder do other Deputies notice, that in this country now there is one business that is thriving and multiplying amongst us, money changing.  Have you noticed that in this city of Dublin, nearly every corner site is now occupied by a hire deposit company or a firm of merchant bankers or a foreign bank?  Did any of the Deputies see Mr. du Cann, the ex-leader of the Conservative Party of Great Britain, tell of his youth on television?  He said: &ldquo;I had not long left school when I learned that if you wanted to get rich, there was no need to work.  There was no need to produce. All that was necessary was to deal in money.&rdquo;  Did you hear him?  He said that and he said it quite unselfconsciously. Have Deputies noticed how many more people in this country have begun to deal in money?  They do not work as we used to understand the term.  They do not employ.</P>

      <P>They are not like the lilies of the field because they are never naked and they are not clothed by the finger of God.  They get their clothes in Savile Row where they are sold. But, is it not time that Deputies began to wake up to the fact that in our capital city, as in so many other capital cities in the world, the richest men amongst us are the men who deal <Col N="1095" /> in money and they have the impudence to tell us now that if we invigilate them too closely, they will devalue the currency and, if that does not teach us our lesson, they will close Parliament for six months?  There are money dealers in this city who feel much the same way.  There are people who are buying property in this city and waiting for rats and the damp and the falling plaster to drive out the tenants so that they can pull the buildings down and sell another part of Ireland for money that can be profitably invested not where rust will not reach it but in a metal which they trust the rust cannot corrode.</P>
      <P>A nation that falls further and further under the domination of the money changers is headed for destruction. I look back with satisfaction to the time when I was a member of a Government&mdash;aye, and before that: let the truth be told&mdash;when the foundations of the State were laid and when the Government of our country controlled the money changers.  I look back over the whole panorama of our history and recall that the aspiration of our people to freedom was rooted in the belief that it was the sovereign will of our people, and not that of any minority of money changers, that should rule this country for the benefit of all. I think that has changed and the more money ceases to be a reliable store of value and a universal medium of exchange, and the more it becomes incumbent upon all those who earn it to pass it on for goods before it loses value, the greater becomes the power of the money changers in the market places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I always come back, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to the tragedy that what I know, and what very few Deputies in this House understand, of such complex matters is virtually inexplicable to the masses of our people, or, indeed, to any free people on the earth.  How much heavier is the burden on us, who know the truth and who have accepted the responsibility of preserving freedom, of making democracy work, of telling the prototype of the President of the CBI that Parliament was not going to shut up for six months.  I <Col N="1096" /> heard him say it.  He can deny saying it until the cows come home.  It was not a question of reading it in the newspapers. I saw his lips proclaim it: I heard the words.</P>
    <P>We cannot effectively forewarn those whose freedom is in peril.  We cannot show them the enemy and make them recognise him because the disguise of the money changer is infinite both in variety and effectiveness.  We, who do know, have in this House a very grave responsibility, and so has every free Parliament in the world, to sound the tocsin against the catastrophic attraction inflation and devaluation have for those who do not understand their inevitable consequences.</P>
    <P>Mark these words: there are thousands of small shareholders, relatively small shareholders, who are looking to the Stock Exchange every day for their couple of hundred pounds, which has gone up by £50, and they feel a kind of euphoria rising in them. They have got £50 for nothing.  There are farmers whose cattle have gone up 20 per cent in the last fortnight.  There are thousands of simple people who believe that here is the crack through which the trade union movement can break for higher wage rates for them. And that euphoria is associated in their minds, just as it was in the Kildare by-election and the Cork by-election, with inflation and devaluation.</P>
    <P>Ninety per cent of the ordinary people of the country who are going about their day's work and have not time to excogitate either economics or finance, find the present experience of inflation and devaluation quite an agreeable exercise.  They cannot connect its inevitable consequences with the true cause.</P>
    <P>I warn this House that we should not be worrying primarily&mdash;I say &ldquo;primarily&rdquo;&mdash;about the economic consequences of this deflation; relatively they are insignificant.  But what we should be worrving about, what we should be telling those who trust us is that it is&mdash;</P>
    <P>...a lesson of history that without stable money neither justice nor progress can be assured, and that the human spirit cannot give of its best if it is harassed by all the uncertainties <Col N="1097" /> to which rapidly changing money values give rise.  Nations, too, must have their self-respect (which is something other than nationalistic pride), and enjoy the esteem of other nations; but this cannot be obtained without the benefits of a sound currency.</P>
    <P>This devaluation is a catastrophe for freedom.  I only hope and pray that the ramparts the United States of America seeks now to erect against a further devaluation catastrophe on a far wider scale will stand firm and protect us from being overcome.</P>
    <P>I ask myself, when I think of 14.3 per cent devaluation: is it enough?  Is it enough to get us back on to the rock of stability?  And the fact that I find myself asking that question again and again, I desperately apprehend, provides the answer.  The whole purpose of our exercise was to make sterling the strongest currency in the world, a currency on which there should be no further question of an early devaluation. Is there a Deputy in this House who would pledge his honour that sterling now is standing on a rock?</P>
    <P>I wish he could.  Devaluation has hit three times in 35 years.  But there have been respectable intervals between the various defaults.  There have been alibis for all but the last.  There can be none for any future default on Great Britain's obligation.  Whether we have to follow hereafter is something on which we ought to be reflecting now.</P>
    <P>I want the House to remember the events of last week, shaking the foundations of the freedom of the world.  There is one bastion left.  May God protect her: the USA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the Minister had to devalue.  Once Britain devalued, we could not remain as we were.  New Zealand devalued by 19 per cent.  Had we adopted that percentage, we should be in the same position as New Zealand, and indeed Australia, from the point of view of the meat market, the butter market and the cheese market in Britain.  We should also have been closer to the Netherlands and had some advantage, in fact, over them.  It would also have given us <Col N="1098" /> an advantage over Britain in that countries which did not devalue would set up factories in Ireland rather than in Britain.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister was free to decide on the figure but, since New Zealand was apparently free to make her own choice, I do not see why we should not have done likewise.  He also mentioned that we had a right to do it.  He took as examples Israel, Spain and Denmark.  He said they were competent Governments, that they devalued and so should we.  I do not think they devalued for the good of England or Ireland.</P>
      <P>Israel devalued because quite a good bit of English money is being invested there at the moment and there were losses of 14.3 per cent on it.  Israel also has a semi-tropical climate.  Most of the countries that did not devalue have such a climate and can produce tropical produce such as citrus fruits and various vegetables.  Israel, therefore, has a market in England and Ireland. Their competitors&mdash;Brazil and South Africa, for instance&mdash;have not devalued and there is the question of charges for delivery of goods.  Therefore, Israel devalued for her own good and nobody can blame her for doing so.</P>
      <P>The Canary Islands have semi-tropical weather all the year round. Spain is the one country in Europe that has such weather 11 months of the year.  Strangely enough, brandy is one of Spain's bigger exports to South America but sherry is one of its main exports.  There is a surplus of sherry at the moment and the biggest buyer is Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Spain is now in a better position to compete in the American market against the home-produced sherry of America.  She exports wines and brandy.  Her brandy goes mainly to South America but some of it comes here.  Spain may now get some of the market from the French people.  Her wines are already a lot cheaper than the French ones and this will increase her sales in this country and, I presume, in Britain.  Furthermore, most of Spain's citrus fruits such as grapes, and so on, can be exported to Britain and Ireland whereas the continental countries would <Col N="1099" /> have their own citrus fruit and would not be interested in Spanish exports.</P>
    <P>Denmark devalued eight or nine per cent, basically to hold most of her market in Britain.  New Zealand have now devalued 19 per cent.  They have an advantage of five per cent over us on the British market.</P>
    <P>In his statement in this House and on television, although I did not see him on television, the Minister has tried to lead us to believe there is very little effect in this devaluation. In actual fact, it works out at two per cent, we are told, but, on television, Mr. Wilson said it would be three per cent.  He also said devaluation was the only alternative at the moment and that he has tried to avoid it for three years.  Nevertheless, according to the Minister here, it is not really of much significance at all.</P>
    <P>If it is of no significance, why did all the other countries that have not devalued not follow suit?  The reason is apparent.  They can now invest in the devaluing countries with a start of 14.3 per cent premium.  They can now get better value for their money in the sterling area.  The leeway of 14.3 per cent works out at a lot more, in actual fact.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the United States are fighting hard to save the dollar. Whether or not the value of the dollar will fall, I do not know, but, over the past 20 years, by artificial support or restraint, whichever it may be&mdash; I myself think it was by artificial support&mdash;they were able to buy into practically every big manufacturing industry in Britain and Europe because they had a strong dollar against continental money.  I think we shall see the same thing happening now and that the countries that have not devalued will invest in the countries that have devalued.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the balance of payments is improving.  This is very good but he never adds anything to offset it.  He does not say there are grants for machinery at the moment, that there are tax concessions which will go in the Free Trade Area in 1980 <Col N="1100" /> and earlier if we join the Common Market.  He also said Irish and British goods will replace those from non-devaluing areas.  This will be very small.  Most of the goods we import from such areas are basically raw materials which Britain cannot supply or else produce grown in other countries such as oranges, citrus fruit and various vegetables that cannot be grown in these two countries.  These raw materials will have this 14.3 per cent added to their cost and, when added to the raw material against the final product, will make a difference in the price of the finished article produced here, and in a country that imports the raw material.</P>
    <P>The Minister made another statement which I cannot understand at all: &ldquo;The non-devaluing countries will keep their prices down from the point of view of competition.&rdquo;  This is completely wishful thinking.  If, as the Minister expects, there will be extra production in Britain and Ireland, there will be fewer sales by the devaluing countries to us than there have been. If this happens, it means we cannot import at the same price.  They must increase their price because they are sending in less.  If they were sending in more, then maybe the last lot could be sold at a dumping price.  If we take away any of their business, their prices must go up automatically.</P>
    <P>I consider that we shall have to export 20 per cent more goods to the non-devaluing countries.  My reason for saying so is that we have increase in petrol and handling charges which will increase freight charges and handling charges at the other end.  There will be higher interest rates.  Most people who deal with continental firms or firms in any outside country have a certain amount of credit.  This credit they can use.  They can borrow a certain amount.  They must pay interest on it. The extra cost of raw materials will also add to our prices here.  The extra cost of raw materials in England, due to the withdrawal of the rebate, and the extra ten per cent corporation profits tax, will also increase the cost in Ireland. In order to get the same amount of money as we have been getting from our exports, we will have to increase <Col N="1101" /> exports by 18 or 20 per cent but on that percentage we will have transport charges to pay.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon has given notice that he wishes to raise the subject matter of Question No. 9 on today's Order Paper on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time today, I had a question to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs asking:</P>
      <P>why five men who were working as temporary labourers at Monaghan head office were laid off work and others employed in their place, some of whom left other employment to take the places of the men laid off.</P>
      <P>The Minister asked his Parliamentary Secretary to deal with the question. The Parliamentary Secretary, I am sure, gave a true and faithful account of the information contained in his brief to the House, but I asked several supplementary questions and I would recall to the House that in the course of those supplementaries, I employed with due deliberation the adjectives &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; and &ldquo;corrupt&rdquo; in regard to the conduct of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The Minister and I represent the same constituency.  The men on whose behalf I am now speaking are his constituents, to whom he has a very special duty to see justice done and I refuse to allow him to shuffle off his responsibility, either as a Deputy to his constituency, or as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, on to the Parliamentary Secretary who is his subordinate in the administration of the Department for which he, the Minister, is primarily responsible to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts of this case are these, and I pledge my honour to the House that these are the facts and I have urged the Minister, and he has accepted by his presence the challenge to be here present, to check me if I present to the House anything but the literal truth. <Col N="1102" /> We are all familiar with conditions in rural Ireland and there are in most substantial towns in rural Ireland certain elements of the community who depend largely for their livelihood on temporary work.  Some are fortunate enough to get recurrent periods of temporary work from a Department of State, or a semi-State corporation, such as the Electricity Supply Board, and naturally if they discharge their duties satisfactorily and for a protracted period are called back again and again to the service of the Department of State or semi-State corporation.  They come to depend on that as a virtually quasi-permanent source of employment.</P>
    <P>Amongst these employees in Monaghan were five labouring men with modest incomes and with families.  In the ordinary course towards the end of August the temporary work came to an end and to give the House an idea of the kind of men they are, they made no complaint; they said they knew that kind of thing happened in the Post Office: they had work to do as long as it was there and were glad of the chance to labour and be paid.  They knew further employment would not be available until a new job of an analogous character was undertaken. Shortly afterwards work of an analogous character was undertaken in Monaghan and these five men confidently expected to be re-employed.  To their amazement, they were not.</P>
    <P>Now we could argue the toss about whether there were five or seven men involved.  I want to spotlight the case of two men in respect of whom I can pledge my word to the House.  Two of the men who had been discharged in August went to seek employment again from the ganger or, I think they call him the engineer in the Post Office, and were told they would not be employed.  They asked: &ldquo;Why, is there not another job of work on?&rdquo; And they were told: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  I will not mention names here but the better to inform the Minister, to give him a better chance, I will give him initials. The engineer said: &ldquo;Your places have been taken by L. and M.&rdquo;  These men said that that could not be, that those men were in jobs already in the mineral water factory.  The ganger said: &ldquo;No, <Col N="1103" /> they are not, they are working on the Post Office job in Monaghan.&rdquo;  These men went about their business and wrote to me.</P>
    <P>I put down this question and the Minister today says he has passed the matter to the Parliamentary Secretary who will answer the query I put but I pressed him strongly and said I was not satisfied to deal with the Parliamentary Secretary, that the Minister was paid for this and should face the music and render an account to the House.  The Minister intervened and said: &ldquo;No, I will not; I have given my answer to the Deputy's question in the public press&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has declared that he has communicated his answer to this query to the public press.  Here is his answer.  It is in <i>The Northern Standard</i> of last Friday, November 24, and is addressed to the Editor of that paper and dated 21st November, 1967:</P>
      <P>Sir,</P>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to a report and editorial article in your issue of 17th November last regarding the employment of temporary labour for Post Office engineering purposes in the Monaghan area.</P>
      <P>The standard procedure for recruiting temporary labourers for the Post Office Engineering Branch is that nominations for the work are obtained from Local Employment Exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Selection is made at local level and is based on suitability for the job. Previous experience in the Post Office is taken into account but it is not an overriding consideration. Temporary labourers do not possess an entitlement to continuity of employment; regular labouring work in the Post Office being performed by a grade of quasi-permanent labourer. Temporary labourers are employed <Col N="1104" /> on a casual basis and are not retained when the need for their services ceases.</P>
    <P>The standard procedure in regard to temporary labourers was followed in the Monaghan area.  Seven men who had been taken on in September 1966, were let go at the beginning of August, 1967, when they were no longer needed.  Subsequently, more temporary work became available.  Seven men, all of whom had been nominated by the local Employment Exchange, were selected as the most suitable for the work and they were taken on at the end of September.  One left after two days and he was replaced by the next most suitable candidate nominated by the Employment Exchange. Four of the men who had been let go in August were re-employed; the three who were not re-employed were regarded as less suitable than the men selected.  I emphatically repudiate the suggestions made at the meeting of the Monaghan Urban District Council, as reported by you, that there were irregularities in the employment of the men concerned; and I am satisfied that no grounds exist for an inquiry as suggested in your editorial article.  I trust that my statement of the facts of the matter will be given the same prominence as the unwarranted allegations reported in your columns. </P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours, etc.,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Erskine Childers.</P>
    <P>If you did not get publicity enough in <i>The Northern Standard,</i> I am giving you publicity now.  I have been 35 years in the Dáil.  Looking around me here I see no Deputy who has been here longer than I have.  We have all had experience of the practice of what we call in Cavan and Monaghan &ldquo;The bureau&rdquo; and in the rest of the country the labour exchange.  You cannot be registered at the labour exchange as being available for work unless you are unemployed.  Is that true or false?  Is that not the common experience of us all?</P>

      <P>I am now alleging <Col N="1105" /> against the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that in order to provide a corrupt preference for political supporters of his own and of Deputy Mooney, he displaced those men from the work to which they were entitled and fraudulently and illegally accepted from the manager of the employment exchange the names of two men who were in fact employed at the time the labour exchange notified the responsible Post Office official in Monaghan they were available for employment.</P>
      <P>Let us have no doubt or quibble about it.  I pledge my personal honour that two men, whom I shall describe as L and M, were engaged in insurable employment in a mineral water factory in Monaghan up to the Saturday before the Monday on which they began work in the post office. I say that the Minister and his colleague, Deputy Mooney, knew that. I say that the Minister corruptly and illegally intervened in order to injure two ordinary working men to collect unworthy and ignoble political kudos for himself and Deputy Mooney, one of whom is in imminent danger of losing his seat in Monaghan at the next general election.</P>
      <P>Those are words I hate to use about a Minister of State.  I want to remind the House that I knew this kind of business was going on for years.  But this is the first time I have caught them <i>flagrante delicto.</i> This is the first time I have had the material with which to pin the hand of the cheat to the table on which it sought to cheat two working men.  I am asking no more for these men than the right honestly to work for the pay with which to feed their families.  I do not know whether these men who have been put out of work ever cast a vote for me in their lives.  They did not come to me until the matter had been raised at the Monaghan Urban District Council and the Minister had announced there were no grounds for a public inquiry.  Then, and only then, did they write to me and authorise me to speak on their behalf in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am charging the Minister in public with corruption and illegality.  I am charging him with a conspiracy to that <Col N="1106" /> end, a conspiracy which could not have been successfully prosecuted without at least the consent, tacit or expressed, of his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.  That is a grave indictment.  I think I am entitled to ask of the Minister that, in admitting these facts, he will concede that an inquiry must be held to determine the true source of this corruption and why this illegality was allowed.  I do not lightly make charges of this character in the House.  The Minister and I have been Members for Monaghan for many years.  It has been our practice, which I have recommended to the younger Members of the House, that if we had differences, they should be conducted in terms of courtesy and restraint, owing to our common representation of the same constituency, and that we should withhold from criticism of one another a severity and harshness of language which it would be quite legitimate to employ in regard to others in the House.</P>
    <P>I am 35 years a Member of this House.  I am an ex-Minister of an Irish Government.  I am an ex-Leader of the Opposition.  I am what I am.  I stake all this on the truth of what I am reporting to Dáil Éireann now.  I am claiming&mdash; I am not asking&mdash;for reinstatement.  I am not pleading for jobs for anybody.  I am asking that corruption, illegality and injustice should be inquired into and fathered on the individual or individuals responsible for them.  I am convinced this injustice arose from no local decision. I am satisfied that it arose as a result of a direction, tacit or implied, from the Minister or officers under his direct invigilation.  The local officer of the Department is entitled to vindication from his neighbour's feeling that he has acted unjustly by his neighbour.</P>

The local officer is entitled <Col N="1107" /> to be vindicated from this charge.

      <P>Deputy Dillon, in making this onslaught on his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Transport and Power, has quite obviously used the full extent of his Parliamentary experience at the lowest level to endeavour to justify a claim of corruption.  It is extraordinary that he endeavours to justify this claim of corruption by saying that he has conducted himself properly down through the years and by offering his example to younger Deputies as one which they might emulate.  I think the example he has given tonight is certainly not one which can in any shape or form be recommended to younger Deputies.</P>
      <P>This offence which he suggests the Minister has offered the House or the nation by reason of some extraordinary arrangement which the Minister or I as Parliamentary Secretary appear to have arranged in Monaghan is just a tremendous working up of hatred which obviously has been built up in Deputy Dillon down through the years, a hatred which he explained during the course of the debate as being based on the fact that his Party and himself have only succeeded in getting one of the seats in the Monaghan constituency, and he is endeavouring&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Dillon, with all his experience, finds it necessary to bring in his collection of henchmen to back him up at this stage.  It was extraordinary that he should claim in the course of his dissertation that it was unheard of and completely new that the employment exchanges as such should <Col N="1108" /> take registration for employment from anybody except those people who are already unemployed.  It is a recognised fact that a man, while in employment, may continue to be registered so that his name may be forwarded for any vacancies that may arise.  It is a known thing and I am surprised that Deputy Dillon with his 35 years of experience is not aware of that basic fact.</P>

      <P>Surely Deputy Dillon is not trying to suggest that no man in employment is entitled to improve himself? I say that if a man is in any sort of medium-sized job with a certain amount of pay and sees the possibility of getting into a position where the conditions are better, he is entitled to go looking for it.  Deputy Dillon is endeavouring to give the impression <Col N="1110" /> that he is not so entitled.  In this particular case, if a man is in a position which he regards as somewhat temporary and with which he is not satisfied, there is nothing to stop that man from signing on at the exchange to be offered some other type of employment.</P>
