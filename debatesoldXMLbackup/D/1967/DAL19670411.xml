    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs what is the attitude of the Government with regard to Recommendation No. 486 on the conclusions of the second Seminar on International Voluntary Service which was adopted by the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe on 27th January, 1967; and if he will instruct his Permanent Representative in the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to vote in favour of the proposals contained in this recommendation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are favourably disposed towards Recommendation No. 486 and, consequently, when this Recommendation is next considered by the Committee of Ministers' Deputies of the Council of Europe, the Permanent Representative will be instructed to vote in favour of the proposals contained therein.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether his attention has been drawn to the import of recent speeches made by the Six-County Premier, Captain Terence O'Neill, in Berlin regarding federal government within the United Kingdom; and whether he has any comment to make on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen newspaper reports of the speeches to which the <Col N="1208" /> Deputy refers but I do not think that any comment is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it fair to the German Government that an Irish politician should be making speeches likely to confuse the German Government about the identity of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the visit was handled by a German organisation called Inter-nationes, not by the Ministry of External Affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware of the urgent need for a public telephone for the townlands of Mullinamina and Gortnasillagh, Glenties, County Donegal; and, if so, if he will have a public telephone kiosk installed there.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to both parts of the question is no. A kiosk in this area would have no prospect of being used sufficiently to justify its provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that if we are to retain people in rural Ireland, we must give them at least some amenities, and that the telephone is now recognised as one of the essential amenities in any such area? In view of that, will he reconsider his decision and give this locality a telephone? This centre is a tourist resort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>A similar case could be made for a huge number of areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that the people of Letterbrone, Aclare, County Sligo have been without telephone communications for about one year and that the nearest doctor is about five miles away, the nearest veterinary surgeon 12½ miles <Col N="1209" /> away and the nearest priest about five miles away; and if he will recommend that a kiosk be erected in Letterbrone, as both poles and wires are already there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a private telephone in the area was ceased in October last. I will be glad to arrange immediate attention to any application to take over the ceased line, but I am afraid that the use likely to be made of a kiosk would not be nearly sufficient to warrant its provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if, in a case where it is necessary to erect a new pole route for telephone service, local authorities must give public wayleaves consent and comply with certain statutory requirements about advertising and waiting period; what the regulations are regarding consent; and what the statutory requirements are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department have a statutory right to place a pole route along a street or public road subject to the consent of the local authority concerned. If the local authority refuse to give their consent or fail to give it within 21 days, or attach to it conditions to which the Department object, the Department may, if other means of settlement fail, apply to the courts to determine the issue. In non-urban areas the Department must publish, in a local newspaper and also along the proposed route, notices of intention to erect the poles, and may not proceed with the work for at least 21 days after publication of the notices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the singular success of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in getting the wayleaves they require through the admirable procedure laid down, would the Parliamentary Secretary suggest to the Minister for Transport and Power that the ESB might surrender the fantastic powers they have and accept instead the procedure accepted by the GPO?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that a person, who has started work on a glasshouse and applied for a glasshouse nursery grant, has been refused a grant because the work was started before the inspector called; and if he will consider having a grant paid in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a provision of the Scheme of Grants for Glasshouse Nurseries, as of other such schemes, that a grant may not be paid for work started before written approval is obtained; but no applicant has been refused a grant under the glasshouse scheme because the work was started before the inspector called. I am prepared, as an exceptional measure, to consider on its merits any case in which satisfactory evidence is forthcoming that work under the glasshouse scheme was not commenced before 1st January, 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when I checked with the Department to find out why a particular applicant had not been allocated a grant, I was informed that the man had been refused because he had started work before he got the OK from the Minister's Department? Would the Minister agree that even if it is after 1st January, 1967, that the work was started, he should reconsider the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If I bring the matter to the notice of the Minister, <Col N="1211" /> will he agree to have a look at it, or to have someone have a look at it again? That is the information I received from the Department a few weeks ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>The determination of resale prices is a function exclusively reserved to the Commissioners. The lands available for division in this particular district consisted of 260 acres, of which an area of 125 acres comprising two estates was purchased for cash under Section 27, Land Act, 1950, and the balance was secured by way of exchange. The approved allottees included eight persons who surrendered parts of their existing holdings and one who surrendered his entire holding in exchange-and twelve who were offered additions to their existing holdings. All but two of the approved allottees accepted the parcels offered to them. In fixing the resale prices the Land Commission had to have regard to the high price paid for the lands purchased for cash.</P>
      <P>As the lands involved are situated in a non-congested area the provisions of section 7, Land Act, 1965, apply to the resale prices of the parcels offered by way of additions and the allottees are not eligible for revision of the annuities. I may say that the average rateable valuation of the holdings owned by the twelve persons who were offered additions is about £21-a figure which indicates that the holdings are substantially better than the average holding in the scheduled congested areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to declaring Ballymacoda a congested area, I have pointed out previously in reply to similar questions, and in the course of the debates on the Land Act, 1965, that I consider priority should be afforded to the traditional congested areas where congestion has for so long been so pronounced <Col N="1229" /> and that it would, as yet, be premature to declare additional areas under Section 4 of the Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No increase in a Land Registry search fee such as that alleged by the Deputy has, in fact, occurred. The fee of £1 10s referred to is in respect of an official search, made on the basis of an application by telegram or telephone, that is to say, an authorised and authoritative search carried out by officials of the Land Registry, the result of which is confirmed in writing by the Registry and the reliability of which is guaranteed by the State. The fee for an unofficial or personal search made by an applicant himself is 2/6, but at no time in recent years has the fee for any official search been as low as this figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is a long-standing and informal arrangement in the Central Office of the Land Registry and in some, but not all, of the local offices whereby solicitors are facilitated by having their telephone inquiries treated as personal searches, for which the fee of 2/6 is charged. In such cases no written confirmation of the result of <Col N="1235" /> the search is sent by the Registry and, in the event of error in such a search, no claim against the Compensation Fund can be entertained. The search is in no sense an official search the reliability of which is guaranteed: and the practice in the Central Office, and in some of the local offices, has no statutory authority to sustain it. I am having the position in regard to these non-official searches fully examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The surplus of £800,000 with which last year ended, though small, had an important economic significance. It marked the success of the Government's policy of curbing, largely through budgetary action, the excessive pressure which total national spending had been exerting on the balance of payments. The elimination of the 1965-66 deficit of almost £8 million, coupled with the stabilisation of public capital expenditure, played a big part in bringing national spending within the resources likely to be continuously available. It has thus strengthened the basis for future development of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1248" /> Current expenditure last year at £272 million was some £4 million higher than was provided for in the March and June budgets. The emergence of such an excess is no unusual experience. Among the factors responsible were the scheme of headage payments on fat cattle exports to the United Kingdom introduced to support fat cattle prices last autumn; higher expenditure on social welfare benefits due to the temporary increase in unemployment; and a much bigger increase in health expenditure than originally estimated by health authorities.</P>
    <P>This excess expenditure was more than offset by revenue buoyancy which reflected the renewed growth of the economy in the second half of the year. A major extra contribution came from the Wholesale Tax introduced on 1st October last, which yielded £2.3 million instead of the budget estimate of £1.5 million It is particularly difficult to estimate the yield from a new tax in its first period of operation, when the true extent of the tax base is uncertain and the allowance made for forestalling must be largely conjectural.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Budget</i>, 1966-67&mdash;<i>outturn</i></P>
    <P>Expenditure on the public capital programme in 1966/67 was £99 million, almost the same as in 1965-66. The doubts originally felt about the adequacy of resources to meet the programme, within the limit of a tolerable external deficit, proved unfounded &mdash; thanks to the increase in exports, the success of the National Loan and also to an improvement over the budget estimate in the amounts that local authorities and State bodies were able to raise from non-Exchequer sources. These favourable developments assured the financing of the programme. Foreign borrowing brought in £9.8 million, with the result that it was necessary to raise only a net £16.2 million from the banking system, or about half the amount raised from this source in 1965-66. This meant that much the greater part of the Central Bank's recommended £43 million of new bank credit in 1966-67 was available for the private sector.</P>

      <i>Economic Review</i>
    </P>
    <P>In view of the number of documents recently published on the economic situation, including my own Department's &ldquo;Review of 1966 and Outlook for 1967&rdquo;, the comments of the National Industrial Economic Council on this review and the annual survey of the Irish economy by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, it is not necessary to do more than summarise briefly trends in 1966 and likely developments in 1967.</P>
    <P>In 1966, the first priority of economic policy was the achievement of a substantial reduction in the balance of payments deficit, which had amounted to £42 million in 1965. This aim was achieved. The deficit for the year amounted to £16 million or £26 million less than in 1965.</P>
    <P>The main factor in the improvement was a substantial rise in exports, a highly commendable achievement in view of the many external difficulties encountered during the year by Irish exporters. Total merchandise exports reached the record figure of £243½ million, an increase of 10 per cent over 1965. Industrial exports were particularly buoyant: they rose by 17½ per cent. Merchandise imports showed very little increase, while net invisible receipts were some millions higher.</P>
    <P>To ensure a favourable outturn on external account in 1966, it was necessary to maintain for most of the year the corrective measures taken in 1965. These measures, together with a number of other influences, internal and external, caused a slowing-down in the rate of growth. The increased volume of national production is provisionally estimated to have amounted to about 1 per cent, compared with 2½ per cent in 1965. The volume of output of transportable goods industries was somewhat higher than in 1965 but, as building and construction fell, the rise in total industrial production is believed to have been less than in that year. The volume of agricultural output showed little change.</P>
    <P>The annual figures, however, conceal an important change of trend within <Col N="1250" /> the year. Indeed, there was a marked contrast between the first and second halves of the year. In the second half, the volume of output of transportable goods was almost 8 per cent higher than in the corresponding period of 1965. This contrasted with virtually no change in output in the first half of 1966. Retail sales were 5 per cent higher in the second six months of 1966, compared with a fall of 1 per cent in the first six months. Investment also was somewhat more bouyant. The change-about in industrial production, consumption and investment was underlined by the trend of imports which rose by £17 million in the second half of 1966, following the decline of £16 million in the first half of the year. Imports in the first two months of 1967 have continued this upward movement.</P>
    <P>The dominant note of financial policy in 1966 was one of caution, made necessary by the difficulty of assessing the expansionary force released by the &ldquo;tenth round&rdquo; of wage and salary increases and the unpredictability of banking developments and of the private capital inflow. In the event, a surprising expansion of credit took place during the bank strike, while the private capital inflow, affected by external controls and international stringency, staged a remarkable recovery in the late autumn. Viewing the situation in June, at the time of the second Budget, the Government still considered it unwise to submit the economy to the inflationary risks involved in a deliberately unbalanced budget. Instead, emphasis was placed on a gradual relaxation of the corrective measures and, as the various statistics which I have just given indicate, this policy has sufficed to get the economy moving forward, though not yet at a satisfactory rate.</P>
    <P>In 1967, the major economic objective must be to step up investment so as to re-establish the growth rates experienced in the earlier years of the decade and thus raise the level of employment. At the same time it will be necessary, if sustained growth is to be achieved, to maintain reasonable stability on external account by containing the forces making for excess demand and excessive increases in costs and prices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> A commentary on the prospects ahead has been given by my Department in its &ldquo;Review of 1966 and Outlook for 1967&rdquo;. With this as a background and making certain assumptions the National Industrial Economic Council has forecast a growth rate of about 3 per cent, a rise in the volume of fixed asset formation of 5 per cent, an increase in the volume of consumer spending of 3 per cent and a balance of payments deficit of £23 million. The accuracy of these forecasts will depend on the realisation of the underlying assumptions. The assumption about money incomes, which is a crucial one, is that there will be no general increase in rates of remuneration during the year.</P>
    <P>If the right conditions are maintained, the outlook for 1967 is promising. The expansion in industrial production, which began in the second half of last year, should continue and gain momentum. Domestic consumer demand should continue to recover as economic activity picks up. This will help to stimulate private investment. On the external front, the Free Trade Area Agreement will assist the expansion of exports, no longer impeded by the British import surcharge. Tourist earnings, which were adversely affected last year by some exceptional factors, should be higher this year.</P>
    <P>There are, however, several points of danger which must be watched if expansion is to be sustained without interruption. Our export competitiveness disimproved in 1966; unit wage costs in Irish manufacturing industry went up by 7 per cent compared with a rise of about 5 per cent in the United Kingdom. In view of the continuing restraint on incomes in the United Kingdom, it is vital to ensure that there will be no further deterioration in our competitive position. On the contrary, we must all work for an improvement. It will be more difficult to sell our goods abroad this year. Demand in the United Kingdom is likely to remain depressed for much of 1967. Most of the advanced Western European countries anticipate <Col N="1252" /> a slowing down in the rate of increase of their imports. While it will be harder to sell abroad, more imports will be required to sustain the projected increases in production, investment and home consumption. Already, in the first two months of the year, imports are £12 million greater than in the corresponding period of 1966. This emphasises the crucial importance of making this a year in which priority will be given to improving competitiveness through income restraint and increased productivity.</P>
    <P>The circumstances of this year point to the need for continued cautious reflation of the economy. This is the key to the budget which I am presenting. The annual report on the Irish economy published recently by OECD supports the view that there is scope for some relaxation of existing demand restraints. The report suggests that achievement of this aim may require some stimulus from the capital or the current budget. The main emphasis, in the Government's view, must be placed on increased capital expenditure. This, together with the resources available to finance increased activity in the private sector, should be adequate to generate a steady expansion of national production. A big increase in current expenditure has to be faced but the Government are not prepared to allow this to destroy the balance achieved in the current budget. Given the conditions likely to prevail in 1967, the reemergence of any large budget deficit on current account could widen the balance of payments gap excessively.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Budget,</i> 1967-68</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the public capital programme has been static in money terms since 1964-65 and, because prices have been rising, it has been contracting in volume. A return to the previous level of activity generated by the programme, and indeed a moderate raising of that level, provided excessive commitments are not built up for future years, are justified as a stimulus to the economy generally, including investment in the private sector. Even a slight increase in the public capital programme can give a significant boost to economic activity. About one-half <Col N="1253" /> of gross domestic fixed capital formation is attributable to the public capital programme and about one-third of the expenditure on the programme finances directly the creation of assets in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The decision to expand the public capital programme is based on the expectation that normal home resources will continue to increase and that those resources will not have to be drawn upon to finance any sizeable deficit on current account. Our own investment resources are relatively scarce and must be carefully husbanded. We have to supplement them by using external capital. Effective use of these resources to increase production and employment will be frustrated if domestic costs and prices are driven up by unearned increases in money incomes. This is a matter within the control of our own community and we will have only ourselves to blame if, through shortsightedness or selfishness, we fail to follow reasonable and responsible courses.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the public capital programme falls into two categories. The first&mdash;building and construction&mdash;comprises what can be loosely described as social investment. The second by and large comprises development expenditure. These two types of investment are closely related and interdependent. We cannot afford the first without providing in reasonable measure for the second. At the same time it must be recognised that social investment in housing, education and hospitals is a necessary pre-requisite for a full and balanced economic development. The aim in allocating the increased resources for the 1967-68 programme has been to strike a balance between the two kinds of investment and the overall increase of 9.6 per cent is shared between them roughly in the same proportion.</P>
    <P>The proportion of national investment undertaken by the Government is so great, and the need for a high rate of economic growth so urgent that the pattern of expenditure on the public capital programme must not be permitted to set into a rigid mould. There is now a greater need than ever to ensure that investment resources <Col N="1254" /> are disposed of in the most beneficial manner. Because of the longer timespan of investment projects, radical changes in the pattern of expenditure cannot be made effective in a short period. Those projects which should be given greater or less emphasis can be determined only after a thorough analysis of the different expenditures which make up the public capital programme. Such a comprehensive analysis has been initiated but it will be some time before useful results are available.</P>
    <P>Another matter which must be kept in mind is the desirability of reckoning as capital only such expenditure as genuinely merits this description. Expenditures which do not add to the national stock of capital, or must be repeated every year to maintain their effect, are suspect from this point of view. There is, of course, a distinction between the accounting principles involved here and the economic principles which must determine, from year to year, how much of total Government expenditure should be financed from taxation and how much from borrowing. Last year, a significant change occurred through the conversion of a deficit of £8 million on current account into a surplus. This year, a reflationary rather than a deflationary budget is called for and it would not be appropriate to increase taxation in order to cover any of the items now classified as capital. The question must, however, remain open for consideration in relation to the circumstances of future years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Financing of Capital Budget,</i> 1967-68</P>
    <P>The Capital Budget booklet estimates that, after account has been taken of the independent finance available to local authorities and State bodies and of small savings and other normal Exchequer resources, including a national loan, a balance of £25 million will remain to be found to finance the 1967-68 programme. The possibility of widening the range of Government issues is being examined. In particular, discussions are in progress on what might be done to satisfy the desire of life assurance companies and pension funds for a longer-term <Col N="1255" /> security to match the maturities of their liabilities. The scope for a shortdated stock is also being looked into.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that most, if not all, of the residual £25 million I have mentioned will be available from the banking system. Government borrowing abroad in the calendar year 1966, including the drawing on the International Monetary Fund, amounted to £25 million. Foreign borrowing on any substantial scale is not contemplated in 1967-68. Recourse will be had to such borrowing only so far as may be necessary to make good any shortfall in home resources. Within a balance of payments deficit of £20-£25 million, sufficient credit should be available for the continuation of productive development by the private sector but, if it appears that the public sector's demands on bank resources cannot be fully met in this context, a limited amount of foreign borrowing may be undertaken. It is by no means certain, however, that this need will arise. Government foreign borrowing in 1966, combined with private capital inflow, has raised external reserves above the 1964 level. I expect that the private capital inflow this year will be sufficient to cover the current account deficit on the balance of payments without significant drawing down of external reserves. Strictly speaking, therefore, it should not be necessary for the Government to borrow foreign money, at least until interest rates have fallen further and then only, as I have said, if it were necessary to ensure that sufficient credit was available for private productive purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>World Bank Mission</i>
    </P>
    <P>A mission from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development came to this country a year ago to prepare a survey of the Irish economy as a necessary preliminary to consideration by the Bank of any application for a long-term loan for development purposes. This was followed up recently by a small technical appraisal mission to report on possible projects. No borrowing from the Bank is contemplated this year but the basis has been laid for the formulation of a <Col N="1256" /> project suitable for financing by the World Bank in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Savings Incentives</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need to maintain and, indeed, improve the attractiveness of saving and thus support the excellent work which continues to be done by the National Savings Committee.</P>
    <P>I announced some time ago that the Government had decided on an increase from £50 to £70 in the tax-free limit on interest payable by the Post Office Savings Bank, Trustee Savings Banks and certain commercial banks. This will be provided for in the Finance Bill. I feel sure that this will reinforce the good effects of the recent increase of 1 per cent in the rate of interest payable on deposits in savings banks.</P>
    <P>The Government have provided a wide and attractive range of facilities and incentives for saving and I am satisfied that there is a suitable medium available for anyone wishing to save his money and invest it in the country's future.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Current Budget,</i> 1967-68</P>
    <P>
      <i>Introduction</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have little doubt that interest in this, as in every budget, is centred on whatever tax changes or other measures I may announce this afternoon. The telescope of public attention is focused on the top mast of the budgetary ship to see what kind of flag is flying, with the result that the hull glides by almost unnoticed. It is for this reason that I want to direct the public gaze downwards for a moment to the great bulk of current Government spending.</P>
    <P>Those who think in terms of a big hand-out on budget day should consider first how heavily the budget is already loaded with extra expenditure. The White Paper published a few days ago showed that the current expenditure already proposed for this year is, at £292¼ million, some £20 million higher than the amount actually spent last year. Of this £20 million, almost £7 million goes to cover the extra debt service arising from the expanded <Col N="1257" /> programme of capital expenditure. Three major services account for a large part of the remaining £13 million: education, £3½ million; health, £2 million; and agriculture, including rates relief, £2 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Education</i>
    </P>
    <P>For the development of Ireland's full potential there is no more fundamental or important investment than that in education. The extensive programme of improvements now under way includes the introduction this year, at a cost of just over £1 million, of important new plans for post-primary education. These include State grants of up to £25 per pupil from September next to secondary schools that decide to participate in the scheme. The minimum grant under this scheme is £15; this is to be raised by stages to £20 and £25 in the succeeding years. Comprehensive and Vocational school fees will also be paid by the State. A scheme for the provision of free school books in certain cases is also envisaged. Free transport for pupils living more than three miles from a free post-primary school centre has been introduced from 1st April this year. The schemes will operate for the whole of the year 1968/69 and the total cost for that year will be about £2¾ million. When the £25 grant is being paid for all secondary pupils coming under this scheme, this will add a further £400,000 a year to the total cost.</P>
    <P>Exchequer expenditure on higher education also continues to increase. The sum in the Estimate for Universities and Colleges for 1967/68 is £3,792,600, an increase of £341,000 over the actual figure for 1966/67. Provision is being made for more staff, more accommodation and other facilities to cater for the continued increase in the number of students. The Commission on Higher Education expect this increase to continue in future years. The Commission have made several recommendations involving more Exchequer expenditure to improve university staffing and facilities, to provide extra accommodation and to assist talented students to participate in higher education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1258" />
      <i>Health</i>
    </P>
    <P>The health services provision is up by almost £4½ million on the original figure for 1966/67, or by £2 million on the actual expenditure last year. This steep increase in the Exchequer bill for health services is due to two principal factors: the rapidly-growing cost of staff and medicines and the departure from the former system under which the Exchequer and the health authorities shared the cost evenly. In fact the Exchequer is this year bearing 55 per cent of the cost.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agriculture</i>
    </P>
    <P>The increase of £2 million in current expenditure on agriculture, including rates relief, for which this year's budget already provides, is a continuation of the steeply-rising trend in State aid in recent years. The Capital Budget also shows an increase of £1 million for agriculture and agricultural credit. In the past three years alone, total State expenditure, current and capital, in relation to agriculture has risen by 56 per cent &mdash; from £38.5 million in 1963/64 to £60.2 million for this year. Support for milk and dairy products has increased from £6 million to £15.4 million, representing, in effect, an increase in price of 5d a gallon and an expansion in creamery milk production of almost 100 million gallons. The guaranteed prices for wheat, barley and pigs have been raised and there have been substantial improvements in farm buildings and land reclamation grants. In addition, several new schemes have been introduced with the object of improving farm incomes; the calved heifer subsidy has now cost £8½ million; the brucellosis eradication scheme will cost £¾ million this year; in 1965, the Government introduced a carcase beef export subsidy to ensure the same support for all beef exports to the United Kingdom as is given to store cattle through participation in the British guarantee system; last autumn, to offset a serious fall in cattle prices, the Government subsidised exports of fat cattle at a cost of £660,000; again, last year, a scheme of subsidies was introduced to improve the standard of mountain sheep farming and a farrowed sow scheme was started as an <Col N="1259" /> incentive to increased pig production. I mention these facts to show that the Government have not only been aware of the difficulties facing agriculture but have taken a whole series of practical steps, costing many millions of pounds, to help farmers to overcome their problems.</P>
    <P>The support which 70 per cent of the population can afford to the 30 per cent in agriculture is obviously limited in a country of moderate means. The situation is altogether different in more developed and better-off countries where the farming population is only a small proportion of the total and large urban populations provide a ready and remunerative home market in contrast with the position here where nearly half the produce sold off farms has to be exported. We are not in a position to influence materially world agricultural prices. Our exports must be sold in markets which are at times over-supplied and in which prices are tilted against imports by support schemes favouring domestic production. The EEC common agricultural policy will continue to have adverse implications for us until we achieve membership. Even then, we should not expect the millennium. The fact is that some of our agricultural prices are already above the EEC levels, beef and to a lesser extent, milk and dairy products being the most important items whose prices are still below the EEC standards.</P>
    <P>Clearly, therefore, neither State aid nor price improvements can take the place of increased production as a means of raising farmers' incomes. Farming can be prosperous only when output is rising steadily. The position in this regard in the present decade has been disappointing. It is a matter of concern, to which the new National Agricultural Council will, I hope, address itself, that the vast amount of capital expenditure devoted to agriculture in recent years has, on a national basis, not yet produced a regular, substantial return. Net agricultural output at constant prices has risen annually on average by only a fraction of one per cent since 1960. In one year, 1964, there was an increase <Col N="1260" /> on the previous year of 4 per cent but there was a setback again in 1965 and little change in 1966. This sluggishness of agricultural growth shows up in a fall in tillage, which has largely offset increases in livestock and milk.</P>
    <P>Weather has, of course, been an important factor in depressing production. Scientists confirm that the summers since 1960 have been below normal. Apart from any additional budgetary aid, but assuming normal weather conditions, the NIEC has estimated that farm incomes should rise by about £7 million in 1967.</P>
    <P>Government policy is based on helping farmers who work their land fully and efficiently to share equitably in rising national prosperity. Market outlets as secured by trade agreements and State aid in the form of production incentives, price supports, credit facilities, structural reform and so on will be effective only if farmers use them in a business-like way to increase their production and incomes. A vigorous and well-managed co-operative movement, based on farm units of viable size, providing comprehensive production, technical and marketing services, and acting in close liaison with the various public agencies would, I believe, enable small farmers, and large farmers too, to reduce their costs and increase output and incomes. There is no obvious reason why the great scope of the co-operative movement in many European countries should not be paralleled here. This is a matter which I hope the new National Agricultural Council will pursue. The Government are most anxious to help farmers to organise themselves for productive purposes. I shall be mentioning in a few minutes the additional aid in support of incomes and reduction of costs which this year's budget can offer.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Limits of Budget</i>
    </P>
    <P>Meanwhile, I should like to revert to the £20 million increase in current expenditure which the budget already carries. This absorbs all but £1.3 million of the additional revenue produced by last year's steep increases in taxation. We have had in recent years <Col N="1261" /> to keep on raising taxation in order to cover the cost of the additional services and aids demanded by various sections of the community. The public at large have, with some grumbling, accepted that these expenditures were desirable on social or economic grounds. But there is a limit to the extent to which taxation can be levered up even for the most desirable of objects and this limit can be reached more quickly if the economy is advancing at only a slow pace. This year, however strong the pressure for additional expenditures, I must contain it so that I do not have to raise taxes significantly. I do not want to disturb the costs or prices which affect our competitiveness. I do not want to impede, but rather to promote, the growth of production and employment. At the same time, some social obligations as well as the position of farmers must be looked at as sympathetically as resources will allow. In deciding on budgetary changes, I must keep in mind the need to avoid falling back this year into an uncomfortable deficit position, particularly as many of the improvements now being made in educational and other services are going to cost increasingly more in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budget plan</i>
    </P>
    <P>Briefly, my budget proposals are as follows. The White Paper shows an opening surplus of £1.3 million and I propose to supplement this by an increase in taxes on tobacco and beer which will provide a further £2½ million. This gives me £3.8 million. It seems to me that, in a year of resumed economic growth, I may, without risk of running into a significant deficit, assume a favourable net error of £4 million in the estimates. On this basis I have £7.8 million to dispose of and this I propose to apply partly to give some desirable reliefs and incentives in the field of direct taxation, partly to improve social welfare and other payments but, for the greater part, to come further to the aid of farmers and the West.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Increases</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the case of tobacco I propose to increase the main rate of customs duty <Col N="1262" /> on leaf by 3s 5d a pound with corresponding increases in the other rates of duty and an equivalent charge on stocks held by manufacturers at 5 p.m. today. The effect, in the case of cigarettes, will be to increase the duty element in the price of a packet of 20 standard size plain cigarettes by 2d, making allowance for the incidence of turnover tax. Whilst the duty increase in the case of smaller cigarettes will be somewhat less than 2d, the prices of cigarettes generally may be expected to rise by 2d for 20, since price increases involving fractions of a penny are not practicable. However, the cigarette manufacturers have already undertaken that, should an increase in duty create a problem of this kind, any surplus arising will be applied to their products and passed on to the consumer and will not be used to increase their profits. The increase in tobacco duty, including the charge on stocks, is expected to yield £1¼ million this year.</P>
    <P>I propose to find the other £1¼ million by increasing the beer duties by the equivalent of 1d a pint, making allowance for the incidence of turnover tax.</P>
    <P>I believe that these tax increases will be generally accepted as modest particularly in view of the considerably increased expenditures which we are undertaking this year in education, health, social welfare and agriculture. Furthermore they will be offset by some not inconsiderable reliefs which I shall now describe.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Medical Expenses</i>
    </P>
    <P>The House will recall that the Commission on Income Taxation recommended that a taxpayer who incurs expense on himself, or on any dependant, arising out of disability or illness which is serious and likely to be permanent should be allowed the vouched expenses in excess of £50 per annum per person and up to a maximum of £300 per person. I have had this matter exhaustively examined and I now propose to grant relief within the financial limits recommended by the Commission, in respect of payments for the professional services of medical practitioners, for maintenance and treatment in hospital and for <Col N="1263" /> drugs, medicines and appliances prescribed by a practitioner.</P>
    <P>The relief due for any tax year will be given by way of repayment after the end of the year and so, in 1967-68, there will be no surrender of revenue. It is estimated that the cost in 1968-69 will be £250,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Dependent Relative</i>
    </P>
    <P>In 1963, the income limit for purposes of the dependent relative allowance was raised from £110 to £120. Before that no income tax allowance was available for a dependent relative whose income exceeded the specified limit. The 1963 Act provided, with effect as from 1964-65, for the granting of a tapering allowance where the income of the person maintained exceeded £120 a year. One purpose of this provision was to obviate the necessity for frequent alterations of the income limit. I now propose to increase the limit from £120 to £140. The cost to the Exchequer will be £250,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Child Allowance</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year an increased allowance for income tax of £150 was introduced for children over the age of 11 years, leaving the allowance for younger children at the figure of £120. I am anxious, within the limits of the resources available to me, to do something for the taxpayer with a family of young children. Anything in this area costs a great deal and in view of the increased State aid being provided for free secondary education I feel that the tax relief which I can afford to give this year should be channelled to the parents of younger children. I accordingly propose to raise, as regards children not over 11, the existing allowance of £120 to £135. The cost will be £500,000 this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Surtax Earned Income Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have been strongly urged by a number of responsible bodies to remedy a situation which is severely hampering Irish industry in recruiting the services of the best managerial, technological and research talent available. Some years ago attention was <Col N="1264" /> drawn to the disadvantage to a developing economy of taxation being relatively heavy in what might be called the higher managerial ranges of income. The steps then taken to rectify this have, however, been nullified by events since, including the necessity to raise the standard rate of income tax last year. The position again obtains that taxation at these levels &mdash; that is roughly from £3,500 upwards &mdash; is much heavier than in Britain and as a result we are not getting the people we need at this level. It is not possible to reduce the standard rate this year or, indeed, to correct fully the adverse relationship I have just described but I propose to go some way towards doing so, largely by readjustments within the surtax system itself. I propose that the first £1,250 of earned income be not taken into account in calculating surtax, and to recover all but £150,000 of the cost of this by a flat rate increase of 20 per cent in existing rates of surtax. The changes will apply to surtax payable on 1st January, 1968. As an illustration of the net relief which these changes will afford I may mention that a married man on a salary of £4,000 a year, instead of paying £126 more than in Britain as at present will pay £12 less; at higher levels of income, while he will still be paying more than in Britain, the differential will be reduced.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Allowances</i>
    </P>
    <P>By far the greatest advantage which the budget can confer on industry is to restore, by its influence on economic expansion, the steady upward movement of home sales, production and profits.</P>
    <P>As a specific encouragement, however, to higher investment in manufacturing industry and an improvement in our competitive position in free trade conditions, I propose to raise to 50 per cent the initial allowance of 40 per cent which applies to capital expenditure incurred in the period up to the 31st March, 1968, on new machinery and plant. I further propose that the 50 per cent allowance should be made available not only for expenditure up to the 31st March, 1968, but also for expenditure in the three subsequent <Col N="1265" /> years up to the 31st March, 1971.</P>
    <P>I have also decided that a special measure of assistance is desirable to promote the development of industry in our special development region&mdash; the twelve under-developed western counties. I propose to introduce what is generally known as &ldquo;free depreciation&rdquo; in these areas. This is a special system of tax allowances for machinery and plant. It will apply only to new machinery and plant used in industry&mdash; mobile equipment such as road vehicles will be excluded &mdash; and will take the form of allowing an industrialist to claim, in addition to the depreciation allowance for which the general law provides, such further depreciation allowance as he may choose. Thus, if an industrialist so wishes, he may write off 100 per cent of his expenditure in the first year. This should constitute a most valuable incentive to investment in western areas.</P>
    <P>The increased initial allowance and free depreciation will not be felt as a cost to the Exchequer until 1968/69. The cost in that year is estimated at £500,000 rising to £1,000,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>Since 1963-64 expenditure on social welfare has risen from £31 million to the present £42½ million, an increase of 37 per cent in four years. Since the last general increase in social welfare rates, however, the consumer price index has risen by almost 4 per cent. To offset this an extra 2/- or so in the main rates would be needed. To give, in addition, a real improvement, the Government propose to increase by 5/- a week the non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions, the personal rate of unemployment assistance and the allowance for an adult dependant.</P>
    <P>Insurance benefits will also be increased by 5/- a week. This will apply to the personal rates of old age and widows' contributory pensions, unemployment benefit, disability benefit and maternity allowance, and to the allowance for an adult dependant where this is paid.</P>
    <P>To mitigate the adverse effects of <Col N="1266" /> prolonged unemployment, the maximum duration of unemployment benefit will be increased from 6 to 12 months. Persons with an average of 40 paid contributions a year over the preceding 7 years will be paid full benefit; others, except juveniles, will be paid benefits for the second 6 months equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment assistance applicable in urban areas. As a result of this arrangement and a further change I shall announce later the unemployment assistance scheme will in future operate substantially for the benefit of smallholders and other residents of rural areas.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer here is bearing a high ratio, by international standards, of the cost of social welfare. In the first place, assistance services, which are financed wholly by the Exchequer, represent a high proportion of our total outlay. Secondly, even in the case of insurance services, the Exchequer bears a higher proportion of the cost than in Britain or the European countries generally. When the unified social insurance scheme was instituted in the early 1950s, the intention was that the taxpayer would contribute about one-third of the cost of social insurance. In fact, however, his contribution has been nearer to 40 per cent down the years. The extension of the duration of unemployment benefit, which will lead to a saving on unemployment assistance, is a step towards the goal of more comprehensive insurance cover with a lessening of our dependence on means-tested assistance schemes. It is proposed also to make a modest adjustment in the proportion of the Exchequer contribution to the insurance services by putting the cost of the extension of unemployment benefit and slightly more than two-thirds of the cost of rate increases on the insurance contribution. This should go some way towards achieving the apportionment of cost between contributors and the Exchequer which was originally envisaged.</P>
    <P>The infectious diseases maintenance allowance and the disabled persons maintenance allowance administered by the Department of Health will also be increased by 5/- a week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> The increases in social assistance will take effect from the beginning of August and in insurance benefits from January next.</P>
    <P>These proposals will cost the Exchequer £1.5 million this year.</P>
    <P>There is a growing consciousness in our community of the problems of the old and a good deal of voluntary personal service is being devoted to their welfare. While our social welfare services are being continuously improved, there is considerable scope for voluntary effort in providing old people not just with the bare necessities of life but also with some comfort and companionship. I hope more people will associate themselves with these very praiseworthy activities. For their part the Government have been considering particularly the difficult circumstances of old people who live alone. We have decided to give this group additional help by way of free electricity and transport.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Free electricity and transport for old age pensioners</i>
    </P>
    <P>The electricity bill can be a worry when resources are limited. A scheme is being prepared which will remove this expense, or reduce it substantially, for all households consisting only of old age pensioners. It is intended to give relief from the fixed charge on the ESB's domestic consumer tariff. This is 11/- as a minimum for each two-month period. In addition it is proposed to provide an allowance of 100 units of electricity free of charge in each period. The scheme will be brought into operation from 1st October next.</P>
    <P>A scheme is also being worked out in consultation with CIE whereby old age and blind pensioners will be able to travel free of charge on CIE buses and trains during periods when traffic is not heavy. It will be introduced during the course of the next few months.</P>
    <P>The net cost of the schemes, as agreed after some experience of their operation, will be reimbursed to the ESB and CIE from public funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" />
      <i>Public Service Pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>The pensions of former civil servants, national teachers, gardaí, members of the defence forces and other public service pensioners who retired before February, 1964, have already been increased a number of times. The last increase, granted in August, 1965, afforded compensation for the rise in the Consumer Price Index up to February, 1964, the date of the 9th round of general pay increases. The Consumer Price Index increased by 12 per cent from February, 1964, up to mid-May, 1966, which just preceded the 10th pay round. To compensate for this, I propose to increase by a further 12 per cent those pensions which were increased in August, 1965. The increase will be effective from 1st August next and the cost to the Exchequer this year will be £430,000. In a full year, the cost will be £636,000 plus the cost of recoupment of the Exchequer share of increases in local authority pensions, for which figures are not yet available. Military service pensioners and the holders of special allowances will also be eligible for a corresponding increase.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Farmers</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am left with £5 million, all of which is being allocated in aid of farmers and the rural community, particular attention being given to the smaller farmers and the development of the western counties.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rates on Agricultural Land</i>
    </P>
    <P>The ability of farmers to meet increases in rates on agricultural land has been a constant concern of the Government. Out of a gross increase of £5½ million in such rates between 1963-64 and 1966-67 the Exchequer has in fact met £4½ million. Owing to the continuous increase in rates generally the Government have decided to give a further measure of relief designed to assist smaller farmers. Briefly, the proposal is completely to derate all holdings on agricultural land of £20 valuation and under in county health districts, and to give a scaled relief to all holdings with valuations above £20 and not exceeding approximately £33. This will cost the Exchequer about £1.6 million <Col N="1269" /> in 1967-68 and will bring the total bill for relief of agricultural rates this year to the very considerable sum of £16 million as against £13.4 million last year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Abolition of Employment Period Orders</i>
    </P>
    <P>To improve the incomes of those living on very small holdings has been a matter of special concern to the Government. The Minister for Social Welfare has been authorised to make changes in the present assistance schemes which will increase their cash incomes significantly. The First Employment Period Order, which disqualifies landholders of over £4 valuation from assistance from March to end-October, will be revoked immediately. The Second Employment Period Order, which would ordinarily come into operation in June and debar until end-October men without dependants in rural areas, including smallholders under £4 valuation, will not be made. The cost of these changes will be £620,000. This will mean that about 10,000 smallholders will now for the first time be eligible to receive unemployment assistance throughout the year. Taking account of the changes introduced last year, these payments will now total over £1 million a year. As a result, smallholders are not only protected against hardship throughout the year but, because the payments are not adjusted for variations in farm output, they have every incentive to increase their incomes by more intensive use of their land. This in itself is an important step towards relieving one of the most difficult problems of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Milk</i>
    </P>
    <P>The price of creamery milk will be increased by another 1d a gallon from 1st May next. The cost this year will be £1.6 million. A corresponding increase of 1d a gallon will be paid to the liquid milk producers in the Dublin and Cork liquid milk areas.</P>
    <P>The special allowance for quality creamery milk has already been increased from 1d to 2d per gallon with effect from 1st April. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries appreciates that, because of a lack of cooling <Col N="1270" /> facilities, the smaller dairy farmers are encountering some difficulty in meeting the quality standards and he proposes, therefore, to introduce this year a scheme of grants to help such farmers to acquire milk coolers. The grants, which will be for the type of cooler appropriate in each case, will be available to applicants who satisfy certain conditions, as to land valuation and milk supply, designed to ensure that the benefit goes to the smaller dairy farmers. Details will be announced shortly by the Minister. I am setting aside £100,000 to meet the cost of this new scheme in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pigs</i>
    </P>
    <P>The guaranteed minimum prices for pigs will be increased by 6/- a cwt. deadweight with effect from 1st May. This will cost £200,000. The headage grant for farrowed sows introduced last year with the object of building up pig numbers is due to expire next September. It is being extended to June, 1968, at a further cost of £200,000, making the total additional aid for the pig industry this year £400,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Report of Milk Price Committee</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries received last week a summary of the recommendations of the Committee set up last year to examine the question of a two-tier price for milk. The full report of the Committee will not be available for some time. The Committee are unanimous in not recommending the introduction of a two-tier price system for milk but they recommend, instead, an incentive bonus scheme for small farmers who are potentially viable, including small farmers who would not be classified as dairy farmers. The detailed proposals of this Committee will, of course, receive very careful consideration and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries also proposes to consult the National Agricultural Council about them.</P>
    <P>I can say at this stage that the idea of a bonus incentive, given where production has actually been increased in conformity with an approved plan aimed at making the small farm a <Col N="1271" /> viable economic entity, is an attractive one. It is consistent with the policy we have been following in regard to small farm development, by the institution of the Pilot Area scheme, the tailoring of various grants in favour of the small farmer and so on. Without commitment to the particular form of scheme outlined by the Committee, but as evidence of intention to start a bonus incentive scheme in 1967-68 for small farmers, following detailed study of the Committee's recommendations and completion of a general review of existing schemes, I am setting aside £250,000 for this purpose now.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Erin Foods-Heinz partnership</i>
    </P>
    <P>The new partnership between Erin Foods and Heinz for the development of exports of food products offers an assurance of a market for vegetables and other produce which will provide a basis for more intensive and profitable exploitation of small farms. This is especially important in the case of holdings which because of their size or type cannot be made viable by pursuing other forms of enterprise.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Western Development</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have said elsewhere that the greatest physical, human and social problem facing us in Ireland today is the preservation of the West of Ireland. If real progress is to be made quickly, all bodies which have responsibilities in the matter must realise the urgency of the situation. The Government are well aware of the economic and social difficulties which the people have to face in these areas and are treating the twelve Western counties as a special development region. We have decided on a number of further steps to encourage and assist local development.</P>
    <P>Although every effort is being made to intensify agricultural development, the expansion of incomes of the rural community can be achieved only by a comprehensive development programme aimed at increasing employment and income derived from industry, tourism, angling, forestry and fishing as well as agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to extend substantially the size of the <Col N="1272" /> pilot areas and, having studied a progress report by the Department of Agriculture's Western Regional Officer, are satisfied that land structural reform is the next essential step in the economic development of the areas and indeed of all similar small farm districts in the West. They have, therefore, approved a proposal of the Minister for Lands to initiate an intensified programme of land settlement by the Land Commission in the extended Pilot Areas over and above the normal annual land settlement programme.</P>
    <P>To finance this intensified programme in the Pilot Areas in the current year I am making available an additional sum of £200,000. It is the intention to mount this campaign vigorously in the Pilot Areas and to press ahead until the whole task is satisfactorily completed. Structural problems of fragmentation, intermixed rundale holdings and small uneconomic holdings will be dealt with comprehensively. Utilising to the full the powers provided by the Land Act, 1965, particularly the new life-annuity and self-migration schemes, vacant and derelict holdings and lands not being fully utilised will be freed and made available to assist materially in the implementation of the structural reform programme.</P>
    <P>Industrial investment in the underdeveloped counties should be greatly stimulated by the &ldquo;free depreciation&rdquo; provisions I have announced today. The first factory set up on the new industrial estate at Galway is expected to commence operations next month and work on the estate will be intensified during the summer. Foras Forbartha are having a planning study carried out in Carraroe in the Connemara Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Employment at the Shannon Industrial Estate continues to expand, having risen by 660 in 1966. Production at the estate has also been rising rapidly, the total value of output last year being estimated at £27 million. It is expected that, by 1970, output worth £40 million will be produced at the Shannon Estate. This is double the estimate in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>In many areas of the West, tourism <Col N="1273" /> offers the main prospect for expanding incomes. Registered hotel and guesthouse accommodation in the twelve underdeveloped counties has increased at an average rate of 6 per cent in the last few years and the number of guest-rooms will show a further increase of that order in 1967. Supplementary accommodation is also rising at a rapid rate in the West, the increase in the number of guest-rooms in 1967 being estimated by Bord Fáilte at about a quarter. This particular development generates incomes where this is likely to have the greatest social advantage. At the request of the Minister for Transport and Power who is convinced of the importance of farmhouse tourism, I am providing an additional capital sum of £100,000 this year to enable Bord Fáilte to mount an all-out campaign for the development of supplementary rural accommodation&mdash; mainly farmhouses &mdash; in the West. Moreover, the western counties will benefit preferentially under a revised scheme of incentive grants for additional hotel accommodation which I shall outline in a moment.</P>
    <P>Angling is assuming increasing significance in the expansion of tourism in the West and in some of the midland counties which have only recently entered the tourist field on a major scale. The Inland Fisheries Trust has been doing good work for fishing development and an extra £25,000 has been provided for the Trust this year.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the maximum development will take place in each sphere of economic activity in the West, a special survey of each county is being prepared and I expect to have these within the next few months. The surveys will provide a framework for development in each county.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, essential that there should be complete co-ordination between all interested parties in both the planning and implementation of the various measures required for local development in the West. Such co-ordination within each county will be effected by the County Development Team under the chairmanship of the County Managers. These Development Teams have brought considerable initiative to bear on the solution of <Col N="1274" /> local problems and I am pleased with the progress they have made, particularly in the last year during which each Team has had the services of a full-time Secretary who acts as Development Officer for his county. The leadership which the Teams and their secretaries are bringing to the West is indeed heartening since this is perhaps the thing most gravely needed in the region. I have no doubt that the County Development Teams will play a major role in promoting the development of the West. I now propose to take the necessary steps to put the Teams and the County Development Officers on a permanent basis, with adequate administrative machinery to be fully effective. I intend to take up with the various Government Departments and State agencies dealing with the West the question of strengthening the arrangements they have with the County Development Teams so as to provide the backing which will enable the Teams to move ahead quickly in co-operation with local voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>A fact which the work of the County Development Teams has brought out clearly is that there are quite a number of worthwhile projects in the West which could, with very little direct assistance, be put on an economic footing. As an illustration I might mention two co-operative ventures, one in Roscommon and one in West Cork, where relatively small help was afforded and as a result a significant amount of work and income will, I hope, be generated among the small farming communities concerned. These and similar projects involving local effort and initiative are deserving of encouragement and I do not want to see any of them fall by the wayside for want of reasonable financial or technical assistance. There is often a gap between what can be raised from existing State institutions and private sources, including reasonable local contributions, and the full cost of getting good projects off the ground. To meet this sort of situation there is provided in the Estimate for my Department a sum of £20,000 for special assistance for such projects. This would not, however, be nearly <Col N="1275" /> enough to meet requirements if the County Development Teams generate activity at the rate we hope they will. I have, therefore, decided to increase the provision to £250,000 so as to create a fund out of which payments will be made to assist the development of worthwhile projects in the twelve underdeveloped counties which are inaugurated either by the teams or otherwise. The Fund, which will be known as the Special Regional Development Fund, will be administered with the greatest possible degree of flexibility in providing supplementary finance for desirable projects.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tourism</i>
    </P>
    <P>To encourage the development of hotel accommodation throughout the country, but with special reference to the western areas, the adequacy of the existing incentive grants has recently been reviewed. As a result, it has been decided to introduce new and increased grants generally and to give extra inducements by way of more generous rates of grant in the western counties towards the construction of new hotels and the provision of additional bedrooms and dining facilities.</P>
    <P>At present the maximum grant available to new hotels in the remote tourist centres is 25 per cent of the total construction cost. This maximum is being increased to 35 per cent for new hotels in the western counties. Where a hotel does not qualify for the total construction grant, the grant available up to now was one of 20 per cent in respect of new bedrooms. This 20 per cent limit is being raised to 40 per cent generally and to 50 per cent in the western counties. Dining areas and kitchens in new hotels not receiving the total construction grant have, up to the present, not been eligible for any grant. In future these facilities will qualify for a grant of up to 20 per cent generally and 30 per cent in the western counties. In addition, for the first time, grants will be available for the development of caravan and camping sites &mdash; up to 50 per cent of the cost of the works subject to a maximum of £20,000 per site. This <Col N="1276" /> grant will apply in the western counties and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The various grants which I have mentioned for new tourist accommodation will be administered by Bord Fáilte. Over and above this, new hotels and the extension of existing hotels in Gaeltacht areas qualify for additional State grants under a scheme operated by Roinn na Gaeltachta. In future in these cases the combined rate of grant from both sources for new bedrooms can be as much as 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>The generous range and level of grants now fixed is a further recognition by the Government of the importance of tourism to the country at large and especially to the western areas. I hope that these improved incentives will help to raise appreciably the level of investment in tourist accommodation and, in particular, that they will be availed of extensively in the western counties where the potential for increased tourism is so great.</P>
    <P>Details of these various schemes will be announced by Bord Fáilte shortly. Their cost this year is allowed for in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>I believe that with this strengthening of the apparatus for the development of the West, the way is now clear for a new and more intensive onslaught on the problem. I emphasise, however, that the impetus for this must come primarily from local effort. The button must be pressed in the West itself. I appeal, therefore, for a great new development of local initiative from Cork to Donegal to undertake the work requiring to be done and I assure everybody concerned that no worthwhile and realistic project in any area will be allowed to fail if official assistance can make it succeed. I appeal, also, to all those in the public service who are involved at any level to bring a new enthusiasm and dedication to their efforts and to concentrate all the administrative resources at their disposal to ensure success.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Mining</i>
    </P>
    <P>One of the significant growth areas of the economy in the last few years has been mining. The achievements of this sector have been impressive and have contributed very satisfactorily to <Col N="1277" /> employment and export earnings. I am told that a great future expansion in exploration and development is possible and that additional tax incentives can generate a large volume of outside investment. I have accepted this argument.</P>
    <P>A condition governing the existing reliefs from taxation in favour of profits from the mining of certain nonbedded minerals is that the trade of working the mine must be commenced within a period of twenty years from the 6th April, 1956. I propose to extend this period by a further ten years so that the reliefs will be available in respect of mining operations commenced before April, 1986.</P>
    <P>Many different types of allowances and incentives have been suggested but, instead of bringing in rather complicated new provisions, I have come down in favour of the simple decision to substitute for the existing reliefs a twenty-year period of complete exemption.</P>
    <P>I believe that Ireland now offers a very favourable sphere of activity to mining organisations and I hope they will not be slow to take advantage of this.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Oil and gas exploration</i>
    </P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the oil and natural gas strikes made by various oil companies in the North Sea and of the extension of their explorations to the Irish Sea. The Government are concerned to ensure that any gas or oil resources which may exist in the part of the Irish Sea over which we have exploration rights are exploited to the full. Legislation is being prepared to encourage and control exploration for these valuable sources of fuel and power. A consortium of companies has already been granted exploration licences covering the land area and territorial waters of the State.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Profits from land and property development</i>
    </P>
    <P>The House will recollect that there has been certain criticism of Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965, which is concerned with the charging of profits from dealing in or developing land, <Col N="1278" /> although there is no disagreement as to the fundamental need for the legislation. My predecessor invited detailed observations from interested parties and undertook to introduce this year such amendments of the law as might be appropriate. A considerable volume of comments and suggestions has been received and examined. As a result of my review I propose to recast the legislation extensively.</P>
    <P>As the law of property is of its nature very complex, the formulation of the legislation I am proposing will present some difficulties and I think that it would be unfair to ask the Oireachtas to concern itself with this intricate matter in the restricted time available for the discussion of the Finance Bill. I propose, therefore, to include my proposals in a Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in the autumn. This will allow more time for the work of drafting and the Oireachtas also will have a more extended opportunity to consider the proposals.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that the relieving provisions I shall be bringing in will be retrospective to the 6th April, 1965.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Appeal Commissioners</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Commission on Income Taxation recommended that the Special Commissioners should be relieved of all administrative duties so that they would become a purely appellate body; and that the designation &ldquo;Special Commissioner&rdquo; should be altered to &ldquo;Appeal Commissioner&rdquo;. Legislation to implement these recommendations will be introduced in the autumn.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Repeal of Section 490 of the Income Tax Act, 1967</i>
    </P>
    <P>Nobody enjoys paying income tax and some tend to dramatise the collection of tax properly due as a struggle between the citizen and the Revenue. There are two observations which I should like to make in this connection. Firstly, the officers of the Revenue Commissioners have instructions to draw the attention of taxpayers to any reliefs to which they appear to be clearly entitled but which they may have omitted to claim, and to respond <Col N="1279" /> freely to any requests that may be made by taxpayers for advice as to their rights and liabilities and for guidance in formulating claims to relief. Secondly, there is no such entity as &ldquo;the Revenue&rdquo; in the sense of an enemy of the citizen. Every good citizen ought to pay his tax and there must be effective means of dealing with deliberate evasion or refusal to pay. Tax which one person escapes paying is not conveniently wiped out but is shifted on to the shoulders of his fellow-citizens. Refusal to pay amounts to contempt of the Oireachtas. Public expenditure must be financed by revenue and revenue is vital to the functioning of the State.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that the Income Tax (Amendment) Act, 1967, repealed certain provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1967. Since doubts had been raised as to the constitutionality of these provisions I considered that the sensible thing to do was to repeal them. In the forthcoming Finance Bill I shall propose the repeal of section 490 of the same Act which has to do with the special form of execution order in revenue matters. I shall, however, be examining what provisions in the same field may be necessary at a later stage to aid the efficient collection of taxes and duties.</P>
    <P>I propose to make available shortly a loose-leaf edition of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and to issue from time to time fresh pages reflecting any future changes in the law. An index will also be provided.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other proposals</i>
    </P>
    <P>During the past few months I have received many suggestions, demands and proposals. Some I have been able to adopt, many others I have not. I should like to assure all those concerned, however, that the suggestions have all been sympathetically examined in detail and some which have not been adopted now have been put aside for consideration on another occasion.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Incomes Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters to which I would like to refer before I conclude. For reasons I have already <Col N="1280" /> stressed in this speech, amongst the more important of these is Incomes Policy.</P>
    <P>In the course of its Report on the Economic Situation 1965 the National Industrial Economic Council laid considerable stress on the necessity for an incomes policy and indicated the general principles which should guide it.</P>
    <P>The Government indicated at an early stage that they accepted the validity and relevance of the principles outlined in the report and in January, 1966, the then Minister for Finance moved a motion in Dáil Éireann agreeing generally with the views and recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>In so far as the incomes policy part of the report is concerned, I want, in view of certain doubts which have been expressed, to reaffirm one point made by the Minister for Finance on that occasion, namely, that the Government endorse the NIEC view that an incomes policy must embrace all categories of money incomes and should not be confined to wages and salaries alone.</P>
    <P>The NIEC recommendations on incomes policy were very wide and in some cases envisaged further examination of particular aspects of the problem. The Council has arranged to discuss the question further in the light of departmental comments on the various points involved.</P>
    <P>While certain aspects of the report require further consideration and examination, there is one matter on which action can be taken now. I refer to the imposition of a general obligation on every person carrying on a trade, profession, or profit-making activity of any kind to keep correct records of his basic business and professional transactions. This was recommended by NIEC and followed from proposals made earlier by the Commission on Income Taxation. So that the necessary preparations can be made, I am giving notice of my intention to introduce legislation next year to impose such a general obligation.</P>
    <P>The NIEC has emphasised that the purpose of an incomes policy is not to prevent profits &mdash; any more than wages or salaries &mdash; from growing. In its recent <Col N="1281" /> Report on Full Employment it again stresses the need for profits, this time in the context of providing jobs at adequate wages for all our people who wish to make their livelihood here. We cannot hope to attract the capital needed for development unless those providing it can expect a satisfactory return. Since total profits vary with turnover it is profit margins, rather than total profits, that need to be watched. The Government regard competition as the most effective way of guarding against excessive profit margins. The progressive implementation of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement will be a powerful factor in increasing competition. Cases may arise, however, where competition is not fully effective. These are at present dealt with under the provisions of the prices legislation which have been brought into force by the Prices Stabilisation Order, 1965 and this Order has recently been renewed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>European Economic Community</i>
    </P>
    <P>Events in train in recent months may lead to the reactivation of the applications of Ireland and other countries for membership of the European Economic Community. In that event we may have a relatively short period in which to complete the process of adjustment to Community conditions. Since 1963, when consideration of our application was suspended, the Government have been urging the country to act on the assumption that Ireland's membership may be a reality by 1970. More than half of that period has gone by, but I think it would be true to say that we are less than half-way towards the level of preparedness which prudent foresight demands. If we do not use the time remaining to us to the best advantage, we may have to pay a price in economic dislocation that could put in hazard the country's welfare for years to come. Moreover, our complacency would have caused us to miss an opportunity of achieving a degree of economic progress which would enable us both to exploit to a degree never before possible our economic potential and to play a full part in the shaping of the Europe of the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> Within the next few days the Government will be publishing a White Paper on the European Communities which will show clearly the kind of environment in which the economy may have to operate a few years hence. Everyone who has a responsibility in the field of economic activity should familiarise himself with the details of that environment. I would appeal particularly to industry, and this includes both management and labour, to face up to the prospect before it, since it is in the industrial sector that we expect to encounter the severest tests and so need to make the greatest adjustments. All that the Government have done by way of exhortation and inducement will be of little avail if industry itself fails to respond fully to the needs of the situation by raising its competitive efficiency to a level that can match that of its future competitors in an enlarged European Community.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Fiscal Harmonisation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Fiscal harmonisation and the ultimate abolition of fiscal frontiers are among the goals which the European Economic Community has set itself. It is only prudent that we should now be adapting our taxation system to the model which the EEC is shaping for its members. While certain aspects of the harmonised system have not yet been set out in detail, the Council has already approved draft directives regarding the adoption of a uniform added-value tax on expenditure on goods and services. The directives require that a tax of this kind must be brought into operation by all the member countries not later than 1st January, 1970. During the period of transition before fiscal frontiers are abolished, member countries will be required to impose this tax at all stages of production up to and including the wholesale stage. They may, in addition, impose a separate tax at either the wholesale or the retail stage. The eventual objective of abolishing fiscal frontiers will be achieved when the structures and rates of taxation, together with tax exemptions, are harmonised.</P>
    <P>It should be possible, without undue difficulty, to adapt our existing wholesale <Col N="1283" /> and turnover taxes to this pattern if our hopes of membership are realised. This task would be made much more difficult, however, if we were to amalgamate these two taxes as has been requested by certain interested bodies here. Apart, therefore, from the problems inherent in such a merger, it is clearly in harmony with our aspirations to membership of the EEC that the taxes should be preserved as separate entities for the present.</P>
    <P>
      <i>GATT Negotiations</i>
    </P>
    <P>To turn to another part of the international scene, Ireland has been taking part in the Kennedy Round of trade negotiations as a preliminary to accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as the GATT. The GATT is the main international forum for negotiating multilateral tariff reductions with a view to expanding world trade. Given a successful outcome to the Kennedy Round negotiations, we would hope to accede to the GATT shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>Naturally, we cannot hope to have the benefit of tariff reductions by other countries without conceding some reductions on our side. But the expansion of world trade is in our interest and the general reduction of tariffs should give Irish exporters new and worthwhile opportunities of stepping up their sales of goods abroad.</P>
    <P>Progress in the Kennedy Round negotiations has necessarily been slow since some 50 countries are taking part and the process of bargaining extends over the whole range of tariffs and non-tariff obstacles. The negotiations cover trade in agricultural as well as industrial products. On the agricultural front, which is of such importance to us, this has been the first serious attempt to get to grips with the problem of the very unsatisfactory world trading conditions and we had hoped for a substantial betterment by way of freer access to markets in other countries. Unfortunately, the latest indications are not encouraging and it now looks as if <Col N="1284" /> we cannot expect major improvements that would benefit our agricultural exports.</P>
    <P>The industrial sector presents a more encouraging picture and we hope that there will be a significant reduction in duties on our exports, particularly to continental Europe and North America.</P>
    <P>The negotiations are now in the final stage and, allowing for the completion of the necessary formalities, we may hope to become a contracting party to the GATT some time during the present year. If matters go well, this may be achieved within the next few months.</P>
    <P>Our application must be approved by two-thirds of the member countries. We expect that it will be possible for us to secure the necessary approval.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Decimalisation of Currency</i>
    </P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the recent controversy in Britain over the choice of the pound as the basis of decimal currency to be introduced there in 1971. Countries such as South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, which previously used the British system of pounds, shillings and pence, opted for a decimal currency based on a 10/unit in the belief that it had advantages over the pound. Here, too, the Metric System and Decimal Coinage Committee which reported in 1959 recommended in favour of a system based on a unit worth ten shillings and this recommendation was repeated by an official Working Party whose report was published in 1965. In each case, however, reservations were expressed as to what we should do if Britain adopted a different system.</P>
    <P>Our currency units have corresponded for a long time. Whatever doubts may be entertained about the choice of system in Britain, our approach to the question of what unit would best suit us must have regard to the advantages and disadvantages both of following suit and of taking a separate line. We must weigh up these considerations both as regards domestic and external transactions.</P>
    <P>Although the solution of this problem is becoming urgent we do not have to take a decision for some little time yet. I propose to make available shortly <Col N="1285" /> a booklet setting out in summary form a comparison of three systems, namely a system based in some form on the pound, a 10/- ½-cent system which would result in a two-to-one relationship with the proposed British system, and a 2/- cent system which would have a direct decimal relationship with the pound and be of the same order of magnitude as the chief European currencies.</P>
    <P>I expect that the Government will make a decision on the choice of system and on the establishment of a decimal currency board by the autumn. The publication of the booklet is intended to give a final opportunity for reflection and for the submission of considered views by interested persons and groups.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Banking Legislation</i>
    </P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a substantial growth in the number and type of banking and other financial institutions operating in the State. There is considerably greater freedom of entry here into the business of banking than is allowed in other countries and, on the recommendation of the Central Bank, I propose to seek the approval of the Government shortly for the introduction of legislation to control through the agency of the Central Bank the establishment of such institutions and to keep their operations under review so as to provide greater protection for people depositing funds with them and to ensure that, as far as possible, future developments in banking are in conformity with the national interest.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Services Reorganisation</i>
    </P>
    <P>As the House already knows, a group was set up by my predecessor in September last to examine and report on organisation in the public services at the higher levels. This group comprises distinguished members with a variety of experience, including a high-ranking official generously made available by the Government of Norway. I understand that their investigations are making steady progress and I am confident they will have valuable recommendations to make.</P>
    <P>Meantime, no effort is being relaxed <Col N="1286" /> to maximise efficiency in the public service and to adapt it to the new tasks which face it. Organisation and methods surveys and work study, carried out on a full-time basis by officers selected and trained specifically for this work, keep on yielding valuable results. The services of outside management consultants continue to be used for special investigations where it is felt that the necessary expert resources are not available within the civil service itself.</P>
    <P>Progress is being made towards the introduction of operations research in the civil service and the setting-up in my Department of an expert unit in this field. Operations research is one of the newest and most advanced of the modern techniques which are being developed as aids to decision-making. The expert operations research personnel of my Department will be deployed to the best advantage in various investigations in the civil service in much the same way as, on a different level, are the experts in my Department on automatic data processing.</P>
    <P>Training is reaching more civil servants at all levels. Much of the training is provided within the service itself but I am glad to acknowledge specially the valuable courses provided by the Institute of Public Administration. Civil servants are also sent to suitable training courses organised by the Irish Management Institute and by other bodies both in this country and abroad. Scholarships to a University to follow designated courses or to the School of Public Administration are provided for promising young officers. In general, there is increasing emphasis on training in economics and in techniques like cost-benefit analysis.</P>
    <P>One of my principal objectives will be to give my shareholders, the taxpayers, value for their money. It will be my constant aim to seek out economies and to strive for ever greater efficiency in public administration. Modern systems and methods will be introduced at every possible level and time-wasting and outworn procedures, where they still exist, will be eliminated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" />
      <i>Culture and Leisure</i>
    </P>
    <P>In modern society, as income standards rise, there is a compelling social necessity to devote increasing attention to the problems of leisure. To ensure that an adequate variety of cultural and recreational facilities is available for their people, and, indeed, to raise general standards in this respect, is now accepted as an obligation by enlightened governments everywhere. It would be unthinkable to abandon people to the monotony of a working life unrelieved by the stimulus of cultural and intellectual activity. Fortunately we have in the Irish language and in its promotion and development a great field for cultural endeavour which it will be one of my special responsibilities to foster. Television can, of course, be a most powerful influence in this, as in many other ways of creating wider and deeper interests. The State is already providing assistance to music, the arts and the theatre. I intend during the year to consider how these arrangements can be improved, particularly in relation to the live theatre.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Report on Full Employment</i>
    </P>
    <P>The NIEC published their report on Full Employment last month. This was no occasional paper but a searching and cogent document which should serve as a frame of reference for the nation's plans and policies during the next decade. The Government consider this report to be so important that they have arranged to have a special popular version prepared which will be distributed as widely as possible free of charge. The Council, in the words of the report, did not attempt to formulate a plan for full employment. Rather, having stated the problems and assessed their dimensions, the Council suggested some of the main elements of a broad strategy by which full employment might be pursued, examined some of the main obstacles which now lie in the way of its achievement and generally posed the choices which the community, if it wants full employment, must face and make.</P>
    <P>To achieve the objective of full employment there must be substantial <Col N="1288" /> and progressive increases over a prolonged period in output per worker, in the productivity of investment and in savings and exports. If the full potential of the economy is to be realised, the skills and knowledge within the community and the size, efficiency and up-to-dateness of the stock of capital must be radically improved. Above all there must be a change in attitudes and a genuine will to achieve full employment. This in itself will not be enough. We must also be prepared to accept the policies necessary to achieve full employment and to put them into effect, even where they conflict with the particular interests of individuals, of groups or of localities. This is the challenging message of the report.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Productivity Year</i>
    </P>
    <P>A central theme in the NIEC report is that productivity must be raised if employment is to be maintained and increased. The Council's call for greater efficiency is addressed to all sectors of the community, including industry and agriculture, distribution, the professions, and the public service. It must be answered not alone by the Government, which is already actively supporting the drive for increased productivity, but by individuals, firms, trade associations and professional bodies in the private sector. To focus national interest and effort on this urgent and vital work, the Government intend to make 1968 a National Productivity Year. Trade and professional bodies will shortly be approached for advice in launching this project. I am confident that the Government can rely on their full co-operation in making this a worthwhile and effective effort. A marked rise in productivity in 1968 would be an encouraging start along the road to full employment and a practical demonstration that the community regarded the NIEC report as a call to action.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Mid-term Review of Second Programme</i>
    </P>
    <P>The preparatory work on the review of the Second Programme is now nearing completion and will shortly be the subject of consultation with the <Col N="1289" /> NIEC. Realism must, of course, be the keynote of this review. This will by no means exclude our doing better than we may now think likely, with obvious gains both in employment and prosperity. I look upon the few years now remaining to 1970 as a period in which two main objectives should be pursued: getting back to a steadily sustainable growth rate; and trying to bring about and consolidate the change in attitudes and policies required to set our economic programmes firmly in the perspective of full employment as pictured in the NIEC report.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>In this budget I am seeking to achieve a number of objectives. I want to make a contribution to stability in prices and costs by refraining from other than minimal increases in taxation. I have sought to improve the lot <Col N="1290" /> of the old and the needy, to develop a new urgency in the solution of western problems, and to bring about a better economic climate through a substantial increase in the incomes of the farming community. I want also to give a fillip to economic activity and to get production moving upward much more rapidly than it has been. Whether this endeavour will meet with full success this year, whether the necessary activity will be generated and resources expanded, depends on the efforts and attitudes of our people as a whole. We can get ahead during the coming year and be a great deal better off as a nation at the end of it if we really want to and if we are willing to seek no more from the community than we are prepared to contribute in return. This budget is my contribution and I am asking everyone else to make theirs in their own way and to the best of their ability.</P>

      <P>It is, I think, fair to remind Deputies &mdash; and people outside do not require to be reminded of this &mdash; that in recent years we have had a succession of Budgets, each one imposing a considerable added burden of taxation. Last year alone £12 million in extra taxation was imposed on the people.</P>

      <P>And it is worth recalling that in this Budget today we have now reached a situation in which taxation has reached the peak of 28 per cent, which is seven per cent higher than that forecast in the Second Programme for the year 1970. It is against that background that the proposals the Minister has introduced today should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year's budgetary policy was a mistake; that is clearly admitted now by the Minister for Finance in his statement here today. We pointed out, particularly last June, that what the then Minister was doing, and what the Government were doing, was deflating an economy already very much deflated. The people who have to pay for the successive mistakes of Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance are not Fianna Fáil Deputies, except when it <Col N="1302" /> comes to an election, but the unfortunate people endeavouring to hold down a job, or to get a job. As a result of mistakes made in the past in relation to work, to employment, to the number of people at work and likely to be at work in this country, it is worth recalling that we are now 50,000 off target and that there are at present 14,000 fewer people at work than there were when the Second Programme for Economic Expansion was initiated three years ago. Of course something must be done: if this trend were to continue into this year, I believe the patience of the people would be tried sorely. Of course something has to be done, this year in particular, because the Government are facing a test in the local elections. The people know this and of course the people will demonstrate in no uncertain way what they think of this doubledealing that has been going on with Budgets.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether they will, but it is worth recalling, in relation to agricultural production, that over the past five years agricultural output has increased by less than one per cent. That has meant that the lot of every farmer, big and small, in this country has been severely tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks in his Budget Statement about preparing for Europe. <Col N="1303" /> Indeed, I applaud everything he says but, if we are to go into Europe, we look forward to entry into the European Community because it may mean a tremendous opportunity for Irish agriculture. Have the Government been preparing for that? The plain fact is that in their preparations during the past few years there has been nothing but feuding and bitterness and gimmicks of one kind or another. That is not the way to prepare us for something which may involve our destiny as a nation. Whatever is being done for agriculture here is a step in the right direction. I hope it may mean that from now on an objective and realistic appraisal will be made of what is required for agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is to be derating up to £20. I am glad the Minister for Finance is the latest Fianna Fáil Minister who has read the Fine Gael <i>Towards a Just Society.</i> I am sorry, though, that the Minister did not read it fully and that he should stop at £20. Of course there has been the scaled relief up to £33 but our proposal was to derate all holdings up to £25 valuation.</P>
    <P>On social welfare, may I comment that it is not necessary for me or for any Deputy to say a word of welcome when anything is done in relation to social welfare? However, it is right that I should comment that whatever is being done should have been done a long time ago. Last year, one of the greatest frauds ever perpetrated in relation to social welfare was the 5/increase which old age pensioners thought they were getting but which few of them got. One may say there has not been anything constructively done in relation to social welfare during the past 24 months. During that period the cost of living has increased very significantly. Whatever is proposed to be done in this Budget is very little indeed and why then is there again the postponement of benefits until next August? If we are to give relief where relief is necessary, can we not reach a stage, particularly when the money is available, particularly when a Minister for Finance can point to a surplus when we can give it here and now?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> Again it is postponed and the poor old couple and the poor old person who are to get some concession in relation to travelling and electric light cannot have it given now. Again it must be postponed until August when the nights are short and when there will not be a shilling saved on electric lights. Still in regard to social welfare, I am disappointed that once again there has not been an imaginative approach to the whole problem. Again there is to be merely an increase, and as surely as it is given it will be taken away by rising prices, but there has not been an effort to look to our social welfare structure.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal to give relief in relation to children's allowances to those who pay income tax. What about the many families who are not within the income tax bracket and to whom the cost of living is a very serious threat? Why has not something been done there? It is about time the reliefs for such persons were increased. A measure of that kind would be, in my view, some worthwhile approach to the area of greater need and greater hardship.</P>
    <P>Again I hope Deputies noted &mdash; I noticed one commentator indicated that I would say something about what is not in the Budget &mdash; that one thing that is not in it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is anything to provide for the great health scheme which we were promised by the present Minister for Education when he was Minister for Health. Is that to be postponed again until Tibb's Eve or does it ever come? Once again, with a Budget with a surplus, money cannot be found to provide for the limited health proposals contained in the White Paper on Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say this in general with regard to the Budget? There are many other provisions in it which we have advocated from time to time. I am sure Deputy Patrick Byrne will be pleased in particular that a case he has made many times in relation to an allowance for medical expenses has at last been adopted and I am sure it will do <Col N="1305" /> Deputy Byrne no harm in his constituency of North-East Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Also we have raised here from time to time the position of people living on fixed pensions who have no one except an Opposition to speak for them. I say very sincerely to the Minister on their behalf: &ldquo;Thanks for what is proposed to be done in relation to pensions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the Budget is, as has been indicated, one which was forced on the Government by the solid weight of public opinion. Indeed whatever active view might have been expressed by people as the Budget came closer was certainly reinforced by the OECD survey on Ireland, just recently published here. The team who did the work indicated clearly that our economic situation required a Budget which would be in marked distinction from the budgetary proposals adopted last year. Therefore, while we can welcome the fact that this is not the same kind of Budget as was introduced last year, we must point to the fact that as a result of the serious mistakes made over recent years in relation to economic progress and advancement, we are now some two years behind.</P>
      <P>We have 14,000 fewer people at work. We are 50,000 short of our target. We have not seen any semblance of a policy for the development of agriculture as our main industry. The only target we have exceeded in the Second Programme is that of taxation. We have now reached a level at which we are seven per cent higher than the highest peak imagined in the Programme. Whatever applause Fianna Fáil Deputies may give to the Minister for Finance, they are welcome to give it in the full knowledge that a great deal more must be done if this country is to be saved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's Budget proposals were applauded by members of the Fianna Fáil Party when he sat down. I have no doubt his proposals <Col N="1306" /> will be applauded by those sections who are going to benefit from the concessions which have been announced. I think it would be a mistake to take the popularity of those proposals with certain sections as an indication of the state of the economy. I am not an economist, but I do not think one needs to be an economist to see how very easy the Minister's task was in distributing those benefits to social welfare and to the farming community. He had a surplus of £1.3 million and there is another story to that. He decided he was going to put 2d on the packet of cigarettes and a penny on the pint, from which he will get £2½ million. Then he blandly says for errors of estimation, £4 million. That is a pretty simple business. One wonders why, when one thinks of the Budget last year, there was no provision at all for errors of estimation. I would say that last year's Budget was, to some extent, a &ldquo;hookey&rdquo; Budget. I should say the two Budgets of last year were &ldquo;hookey&rdquo; Budgets. By reason of that we found ourselves, in 1966, in one of the worst positions we had been in for very many years.</P>
      <P>There was great joy when it was made known that there was a surplus as the result of the two Budgets of last year. We are told that the Budget was balanced and this was a terrific thing. We had the first Budget last year before the Presidential election. This was not a very bad Budget. As a matter of fact, there were some concessions. The other Budget came when the election was over. It introduced the wholesale tax which we now have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot look at this Budget on its own. We must remember it was the Fianna Fáil Party who introduced the turnover tax, and the Fianna Fáil Party who introduced the wholesale tax last year. Those taxes are still with us and there is nothing in the Minister's speech to indicate that there is any alleviation in respect of food in regard to the turnover tax or in respect of other necessaries as far as the wholesale tax is concerned. As a matter of fact, an error of £1 million was made in the estimation of the amount of wholesale tax which it was expected would be brought in. That is a pretty <Col N="1307" /> big mistake, a pretty big error. One wonders whether or not this was a deliberate error on the part of the Minister for Finance at that time.</P>
    <P>In any case as far as the new situation is concerned, it is not really important because I have still to be shown what is sacrosanct about a yearly balancing of payments. We seem to have a phobia in this country with regard to balancing a Budget every year and to have no regard to the three, four or even five years ahead. We should have some regard to the time ahead and not be badgering people as far as taxation is concerned.</P>
    <P>In any case the Budgets of last year were balanced but a lot of things went wrong. Some of those were pinpointed in the Minister's speech, in the NIEC report and to some extent by the Department of Finance. A balanced Budget is no criterion of the state of the nation. If it were, last year should have been an extraordinarily good year for the Irish people. As a matter of fact, it was a pretty bad year all round. The gross national product increased by less than one per cent as against four per cent envisaged when the Second Programme was announced. The unemployment figures jumped by six per cent as against 5.6 per cent in 1965. There were 7,000 fewer at work in March, 1966 than there were in March, 1965. There was an average of 64,000 out of work. This was caused by the general depressed state of agriculture and, to some extent, of manufacturing industry. This, in my view, was the responsibility of the Government, and particularly the Minister for Finance who last year introduced a Budget which to a large extent caused deflation and to some extent caused increased unemployment. We had this lack of growth and we had also this depressed agriculture and another increase in emigration.</P>
    <P>The new taxation introduced last year, in my view, was the cause of some slowing-down in the general economy. It certainly slowed down growth. During March, April, May and up to June, when we had the second Budget introduced, the balance of payments showed itself to be improving. <Col N="1308" /> The Government were guilty of neglect here. Despite this, we had those drastic measures &mdash; restriction of credit, restriction of hire purchase transactions and restriction of capital, as far as Government finances are concerned. This was bad judgment by the Government last year, to some extent. As far as I can see from the Minister's speech, there is not any great hope of encouragement this year, particularly for employment. The Minister held out no ray of hope in that regard. The excellent report got out by the NIEC goes for naught unless the Government take the initiative and the proper steps. Certainly there is nothing in this Budget to ensure that growth will be stimulated, to some extent, and that we can reach full employment, if not by 1981, at least by 1986.</P>
    <P>We are told the present year should be a good one but reading the Report of the Department of Finance, nearly all the good things are blotted out by something on the other side. We are told that the prospects for 1967 are good because we are to have more exports as a result of free trade and the removal of the British import levy. On the other hand, we are told &mdash; and this I find contradictory and somewhat cancelling out &mdash; as against this that there will be depressed demand in Great Britain due to a standstill in incomes and a slowing down in demand in the EEC countries. They also mention a deterioration in competitiveness with Britain, an increase in imports and consumption with the expansion of credit. I would like the Department of Finance or the Minister for Finance to explain that some time in the debate.</P>
    <P>We welcome these concessions to the farmers and to the social welfare recipients. In that they accord with our policy, we propose to give him the money for these concessions. We have said down through the years that if the Minister makes concessions in respect of deserving sections of the community, we will have no hesitation in giving him the money and this we propose to do. Let us not exaggerate what is being done. The non-contributory old age pensioner and the blind pensioner are to get an increase of <Col N="1309" /> 5s a week from, I think, next August. This is not a terrific thing in 1967. I appreciate the Minister's difficulties as far as money is concerned but we are not going to clap or applaud the Minister and the Government for bringing a man whose income is now £2 12s 6d up to £2 17s 6d. I do not want to go into the circumstances of such a man but I do not think it is anything we should be proud of that we are going to give a sick man £2 17s 6d a week.</P>
    <P>I think it is time we re-examined the whole social welfare code. The Minister for Social Welfare recently said we might now think of revising the code in order to bring it into conformity with the codes in countries of the EEC. I think it is long past the time when we should do this. We in the Labour Party have advocated that there should be this revised scheme and we have spelled out the outlines of our policy as far as social welfare is concerned. We want to see benefits linked to wages. We want to try to have our social security code conform with the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>We welcome the abolition of the employment period orders. I never could see the sense in them. Somebody may tell me I was Minister for Social Welfare. This is true. I think the Minister ought to be thanked in any case for taking this step which I think is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this will be the last Budget this year. The Minister for Finance in a very polished display on television the other night &mdash; I say this actor-wise &mdash; was asked what he was: was he an economist or an accountant? He should have been asked a third question. He is an economist and an accountant. He is a politician as well. I do not blame him for that but I would like to get an assurance from him now that they have tidied the accounts of this country and that this will be the last Budget this year. We are to have the local elections this year. They are very important to the Fianna Fáil Party, to the Fine Gael Party and to the Labour Party. It will be absolute fraud and absolute dishonesty if after these elections the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="1310" /> or somebody else puts into effect some order whereby the cost of stamps, telephones or something else is increased.</P>
    <P>This is the time when we should know what our commitments are and what our expenditure is to be for the next 12 months. In the past 12 months we had Fianna Fáil breaking it up into two sections in order to get maximum support for their candidate in the Presidential election. This country has given Fianna Fáil a reasonable chance. Time passes quickly. This is the eleventh successive Fianna Fáil Budget and it is the third different Minister for Finance who introduced the Budget on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Government. I do not see many new ideas in it. I do not see any ideas about the stimulation of growth in any of the Minister's proposals. In anything he said there do not seem to be any new ideas. In 11 years we seem to have the same old story, the same story of stop-go, stop-go, stop-go. It seems that when certain sections of this community appear to be getting into relevant prosperity or relevant comfort something happens.</P>
    <P>Ministers of late, particularly the Minister for Labour, have been trying by inference and innuendo to suggest that all economic ills may be laid at the door of the trade union movement. The past year has proved that to be incorrect in view of the reasonable attitude adopted by the trade union movement. I would like to warn the Minister for Labour, the Minister for Transport and Power, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance if they continue with that type of antagonistic speech, they may find themselves in a situation in which the trade union movement will not lie down under this sort of criticism but will decide to assert the rights which they believe they still have.</P>
    <P>This is a question of getting £2½ million from cigarettes and beer and then bringing in this notional figure of £4 million and getting £7.8 million, a relatively easy thing to distribute. I think the Minister has distributed it pretty fairly, having regard to the fact that he has only £7.8 million, but <Col N="1311" /> I believe an important thing for the Minister now and in the course of the year is to ensure that employment will rise, and rise rapidly, and that there will be not alone employment but security for the men and women in industry and in agriculture.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1) That, subject to the next paragraph of this Resolution, the duty of customs on tobacco imposed by section 20 of the Finance Act, 1932 (No. 20 of 1932), shall, as on and from the 12th day of April, 1967, be charged, levied and paid at the several rates specified in Part I of the Schedule to this Resolution in lieu of the several rates specified in Parts II and III of the Third Schedule to the Finance Act, 1966 (No. 17 of 1966).</P>
      <P>(2) That &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) this paragraph applies to manufactured tobacco which was manufactured in, and consigned from, the United Kingdom and was manufactured therein from materials other than materials falling within Tariff Heading number 24.02 in the Schedule to the Imposition of Duties (No. 159) (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) Order, 1966 (S.I. No. 132 of 1966),</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) the customs duty on tobacco mentioned in paragraph (1) of this Resolution shall, as on and from the 12th day of April, 1967, and before the 1st day of July, 1967, be charged, levied and paid on manufactured tobacco to which <Col N="1313" /> this paragraph applies at the several rates specified in Part II of the Schedule to this Resolution in lieu of the several rates specified in Part I thereof and shall, as on and from the 1st day of July, 1967, be charged, levied and paid on manufactured tobacco to which this paragraph applies at the several rates specified in Part III of the Schedule to this Resolution in lieu of the several rates specified in Parts I and II thereof.</P>
    <P>(c) the provisions of section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duties imposed by this paragraph &mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) with the substitution of &ldquo;the area of application of the Acts of the Oireachtas&rdquo; for &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; and as though the expression &ldquo;manufactured tobacco&rdquo; in the first column of the Second Schedule to that Act did not include manufactured tobacco to which this paragraph applies,</P>
    <P>(ii) as though manufactured tobacco to which this paragraph applies, together with the descriptions of such manufactured tobacco in Part II or III (as may be appropriate) of the Schedule to this Resolution, were mentioned separately in the said first column and the appropriate preferential rates specified in that Part were mentioned in the second column of the said Second Schedule opposite the mention of those goods in the first column thereof, and</P>
    <P>(iii) subject to the last paragraph (beginning with &ldquo;Goods shall not be deemed&rdquo;) of subsection (1) of the said section 8 being disregarded,</P>
    <P>(d) in this paragraph the expression &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; means Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands,</P>
    <P>(e) the expression &ldquo;hard pressed tobacco&rdquo; mentioned in Parts II <Col N="1314" /> and III of the Schedule to this Resolution and the next subparagraph of this paragraph has the same meaning as it has in section 17 of the Finance Act, 1940 (No. 14 of 1940),</P>
    <P>(f) the expression &ldquo;other pipe tobacco&rdquo; mentioned in Parts II and III of the Schedule to this Resolution means manufactured tobacco of kinds normally intended to be used in pipes, not being hard pressed tobacco.</P>
    <P>(3) That the duty of excise on tobacco imposed by section 19 of the Finance Act, 1934 (No. 31 of 1934), shall, as on and from the 12th day of April, 1967, be charged, levied and paid at the several rates specified in Part IV of the Schedule to this Resolution in lieu of the several rates specified in Part V of the Third Schedule to the Finance Act, 1966.</P>
    <P>(4) That, subject to the provisions of paragraph (5) of this Resolution, there shall be charged, levied and paid on all stocks of tobacco of every description which at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 11th day of April, 1967, are in the ownership or possession of a licensed manufacturer of tobacco and in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse, a duty of excise, payable by the manufacturer, at the following rate, that is to say:</P>
    <P>(a) so far as the stocks consist of unmanufactured tobacco, three shillings and five pence for every pound weight of the stocks, and</P>
    <P>(b) so far as the stocks consist of tobacco (including snuff) other than unmanufactured tobacco, three shillings and five pence for every pound weight of unmanufactured tobacco from which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, the stocks were derived.</P>
    <P>(5) That the duty provided for by paragraph (4) of this Resolution shall not be chargeable on any manufactured tobacco (including cigarettes, cigars and snuff other than offal snuff) as to which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that it was at five <Col N="1315" /> o'clock in the afternoon of the 11th day of April, 1967, fully prepared for sale by retail and that either &mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) it was not the product of any operation carried out by any manufacturer in whose ownership or possession it was at that time; or</P>
    <P>(ii) it was at that time held as retail stock in premises used for selling tobacco by retail; or</P>
    <P>(iii) it was at that time in transit from seller to buyer under a contract of sale:</P>
    <P>Provided that no tobacco shall be deemed for the purposes of this paragraph to have been fully prepared for sale by retail if, according to the ordinary course of business of the person in whose ownership or possession it was or to whom it was in transit, it had still to be subjected to some further process (other than packing) before being sold by him.</P>
    <P>(6) That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall not later than the 18th day of April, 1967, make a return to the Revenue Commissioners in a form approved by them giving such information as they may thereby require and, in particular, showing the quantities by weight of tobacco of every description in his ownership or possession at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 11th day of April, 1967, in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse.</P>
    <P>(7) That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) produce, if so required, to any officer of Customs and Excise the trade books and all accounts and documents belonging to or in the possession of such manufacturer which are necessary for verifying the return made in pursuance of paragraph (6) of this Resolution, and</P>
    <P>(b) render all reasonable assistance to such officer in the taking of an account of the tobacco which was in the ownership or possession of such manufacturer at five <Col N="1316" /> o'clock in the afternoon of the 11th day of April, 1967.</P>
    <P>(8) That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall, immediately upon making the return required by paragraph (6) of this Resolution or on the 18th day of April, 1967, whichever is the earlier, pay to the Revenue Commissioners the full amount of the duty mentioned in paragraph (4) of this Resolution on any tobacco which was in his ownership or possession at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 11th day of April, 1967, and was chargeable with the said duty, and the Revenue Commissioners may, if they think fit, defer the payment of the duty to a date not later than the 1st day of November, 1967, upon the manufacturer giving security by bond or otherwise to their satisfaction that such duty will be paid.</P>
    <P>(9) That every manufacturer required by paragraph (6) of this Resolution to make such return as is mentioned in that paragraph who either fails to make such return or makes a return which is incomplete, false or misleading in any material respect or fails or refuses to do anything which he is required by paragraph (7) of this Resolution to do shall be guilty of an offence under the statutes relating to duties of excise and shall for every such offence incur an excise penalty of fifty pounds, and all tobacco in relation to which such offence was committed shall be forfeited.</P>
    <P>(10) That where drawback is payable in respect of tobacco on which the excise duty provided for by paragraph (4) of this Resolution has been paid, such drawback shall, to the extent of the duty paid in pursuance of the said paragraph (4) as determined by the Revenue Commissioners, be a drawback of excise.</P>
    <P>(11) It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a reference to the fact that the average increase would be 2d per packet. As happened last year, because of the different sizes of cigarettes and because of the difference between tipped cigarettes and ordinary cigarettes, somebody will make substantial gain. The Minister gave a guarantee that the manufacturers would plough that back into the industry. I hope I took him up correctly. What does that mean? Will they give more coupons, more coloured cigarette cards, or will they give better prizes for their competitions?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not try to make some arrangement with the tobacco companies whereby this substantial amount of money would in fact come back to the Exchequer, rather than what is happening? <Col N="1321" /> Perhaps the Minister could give us some figures. Last year some estimated figures were given which appeared to me to be colossal and the amount was divided between the tobacco companies as a result of the difference in size and price of standard cigarettes. Has the Minister any estimate of what the difference would be or could he perhaps, later on, give us some figures of what the tobacco manufacturers will net?</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am getting all I am looking for. I am getting my pound of flesh and the tobacco manufacturers will not make anything on this because of the inadequacy of the possible adjustment of the margins. In so far as any surplus will arise to them, which is not coming to me, they will put it into the cigarette.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £11,969,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1968, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain Services administered by that Office; for the Pay and Expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> The Estimate for Defence for 1967-68 is for a sum of £11,969,000, which is £1,167,000 more than the amount voted for 1966-67. Deputies will recollect, however, from the Supplementary Estimate which I introduced recently that, because of the tenth round pay increases and other factors, the Dáil would have had to be asked for a very substantial sum rather than the token £10 actually sought, were it not that appropriations in aid for 19661967 greatly exceeded expectations. More than one-half of the £1,167,000 by which the present Estimate exceeds last year's figure is due to these tenth round increases.</P>
    <P>During the past year Ireland continued to contribute contingents to the United Nations Force in Cyprus. This Force was established, following a resolution dated 4th March, 1964, adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations, and with the consent of the Government of Cyprus. Its functions were defined as follows:</P>
    <P>In the interest of preserving international peace and security, to use its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of fighting and, as necessary, to contribute to the maintenance and restoration of law and order and a return to normal conditions.</P>
    <P>Since the inception of the Force, Ireland has been supplying contingents and, with six-monthly rotations, three battalions and five infantry groups have served in Cyprus. The 7th Infantry Group comprising some 500 troops, all ranks, and a headquarters staff element of 18 has now completed its six months tour of duty. It has been replaced by the 8th Infantry Group under the decision of the Government to accede to the Secretary General's request for maintenance of an Irish contingent with the Force until the current extension of the United Nations mandate expires on 26th June next. By that date, 21 Irish units and associated staff elements will have had, between them, seven years' continuous service with United Nations Forces, first in the Republic of the Congo and then in the Republic of Cyprus. The total strength, all ranks, of these formations is about <Col N="1328" /> 11,250 troops. Bearing in mind the relatively small strength of the Army, its contribution to the maintenance of world peace during those seven years ranks with the best and both the personnel who served abroad and those who shouldered the extra duties thereby created at home deserve congratulations on a job well done.</P>
    <P>In the course of an address to officers and men of the 7th Infantry Group on the occasion of the presentation to them of the United Nations Cyprus Medal, the Force Commander, Lieutenant-General Martola, said:</P>
    <P>It is a great pleasure for me to visit the Irish contingent serving with the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. You are halfway through your tour here and I would like to express my most grateful and sincere thanks and appreciation to all of you for the excellent work you have done. Many times the work has been hard for you, serving as you do under great pressure and arduous circumstances, but showing patience and endurance of a high military standard, you have at all times remained firm and steadfast. You have carried out your work in a really excellent manner.</P>
    <P>During the year also Irish officers continued to serve with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation which continues to observe the maintenance of the cease-fire in the former territory of Palestine and to assist the United Arab Republic, Syria, Jordan and the Lebanon, on the one side, and Israel on the other, in the supervision and observance of the terms of the Armistice Agreements concluded between them. At present there are ten Irish officers serving with the Organisation. I am happy to say that one of our officers was recently appointed Chairman of the Israel-Syria Mixed Armistice Commission. Irish officers have been serving with United Nations observation missions since 1958 when fifty officers acted in this capacity in the Lebanon. Since then, small numbers of officers have also served in West New Guinea and on the India-West Pakistan border. All these officers have made <Col N="1329" /> and are making a very worthwhile contribution to the work of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, I visited recently Irish troops serving in Cyprus and the Middle East. During the course of my visit to Cyprus, I had an opportunity of inspecting their camps and of speaking to many of the officers and men. I found everywhere that morale was high, that the health record was excellent and that the troops were doing a difficult job and doing it very well. During a few of the winter months weather conditions in Cyprus can be cold and wet, but, despite this, the troops go about their work cheerfully and with a will. While most of the accommodation is either under canvas or in semi-permanent huts, the United Nations has endeavoured to make the quarters as comfortable as circumstances permit and improvements in progress were noted by me. The men themselves take a very active part in the actual carrying out of these improvements and they also manage to make their surroundings as cheerful and attractive as possible. Indeed, I was greatly impressed by their industry and skill in this direction and their capacity to make the best of the situation.</P>
    <P>I had discussions with the Force Commander on the subject of accommodation and I believe that the improvements in hand and contemplated will leave things in a reasonably satisfactory state. It will be appreciated that the United Nations mandate in Cyprus has never been for longer than six months at a time and that the aim is to arrive as soon as possible at a situation where it can be ended altogether. In these circumstances, and having regard to the financial and political implications, I can well understand the reluctance of the United Nations to embark on a large scale programme for the provision of permanent, or even semi-permanent, accommodation. I am satisfied that the United Nations is doing its best to strike a fair balance in its handling of the accommodation problem. I did not have an opportunity of inspecting the accommodation of other contingents, but I was assured that contingents in <Col N="1330" /> similar locations to the Irish are similarly accommodated.</P>
    <P>Duty at observation posts is arduous but many of our troops to whom I spoke expressed a liking for it. While various factors, such as urban, rural and topographical conditions, local tensions and the occurrence of incidents, must necessarily affect the demands made on the personnel, it can be stated that all contingents are on an equal footing as regards duty.</P>
    <P>In the course of my visit to the Middle East, I met all the ten Irish officers serving with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation and I had an opportunity of seeing something of their operational conditions. These officers are mostly employed on observation duty on the various cease-fire lines, work which can be both delicate and difficult. I am happy to say that these officers are doing a wonderful job for the United Nations. I found them in good health and spirits. Incidentally, they rotate on a two-year basis.</P>
    <P>Everywhere I went, I found the greatest goodwill towards the Irish troops and praise for their impartiality and fairmindedness. I would like to express the sincere wish that the efforts of the United Nations in those countries will soon meet with complete success.</P>
    <P>It is a pleasure for me to record once again my appreciation of the public-spirited activities of many individuals and firms who continue to provide comforts for our troops serving overseas. Since 1960 the organisers of this laudable work have been providing, entirely on a voluntary basis, an avenue for persons and firms to express their appreciation of the contingents serving overseas and their goodwill towards the troops.</P>
    <P>This may be an appropriate point at which to bring the House up-to-date in relation to the reimbursement of this country's extra and extraordinary expenses arising from the supply of contingents to the United Nations Forces. As regards Cyprus, it is estimated that by 26th June next, when the current extension of the <Col N="1331" /> United Nations mandate will expire, Ireland will have incurred a total sum of approximately £1,600,000 in recoverable expenses. Of that amount, claims amounting to £1,361,200 approximately, have been presented to the United Nations and a total of £887,500 has been refunded to date.</P>
    <P>As regards the balance of approximately £473,700 outstanding against the claims already made, the Minister for External Affairs, on 8th February last, again gave the House the background to the situation in relation to allowances paid prior to 26th June, 1965, on which the Secretary-General has agreed to use his best endeavours to arrange for a refund. Representations for the refund of the balance outstanding are being pursued vigorously by the Minister for External Affairs. It will be noted that an amount of £248,800 has still to be claimed. This amount will be claimed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not think the full financial picture of our claims in respect of overseas service has been given up to now. As regards the Congo operation, our claims amounted to £1,680,000 odd for allowances, stores, etc. and these claims were fully met. A final claim, which covers odds and ends and will be for no more than a couple of thousand pounds, is being prepared. On the pensions side, claims amounting to almost £195,000 have already been made on, and met by, the United Nations in respect of benefits and expenses paid as a result of the death and disablement of members of the Defence Forces who served in the Congo. The only similar claim in respect of Cyprus, amounting to about £6,800, has also been met.</P>
    <P>Before I leave overseas service, perhaps I should recall for Deputies that recently I made awards of the Distinguished Service Medal to 65 officers and men of the Permanent Defence Force arising out of service with the United Nations Force in the Congo. I am sure that Deputies will wish to join in congratulating the recipients of these awards which give an indication of the excellent service and devotion to duty of the Irish units <Col N="1332" /> which served in the Congo. It is, I think, now generally known that the award of the Distinguished Service Medal is not confined to service with United Nations Forces and that it may also be awarded in respect of appropriate acts or service in home stations.</P>
    <P>Because of an improvement in the recruiting position, it was found possible recently to put a second corvette on fishery patrol duties. One corvette has been refitted for such duties, while another is undergoing a similar refit. The helicopter service, in addition to other duties, participated in 38 missions in 1966 involving the conveyance of emergency medical cases to Dublin hospitals. The apprentice training schemes at Naas and at Baldonnel, which are now very well known, continued as usual during the year, as did the schemes for the training of pilots for Aer Lingus at Gormanston Camp and the nautical training of fishermen at the Naval Base, Haulbowline.</P>
    <P>The Army Equitation Team participated in six international shows in 1966, and won five first prizes, one second, 12 third and eight fourth prizes, as well as 33 lesser prizes. Locally, 23 shows and 23 gymkhanas were attended, and a very large number of prizes won.</P>
    <P>Turning to Civil Defence, I am glad to say that good progress has been made during the past 12 months. A National Control Centre from which warning and advice could be broadcast in a radioactive fall-out situation and which will facilitate the conduct of training exercises has been established in my Department.</P>
    <P>Preliminary communication exercises, including the processing and plotting of simulated reports of radioactivity have been carried out with very satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>A County and County Borough Mobilisation Scheme, setting out the Civil Defence resources in manpower and equipment available, is in course of completion by all county councils and county borough councils. This scheme represents a considerable advance in the organisation of Civil Defence at Local Authority level. I <Col N="1333" /> wish to take the opportunity to express my appreciation for the co-operation of the county and city managers and other senior officers of local authorities concerned in the preparation of this scheme.</P>
    <P>In this connection I feel I should emphasise that the purpose of Civil Defence is to mitigate the effects of war on our people and that the operation of Civil Defence schemes within their functional areas is a statutory responsibility of local authorities. Many of the possible activities of Civil Defence would in fact be extensions on a very large scale of existing local authority functions, for example, hospitalisation of injured people and assisting homeless in getting shelter.</P>
    <P>The recruitment and training of Civil Defence personnel generally have continued to be satisfactory during the past year. The training of instructors for local authorities, the Civil Service, Defence Forces and Garda Síochána was continued during the year at the Civil Defence School. A series of week-end &ldquo;Methods of Instruction&rdquo; sessions on a regional basis has been introduced with a view to improving the general standard of instruction. These sessions have proved to be of particular value to Civil Defence instructors who have already qualified as such at the Civil Defence School but who do not normally engage in instructional work. Short Civil Defence courses for civil servants which were introduced in 1965-66 have been completed by many Departments.</P>
    <P>The policy of running week-end camps for Civil Defence, which gives excellent practice in mobilisation and movement of large numbers as well as opportunities for combined training, continues to receive excellent support from the volunteers. Local training, conducted by local Civil Defence instructors, continued at 340 centres during the year.</P>
    <P>Considerable publicity by way of Dáil Question and otherwise was given to County Controls some months ago. I would like, therefore, to take this opportunity of saying that these controls represent a vital link in the Civil Defence system. Under operational conditions the county organisation <Col N="1334" /> would be directed from them by the County Controller, usually the county or city manager, and his staff &mdash; approximately 50 in each case.</P>
    <P>Work is in progress on the establishment of a Regional Control, which will also be used as Dublin City and County Control, at Firmount House, Co. Kildare. As a result of further work there during 1967-68, the centre will be operational. Galway County Council has been authorised to proceed with arrangements for the incorporation of a county control in the basement of a proposed new technical school at Moneenageisha. With regard to other county controls, a number of local authorities are ready to proceed with the work.</P>
    <P>Throughout the past year the Irish Red Cross Society was, as usual, actively engaged in its commendable humanitarian work, and it is with pleasure that I record again my appreciation of the efforts of the members of the Society in this regard.</P>
    <P>During 1966 the Society donated over £11,000 towards the relief of hunger in India. The bulk of this considerable donation was made up of spontaneous contributions from the people of Ireland. The Society also contributed foodstuffs and clothing towards the alleviation of hardship caused by flooding in Italy. In addition, during European Refugee Week in October, 1966, it raised £3,000 for the benefit of refugees in African and Asian countries. It now has 17 refugees from North China at Naomh Aindrias Home in Dublin.</P>
    <P>As to the details of the Estimates, I have already mentioned the tenth round increases which came into operation last year. The effect of these is shown by the provisions in the major pay and allowances subheads &mdash; Subheads A, B, C, D and F. The Estimate is based on an average strength of 1,178 officers, 87 cadets and 7,150 noncommissioned officers and privates &mdash; that last figure being slightly higher than the average strength during 1966-67. The provisions for stores and services are higher than last year's because last year, for economy reasons, <Col N="1335" /> the provisions were not as high as I would have wished. The sums being provided represent essential minimum requirements which were determined only after the most careful examination. I do not think it is necessary for me to go over the various subheads in detail. Specifically, however, I may mention, that provision is being made for the building this year of six houses for married soldiers at Limerick, and for further improvements in accommodation and dining facilities for soldiers in barracks.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Army Pensions is for the sum of £2,539,000, which is slightly lower than last year's figure. While the provision for Defence Forces pensions continues to increase, there are inevitable reductions under other subheads as those in receipt of pensions in respect of the 1916-1923 period decline in numbers. As well, with the passage of time, many more special allowance holders than formerly are over 70 years of age and are eligible for old age pensions, especially contributory pensions, so that, while over 9,000 special allowances are being paid at present, there is a slight decrease in the average rate of allowance and the overall cost has not gone up in proportion to the numbers.</P>
    <P>Applications for the Service (1917-1921) Medal continue to be received in large numbers. There were more than 700 applications in 1966, and a further 170 have been received in the first three months of this year. Here I should like to repeat briefly what I said last year &mdash; that many people seem not to be applying for the Medal until they feel in need of a special allowance. If this trend continues, many applicants will be disappointed eventually, because former officers will not be available for consultation and so the applications will not be capable of being investigated. This difficulty has arisen already and is increasing. It would be well, therefore, that former members of the Old IRA and other organisations of the 1916-1923 period who feel entitled to the Medal should delay no longer in applying for it.</P>

      <P>I wish to join <Col N="1336" /> with the Minister in offering our congratulations to the armed forces for the magnificent work they have done in the service of the United Nations. It was but right and proper that the Minister should have gone abroad and have an opportunity of inspecting our troops in the manner he has described to us. In doing so, he was merely showing not only the appreciation of the Minister and the Government but the appreciation of the Oireachtas and the Irish people of the magnificent work they are doing. We are glad to hear of so many recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal. We all know the traditions of the Irish Army down through the years and it comes as no surprise to us to find that those officers and men have been found worthy of receiving this medal. However, I wonder has the medal been awarded to those who served in the Congo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right and just. I am very glad to hear from the Minister that those men who gave such distinguished service in the Congo will be honoured in the manner in which their colleagues in Cyprus have been honoured. Having said that, I should like to come to the Army at home. I am afraid there has been no new thinking since the establishment of the State on the manner in which our Army is being run. In going through the Estimate, I note that almost one-twelfth of the Estimate, in other words, one pound out of every £12 voted for Defence, is being paid to civilian employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out when dealing with the Supplementary Estimate that when the Army was first founded away back in 1922 and when we were at the height of that tragic Civil War, four Army officers or paymasters with a staff were sufficient to pay the entire <Col N="1337" /> Army. Here now we have not only Army paymasters but civilian paymasters checking their accounts: we have the Department of Defence, who are the civilians of course, the Department of Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor-General. We could depend entirely on the quartermaster staff of the Army to pay the personnel of the Army and to keep proper accounts without a civilian counterpart in the Department of Defence. That is something I advocated previously and something which we would have to do in time of an emergency or in time of civil or international warfare. It is something which we should practice now and thus cut down expenses.</P>
    <P>When I make the suggestion that the personnel of the Army should become their own quartermasters and paymasters, may I quote an example of how the civil branch of the Department of Defence can make a mess and muddle of things? It is in relation to grazing in the Curragh. Under a very old Act, 1872, the Board of Works administered grazing rights in the Curragh whereby adjoining farmers were entitled to graze one sheep per acre on the Curragh Camp land. Some short time ago the administration of this was taken over from the Board of Works by the civil branch of the Department of Defence. The regulations they made were so chaotic, as one circuit judge recently said, that any person who wants to do so may now graze sheep on the Curragh to the detriment of those who were traditionally entitled to graze sheep on those lands. That is one example of what a mess the civilian side of the Department has made in administering something in regard to which they had no experience.</P>
    <P>May I come back once more to the question of the Defence Forces as a striking force? We all hope that our Defence Forces will never be used for anything other than defence. I still believe, however, that a small active mobile force based on the Curragh, highly trained, the nucleus of a reserve or civilian army, as it were, would serve this country much better than the present system. At the moment our <Col N="1338" /> Defence Forces are scattered over many barracks throughout the city of Dublin, Victorian barracks on which no funds have been spent for years. The forces are therein engaged on guard duty, fatigues and so on. There is no scope whatsoever for what should be their main function, namely, that of soldier. These men should be removed from the city and concentrated in the Curragh. The barracks should be handed over to Dublin Corporation to be used as building sites or car parks. That would avoid the expense of upkeep on these ancient Victorian monuments. The Minister should consider this suggestion. One barracks should be retained as a military headquarters. There should be no difficulty about that.</P>
    <P>Certain personnel should be retained in the city for ceremonial purposes. Why do we hide our Army? I know men who have reached 20 years of age who would never have seen an Irish soldier, were it not for television. I do not know why we should hide our Army. All we ever see outside Leinster House even is a military policeman. Why do we not have a proper guard with due ceremonial? Years ago, when I was a student, one of the things we went to see was the changing of the guard outside the Bank of Ireland. That was an attraction. I believe it was one of the cheapest and best advertisements a recruiting officer could have. The Minister should look into this. No matter what magnificent work is done on the Curragh, it is not seen by the general public. The most the ordinary citizen sees is the small parade on St. Patrick's Day. Down the country the people have no hope of ever seeing a ceremonial parade.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no reference to the FCA. There is, I think, a great potential in that Force. The FCA should be the First Line Reserve. Possibly it is intended to be that, but in actual fact it is not. The Minister said there are 18,000 personnel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not include in that the military personnel. Last year a saving of a few paltry thousands of pounds was made by refraining from calling up the FCA for annual training. That should never have happened. We should not be afraid to spend money on the FCA. Not only should they be remunerated properly but they should have all the comforts and amenities to which the ordinary soldier of the line is entitled and which he receives. I appeal to the Minister to do what he can on behalf of that particular line of defence, the FCA.</P>
      <P>Some of the barracks allocated to the FCA have been allowed to fall into decav. Such property should be disposed of and there should be one county depot for each FCA battalion. It is a disgrace that Rockhill House in Letterkenny, which was occupied by the troops during the war and in which a magnificent chapel was built, has been allowed to fall into decay. The roof has been removed from the chapel. I regard that as desecration. It is a waste of public money to allow a chapel to fall into such a state of decay in 20 years that the roof should have had to be removed. We would be much better off if we scrapped all the military barracks in Donegal and concentrated on Finner Camp as a training depot for the FCA. The camp could be used for four or five months from spring to late summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what is being done with the forts on Lough Swilly. I understand there are some troops, or civilian personnel, occupying them. These forts are completely out of date. <Col N="1340" /> They should be dismantled forthwith and the guns sold as scrap.</P>
    <P>There is one appeal I should like to make to the Taoiseach and his Government, through the present Minister for Defence. The Taoiseach is a Corkman. He is a man who holds no bitterness in his heart. That is my honest opinion. I appeal to him this year to permit the Army in the month of August to honour its commander-in-chief, General Michael Collins, at Beal-na-Blath. The Army is above politics. Whatever bitterness may have been engendered in the Civil War is now gone. It would be a nice gesture if our magnificent Army, of which we are all so proud, were permitted to attend at Beal-na-Blath this year. I make my appeal through the Minister to the head of the Government. Let bygones be bygones and let honour be seen where honour is due.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the Military College and to my opinion that it would be a good thing if it could possibly be made a constituent of the National University, or, alternatively, that the personnel, the potential commissioned personnel, serving there were given an opportunity of doing a university degree. I do not think there would be any difficulty about it and it is something which the Minister should consider. It would raise the standard, not that I suggest for one moment that the standard of our commissioned personnel is low, of our commissioned personnel. It would give them a broader outlook and would give them an opportunity of acquiring a degree which would be most useful to them in their post-service days.</P>
    <P>On the question of our Naval Service, I am glad to see from the Minister's speech that a second corvette is now commissioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We all join with the Minister in that prayer. I wonder if, with due respect to the late Deputy T. Lynch, we could not adopt the attitude of his fellow and neighbouring Deputy, Deputy Esmonde, and try to procure a more up-to-date method of fishery protection than the antiquated corvettes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>They are outmoded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are outmoded, out-of-date and antiquated, and I think we could do something better to procure a more efficient and up-to-date patrol boat such as that used by the British Navy during the war, which used to be known as the torpedo boat. It is fast and capable of approaching certain poachers without being observed. These boats should be dispersed along our coastline. It would be a difficult matter but remember how our lifeboat services are organised. We have a lifeboat service scattered all over the coastline at strategic points. On the lifeboats generally, only two of the crew are permanently employed by the National Lifeboat Institution. We could have small torpedo boats manned by crews of five, six or seven persons, with, say, two of them trained, one in gunnery and one in navigation and mechanics, and the remainder recruited and paid on an hourly basis during the hours when they are employed. I believe it would be possible to work such a protection service and it would be much more advantageous to our fishery protection than the present outmoded corvettes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the personnel of our Naval Service. They are doing an excellent job with antiquated and undermanned ships. Something more could be done for fishery protection by employing these small, fast ships, possibly manned by two permanent members of the Defence Force and three or four members of the Reserve Force. They would be more of a surprise packet and less visible on the <Col N="1342" /> horizon than the antiquated steamdriven corvettes. It is something the Minister should consider. If such a ship were used in conjunction with our helicopter force, we could protect our fisheries more efficiently than we are doing. We have been told about the helicopter service in the Minister's speech and about the number of missions of mercy which they have operated. We should congratulate them on the magnificent work they are doing, but they could do more for fishery protection than they have done in the past. If they worked in conjunction and in close co-operation with fast torpedo boats, we would have less to fear from fishery marauders.</P>
    <P>We should bear in mind that as a result of overfishing the Dogger Bank and the North Sea are now practically completely denuded of fish and that the last fishing ground of Europe is that area from the west coast of Ireland to the Atlantic shelf which is reckoned to be no more than 20 miles wide. We should ensure that these 20 miles, for the protection of which we are responsible, should be fully protected because in ten or 15 years' time, with the advance in fishing techniques, there is the danger that that area between the west coast of Ireland and the Atlantic Shelf will be completely overfished and even completely denuded of fish.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to do what he can on behalf of fishery protection by rethinking as to the type of boat that should be employed, the manner in which these boats should be manned, and on liaison between the air arm and fleet arm of our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Turning to pensions, there is one difficulty from which some ex-Army pensioners suffer. Under the Defence Forces Pensions Scheme, pensions were paid and are being paid to ex-Army personnel. Under the Defence Forces Pensions (Amendment) Scheme, 1965, former officers of the Army who are pensioners and are in alternative employment and receiving remuneration in addition to their Army pension, and even where such employed people are remunerated from public funds, are not liable for an abatement of their pension; in other words, a man who serves <Col N="1343" /> in the Army and secures his pension and then takes up employment in some other position where he is remunerated from public funds.</P>
    <P>Let me take an example. An Army officer retires and secures his pension and then takes up employment, say, in the Houses of the Oireachtas where he is paid out of public funds and his pension is in no way abated, and rightly so. But suppose that same officer who retired from the Army were entitled to a military pension, has received such a pension for his service in the Army and is entitled to a disability pension in addition to his military pension, then his military pension is abated and he does not receive the allowances to which he would be entitled if he were not disabled and in a position to take up employment which is remunerated from public funds. It is very unfair. I would appeal to the Minister to look into it and, if necessary, so amend the scheme, that such an officer will be entitled to his full military service pension and full disability pension, if he is entitled to both, without any abatement whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The only other matter to which I should like to refer is what has now become known as the Old IRA pension, and disability allowance payable to Old IRA medal holders. As the Minister pointed out, the number of military service Old IRA pensioners is dwindling fast. Every day, reading through the death columns of the newspapers, we read of some veteran of the Black and Tan war having passed on. We have now celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the 1916 Rising. Very few of these veterans are left. Could we not, in God's name, give them a reasonable pension in their old age? It is disgraceful to think that some of those personnel are in receipt of a weekly pension as low as 25/-, and even less, and that when they come to draw the old age pension there is an abatement of their military service pension. They are now very few in number. We owe them a lot; let us try to remunerate them in some small way in their old age, by giving them some of the comforts they have <Col N="1344" /> been denied down through the years, but to which they are entitled, by increasing to a reasonable sum the pensions of which they are now in receipt.</P>
    <P>Again, there should not be the delay in paying a disability allowance after application. It takes a considerable time to apply for and successfully receive an IRA military service medal. My experience is that from the date of application it is generally eight or nine months before investigations are completed and a medal awarded. If one then wishes to apply for a disability allowance, it is generally 12 months before such an allowance is granted. I quoted in this House before the case of an unfortunate man for whom I had been fighting for an allowance for somewhere in the neighbourhood of three years and the postman arrived with the first payment the day the corpse was being taken out of the house to the churchyard. Even though these are rare cases, they should never occur and a little co-operation between the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; who investigate these matters &mdash; and the Department of Defence would expedite the issue of these disability allowances.</P>
    <P>A very big drive is carried out periodically for recruitment to our Defence Forces. We must ensure that those men who have given the prime years of their lives to the Defence Forces, when they retire after 21, 25 or 30 years' service, will be given, first of all, a reasonable pension, a pension commensurate with the service they have rendered and in proportion to the wages or salaries they received. First of all, an opportunity should be given to them to procure employment in the State, where such exists. Year after year, when this Estimate is being discussed, Deputies receive petitions from ex-soldiers who feel disgruntled, who feel they have not been properly treated, who feel something should be done for them &mdash; even commissioned personnel. The Minister should ensure that these people are properly remunerated when they retire. Further, it would be the greatest recruiting incentive one could possibly have if a serving soldier could turn to a prospective <Col N="1345" /> recruit and say &mdash; what Deputy James Tully and I knew it to be &mdash;&ldquo;It is a gildy job; you can get into it because you know that when you are getting out of it, you will be satisfied&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy P. O'Donnell, I should like to be associated with the Minister's remarks about the members of the Defence Forces who have served abroad. They are doing an excellent job, but, as I said &mdash; I think it was last year on this Estimate &mdash; they are doing the job we expected they would do: we expected them to do well and they have been doing well. We should couple the soldiers serving in this country with them because it is a remarkable thing, when there is some excitement or activity, soldiers are appreciated, but when there is none in the normal peacetime, they are people who do not get a very high regard from the general public.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister found time &mdash; indeed, as Deputy P. O'Donnell said, he was perfectly entitled and it was his right and his job to go &mdash; to go out to see how these people were getting on in both Cyprus and the Middle East and to show them that even though they were out there they were not being forgotten. I am a little disappointed, however, that he has not given a more thorough report on the conditions in which they are serving, because shortly after he came back, I asked him if it was true that in very inclement weather the members of the Irish Defence Forces in Cyprus were sleeping under canvas, canvas that was not of first-class material. The Minister said they were but he understood that members of the other defence forces were also sleeping under canvas. I believe that neither the Irish Force nor any of the other Forces should have been asked, in the wintry conditions which exist in places like Cyprus, to stay outside under canvas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what the extra cost, the United Nations should have provided some kind of solid shelter for them. The Government here should have made that clear to the United Nations either before or after the Minister's <Col N="1346" /> visit. His visit there must have done quite a lot to brighten up the spirits of people who were very far from home &mdash; the fact that he took the trouble to go out and see how they were being treated &mdash; but I still think something should have been done to ensure that the conditions in which they were living there would be improved.</P>
    <P>I said last year &mdash; and I repeat it now &mdash; that for the size of our Army, we have done our share of peacekeeping in Cyprus, as we did in the Congo. The danger of being imposed upon is always there. I know it is a bit of excitement for very many soldiers, who welcome the chance of going abroad and seeing parts of the world they would not normally see. Even so, it has left our Force at home in a very depleted state. Even though the Minister today, and the Minister for External Affairs on a previous occasion, explained to us there were high hopes of a refund of the amount of money due to us from the United Nations, I wonder if we will find, at the end of 12 months, that this money has been refunded. There are two things about this; one is that having that sum outstanding for a long time, even if we get every penny of it back, will be a hefty drain on our economy, because this is money which has to be raised in another way. Secondly, the fact that the money outstanding and which has been outstanding for a long time may not be paid should be taken into consideration and other nations should be asked to do their share as we have been doing ours.</P>
    <P>When the Supplementary Estimate was being discussed a few weeks ago, I referred to the fact that two Irish soldiers had been returned from Cyprus and the Ceann Comhairle said at the time it was a matter for the main Estimate. I do not want to embarrass anybody but the Army authorities here issued a statement to the effect that they were quite satisfied that no disciplinary action was warranted. I am prepared to accept that, but if that is so, why should these men have been sent home? After all, the two men have to live among their own people. I do not know if this was done to <Col N="1347" /> please somebody but if the men did not do anything, they should not have been sent home. I am disappointed that something further was not done about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Distinguished Service Medal. The medal is being awarded in certain circumstances and I suggest that in some cases there should be a cash award with the medal. There are occasions when a medal is of very little use, when a soldier would welcome something a little more useful, and if a soldier's service warranted the issue of such a medal, he should have some financial assistance as well. From the list published of the recipients of the medal, it appeared that the proportion of officers to NCOs and men was very high. Is it a fact that we have all very brave officers and not so brave men or was there another reason for this? I should hate to think that being officers entitled men in any Army to be considered braver than the men under them. Perhaps I am being unfair in this and if so, I feel sure the Minister will correct me.</P>
    <P>Two extraordinary things appear from this Estimate. The first is that the Minister made very little reference to the Army at home and completely omitted to deal with the FCA. This was more than an oversight. It did not happen by accident. There must be a very good reason for it. The last thing we should do is to forget that even though we have soldiers serving overseas, we also have soldiers here at home who do a very good job. I should hate to think that the soldiers at home would be given the impression that they are people who do not count, who warrant less than half a page in the Minister's statement when he comes to deal with not a paltry sum of money but £11,699,000, quite a substantial sum. I was most disappointed there was not more reference to our soldiers at home.</P>
    <P>We have had the old gripe for years about the uniforms and the boots. Uniforms have been improved and they are better. That was a big step forward but I still think the footwear is in the past. The Minister, I suggest, <Col N="1348" /> should continue the good work. Having started at one end, like the old man down the country who when he polished the tops of his boots, thought he was well dressed and forgot that there were heels on the boots, the Minister should not stop. There was not much point in improving the uniforms and not the boots. It does not look well. There should be walking-out boots to go with the uniforms and be an attraction.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear about the weapons used by the Army here, but I think we still depend a lot on the old-type rifle. Having served abroad, quite a number of our soldiers are not equipped with modern-type rifles and machine-guns. If we are to justify the existence of our Army at all, we must spend a considerable amount of money on the replacement of weapons which must be kept up-to-date and the old ones disposed of. It is little use training an Army to fire single shot rifles when the armies of the world are using a very different weapon.</P>
    <P>Uniformed soldiers seem to have disappeared from our streets. Perhaps there are more civilian passes than there were in our day but a soldier in uniform nowadays is the exception, even in the neighbourhood of Army barracks. I agree with Deputy P. O'Donnell that Army Bands should be seen more often in public. I do not know whether the existence of the Army Band is to be discouraged&mdash;are we heading to the day when there will be no replacements and the bands will disappear? &mdash;but I suggest every effort should be made to show Army Bands in public. The Minister may say that was all right for recruitment purposes and that we are not now anxious for recruits. That may be so but the public image, the morale of the Army, must be kept up and the way to do it is to show it in its best light. I suggest that the Minister revert to the old idea of allowing the Army Bands to appear at sports meetings and what have you, to show them in public.</P>
    <P>I have another complaint. There is not enough sport in the Army of today. During the Emergency, there were, of course, many more men in the Army and consequently many more sportsmen <Col N="1349" /> in the Army. We could very well revert to that idea so that each unit would have teams under the various codes to play in competition with civilian sportsmen outside and show that they can hold their own in the best company. It would do an immense amount of good.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell suggested that the Army should be moved more down the country from the city. I do not agree with him because I think it would cause a tremendous upset to a lot of people. I agree there are far too many old barracks retained in Dublin and indeed in the country. They could possibly be brought into one central barracks in the city, but it would be a mistake to move more than a small number outside the city. After all, in a time of danger, it is the city that must be defended. Guard duties have to be carried out but I am afraid there are too many guards being carried out for the sole purpose of giving fellows something to do.</P>
    <P>I wonder what is in the Magazine Fort. Is most of the equipment there so useless that bows and arrows would be more effective if there was need for the use of arms? During my time in the Army, some of the stuff being taken in there was rejected British arms, rejects from the battles in Europe and from all over the place being dumped in there and protected as if they were gold, so precious that they had to be guarded in case somebody would steal them. Most of it was useless old stuff, though dangerous. The Minister should get somebody to have a look at the stores there, which include some explosives. Somebody did have a look at them some years ago and took some away but we should see to it now that what is there is reasonably useful and not rubbish.</P>
    <P>The old question of the accommodation of Army personnel was raised and the Minister said he proposes to build half a dozen houses. I mentioned on a number of previous Estimates that the Army authorities have been dodging the column when it came to the question of providing housing for our defence personnel. I do not see any reason in the world why many more modern houses have not been built. If <Col N="1350" /> they were, local authorities would not be in the position in which they have to look for accommodation for married soldiers who for years have been living in a certain place. The local authority to which I belong, and to which the Minister belongs, in County Meath, have been very decent as far as soldiers are concerned. In the Gormanston area, they do their best to house them. I honestly believe that the Army itself could do a lot more to alleviate hardship for those soldiers. Even in Gormanston, many married soldiers are living in the camp whilst their wives and children are living in neighbouring towns and villages because there is no accommodation for them. That should not be so.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of people who have been discharged, the overholders. This is a big problem. Some of them have been there for so long that even at the low rate of rent which is charged, their gratuities are gradually being dissipated. There is nothing they can do and nothing the Army can do. The Minister should make arrangements with local authorities in the different areas so that a certain number of them would be taken over. This would relieve congestion. Originally the houses were built for serving soldiers. Now the serving soldiers are unable to obtain those houses because these people are in them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of jobs, I was surprised to learn that men leaving the Army were not given any preference for jobs, even State or semiState jobs. This is a pity. Men who have served in the Army for a number of years, and who are discharged, should most certainly be entitled to some preference as against civilians who have had the opportunity to do reasonably well in their own jobs before those people appeared on the labour market.</P>
    <P>There is a very excellent organisation of which the Minister could very well make much more use, the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen. The Minister could make arrangements with that organisation which would result in a number of State jobs being made available to the organisation. They in turn could make <Col N="1351" /> those jobs available to the soldiers who are unemployed. It is not asking too much that this should be done. I honestly believe that those men are entitled at least to that type of consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of men leaving the Army and not being able to obtain jobs in outside employment because they have been declared medically unfit, something should be done about this matter. Some of those men have a clean ticket during their life in the Army but when they apply for jobs outside, they are medically examined and are declared unfit for employment. As a result of this, those men have been unable to obtain employment, even though they have been found fit for the job. This is something on which the Department could do very much more than they are doing. If men are discharged from the Army and are found to be medically unfit for jobs in outside life, they should be declared medically unfit and should get some compensation by way of an increased type of pension or some disability pension.</P>
    <P>I received a letter on 31st March relating to a man who was in the Army. He served with the military police from 1922 and all through the Emergency. I do not know whether the treatment he received had anything to do with the fact that he served with the military police or whether there is anything against serving in the military police. This man was on hunger strike with the late Terence McSwiney for 75 days. He was a hospital case in the 1920s. During his service he was in very good health. His rank was actingcorporal. On discharge after 22 years' service, because of the fact that he was not a full corporal, he was discharged as a private. The pension of an actingcorporal under the 1927 Act was 14/- a week. There have been improvements in this because of percentage increases but this pension is still an awfully small amount of money. Even if the pension increases were 300 per cent, this man would be receiving a very small amount in pension. Would the Minister review cases like this where men after long service go out on a very small <Col N="1352" /> pension? Apparently they cannot possibly improve the situation unless there is a change in legislation. This man does not need it because he is dead.</P>
    <P>With reference to this question of discharge also, there is the situation of a man who is discharged and if he is an NCO or a private, he gets no gratuity but officers get a gratuity. I do not know why it has been decided that an officer should get a gratuity&mdash;I am not complaining about the fact that an officer gets such a gratuity&mdash;and that a soldier, whether an NCO or an ordinary man, who has been a long time in the Army should get a miserly pension on going out but no gratuity.</P>

      <P>If you look at the Civil Service, you will find that every section gets a gratuity. There was a question down last week which showed the tremendous number of people who were in Civil Service employment in the Department of Defence. They must be needed or they would not be there. Would the Minister tell me, when replying, if there is any such ordinary civilian, no matter how low his category, who does not get a gratuity or pension on retirement? We find that the men whom they were appointed to look after, when they go out of the Army, get only a few shillings in their pockets by way of pension and no gratuity of any kind. Those people get a very small pension. This is something at which the Minister could very well have a look with a view to some arrangements to have it fixed up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another question which has arisen, that is, people on special allowances and Old IRA pensions. Reference has been made to the fact by Deputy O'Donnell that when some of those people write into the Department, they have to wait a long time before they get a decision. My complaint is that if I write into the Pensions Section of the Department of Defence, it is a long time before I get a reply. I do not know why this should be so because I have always been most courteous with the officials of the Minister's Department and any letter I have written has been an attempt to explain fully what the situation <Col N="1353" /> is. I do not see why there should be such a delay in replying to a letter which I send in to the Department. It does not affect me but it affects the people for whom I am making representations.</P>

      <P>There is an old man down in Kells, for whom I made representation&mdash;I am sure the Minister is aware of this man&mdash;who had a small tailoring business years ago. This man got a special allowance. It was reviewed three times in a period of six months. He got an increase; then he got a reduction; and then he got an increase again. Eventually a social welfare officer, I expect, at the request of the Minister, went along to the man and succeeded in getting him to agree that he was earning £2 a week. This old man received food from people whose clothes he mended. Some of those people could not afford new clothes. The allowance was completely taken from this man.</P>
      <P>I know this man and I know the Minister knows him as well. This man is very often hungry. It is scandalous that somebody should go to the trouble of reviewing this pension three times in six months. I expect those reviews cost as much as the small pension this man would receive for the entire six months. He is not without it. I do not expect he will need it much longer as I expect he will die shortly. I will give the Minister his name if he is anxious to have it.</P>

      <P>I am talking about McGilligan. The Minister knows him perhaps better than I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The FCA has been mentioned by Deputy P. O'Donnell but not by the Minister. He completely ignored the FCA in his opening speech. Why was that? Was there any reason? Is it because the FCA are now to be swept under the carpet and it is no longer important to talk about them? I know the FCA officers recently seemed <Col N="1354" /> to have a difference of opinion with the Minister and his Department over the setting up of an organisation. Whether they are right or wrong I am not competent to judge. Personally I believe that if they have some kind of vocational or voluntary organisation they wanted to set up for the purpose of looking after certain interests, I could see nothing very wrong with that but obviously the Minister did see something peculiar about it and therefore shot it down. I do not think that is the way to encourage these people.</P>
    <P>The position as I see it is that the numbers in the FCA are very much smaller in fact than they are on paper. My second point is that there are a number of people in the FCA for years on top of years, excellent fellows who take their job very seriously and who do everything possible to be what they are supposed to be, a second line of defence. They do everything they can and the Department should encourage them to feel more important than they will feel after reading in the newspapers this document which the Minister has produced today.</P>
    <P>I also think there must be an improvement in the type of uniform they are wearing. It is a dirty old baggy thing. No matter how well made a man may be, he certainly will not look a soldier in one of those uniforms. Again, the type of weapon with which he is issued is the old single Lee Enfield or 300 American-style which would be very little use and the man using it knows it. For God's sake, treat them seriously and give them the impression that they are, in fact, important people. I am quite sure the results would be very much better than they are at the present time. I hope they will get their two weeks training this year. If the Minister and the Department want to tighten up then, for goodness sake, tighten up on those who do not qualify for the two weeks but give those who are really serious about it the best you can give them. It certainly will not go to waste.</P>
    <P>There are a number of odds and ends I wanted to refer to. The first is the question of a man who has a military service pension. It was decided <Col N="1355" /> many years ago as a result of wounds he suffered that he had a certain percentage disability which has been gradually getting worse and worse. It has progressed from 20 per cent or 30 per cent and is now 60 or 70 per cent. I asked the Minister's Department if it would be possible for this man to get treatment in St. Bricin's Hospital because he has to get regular hospital treatment. The reply was that the hospital was reserved for people whose condition could be improved but since his particular disability had been permanently decided at a certain percentage, there was no point in taking him to the hospital and there was no intention of offering him this type of treatment.</P>
    <P>There are a number of these people in the country. The Minister probably knows this. They are very aggrieved. The Army decided this man was 20 per cent disabled. He knows and his doctors will certify that the percentage of disablement has risen to 60 or 65. Would there be any possibility of having another look at this and, no matter what the Army decide was the amount of disablement, deciding that such men are entitled to be taken in and receive the necessary treatment? The treatment must be given to them free because a number of them, if they have not got a medical card, have to pay a certain amount which they can ill-afford.</P>
    <P>I come now to the insurance of Army lorries. I brought a case to the Minister's attention recently where an Army lorry knocked down a boy cyclist. The boy is still attending a doctor and a hospital. I do not know who was right and who was wrong but I know this; if it were a civilianowned lorry, the insurance company would make some arrangements about payment of the boy's medical expenses and indeed any loss he would incur. Because it was an Army lorry, apparently it has been decided that he is not entitled to any type of compensation. I am told the driver disclaimed responsibility. When there is an argument between an Army driver and a 12 years-old boy who did not see where the lorry came <Col N="1356" /> from, it is easy enough to disclaim responsibility. I am not saying the driver was wrong. I am saying the same rules should apply to Army trucks as apply to civilian trucks. Even if they are not insured, the same type of treatment should be given to the people who are involved in accidents. It is too bad that this little lad appears to be in the position that he must accept that fact that he is suffering from an injury which will take a long time to heal, if it ever does, and in the meantime, his father out of whatever little he has, must pay for the treatment. I am not trying to apportion blame. I am just bringing the matter to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Now I come to a hardy annual. Beside Gormanston Camp there is a house owned by a man who has a family. He has attempted to get ESB connection. If he were anywhere but where he is, beside the camp, there would be no difficulty; he would get connection in the normal way. Some years ago he was told he could not have it because the overhead wires would interfere with planes. The funny thing is that there are wires&mdash;they may be better trained&mdash;from the top of the huts, the officers' mess on the inside of the camp to the local church. They do not appear to be any danger to planes at all but the wires leading out to this man's house would interfere with planes. It was suggested he would have to have underground cable. The ESB wanted a £12 bi-mensal charge for this underground cable. In the meantime, houses on the other side of the camp have got connection at the normal charge but despite the fact that the Department of Defence and the ESB have been dickering over this for a number of years, this man has not got his ESB connection. I would ask the Minister, if he would not mind, to take this up with the ESB and see if connection can be made to the man from the Army hut which is beside the gate and about 15 to 20 yards from the man's house, There is no reason why that should not have been done in the first place. The man is prepared to pay the normal charge. He does not want his current free.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> Reference has been made to Civil Defence. Last year and the year before I was very critical of Civil Defence. I still have very mixed feelings about it. I feel the potential is very good but that there is a lot of cod talked about the strength of the Civil Defence organisation. We are told about what the county managers and their officials will do in the event of atomic attack but I would not like to be depending on these people if an attack came. I think this is a question where quality rather than quantity is what the Army should look for. I think that trying to give the impression that there are literally thousands of people in each county bursting to serve in Civil Defence can be disproven by just checking on the actual number of people who attend parades.</P>
    <P>There should be some incentive to the people concerned to encourage them to join the classes. Instead of taking whatever comes, there should be a strict rule that only those who are able and willing to do the job will be accepted into the organisation. I am quite sure that on that basis the numbers would grow much more quickly than at present. A lot of money is being spent on Civil Defence and we are not getting the proper return. I am not blaming local officers, who are spending a lot of their time trying to generate enthusiasm which is not forthcoming. While some areas have made a good job of it, in most parts of the country the number taking part is very small, despite what the books may say. I am not criticising them; I am just saying that that is the position.</P>

      <P>There are areas where they are doing very well but unfortunately there are others where that is not the situation. There is one subject to which I wish to refer and of which most people fight shy. There is a mistaken view in regard to this matter. Nobody likes Army deserters but during the Emergency a lot of young people joined the Army&mdash;many of them very young&mdash;and they got out <Col N="1358" /> as soon as things began to get rough, and in a number of units they did get rough, and very rough. Most of them went across the Border into Northern Ireland, or crossed to England and some of them joined the British Army. Many of them were afraid to come back. Some of them have married and have reared families and established businesses and after 15 or 20 years, it appears rather odd that the Army still retains the right, if these people return to this country, to try them and to invoke the full rigours of the law. I have brought a number of cases to the notice of the Minister and I have received a reply, not from the Minister but from the Secretary of the Department. He did not exactly tell me to mind my own business but he went as close to it as I suppose he felt safe and he pointed out in each case that as far as these people were concerned if they came back, they would be tried according to the law.</P>
      <P>As I said, I do not hold any brief for deserters&mdash;a person who does not do what he promises to do is not worth a lot&mdash;but there are exceptions, and in cases where young people got involved and have been away for a long time, it does not do them, their families or the country any good to say: &ldquo;If you come home from England, we will seize you, try you by court-martial and if you are convicted, jail you&rdquo;&mdash;I do not know if it is still in the &ldquo;glasshouse&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;for 156 days.&rdquo; The time has come when the Minister could very well say in regard to deserters, particularly of the Emergency period and particularly with people who have been absent from the country for over ten years, that it is rather ridiculous to be waiting still to pounce on them coming in from England by boat or plane. The Minister may have his own views on this but I would ask him to have another look at the matter because there is a way of dealing with the problem other than action of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy P. O'Donnell and Deputy Tully in congratulating the Minister on his initiative in visiting our troops overseas and seeing the excellent work <Col N="1359" /> being done in such places as the Congo, Cyprus and in the other theatres, such as Jordon and elsewhere, by our Army personnel. The fact that we have been selected as a country to supply troops is an indication of the high regard people far beyond the borders of this State have for the efficiency and organisation of our officers, NCOs and men. We too, owe them a debt of gratitude for their services and for the manner in which they have kept the flag flying. They have created a wonderful impression for which there has been nothing but the height of admiration.</P>
      <P>In regard to this Estimate I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that new thinking is required. We have arrived at the point where we have a wealth of information at our disposal and arising from the experience we have gained overseas, I believe that the existing Army structure, based on the structure of 1922, is far from what is required today. We will have to streamline our organisation to meet this new challenge and in order that our services will be on a par with other countries, and not be thinking in terms of the past, but rather in terms of the future. There are two factors which the Minister should examine: the first is in relation to the civil servants and the second, to senior Army officer personnel. Civil servants and Army personnel are capable people who have carried out their duties to their full limits but if the Minister seeks information, I am sure that the civil servants quote regulations to him and the senior Army officers are in a position to stop anyone who challenges them. This is an unsatisfactory situation and one which requires to be examined comprehensively with a view to having a realistic assessment of the position.</P>
      <P>Another matter is the extension of the retirement age for officers. We hope that advice in this regard will not be sought from people who themselves have limits, age-wise. We should not accept the position that regulations are in existence and even if they are bad, they will still be applied, no matter what the impact may be. We must change the regulations in order to cope with the problem which exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> I could quote hundreds of problems that exist in the Defence Forces and which need to be rectified, regulations that need to be changed and so forth, and I am sure the Minister, with the information available to him and with the knowledge of problems that have been brought to his attention and to the attention of his Department, is in a position to produce a comprehensive packet for anyone who would care to sit down and examine it in order to bring about a change for the better. Last year I mentioned the ratio of civilian personnel to Army personnel. This is overloaded on the civilian side. I suggested that the retiring age should be extended for officers because many duties which are being carried out at the moment by civilian personnel, such as those mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell in relation to Army pay, could be carried out by Army officers if this was done and would give them further time in the Defence Forces so that they would not be cast on to the labour market at a time when great hardship can be caused to some families. This is an involved question. I am sure that senior Army officers who sometimes feel a challenge would be reluctant to say that this is a good idea. It is a matter that should be examined immediately so that in any future extension brought about&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be. The resettlement of ex-servicemen is one of the most vital and important matters we have to face up to. At the moment we have little or no regard for the resettlement of ex-servicemen. As Deputy Tully indicated, when a man leaves the Army, few are concerned about his future. I referred previously to the type of job taken up by the majority of pensioners who have given loyal and efficient service over an extended period and it is not the type of job we want to see our ex-servicemen in. We want to see them trained and retrained to meet the labour market requirements on a par with people who have not served the nation. In the new Industrial <Col N="1361" /> Training Act, there may be some provision whereby that situation can be examined, and under which men can be trained or retrained to meet the future with some skill in excess of that of the ordinary person, and under which they can be retrained to fit in an effective manner into the industrial structure.</P>
      <P>Last year there was a suggestion about the creation of a director of technology to examine the problems of these men, and to assess the situation in regard to the limitations which will be applied as the years go on. As we know in relation to housing, most of the people who are in married quarters, and who are now overholders, are there because of lack of advice, lack of communication, lack of information, or lack of facilities to assess the situation. Most people who are in married quarters are men whose families have married and gone away and are no longer with them. They do not qualify for housing by the local authority. These men should be advised at an early stage and told: &ldquo;This is the situation that faces you. You are entitled to various assistance by way of settlement grants and grants available from the State and the local authorities. Now is the time to build for the future and to equip yourself so that when you leave the Army you will have a home to go to.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I believe this is an important aspect, and I believe we should have another look at it. There should be someone in the service to see that in the fields of housing and employment, the men are equipped with the necessary information and assistance if they want to procure their own homes before they are too old, and to ensure that they would have all the information possible in relation to the facilities that are available. He would also deal with employment and assess the men's ability, skill, and potential, and ensure their training in order to meet the needs of the labour market, so that they would have something that would be of assistance to them when they are thrown on the big, cold, open labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment when a man leaves <Col N="1362" /> the Army, if he applies to the local authority for a job, he is told that he is too old. After he has given 20, 25 or 30 years' service in the Army, he is told that he is too old. That is an undesirable situation which must be tackled by the Minister and the Department. No man who has served the nation loyally should be debarred from any type of employment because he is considered to be too old after his service to the nation.</P>
    <P>There is also the situation in which a man gets pre-discharge leave. I consider this type of leave undesirable and in need of change. We are all in agreement about the resettlement gratuity mentioned by previous speakers. A little change in this would make it more suitable for the NCOs and men as against the present situation. I believe&mdash;and there are complaints&mdash;that a man who now goes on pre-discharge leave and decides to exercise his right to go back into the Army is demoted. There have been very many cases of demotion because men have exercised the right they have. That is wrong, and a practice that should be terminated immediately. People should be allowed to exercise their right and they should get back the rank they held prior to their application for pre-discharge leave. If the Minister does not desire to change the situation immediately, he should examine it in its entirety, and ensure that persons on pre-discharge leave can do the necessary interviews and be employed in the Government services.</P>
    <P>A person on pre-discharge leave may not be employed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, but can be employed by CIE and various other organisations. That is wrong. These men need pre-discharge leave in order to settle themselves, and to make a home for themselves and their families. This was the aim and object for which it was designed in the first place. When a man has qualified for pension purposes and when there is a job going that would suit him, he should be able to apply and get the necessary release without any complications. There are cases where the necessary release was given, but there are quite a number of people who apply and <Col N="1363" /> who told me&mdash;maybe the information they were given was erroneous, or perhaps the people who gave them the information were not fully aware of the situation&mdash;that they would not be considered for various interviews.</P>
    <P>Resettlement is a major problem and it is the best advertisement we have for recruiting personnel if it is known that people are properly resettled and given the necessary facilities for resettlement, and that they have a reasonable gratuity at their disposal with which they can start some type of business so that they can plan in advance. At the moment they are tied to this pre-discharge leave. This is unsatisfactory and it is a matter which should be fully examined by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>The question of overholders has been mentioned. Many of these men who have given long and efficient service and who are living in married quarters cannot obtain a job in any of the State services. They have had to move at the request of the various commanding officers, or because their tour of duty took them to various places. These people who are living in married quarters in Dublin or elsewhere, after they have completed their period for pension purposes, because they are overholders through no fault of their own, because of a lack of advice and guidance on equipping themselves for the future, are deprived of the opportunity of getting accommodation. That is another matter that needs examination.</P>
    <P>A person who is an overholder should be given a reasonable time to get out of married quarters. He should be given six months or three months, or whatever the period may be, and should not be debarred from getting accommodation because he is an overholder. He has given efficient service to the State and for that reason the Minister should have another look at the question of overholders.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of young soldiers living in this city and paying through the nose for sub-standard accommodation. Some of them have to pay £3 or £4 a week and after a few <Col N="1364" /> months, the wife has to go home to her mother in Tipperary, Kerry or other part of the country. This is a regular occurrence. I know it because these men come to me to get them some kind of accommodation. They are unable to get into married quarters because in many cases married quarters are being occupied by people who no longer have an interest in the service. We must find a way out for those people. We must meet the situation realistically and ensure that married quarters are provided for the people who are entitled to them. At the moment, there are many vultures only too happy to get their hands on an unfortunate person who wants a home at any cost. The Minister should take another look at this question of overholding and of married quarters generally. The quarters themselves leave a lot to be desired in many cases. That is not the Minister's fault. They are quite old. I think that, if we intend to retain them, they should have an added degree of comfort.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with having married quarters within the barrack walls. I think that day is gone. We should utilise the services of the National Building Agency or of other agencies to produce flats outside the barrack walls such as those at Ballymun and the money for such work should not come out of the Minister's Estimate but should be charged against the Capital Budget. We have a duty to the people we wish to retain in the Defence Forces. There is the alternative of abolishing married quarters altogether and of giving the people concerned something in lieu and letting them find their own accommodation.</P>
    <P>The accommodation we provide should be reasonable and should no longer be tied to the type of undesirable accommodation in some of the places where we have couples at the moment. There is a difficult housing situation at present. There is the question of overholders and then the necessary finances to erect married quarters are probably scarce. The Minister should seek to have provision made for these quarters other than in his Estimate. Money is provided for the building of houses for <Col N="1365" /> policemen and other people and the same attitude should apply to serving Army personnel. The Minister mentioned houses in Limerick.</P>

      <P>In McKee Barracks and at O'Higgins Road in the Curragh, and in various places where we built additional married quarters, a very creditable effort was made and a very creditable type of accommodation was provided. I believe that, within the Army service, in the Corps of Engineers, for example, we have men whose trades or callings could be utilised in the development of the building of houses, whether in batches of two, four or six or whatever the number. They have the ability and the capacity to do the work and we should utilise them. They proved that when called upon to build the extension to St. Bricin's and to do the reconstruction of Kickham Barracks, Clonmel, and other reconstruction work. I believe that this would be an excellent scheme for utilising the skills of certain Army personnel to provide and develop married quarters or other facilities for serving personnel. We have officers with the necessary qualifications. There is little now, except organisation, that could prevent us from reaching a situation in which we could utilise those people very effectively rather than have some of them engaged in sweeping dininghalls and other such work for which they are ill-fitted. We have men with qualifications which are not properly utilised. Then, again, we have people who are being pushed into jobs within the Defence Forces for which they are completely unsuitable but they are put in because of this little bit of push or <Col N="1366" /> pull that is there and that always has been there.</P>

      <P>An overall examination of the position might bring about relief in this connection. I believe that many of our Dublin barracks should be disposed of. I see no reason why we should retain so many barracks in this city. They are old, ill-equipped and hard to heat. We must develop and equip ourselves to meet the future situation. These old barracks were designed to meet a situation that existed 70 or 100 years ago. Whether such barracks are located in Dublin, Mullingar, Clonmel, Kildare, Galway, Cork, the Curragh, and so on, the conditions are mostly not suitable for present-day requirements. Questions such as fall-out, and so on, are not catered for in any of our military installations. In other circumstances, we would probably have built and developed new barracks on the perimeter of the city and disposed of the rubbish we have and which has probably served well over the years but is not suitable for the requirements of the people today. We should look to that task now.</P>
      <P>The barracks for the police in Templemore is an indication of clearcut thinking by a particular section in relation to the types of facilities that should be available. This was an Army barracks. Quite a substantial amount of money had to be spent on equipping it for another section of the State service.</P>

      <P>Our Defence Forces give loyal service to the nation. They <Col N="1367" /> should get the same consideration as any other section. I disagree with Deputy O'Donnell when he says we should move them all to the Curragh. In my view, the Curragh should go with all the others. We should not put all our eggs in one basket. It would be unwise to put all our Defence Forces in the Curragh, to withdraw our troops from the various outposts in Mullingar, and so on, and just bring them to the Curragh. The Curragh could have many uses. I think it is not suitable for our present-day Army requirements anl certainly it will not be suitable for them in the future. It is a very vulnerable place. We would require a much larger Army to protect it with the type of equipment we have at present.</P>
      <P>I believe the Curragh could be utilised as an industrial estate. I was there recently and I was appalled at conditions. Connolly Barracks and other places which at one stage were something one could look on with pride, are the worse for wear: there is quite a considerable amount of broken windows and destruction there now. That is a point we should further examine to ensure that, if we do not continue to use the Curragh and if there is no hope of using it in the future, we demolish whatever is not of value rather than leave barracks or sheds, and so on, there just for the purpose of employing somebody to keep them clean or to build them up again when they fall down. We should examine this whole matter so that in the future we shall give our servicemen the same facilities, consideration and understanding as was evidenced in the case of the Garda at Templemore.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the extension of the age limit for the retirement of officers. This matter should be further examined and I would ask the Minister to look into it. These men come on the labour market at the age of 50 when most of their children are at college or university. Facilities are not available for absorbing them. There should be a placement service in conjunction with the Department of Labour which would apply to officers the same as to NCOs and men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> I also mentioned the appalling situation that NCOs and men do not receive the allowances granted to officers in respect of children receiving advanced education. It seems that we do not want the children of NCOs and men to receive such education. Surely the facilities available to an officer in this regard should also be available to NCOs and men? We hear a lot of talk about the need for education. We should do something to assist NCOs and men in this regard, even if it means extending the children's allowances during that period. It is a serious matter that the allowances should apply only to officers.</P>
    <P>Last year I appealed to the Minister to grant an additional seven days' leave to NCOs and men. Again, officers are well catered for in this regard. They have a substantial amount of leave, but there is a severe limitation on that of NCOs and men. Today there is a substantial amount of extra duty to be done&mdash;a soldier's tour of duty is a 24-hour tour&mdash;and extra leave should be given. Because of the service in Cyprus, the Congo and elsewhere, a large volume of extra duty has been thrown on a small number of personnel and extra leave is therefore merited. The NCOs and men do more duty than the officer. The ratio is so great that something additional is required. They are not in a trade union and have no one to fight their cause, except the occasional Deputy who gets up here and speaks on their behalf&mdash;and the number who speak on behalf of this important section of the community is small enough. The Minister would be well advised to take into account the excessive hours of duty falling on them in recent years. While so many people outside have a five-day week and an eight-hour day, the soldier still has a 24-hour tour of duty. Yet there has been no allowance given to make up the discrepancy between the hours worked by those outside and the soldier's hours of duty.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service is a joke. I said that last year and I repeat it now. It may be that when the money is available we will equip ourselves properly. We should put by a small amount each year to ensure we will have something <Col N="1369" /> available to buy the necessary vessels for fishery protection. If we are to take this problem seriously, we must deal with it in a realistic fashion. The fishing industry is an important one. We have pirates coming from outside countries who destroy our fishing beds and take the meals off the fishermen's tables. Indeed, fish has become so dear that it is taken from our own tables. If we had more protection, we would have more fish available for home consumption. I differ from Deputy O'Donnell about motor torpedo boats. We should have some type of dual-purpose vessel that would give the fishermen information about shoals and so on as well as providing fishery protection. It may be necessary to have civilian and military crews. There is no problem there. We have them ashore advising the Minister and there is no reason why we could not have them afloat. I do not think it is beyond our capacity to design a dual-purpose boat. Some contribution should be put aside each year in order to meet future requirements. The corvettes are outmoded and outdated and we should give the Naval Service some hope of having a new type of vessel in time. Even if we have to set up one of these many committees of experts to examine the problem, it might be a job well done.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Air Corps, I should like to congratulate the helicopter service, which has done such magnificent work. The very efficient crews have saved a considerable number of lives. I believe helicopters are more effective for us than any other type of plane. We should have more helicopters for the purpose of rescue work as well as bringing back whatever information we require about the movements of personnel who might come here at some stage. Any equipment we purchase for the Naval Service or the Air Corps should be dual-purpose equipment, with a civilian as well as a military application, as in the case of the helicopters.</P>
    <P>The completion of the Congo Plot in Glasnevin is long overdue and I would ask the Minister to expedite whatever arrangements are in hands. When I was up there recently, I met a number of foreigners who came here <Col N="1370" /> specially to see the plot where the men who gave their lives in the Congo are laid to rest. I was appalled to see a few bushes and a bit of wire netting around it. It does not do credit to ourselves or to these men. The sooner we undertake this work the better, in order to get the plot out of the unsightly condition it is in at the moment and give it an appearance befitting these men.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the people who got Distinguished Service Medals. I hope many more people will get the award, and I believe that will be so. We owe a great debt of gratitude to those who have received Distinguished Service Medals but no less to the great number of personnel who have served this country so loyally and so faithfully over the years and who did not get a Distinguished Service Medal. They have done magnificient work in upholding the good name of this nation and have shown that we have here soldiers who are superior to those in many larger nations.</P>
    <P>I appealed to the Minister before&mdash; probably because I was a member of it &mdash;to consider giving a distinctive type of medal to members of the Volunteer Force. I have never heard any response to that, but I appeal to the Minister again. This was a Force that was recruited and served the country loyally and faithfully throughout the Emergency period. This Force had a distinctive uniform and was a distinctive unit. For that reason I would appeal to the Minister even at this late stage to give some distinctive medal to that Force which has now gone out of existence.</P>
    <P>We now have the FCA, a welltrained and very efficient group who are giving their services on a parttime basis. Development of this Force is necessary and desirable. It is probably the cheapest form of defence we can have in order to meet our problems. The criticisms of the FCA which have been made by people outside who are opposed to it have caused an amount of discontent throughout the Force itself, people who have made complaints and who are trying to rectify problems other than through the normal channels and who in the <Col N="1371" /> course of doing this have endeavoured to instil a degree of suspicion in the members of the Force, which is very undesirable. The efficiency of the FCA is beyond question, and when we see them on parade and at various important functions, we cannot but be impressed by them. If there are problems to be rectified, we must face them honestly and ensure that justice is done.</P>
    <P>In regard to Civil Defence, I should like to see this service embracing the whole community, including children. Whether in the secondary school or at the end of the primary term, children should be made conscious of fallout and other hazards. There are plenty of officers in this service well equipped to give lectures on this subject so that children can protect themselves and others, if the necessity should arise.</P>
    <P>The Apprenticeship School at Naas has been mentioned. This has been a worthwhile effort and I congratulate the Minister on the steps he has taken to ensure the greater efficiency of this unit. I hope this idea can be extended to many other aspects of apprenticeship training. Many of our trainees from the Apprenticeship School in Naas have won premier awards not only in this country but outside it when they participated in competitions sponsored by foreign countries. This scheme should be developed and extended to other branches of the service.</P>
    <P>I would again ask the Minister to look at the question of increasing Reserve pay and the question of promotion within the Reserve for NCOs. Once again, I want to congratulate the Minister on going and seeing for himself the conditions in which our personnel are serving overseas. I am quite sure that the comprehensive knowledge the Minister has now at his disposal in relation to overseas problems will enable him to deal more effectively with problems affecting serving personnel at home. I hope that this time next year he will have considered all the points raised by other speakers and myself and that he will be in a position to give some relief to those in greatest need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In an atmosphere of non-controversy, it is sensible to discuss many of the shortcomings apparent in the Defence Forces. It was a very good thing that the Minister went overseas, and I think the Minister, as long as he remains Minister, and whoever his successor may be, should, if we have military personnel overseas, at least pay them the compliment of going to see them and to see the conditions in which they carry out their duties. I am informed&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that the only military personnel serving in Cyprus who are still under canvas are the Irish. I am sure it is possible to rectify that situation and I am sure the Minister will take steps to ensure that our standard is no lower than that of other participants in this peace-keeping Force.</P>
      <P>We pay tribute, and properly, to the dedicated service these men are giving. We are fortunate that the opportunity arose for such service abroad because it provides a relief from the monotony and drudgery of Army life. It is time the battalions of &ldquo;civvies&rdquo; in the Department of Defence realised that we are now in 1967 and that we can no longer go on asking men to man outmoded barracks all over the country, carrying out tours of duty which are unreasonable, and trying to maintain barracks which are on the way to obsolescence. The cookhouse and fatigues form too large a part of Army life. They contribute largely to Army monotony. Someone will have to take a look at the overall situation and appreciate the contraction that must come in the maintenance and control of barracks by too few people in too many places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one experienced in all facets of Army life&mdash;private, NCO and officer in the National Army&mdash;I say the time has come when this appalling anachronism of no gratuity for the private and the NCO will have to be reviewed. This situation is unparalleled elsewhere. These NCOs and men are the backbone of the Army. They serve their time and they are then ejected into civilian society with a flimsy, inadequate low rate of pension. There is no <Col N="1373" /> gratuity. Let those who guard the purse take a look at their own personnel in the Department of Defence, their conditions of service and their emoluments, and see if there is any grade in that Department which is not entitled to some kind of gratuity to supplement pension for resettlement purposes when these people ultimately retire.</P>
    <P>The whole approach has been wrong. Many of these NCOs and men are experienced in different administrative branches of the Army and they could effectively and usefully be absorbed into the civilian corps to help in the work there. That is particularly true at the captain-commandmant level. With their experience&mdash;their Q experience or their A experience&mdash;they could easily be absorbed and that would enable them to continue on to 65 years in gainful employment. There is a monstrous injustice in relation to the age at which serving officers leave the Army, an injustice leading to unrest to such a degree that many of the younger personnel, when they reach the age at which they can get their minimum pension, cast around in an effort to secure their future by getting a civilian occupation, with the result that too many leave the Army prematurely. We do not want to see that happen. I am quite sure the Minister and the other Members of this House do not want that kind of dissipation of trained Army personnel, personnel trained at substantial expense, and personnel which could give worthwhile service. I press this because I am constantly in touch with the problem. I represent an area which has always given generously to all ranks in the Army. West Cork, Cork city and county have always played their full part in giving generously to the Army.</P>
    <P>These problems must be faced realistically. One has to assess where justice lies, remembering that the normal pattern in the Civil Service, the local authority, the teaching or any other profession is that men serve until they are 65. When there is an arbitrary limit in the Army, there is a moral duty on the State to find a way of escape for these people to enable them to continue in some kind of gainful employment. Thinking is archaic in the <Col N="1374" /> Department of Defence but something will have to be done to change that thinking. At the moment serving personnel who retire may have children still in secondary school or on the threshold of university. I am not saying this to gain any political advantage. I do not think this is a debate in which one should seek such advantage. This is a debate in which we should combine intelligence and goodwill in an effort to see if we can get some improvement for these men.</P>
    <P>I have had close personal contact with the Army and its problems. The situation is complex and worrying. Promotion is limited. Only a handful of senior officers enjoy an age limit of 65. Most Army personnel can never hope to be colonel; very few can hope to reach the general rank&mdash;perhaps two or three&mdash;in any period of Army service. Therefore, you are dealing with a problem of personnel who have to retire on the arbitrary decision of what I describe as multiple drones of the Department of Defence, an arbitrary decision because in the provision of soldier-officer for the use of the country, there is a specific limit to the time each rank can serve. There is archaic thinking today and it is time we woke up to it.</P>
    <P>On top of that, is it not time we had a look at the stores and equipment being bought for the Army? God protect us, some of it is as outdated as the hand mangle compared with the washing machine and spindrier combined. We have the position that we are trying to maintain the interest of serving officers in that outmoded equipment which was out of date even before the start of the last war, not to speak of the idea of modern rocket ballistics and intercontinental missiles. It is time we developed a proper perspective on where we are going.</P>
    <P>I am staggered by the tremendous loyalty and dedication of the Army in spite of all this. It is with conscious pride that I come in here to urge this type of consideration on behalf of Army personnel. There are some of the finest types you will ever meet within the ranks of the men, NCOs and officers in our Defence Forces. They <Col N="1375" /> are entitled to the type of human consideration to which that dedication entitles them.</P>
    <P>It is time somebody sat back and looked at the whole problem of the diffusion of personnel around the country and the multiplicity of archaic posts they have to try to keep open. My colleague, Deputy P. O'Donnell, mentioned the forts up in his country. There are many of them down in my country and it seems somewhat farcical that we will not do something about their demolition when we know that the ammunition for their guns will never be made again and that most of them are full of jelly and will never be fired again. Our coast artillery personnel have the monotony of having to check guns A and B for quantity of graphite or jelly, or whatever has been stuck up the bore, and boredom becomes the operative function of these repetitive exercises.</P>
    <P>The Army is worthy of the best this country can give. We should do some straight thinking in that direction. Nowadays we are talking about bigger units, streamlining personnel, and all that kind of thing. Surely the time has come when we should give a real estimate of our needs in Army personnel and surely we can place them strategically and efficiently so that their tours of duty will be reasonable, their quarters will be comfortable and they will not be virtually fatigue parties for cleaning barrack? That is the feature I want looked into, not in a controversial but in a practical way, with a view to improvements being made.</P>
    <P>We have discussed the Navy and, let us all be honest, it is nearly time that our corvettes were presented to some museum or other. That is what they are, museum pieces to be kept afloat by the overstrained and overworked personnel of a grand little corps. Fishery protection, my eye. If they did not break down halfway to the ground, they would not be able to catch anything. Let us be realistic. We could get a readymade, much more effective, modern type of vessel in the 90, 100, 120-foot class mounted with light armour that would do the fishery protection job infinitely better and, it <Col N="1376" /> seems to me, give certain current information service to people fishing around it. I think the naval personnel would welcome some kind of modern vessel, or near-modern vessel. They would provide infinitely interesting tours of duty and would not involve the same terrible strain on the personnel. I know, because I am living adjacent to the naval headquarters in Cork Harbour, what the strain is if they try to put two corvettes to sea with the naval personnel down there. I know from discussions I had with young fellows, good type young fellows, who left the naval service, that it was this excessive tour of duty, this overburdening of this willing personnel that has caused the gradual decline in recruitment to the Navy.</P>
    <P>I shall not comment on that further than to say that these naval personnel, officers, petty officers and men, are proud of the service they give but they do feel that it is a little bit Gilbertian, if nothing else, trying to man these corvettes which are, strictly speaking, only fit for buying up by museums. You will not keep alive the high morale in such an admirable little force unless you give them something less archaic. There is an eerie-cheerie Cobh now if the corvette gets out of the harbour. There is no use in our trying to fool ourselves; that is the situation.</P>
    <P>I agree with other speakers that the FCA get far less than the recognition they should get. They are our first-line Reserve now, and were the situation to arise in which we were faced with any type of upheaval, they are the people we would take in immediately for the purpose of augmenting our defences and doing the job. For some strange reason&mdash;not really so strange&mdash;the kind of bizarre treatment they get with regard to annual training, the kind of grandiose contempt with which some of the armchair soldiers treat them, does not improve their morale either. I am telling the Minister and his Department that the sooner they get back into that wing of our armed services the high standard of dedication and efficiency that was theirs, the better it will be for all of us, because to my mind, it would be impossible for us to carry on our present concept and <Col N="1377" /> organisation of defence without them. It would have been impossible for us to service our foreign forces and our peacekeeping forces abroad, were it not for the amount of service and training these men went through, which was utilised and was helpful in getting certain chores done around barracks and keeping other personnel occupied.</P>
    <P>The FCA are a good force, a devoted force; they are in the best tradition of our own people, because they are of the people and, as such, are worthy of the best possible consideration we can give them, and certainly worthy of full training periods and such remuneration as we can give them for it. Remember this: they were built up in the light of circumstance and experience we had. They were a well-knit community, still are, and I think we will all agree that if we wanted to give them the recognition this House should, we should ensure they are treated&mdash;particularly when integrated and on parade with the Army or in training with the Army&mdash;in the best possible manner. We should ensure not only that they get their full periods of training but that everything in the matter of their comfort in barracks or in camp, and their maintenance and rest be of the highest possible standard. That is what we want.</P>
    <P>The problems of the Army go deeper because we are in a changing situation worldwise; the day of Waterloo has gone, the day of the Battle of Verdun went out with the First World War, the day of the air-strike and the commando seems to be on the way out, and we are now at the stage where we have the problem of atomic warfare. That means we have to consider seriously the integration of Civil Defence and the Army. I know it is the current plan that should an atomic attack start, certain key Army personnel, who are in charge of Civil Defence in their own areas, and certain local authority members, will become the constituent authorities in their areas and will become the commanders for the purpose. I believe the time has come to devote an increasing number of Army personnel to this type of work, to get down to an increasing effort to alert, train and consolidate the ordinary <Col N="1378" /> people into an understanding of Civil Defence. In so far as I have studied the problem and am <i>au fait</i> with the present situation, it does appear there are certain rudimentary trainings and certain types of shelters and semishelters that can be built, which would eliminate a lot of risk. We would be much better off teaching our people the nature of these defences than many of the things on which we waste our time in connection with obsolescent barracks, equipment and training ideas.</P>
    <P>The Army Vote in future, in so far as it spends money on stores at all, will have to try to direct that expenditure on the basis of equipment which has some significance in this day and age. We seem to have a wonderful capacity for finding the most outmoded type of equipment. I am sure we are buying it at a tremendous discount but it is of no value for training purposes and of no value at all when it comes to relieving the monotony which must inevitably set in in an Army in peacetime. It is time to say this: the apprenticeship scheme of the Army has been a tremendous success and has done extraordinary good for the people who were fortunate enough to avail of the opportunities. In so far as is possible, there should be an extension of the school and the scope of the school. It should be extended to a number of other trades, for which the Army has the personnel to do the full training.</P>
    <P>I have seen some of those boys at work; I have seen the work they have done and it is a credit to the Army. I always felt this scheme would be a success, but I am convinced that type of dedication and effort in the Army personnel merits from us the type of consideration we are not giving them. I have no doubt at all, in view of the extraordinarily fine job the corps of engineers did down in Ceannt Park, if they were given the opportunity they would build&mdash;build very efficiently, and a good deal more cheaply than most agencies&mdash;houses for Army personnel. Not only would it give them something to do within their own sphere of activity, within their own sphere of training, but it would also give an opportunity to increase the apprentice outlet and train personnel in the Army <Col N="1379" /> in the various facets of the building trade. We want new houses. We certainly want them outside the confines of barracks because it is archaic in this day and age to have the personnel and their families, NCOs and men, checking in through a gate to their own married quarters at night as if they were some kind of undersized children or delinquent schoolboys. Deputy Dowling is absolutely right when he suggests that the idea of confining Army personnel within the barrack walls in married quarters is archaic.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House too long. I do not want to say too much and so destroy the impact of my first suggestions. I believe it is not a question of more money; it is a question of readjusting our thinking and using the money voted more effectively. I should like the Minister to set up a commission consisting of Army personnel and civil servants in the Department to see what kind of scheme they could work out to utilise the training, skill and technique Army captains and commandants have coming out of the Army at 54 and 56 years of age and how they could make these skills available in other types of jobs until they reach 65 years of age, thus removing from their lives this ever-lurking spectre of what will happen to them at a time when their sons or daughters are at the age of turn, when these men have to leave the Army if they do not get promotion. The stark reality is that beyond the rank of commandant, promotion is very exceptional and beyond the rank of lieutenant-colonel, it is practically non-existent. We have been talking about this for years and it is time we got down to tackling it.</P>
    <P>My final remark is that the loyal service which our NCOs and men have given since 1922 has been incredible. Surely the time has come when we should remove the archaic restrictions on giving them adequate gratuities when they are leaving the Forces and also professional opportunities in relation to rehabilitating themselves in State or semi-State bodies after leaving the Army at such an early age? We <Col N="1380" /> should do this in appreciation of the fact that they have given loyal and continuous service to this nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall begin by echoing the sentiments expressed about the great pride the people of Ireland take in the way our soldiers have been serving abroad under the United Nations flag and how much we all appreciate the tremendous goodwill they are creating for Ireland. They are, in a sense, ambassadors abroad and I was delighted to read the Minister's comments on how well they have been received wherever they have gone, the manner in which they have made themselves friendly and have tried to understand, as it were, the problems of the ordinary people they have met in the various lands in which they have found themselves.</P>
      <P>Then, I should like to comment briefly on the position of the refunds which we are due from the United Nations. A small country like this can find many other uses for the money which we have had to lay out to provide for our troops wherever they may be called to serve. We do not begrudge this because we believe it is being well spent in the cause of furthering peace. We know the United Nations are aware of this but they should be made even more aware of why we should not be kept waiting too long for the refunds which are due to us. The money which the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations is still trying to raise could be put to use here as quickly as we get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the FCA, I understand there are approximately 80,000 men in the Force, a very substantial force of loyal and very enthusiastic people. On numerous occasions I have been approached by FCA members and asked whether it would be possible for them to have their own dress uniform. They take great pride in their units, are proud to be soldiers, and they would like to have their own dress uniform, for which they are prepared to pay if they are allowed to have it. Soldiers in every Army in the world take pride, when they go to functions, in wearing their best uniform, their &ldquo;Blues&rdquo; or dress uniform, <Col N="1381" /> as it is generally known. Members of the FCA are no exception and I ask the Minister to give further thought to allowing these men to purchase a dress uniform with a special mark on it to show their unit. It would be very well received indeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the tenth round increase which was awarded last year and which came into effect. Unfortunately, a number of officers have not benefited as yet. The £1 a week increase was given to all those with £1,200 a year or less and junior officers, in particular, have not received it. I understand a commission have been set up to try to decide what the exact situation is in relation to the Civil Service. I hope the Minister will have a decision soon.</P>
    <P>On the question of married quarters for soldiers, I have seen some of them recently. Some of the families have to live in very restricted space. I should like to add my voice to those who have said that as many married quarters as possible should be built outside barracks. The days of living in barracks are over.</P>
    <P>I was glad to read in the Minister's speech about the ground work being done by the Civil Defence personnel in giving lectures to members of the Garda Síochána, the Civil Service and other bodies. I put forward the suggestion that possibly the military authorities would be able to organise similar lectures for members of the public and, perhaps, for schools. Civil Defence is of great interest to everyone, and if my suggestion could be adopted even experimentally, we would see whether members of the public who talk about it would attend such lectures. I do not propose to take up any more of the time of the House, as most of the points have already been covered. I will conclude by again praising highly the wonderful work our soldiers are doing abroad and saying how proud everyone in Ireland is of them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I wish to join with the other Deputies who have complimented our troops serving abroad with the UN. We all feel a sense of pride in the services <Col N="1382" /> these troops are rendering in the cause of world peace. I was glad to hear from the Minister that he found them all quite happy when he visited them some time ago. There was a rumour abroad here that our troops in Cyprus were not being properly housed and were not being treated on a par with some other troops. The Minister has to a great extent allayed our worries on that score. He told us he had no complaints from them. He said he visited their quarters and found them living under canvas and in other semi-permanent buildings. The criticism some time ago was that whilst our troops were housed under canvas or in semipermanent buildings, troops of other countries were housed in permanent buildings. It is unfortunate that when the Minister was there he did not inspect the accommodation of the other troops. He told us he did not have an opportunity of making such an inspection. If he had done so, he would be in a better position to assess the treatment meted out to our troops <i>vis-á-vis</i> the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to note that there has been a considerable improvement in the payment of expenses incurred by this country in the peace-keeping missions abroad. Undoubtedly this country should play its part in preserving peace in Cyprus as it did in the Congo. As I say, we all take pride in that, but there was a time some years ago when the United Nations was indebted to us for a very considerable sum of money in respect of expenses incurred by us in this mission. I do not think it reasonable that a small country like ours should be called on to give generously of its manhood and of its Army in preserving peace and should be at a financial loss as a result. I see that the position has improved, and improved considerably, but apparently there is £500,000 in round figures still due to us in respect of the Cyprus effort. The Minister hopes this will be paid as soon as possible. Apparently there is another £250,000 which has not yet been claimed. The Minister hopes that that will be claimed in the near future. I repeat that I think a small country like this should not be at any <Col N="1383" /> loss and that we should be indemnified in full against any expense incurred.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of special allowances paid to members of the Old IRA and those who played their part in fighting for the freedom of this country and for the establishment of the State, I wish to appeal to the Minister and to the Government to be a bit more generous. As the Minister says in his statement, the numbers are getting fewer: they are dying out. He also said a significant thing when he said: &ldquo;Many more special allowance holders than formerly are over 70 years of age and are eligible for old age pensions&rdquo;. I am sure he means to imply that when they become eligible for an old age pension, they cease to be eligible for the full special allowances. I think it would not be going too far for all practical purposes to ignore the old age pension they get and give them the special allowance.</P>
    <P>Some time ago on a Supplementary Estimate for the Minister's Department, we had a discussion here on the ratio of civil servants in the Department of Defence to the number of serving soldiers and officers. I think it was calculated that we had about one civil servant to every 12 or 13 members of the Defence Forces. I know we must have civil servants in the Department of Defence and I am sure the great majority of them are performing very useful work. I am satisfied all of them are carrying out the Minister's directions and orders but I must say I think the time of some of those civil servants is being abused for political purposes under the direction of the Minister.</P>
    <P>We know that the time of civil servants in all Departments is taken up from time to time answering representations made on behalf of constituents by Deputies. I suppose that is inevitable, although if analysed very closely, the wisdom of it might be questioned. At any rate, I suppose that when a Deputy writes to the Department of Defence making representations on behalf of a constituent, who is an applicant for a special allowance or anything else, he is entitled to get a reply. Some people make complaints <Col N="1384" /> about that but I do not. At the same time, when the time of civil servants is taken up in passing on information to Members of the Oireachtas, who do not make representations on behalf of anybody, it is going a bit far.</P>
    <P>I am in a position to say that civil servants in the Department of Defence are engaged, under the direction of the Minister, in passing on information to Members of the Oireachtas, to give political kudos to Members of the Oireachtas and to give them political advantage for Party political purposes. I am in a position to say that I have had first-hand information that when Members of this House make representations on behalf of a constituent to the Department of Defence, if he is a Member of the Opposition, he gets a courteous reply in due course giving him the result of his representation and a decision on the case. About a fortnight or ten days before he receives that communication, a member of the Government Party in his constituency who apparently has not intervened in any way at all is made aware of the decision in advance so that he can communicate with the unfortunate who has fought for his rights. That unfortunate person is led to believe that it was as a result of the efforts of a member of the Government Party that he got what he is entitled to.</P>
    <P>I want to say that that may be good political tactics and may perhaps serve to regain a seat for a Member of the Oireachtas who has lost a seat, but I think the whole thing childish. I do not think it deceives anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I think it is childish and I do not believe it deceives anybody, but as Deputy Coughlan says, it is despicable and would seek to undermine the esteem in which democracy is held in this country. I am not making a wild charge; I do not consider this a charge at all, because from the point of view of political profit or loss, I do not think it worth talking about. However, I can assure the Minister that I have <Col N="1385" /> in my possession three letters which I received in or about the same time regarding three different cases. Those letters were addressed to me, giving me full particulars of the cases in a very courteous way. I also have in my possession three letters which the constituents concerned received from a Member of the Oireachtas, with a letter in each case from the constituent concerned confirming that they had never approached the other Member of the Oireachtas to do anything for them, had not been speaking to him and did not know anything about it. Indeed, it was quite clear from the letters which the particular Member of the Oireachtas wrote to the constituents concerned that he was chancing his arm because he was vague and just gave the fact that an increase in the special allowance was being granted or that a special allowance had been granted for the first time. It was equally clear he did not even know the correct names of the constituents concerned or, shall I say, the names by which they were known.</P>
      <P>If civil servants are engaged in this type of activity, on the direction of the Minister, I regard it as a waste of public money and as an undermining of the system of democratic government that we have in this country as far as the Minister, his Department and the particular Member of the Oireachtas is concerned. I regard it as a type of three-card trick of the lowest type, as a sort of an attempt to play on the simple folk who are entitled to such privileges as are provided for them, an attempt to play on their simplicity and to deceive them. I would strongly appeal to the Minister because I am sure the Minister must approve of it or it would not be done, to stop this. I appeal to the Government to stop it and I would like the Minister to unravel the mystery, if there is any mystery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the Minister does not see anything wrong with this: maybe he accepts it and considers it proper procedure. Perhaps he thinks that members of the Government <Col N="1386" /> Party are entitled to this advance warning or advance notice so that they can play the political game, but if the Minister thinks what I am saying is not correct, I am prepared to lay on the Table of this House the correspondence concerned. I felt that I would be lacking in my duty as a Member of this House if I did not expose this sort of thing. When it first occurred a week or so after I got the correspondence I called to the Department of Defence and intended to take it up with the Secretary, the permanent head of the Department but he was out out of the country at the time. Then it struck me that really was not the Secretary's business or responsibility, that this was being done on the direction of the political head of the Department. I intended to raise it here and I have done so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the question of maintenance of barracks. I have been persuing the Estimate and I notice that the figure quoted here for repairs, renewals and maintenance is £163,600. This figure out of a total of approximately £12 million, the total Estimate for the Department of Defence, strikes me as being a very small sum. I am particularly interested in this amount when I think of the repairs, maintenance and renewals so necessary in the barracks in my constituency, Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa, formerly known as Renmore Barracks in Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This barracks, I understand, was built in 1880. In the married quarters there, the only improvements of any substantial nature which have taken place since 1880 are the addition of a very small bathroom in each of the married quarters. When the Minister heard certain rumours and had certain fears about the conditions in which our troops were being maintained and the accommodation provided for them, he showed his concern by visiting and inspecting these quarters on his trip to Cyprus to visit the troops there. I commend him for that action, but I would recommend to the Minister a thorough inspection of a barracks here at home <Col N="1387" /> in my constituency to see for himself at first-hand the conditions in which the serving soldiers there must live and must bring up their families.</P>
    <P>I would make a special appeal to the Minister to keep in mind, in the spending of this very small sum of £163,600, the absolute urgency and necessity for the installation of a central heating unit in Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa. I know this barracks inside out. I am proud to say I served with the FCA some years ago and am well acquainted with the barracks. On several visits since I have not seen any improvement since my time about ten years ago. Each dormitory accommodates 12 men and they are expected to live and sleep in these barrack dormitories, 50 feet by 14 feet, which are most uncomfortable and extremely cold, even in the summer months. The bathrooms which those men are provided with are actually outside this room where they sleep. They have to go out through an open passage to the toilet during the daytime. This to me is primitive, as, I am sure, it is to the Minister. I would recommend to him to have a special survey carried out, or, if he would visit the area, to see the conditions himself.</P>
    <P>We should also like to see the canteen facilities for soldiers serving there improved. I can safely say that one could travel the breadth of Ireland without finding a canteen in such a poor condition. This is partly due to the fact that the barracks canteen committee, which is responsible for the maintenance of the canteen, must charge reasonable prices, which means that there is never any great profit which they could plough back into the improvement of the canteen. This is a matter which is causing some concern and discontent among the soldiers there.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to recruitment. I understand that it is some time since any recruiting campaign was carried out, certainly in Galway and in the west. The Minister referred to recruitment to the Naval Service and recruitment for Civil Defence, but no reference was made to recruitment to <Col N="1388" /> the Army. I am surprised that no reference was made to this because at present there are no more than six or seven recruits in the Galway barracks. The barracks has accommodation for 300 soldiers and there are only about 180 non-commissioned officers and privates there at present who are commanded by a commissioned force which varies from seven to 14, a fairly reasonable proportion. I should like to seen an intensive recruitment campaign for this barracks.</P>
    <P>The wages paid to young men is very satisfactory and if there were proper publicity, there would be such a demand that they would have to limit the numbers joining up in Galway. A young man can come into the Army as a private and start off with about £5 18s. pocket money. Added to that, he has his keep and his clothes, the uniform he wears at his duties. On average, that wage would rise after 12 months, when it would be expected that he would reach the rank of a three-star private, to £7 15s a week. This is very good money when one estimates what the fringe benefits are worth. If a man's rations are taken to be worth 6/- a day and his keep as low as 2/6 a bed and his clothes as low as £1, you will find that his income is roughly £11 10s. a week.</P>

      <P>Recruitment seems to have stopped in the west of Ireland and perhaps the Minister might elaborate on this point if he has some information about it. We would like to see our barracks at full strength. We are proud of the men serving in it and of the manner in which they carry out their duties. We are particularly proud of the large number of them who were chosen to serve abroad. In that regard, I should like to commend the Minister for his visit to Cyprus. It was a very nice gesture on his part. It was a very long journey for a man who is kept busy in ministerial office to undertake and it was very thoughtful of him to visit the men, address them and see the conditions in which they were working. However, I would recommend him to have a closer look at conditions at home as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that the Minister devoted three-quarters of his speech to congratulating the men who have served abroad. We are all glad of that but the men who served abroad had already been trained at home for foreign service. Unfortunately, the position now is that there is no more recruitment to the Army. I do not know what the Minister has in mind when he says that recruitment is going on. In Limerick city we have a barracks as big as any outside Dublin or the Curragh and I have made several attempts to have men, many of them young married men who for one reason or another had to leave the Army and who had firstclass records, reinstated. All of these men were turned down. In one case, a mistake was made and a man was told that he could apply and would be reinstated, but subsequently I received a telephone call from the barracks to the effect that the authorities in Dublin had said that a mistake had been made and that this <Col N="1390" /> man could not be reinstated in the Army.</P>
      <P>There is no point in the Minister telling us what he is going to do with the Army because we who live among the Army know what the Army needs. I want to draw the Minister's attention to their grievances and to the conditions in which these men are asked to live in Limerick city. It is not the first occasion on which I have drawn the Minister's attention to the fact that if the married quarters in Limerick were inspected by our housing officers&mdash;which they are not allowed to do&mdash;they would be condemned out of hand. However, our housing officers and housing inspectors are forbidden to enter the barracks to inspect the conditions there, the filthy hovels in which these soldiers are asked to live. It is not so long since I and other Members of the House questioned the fact that it was impossible to instal plugs in the barracks for washing machines or television sets. That position still prevails. If the Minister is under any misapprehension, I will take him to the married quarters any day he wishes, and point out to him the dirt and filth, the leaking roofs, and the conditions in which these unfortunate people are asked to live.</P>
      <P>I am told it is intended to build six houses to help the housing situation in Limerick. That is like a daisy in a bull's mouth because the whole of the married quarters in Sarsfield Barracks must be levelled to the ground. I defy the Minister, or the man who has been sending out these filthy double-dealing letters a week ahead of the representations made locally, to come to Limerick and allow into Sarsfield Barracks any of our housing inspectors, and we will have a demolition order made within 21 days, the number of days required by statute. If the Minister thinks six houses will rectify the position, he had better take another look at it, and he had better make another visit to Sarsfield Barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come now to the Navy. The Minister devoted three or four lines of his speech to the Navy. He said one corvette has been refitted and that <Col N="1391" /> another is undergoing a similar refit. I have a question down for answer tomorrow which will prove to the Minister beyond yea or nay that many more of those who are attached to the Navy are on land than on sea. What the unfortunate people at sea have to try to manipulate reminds me of the day when poor old Noah went off about his business, or when the <i>Kontiki</i> went off somewhere, not knowing where it would finish up.</P>
    <P>These men who are asked to serve on these two decrepit old wretches of corvettes should be decorated for bravery, and it is about time the Minister took note of this. I will take him for a trip on a corvette any day if he wants to see for himself.</P>

      <P>There is one thing certain. It will be rocking financially when he is in it. It would also be interesting to find out tomorrow, from the question which I hope will be answered, the area which this cripple and a half of a corvette has to survey, and the amount of work it has to do. This is no joke. It is a fact. I know something about this because I went to the trouble of finding out&mdash;much more than the Minister did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer now to An Slua Mhuirí. We have attached to the Naval Service very active young men who have devoted most of their time and attention to An Slua Mhuirí. They have not yet been provided with a rowboat. They go for their annual training to Haulbowline, or wherever they have to go. They go there diligently every year, and they come back and march around the town on parade on dry-land duty. Not as much as a rowboat is provided on the River Shannon for these young men. What does the Minister expect from these devoted young men, men who have <Col N="1392" /> a vocation for this calling? Where is the encouragement for them? It is not there.</P>
    <P>One other matter I want to deal with is the medical services provided by the Minister for members of the Army. We heard a lot about the medical services from the previous Minister, but it has all been contradicted now. We will be hearing more about that very soon. The tragic position with regard to the ordinary private or NCO today is that he is deprived of all medical services, except at his own expense. The health authorities have withdrawn the medical cards for the past 12 or 18 months and any medical services now have to be provided at his own expense.</P>
    <P>We in Limerick&mdash;and I am a member of Limerick Health Authority&mdash; have been more than generous in our treatment of medical card holders and applicants, but unfortunately all Army men are out, while, at the same time, medical services are provided free of charge for the officers and higher ranks in the Army. There are permanent men all over the place in the different barracks so far as I know, and in Limerick, there is one permanent men who attends to the officers only. That is something which is worthy of investigation. The Minister and whoever is advising him may have made a thorough investigation of the Congo and Cyprus, but we should start putting our own house in order at home first. If I were to publish what the Minister has presented to us here today in Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick, I know how long it would last on the notice board, because the whole thing so far as I am concerned is deception, piffle and tripe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points I want to raise on this Estimate. It came to my notice not very long ago that although serving personnel in the Army&mdash;and I presume this applies to the Navy and the Air Corps&mdash;are passed as fit to join the service when they are recruited, if they fall into ill-health and have to retire from the service, they are not entitled to a pension unless they have served overseas. I should like the Minister to clarify the position in that regard, and <Col N="1393" /> to state whether it is true. If it is, we must be about the only fighting service in Europe today, or possibly in the world, that does not look after its people when they are invalided.</P>
      <P>I had a case last year or the year before in which a man had been recruited to the service and passed by the medical personnel as in perfect health. Then he had some lesion or heart trouble, and he was subsequently invalided and could not get a pension because he was not eligible. I understand that all he was eligible for was a small gratuity, the argument being that this was some sort of latent disease that did not manifest itself until later on. I want to put this to the Minister. If a man joins the Defence Forces, it is his career, as such, if he joins up for a fulltime period. He gives the best years of his life to it. Then, at 30, or perhaps a bit more, he finds himself out again in civil life and cannot get any pension. There is something wrong in that. It should be adjusted and attended to immediately.</P>
      <P>In regard to the service of personnel overseas, I know that the personnel are fully protected nowadays as to pension rights and if they contract any disease, and so on. It seems to me that we shall have a lot of demands for service personnel in the not too distant future. With the desire of the former colonial powers to get rid of their responsibilities as soon as possible, they have the habit of giving home rule or self-government, or whatever you like to call it, too late, as a rule. They usually wait until there is the father and mother of a disturbance in the country and they are forced to get out when they establish what is known as an emergent nation and set it up as such. On account of the curious set-up in these countries in which many conglomerations of tribes, and so on, are involved, there is usually an upheaval. The call immediately goes out to a country such as ours, which is not a colonial power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very likely that there will be a heavy call on us for troops in the future. I can see the possibility of such a situation in Nigeria in the not too distant future where they have had <Col N="1394" /> several revolutions and in Aden, where there is a disturbance going on now. Have we the personnel to cope with that situation? Have we sufficient service personnel to deal with any demands that may be made on us? I notice that the Minister said that the bulk of the demands had been met by the United Nations. Is the Minister satisfied, from his experience and the considerable delay there has been in meeting these demands by the United Nations, that if there is a fairly heavy call on our personnel, the demands will be met? Is he satisfied that, if there are heavy calls on our personnel, we shall have sufficient personnel, on the basis of the recruitment at present, to have a safe amount of troops within this country? We have always to remember that the Minister's Party is not over-popular in certain areas lately and it may be necessary even to utilise troops for the restoration of law and order. It is a factor that has always to be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I come now to the Irish Naval Service. It seems the most idiotic economy conceivable that we persist with these corvettes. They cost a tremendous amount to refit, to refuel and to utilise. They are of no use as fishery protection ships. They are too slow. They can be seen, hull up, miles away so that anybody fishing within territorial waters can get out of them because the corvettes are not fast enough to catch them unless they sink the boat which is trying to escape. They must be a national burden to refuel and to send anywhere.</P>
    <P>To have any sort of a naval service, we must associate with other navies. We must be seagoing. A corvette costs five or six times as much to send on a cruise as something which would be suitable for the purpose for which we require it. Last week, I put down a question to the Minister inquiring about the position with regard to our corvettes. I accept that, having only three of them, it is extremely likely that one would be at a dockyard for refitting in rotation and that the other two would be in service. The Minister's reply was that we can man two corvettes but that we have to withdraw <Col N="1395" /> shore personnel to man the second. Is it not a ludicrous state of affairs to say that we are trying to carry on a naval service with antiquated ships which are of no use for the purpose for which they are required? They are not of any use for anything; they are not of any use for action or for harbour defence. They are not even able to lay a proper smokescreen. About ten years ago, they might have been utilised for a slow convoy. There are very few merchant ships which would be convoyed which would travel as slowly as our Irish corvettes. Therefore, it would be in the national interest and in the national economy to dispose of these ships as soon as possible and to get some smaller type of craft that would be of some service for the purpose for which they are intended, which is largely fishery and harbour defence and convoy in times of emergency.</P>
    <P>On several occasions in this House I have mentioned to successive Ministers for Defence what other countries with parallel population and financial conditions have done to preserve their fisheries from the point of view of the type of vessel they use. I have even been told that the British Navy would be willing to lease ships to us for the purpose of keeping the ships in commission so that they could be used at any time they were wanted in an emergency. We could get a fairly modern up-to-date navy, at practically no cost, if we had any negotiations with other navies who would lease us ships to do the job they are required to do.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that everybody in official life has long lost all interest in the Irish Naval Service. Is it any wonder that it cannot get recruits? I did not realise, until I heard Deputy Coughlan speak just now, how idiotic the situation is with regard to our Naval service. They have nothing to train with. If you want to train a sailor, you must send him to sea to get his sea legs. If they all go down to a dockyard and do a bit of drill there, then we might as well keep them here and let them do the drill in a square.</P>
    <P>The Minister should go to the Minister for Finance for the requisite sum <Col N="1396" /> in capital expenditure for a replacement of these corvettes which are now becoming a standard joke in the annals of naval history and save a considerable sum of money in the annual Budget and in the expense of running the Department of Defence.</P>

      <P>I am sure I shall be pardoned if, to a great extent, my reply to the points raised in this debate is a bit scrappy. I am grateful to the various Deputies who contributed so usefully to the discussion. However, a number of issues were raised to which I shall devote whatever time is at my disposal in my reply.</P>
      <P>The number of civil servants and also the number of civilian employees in the Department of Defence was raised. The Civil Service staff of the Department of Defence is not as ridiculously large as has been alleged by our critics. It has been alleged it is ridiculously large in relation to our Army of 8,000, that it is too costly and that in any case it is unnecessary, as the Department of Defence should not have any civil servants at all but should be staffed entirely by military.</P>
      <P>To take the last point first, it is a principle of our democratic way of government that Departments of State are staffed by civil servants. The Department of Defence is not, and should not, be an exception. It is at least as important in that Department as in the others to express the civilian nature of our administration. This must be seen as a fundamental proposition transcending any question of the size of the Civil Service staff, its cost or even its efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody seriously questions the necessity for the existence of the Defence Forces. Deputies have commented favourably on them in general, and some have even suggested we should increase them. Other Deputies made the point that we should bring them into line with modern requirements. The Defence Forces, such as they are, are there and their numbers are regulated in accordance with Government policy. They must be fed and accommodated. Pay and allied matters have to receive attention. They <Col N="1397" /> must be equipped, and this involves the purchase of a wide variety of stores. In that connection I want to assure the House that whenever purchases of equipment are made, it is the most modern equipment that is purchased. That has been the practice at all times except in the very early stages and in emergencies when equipment was required quickly.</P>
    <P>A code of Defence Force Regulations must be provided. Military and other lands for which the Department has responsibility must be administered. All this, and the various military activities which involve business with Government Departments and other civilian interests, give rise to a vast amount of clerical work and negotiation. It is the responsibility of the Minister for Defence to ensure the satisfactory performance of these functions and the civil servants appointed in the Department of Defence for that purpose are acting on his behalf.</P>
    <P>On the purely practical level, if the Civil Service were removed from the Department of Defence, its place would have to be taken by other personnel&mdash; by military personnel, as has been suggested by the critics. There are two things to be said about this. First, if a cheaper form of labour is the objective, the result is likely to be very disappointing. Second, it would involve the diversion to clerical work and miscellaneous office duties of something like the equivalent of a battalion of troops from their proper military pursuits&mdash;more in fact than we have serving overseas at present. This would be an intolerable burden on the permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>The actual number of civil servants in the Department of Defence on the 28th February, 1967, was 504 of all descriptions, including 80 belonging to non-clerical classes such as messengers, cleaners, etc. I am quoting from a reply I gave in the House to Deputy Ryan. Civil Defence accounted for 55, and pensions and allied matters 73. The Establishment Section, which deals with the administration of the Department generally and with the conditions of employment of over 1,500 civilian <Col N="1398" /> employees of 90 different categories, had a staff of 65 excluding messengers, cleaners, etc. Broadly speaking, therefore, the number dealing with the Defence Forces was of the order of 230 administrative and clerical personnel.</P>
    <P>What do these 230 do? The statistics of some of their activities which lend themselves to that form of analysis may be helpful. Taking personal accounts alone, the civil service staff compiles and audits the pay accounts of 7,150 weekly paid military personnel, 1,500 weekly paid civilian employees and 20,000 effective FCA members and other reservists. The staff compiles the accounts of and pays directly: 3,800 soldiers' wives, paid marriage allowance weekly; 900 soldiers' parents, paid voluntary allotment weekly; 1,300 officers, cadets, nurses and chaplains, paid monthly; 500 civil servants, paid monthly, bimonthly or weekly, and 500 Reserve officers of the First Line.</P>
    <P>This may be summarised briefly by saying that there are approximately 35,000 current personal accounts in operation involving the making and/or recording of a total of roughly three-quarters of a million disbursements per annum. There is also, at any given time, a very large number of personal accounts in the process of being wound up, including about 10,000 non-effective FCA accounts. Counting children in respect of whom allowances are paid, there are some 50,000 persons who, directly or indirectly, are paid some form of remuneration or allowance by the Department of Defence.</P>

There are various allowances such as additional pay, ration allowance, travelling and subsistence allowances, uniform allowance, overseas allowances; and deductions such as rations, clothing, electricity and fuel on repayment, quarters, income tax, saving certificates, life insurance, fines, forfeitures, <i>et cetera.</i></P>

      <P>The Civil Service staff places about 7,000 contracts annually, in accordance with the approved Government contracts procedure, for a very wide range of goods and services and valued in a normal year at upwards of £2 million. It administers over 300 properties, involving the handling of numerous lettings, rentals and encroachments. The Civil Service staff of the Department for Defence has been subjected to intensive scrutiny since about 1948 in the light of post World War II developments. It can be said that the current staff is the minimum capable of effectively discharging its responsibilities. However, the introduction of a computer system in the Finance Branch, scheduled for late in 1967, will appreciably affect the staffing position. This in itself is proof that the Department has moved with the times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the Deputy's point separately. I have already referred to the 1,500 civilians employed in army units. Very largely these are tradesmen and labourers <Col N="1400" /> who are there to do work for which qualified military personnel are not available. It is the practice in most modern armies to have a number of civilian employees, tradesmen and others. Our proportion is about the same as that in other armies, as far as I understand.</P>
      <P>The question of the disposal of military barracks has also been raised, as it was last year and on numerous occasions before that. As the House is aware, our military barracks are an inheritance. They were there when the State was founded, and practically all of them have been occupied since by military forces. The question of their disposal and the provision of our troops with new barracks is a big question and one to which I have given a good deal of thought. Last year I informed the House that I was having the matter examined. I have since consulted the military authorities and the officials of the Department of Defence on this matter. As Minister for Defence, I must take account of their advice on matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>I realise that the maintenance of some of the barracks that we occupy at the present time is a heavy burden on the State. I realise that many of the billets the soldiers occupy could be much better. I also realise that we would operate much more efficiently if we had barracks built to modern requirements. However, this is not an over-rich country, and we are limited by the amount of money voted each year for these purposes. One would think all we had to do was to shut these barracks and give them away to Dublin Corporation or some other body. It just cannot be done that way. This is State property and it has to be dealt with according to the method of disposing of State property. I have not yet received a report in relation to the future of our barracks, so I cannot say what advice I shall get from the authorities. I agree with Deputy Tully when he said it would not be possible to take our troops out of the city of Dublin. As long as it is necessary to maintain them in Dublin, we must have barrack accommodation for them.</P>

      <P>If I am going to continue my reply to the points raised, I must be allowed to do so without constant interruption. I do not mind an odd shaft in any circumstances. I realise that there is a problem about these barracks and that it will have to be faced some time.</P>
      <P>The question of the provision of houses for military personnel is an old one. The Department of Defence has done the best it could down the years with the money that was made available to it to provide houses as married quarters. Many of the old married quarters are not up to the minute, but they are occupied at a very low rent. It is not a rent really; they are occupied at a very low charge. Some people do not like leaving this accommodation when the time comes and we often have to go to a lot of trouble to get possession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not putting that up as an excuse. I wish I had the money to build houses for military personnel. I would not build married quarters inside the barracks at all. I believe that is a hangover from the other days. That day is gone and in the concept of modern living, soldiers should have accommodation that is not too close to military quarters. But there are other considerations. Men serving in barracks like to be near; they do not like to have to take transport or go by bicycle or other means in order to get from their homes to the barracks.</P>
      <P>It is primarily the responsibility of the local authorities to provide housing, and all over the country they have been very generous about that matter. Wherever troops are serving, the local authority, as far as they possibly can, accommodate military personnel. It is my desire to do the best I can with the money available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been criticised because I did not mention the FCA in my opening speech. The Estimate is mainly for the purpose of providing money for the Army. The first line of defence is the standing Army and the second line <Col N="1402" /> is composed of the FCA and the other reserves. Since I became Minister for Defence, I have not spared myself in attending FCA camps and speaking to the men themselves, encouraging them in the good work they have undertaken and asking them to give long enough time in the service to become efficient. I did not think it necessary to labour this point or to repeat it here in the House.</P>

      <P>But two weeks is as much as can be managed. As I say, it is not enough. From my own somewhat limited experience, it is not sufficient time in which to train a man to be an effective and an efficient soldier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was raised of accommodating disability pensioners in St. Bricin's Hospital. That has been raised on previous occasions, both with myself and with my predecessors. There are different points of view. I have examined the matter and I have come to the conclusion that, because of the extensive programme of hospitalisation that has taken place throughout the country over the past number of years and the facilities now available to everyone, there is no real necessity to take on this responsibility in St. Bricin's Hospital. Since I became Minister, I have had many requests to admit final pensioners, very prominent men, some of them, into St. <Col N="1403" /> Bricin's Hospital for free hospitalisation. I have refused those requests because I felt that, if we gave it to one, we would have to extend it to all disability pensioners and eventually to the special allowance people also and the permanent Forces disability pensioners. We would be providing hospital accommodation over and above what is needed in the country. It is much better that the ordinary health services should be availed of as far as possible, irrespective of whether the patients are ex-1916, ex1920, ex-1922 or ex-1923, or men belonging to the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>It is true that you can have hospitalisation in St. Bricin's if the disability pension was not pronounced final by the Army Pensions Board. That applies to a small number of people and the fact that such people are called up from time to time for further medical treatment, the idea being to reduce the degree of disability, has given rise to a good deal of comment. So far as I am concerned, I want to assure the House that anybody who is called to St. Bricin's Hospital is called because he has a disability pension that has not been pronounced final by the Army Pensions Board. The Board is the authority in this matter, and not the Minister. If a man with a disability pension produced a certificate showing that disability has increased to a considerable degree, he can seek a review of his case. I want to be perfectly open in this. In no circumstances could I make a recommendation to the Government or to the Department of Finance that we should undertake the treatment in our military hospitals of persons other than those already covered.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the Naval Service as it is at present. I do not think it would be of any appreciable value to us in any emergency. Like the barracks, I inherited the three corvettes. Certainly the corvettes can stand up to rough seas, whatever else may be said about them. Light boats would not do around the west coast. There one needs a ship which will stand up to the hazardous seas.</P>

At the moment I do not think that we could afford it. We have been inquiring into the availability of vessels over the past 12 months and it is not true to say we can get vessels of any description quite easily in order to augment those we have.</P>

It is being examined in the Department. I am unable to say at this stage when the examination will be complete.</P>
      <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell raised a question about a chapel in Letterkenny, in Rockhill House. This was one of a number of churches and oratories provided during and shortly after the Second World War. It was a concrete hut measuring 100 × 30 feet and it was built by contract. What happened was that the roof was damaged during a storm in 1962. The cost of repairing it was estimated at £1,500. The post at the time was not occupied, with the exception of a married officer's quarters, so it was considered that the expenditure could not be justified.</P>

      <Col N="1407" /> Deputy Seán Collins raised a question in relation to civil defence. He made the point that the control of civil defence would be taken over by the military personnel in an emergency. That is not my view. It should not be so and I do not think that it will be so. Civil defence is an organisation based on local authorities and the local authority control will be exercised by a local controller who would be the County or City Manager. The overall controller would be whoever is Minister for Defence at the time. I think the idea of the military coming in and taking over control of civil defence in such an eventuality should not be encouraged at all. The military authorities have their own functions and their own work to do. In any eventuality they would certainly have enough to do to look after their own responsibilities. This is a matter that requires a good deal of public support. People should be made aware of the importance of civil defence and that it is an effort of the civilian population to preserve themselves.</P>
    <P>A number of other contentious matters have been raised. Deputy P. O'Donnell raised the question of participation by the Army in the commemoration of the late General Michael Collins in Béal-na-Bláth. I am a person who has no animosity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I only want to preface what I am going to say. I did not carry any animosity with me out of the Civil War. I just want to say that many of the people, personal friends of mine, even immediately after the Civil War was over, were men who were actively on the other side. When I speak of the participation by the Army in this commemoration at Béal-na-Bláth, I find it difficult to talk about it without a certain amount of emotion. We were in the Civil War and, as far as many of us were concerned, we did not look for, ask for or accept any quarter. Many of the people who were very actively engaged in it were the best of friends afterwards. <Col N="1408" /> They were the people who did not carry with them through life any of the deep feelings which expressed themselves during that tragic period. I have given a lot of thought to this matter; I have examined it as fully as I possibly could; and I am firmly convinced we should have one commemoration only for all these men who served our country, as these men did. I was very young at the time. Maybe I was of a very impressionable age and I regarded all those people as the greatest men of our race&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He is alleging that civil servants are specifically assigned to send out letters to Members of the Oireachtas, in advance of letters sent out to himself or other Deputies, as the case may be. I have no method of knowing, when a Deputy or anybody else writes to me, and I would say that the same applies to the Department, whether the applicant for the grant, let it be a pension, a special allowance or any other grant, has asked a Deputy to make the representation at all. I have found over the years as a Member of this House that Deputies, when they are asked at meetings at which they attend, or by neighbours of the people concerned, make their representations. They do not specify that that is the case and it is an impossibility for a Department or a Minister to know whether the individual has asked that the case be dealt with. As far as I am concerned, letters coming to me personally, whether they come from Deputies or other people&mdash;and other people write, too, in connection with individual cases&mdash;I answer myself and, if the Deputy belongs to the Opposition, my Private Secretary sends him the letter.</P>
      <P>I do not know what happened in Deputy Fitzpatrick's case but I reply as Minister&mdash;and the same applied when I was in the previous Ministry. The file is on my desk; I sign the letter and the letter goes out. It could be several days before anybody else who is writing into the Department, or to some official in the Department, gets a reply, until the file goes out of my office to the branch concerned.

      <P>With regard to the question Deputy Coughlan put to me about medical treatment of soldiers, I answered a question by Deputy L. Belton some time ago&mdash;a question similar to the question Deputy Coughlan has put to me&mdash;and if I repeat the reply which I gave to that question, I think it will answer Deputy Coughlan, that is, if I understood him fully in the case he was making. The reply I gave Deputy Belton on 15th March, 1967 was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has not been any change in recent years with regard to the provision of medical treatment for the families of serving NCOs and men. The Department of Defence does not accept liability for the cost of domiciliary treatment, except at Fort Dunree and in the Curragh <Col N="1411" /> Training Camp area, where such treatment is provided by Army medical officers.</P>
    <P>As regards hospital treatment the position is that prior to the coming into operation of the Health Act, 1953, dependants were afforded hospital treatment in public wards in approved voluntary and local authority hospitals at the expense of the Vote for Defence. In the Curragh Camp area, as a special case, the treatment was provided in the Families Section of the General Military Hospital there.</P>
    <P>With the coming into operation of the Health Act, 1953, local health authorities became liable for the provision of medical, institutional, and specialist services for soldiers' dependants to the same extent as they are liable for the provision of such services for other members of the community in the corresponding categories as to social insurance and income. In that connection, I should mention that NCOs and men are insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, as amended. Where the dependant receives the treatment in a public ward of a local authority hospital, or in a public ward of a hospital approved by the local health authority for the treatment of their patients, my Department defrays the charges made by the health authority. My Department also defrays the charges for specialist services provided by a health authority under section 15 (4) of the Health Act, as amended.</P>

A special allowance is dealt with in anything from six weeks to three months. I checked recently and found that only 50 cases out of a total of 450 special <Col N="1412" /> allowance cases were held up for more than two months and they were cases of special difficulty. None of them was more than six months old.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy spoke of the inadequate provision for maintenance of barracks and mentioned the figure of £190,000 under Subhead S. That figure is for materials only, the provision for labour being in Subhead F.</P>
      <P>Again in relation to special allowances, Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned old age pensions. They are substantially ignored in the assessment of means. There is a softening out in relation to means assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Today I asked in Question No. 19 on the Order Paper, addressed to the Minister for Local Government, about the delay in the payment of grants towards group schemes at Clonturk, Dromard, Rooskey, and Rooskeynamona. The Minister's reply was that there has been no delay in the payment of grants approved for the schemes at Clonturk, Dromard and Rooskey and he said the inquiries now being made as to whether farmers to whom grants are due for payment have paid their rates have delayed the payment of grants in the case of the Rooskeynamona scheme. I referred to that reply at the time as being balderdash. My reason was that the promoter of this scheme, a man by the name of Dobson, was being pressed by the suppliers of a motor pump and on 3rd March last disclosed in a letter to the suppliers of the pump:</P>
      <P>In answer to your letter, I have written to Local Government several times stating that when the scheme was complete the houses were passed last May but the water was tested four times before it was passed. That is six months ago...</P>
      <P>That means this scheme was passed in October last year but the grants have not been paid. The letter goes on to say that the Government are holding up the grant and the last word Dobson got from the county council was that when the Local Government Department grant was paid, they would be in a position to pay their portion.</P>
      <P>The letter continued:</P>
      <P>We have not any money in the bank and the cutting of the road is not fully paid for. I am doing all I can to get the Government grant and hope it will be paid soon. I am writing this on my own and I am calling a meeting. Quinn Bros. are pressing very hard for their money. I feel very much about the whole scheme as I thought Local Government would pay it when it was finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>do not think it fair for the Minister to <Col N="1414" /> come in here after such a long period and tell us the grant is being held up to see if the farmers have paid their rates. I wish to add a little to that story.</P>
    <P>Two or three months ago when the rate collector came to the area, he made it his business to tell all ratepayers that they would not get the grants unless they paid their rates. I have nothing here to prove that the rates are paid, but in my honest opinion, they have been paid. Certainly the Minister could find out very easily. A limited number of people are involved and a simple telephone call to Leitrim County Council would settle the matter. I do not think it fair to hold up these grants.</P>
    <P>I have here another letter from Dobson, to me on this occasion:</P>
    <P>Thank you for your letter received today. So far I have nothing yet from the Local Government or the county council and have not received any grant. B. Fair was here and he said he would take out the pumps and motors if we did not pay. He fixed in three pumps in the area and is not paid for them.</P>
    <P>It is desperate if these people are being threatened by suppliers that the pumps will be taken out. The Minister and his Department should make some effort to give these grants because in the long run it is the builders' providers and the suppliers of the pumps who will be victimised. Those people have carried this Department for a fair period with a delay in grant. Mind you, it would be a desperate situation if builders' providers or contractors refused to give long-term credit to people who are putting in group water schemes. Again, if the Minister and the Government are sincere&mdash;even today they were not in their kind of stop-go Budget&mdash;in giving the co-operation to the farming community which they should give them, they certainly should make some effort to pay these grants.</P>
    <P>I might mention this as well. Particularly this year there are a number of farmers who have not paid their rates. This is not because they are members of the NFA and not because there is a rates campaign on but because they cannot sell their cattle and <Col N="1415" /> they have not the wherewithal to pay rates. Those people are being further victimised now by the Minister's Department. If the Minister made any effort, these grants would be paid. It is an admitted fact that payment of grants generally by the Department of Local Government in the past has been slow. Today we heard from the Minister for Finance that he had a surplus of £1 million. If that is the situation, I am surprised it is not much more than £1 million. Both the Minister and his Government would be very well advised to clear off these grants to which people are fully entitled. They have been waiting for payment over a period of six months.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am very glad that Deputy Reynolds raised this particular point on the Adjournment because it is a matter that has given considerable concern to a lot of applicants for grants. It has become fashionable here for some time to explain a delay in paying grants by saying that it has been necessary to find out whether the applicants have paid their rates or not. I want to say that, in my opinion, that excuse originated in a casual prompt from the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to the Minister for Local Government here some time ago when the latter was answering a question on these grants and when he was stuck for an answer. I do not accept at all that the delay in paying those grants is due to the fact that any inquiry as to the payment of rates is necessary.</P>

In fact, this grant has been delayed for several months.

      <P>This question relates to four group water schemes in County Leitrim. The first one, Clonturk, comprises 20 houses. Grants for 17 of those were paid as long ago as 6th September, 1966; that is, 85 per cent have been paid. In the case of this scheme, at the request of the county council, the diameter of the watermain was increased from two to three inches. The county council agreed to meet the increased cost, which was initially estimated at £400. This matter is at present being examined. At a recent inspection full details of the costs of the scheme were not available for the inspector to enable him to sanction the scheme. I do not think there is any evidence in this case of undue delay.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Dromard scheme, there are four houses and grants in respect of three of them have been paid since 20th July, 1966. The work on the scheme has now been completed and the fourth grant has not been paid yet. In this case there is the necessity to investigate the question of the payment of rates. In that case 75 per cent of the grants have been paid.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Rooskey scheme, there are ten houses, as well as one or two new houses. Six grants were paid on 14th July, 1966 and three more on 22nd October, 1966, so that one grant remains to be paid. Therefore, 90 per cent of all grants in this case have already been paid, so the allegation in respect of those three schemes that there is any hold-up is completely unsupported.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Rooskeynamona scheme, there are 14 houses. Of those, one may not be entitled to a grant. It is not definite yet whether the grant to this householder will be paid, as it is not definite whether he had previously obtained a grant for a domestic water supply. In this case five grants will be paid next week and eight are held up because of these inquiries which now have to be made with regard to the payment of rates and which, as I said before, inevitably result in delays in making payments in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out that I have <Col N="1418" /> the responsibility of ensuring that the vital services provided by the local authorities continue to be available to the community. At present there is an organised campaign to deprive the community of these services by depriving local authorities of the necessary finance. In addition then to the routine work connected with the administration of the various grant schemes by my Department, the Department has now the extra work of keeping itself informed of the results of this illegal campaign against the people. As I explained, that inevitably has the effect of delaying grants in certain cases.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that Deputies on the opposite side of the House have apparently allied themselves with this anti-social campaign and have been pressing me to make every effort to ensure that there will be no delay in disbursing the people's money in the form of subsidies to these people who are trying to deprive them of these essential services.</P>
    <P>If there is any hardship involved, the fault clearly lies with the organisation which is conducting this illegal campaign and which is being supported by Deputies on the opposite side of the House.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state for the latest year for which figures are available (i) the total cost of payment, including expenses, of rate collectors throughout the country; (ii) the cost in each county; (iii) the actual amount included in the rate in respect of such payments; (iv) the number of rate collectors employed by each rate authority and their rates of remuneration; (v) the cost to each authority of superannuation for rate collectors and the numbers in receipt of superannuation; and (vi) the combined cost to each rate authority of the payment, including expenses, and superannuation of collectors.</P>

      <P>The information requested is not available in my Department in the form in which the Deputy has asked for it.</P>
      <P>As regards parts (i), (ii) and (vi) of the question, the following statement shows the cost of rate collection for each county council and county borough for the year 1964-65, the latest year for which figures have been compiled. The figures include amounts in respect of such items as cost of rate applotment, stationery and other incidental expenses as well as rate collectors' salaries and expenses, but do not include superannuation payments. A breakdown of the figures under the various headings is however not available.</P>
      <P>The information requested at part (iii) of the question is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>In regard to part (iv) of the question the statement shows the number of rate collectors employed by each of the local authorities concerned. There is no standard rate of remuneration for all rate collectors. Collectors are paid by way of salary or poundage or a combination of both, and the rate of remuneration in each case depends on such factors as the size of warrant, size of district, number of ratings, etc.</P>
      <P>As regards part (v) of the question, details of superannuation payments made by each county council and county borough corporation to its retired officers in 1964-65 and the number of payees, are set out in the statement. Separate figures for retired rate collectors are not available.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
