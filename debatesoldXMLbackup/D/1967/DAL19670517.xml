      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht (Mr. Faulkner) (for the Minister for Lands)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked into this matter as promised and find that the position as regards annual leave arrangements of forestry workers is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Under the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1961 these workers are entitled to two full calendar weeks' leave but with the qualification permitting other odd days to be granted in accordance with custom in the employment, such additional days being deducted from the main annual leave period.  This, in effect, means that forestry workers who enjoy four such additional odd days have their annual leave allowance reduced from 14 days to ten days, the reduction being of four working days. On a five-day week basis a fourteen day annual leave period would include ten working days.  A ten-day leave period correspondingly includes six working days&mdash;two Saturdays and two Sundays being included in each case.</P>

      <P>The former solid timber entrance gates were 10' 0&rdquo; wide by 12' 0&rdquo; high with an overhead archway of brick and stone.  Some years ago the Hospital authorities represented that the entrance was inadequate for the admission of vehicles bringing supplies to the Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1962 the need arose for the renewal of the heating plant and it was decided, in the national interest, that the new plant should be a turf burning type.  The entrance gates had to be replaced, not alone to permit the entrance of the new boilers and all <Col N="1040" /> vehicles, including turf lorries, but also to meet a request from the Department of Health for the provision of gates of a modern type &ldquo;from the progressive psychiatrical point of view.&rdquo;</P>

The Commissioner is satisfied that, as a temporary arrangement, the area can be policed satisfactorily from Waterville.

      <P>I am aware that in certain schools&mdash;it is not, I am glad to say widespread&mdash;examinations are taking place.  In that connection, I should like to say that the rules and programme for secondary schools did prescribe an entrance test each year up to the school year 1966-67.  The purpose of the test was to establish that the pupil was sufficiently advanced to enable him to <Col N="1044" /> follow, with reasonable success, a course of secondary education.  Then, in December last, all schools were notified that this requirement was being abolished; indeed such a requirement never existed for vocational education.</P>

      <P>I was speaking last night on postal deliveries.  I now want to speak about the placing or erection of letterboxes in the country areas. There are townlands and villages six to eight miles from a post office.  The Parliamentary Secretary, if he is the man responsible, should carry out a survey so as to facilitate the people who live in the country districts so that they can post a letter before the postman comes on his rounds and he can collect it on his return journey to the post office.  It is wrong in this day and age to ask people who have letters to post to travel five or seven miles on their bicycles to the local post office or to where a post box is erected.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;whichever is replying&mdash;would be able to tell me what areas in the Connemara district he intends to motorise.  Can he pick out one area he has motorised and tell us what it costs per day, per week, per month and per year?  Could he also tell us the cost of the van?  Could he compare these costs with the cost of delivery by a man on a bicycle?  Which is the more economical?  I should like to have his comments on that.</P>

      <P>It was with regret that I learned of the Minister's intention to increase the licence fee and the advertising fees on Radio Telefís Éireann, due mainly to losses on sound radio.  Everyone in the House will agree that we should continue to have sound radio.  There are many people, particularly poor people, who are not in a position to provide themselves with a television set, either by purchase or <Col N="1052" /> rental.  There are also blind people who would be deprived of all the information relating to news of world events if we had not sound radio.</P>
      <P>I agree it is essential that the money must be provided, but it is the duty of the State rather than the individual licence holders to offset these losses. This should have appeared as an item in the Budget provisions.  It should have been in the Minister's Estimate, and should have been budgeted for.  This is the second time we have had an increase in the charges under the control of this Department following a Budget. It is becoming a habit.  The people cannot be sure from year to year as to what is expected from them by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>As I say, I agree it is essential to keep the sound radio service going not only for people who have no television sets and blind people, but also for certain of our emigrants in England in order that they can secure the information and news relating to Ireland which they very much appreciate.</P>
      <P>The Minister takes pride in the daily postal delivery in all parts of the country.  I agree it is a source of pride and we can be very proud of the people who carry out those deliveries. Does the Minister's pride reflect on the conditions of service of auxiliary postmen?  The auxiliary postman has a limited number of hours of employment each day.  These hours prevent him from taking employment elsewhere. It is quite true that he is not forced to work for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  He does so of his own choice because no other work is available, or no suitable work available to him.  Nevertheless he has to depend on the amount of money he receives at the end of each week.  He is prevented from signing on at the labour exchange.  He may get other part-time employment in his village if he is lucky.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After working for 40, 45 or 50 years, what does he receive?  He receives a signed certificate from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs testifying to his honesty, his loyalty, and his hard work, but he receives no money and no pension.  I suggest to the Minister that <Col N="1053" /> if he feels this pride in the daily postal and parcel deliveries in the most remote districts and in all sorts of conditions&mdash;we remember the snow all over the country a few years ago when the post was delivered by these auxiliary postmen&mdash;it should be shown in a more tangible way than giving a certificate at the end of his employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to be satisfied with the installation of additional telephones. I agree that there has been an improvement, but a considerable amount more needs to be done.  I know old people living alone in my area, sometimes in fairly isolated areas, who have been refused connection over a period of a year or a year and a half. Some special effort should be made in such cases where people need to be in communication with their neighbours because they are old and have no means of communication except by telephone.  This also affects employment. People such as undertakers and insurance agents find a telephone absolutely necessary in their employment. In many cases they have been put off for a considerable length of time and told to take their place in the queue.</P>
    <P>I have a complaint about the engineering branch of the Department. When an urban district council or a local authority recommend to the Department the need for an additional kiosk in a town, the Department's engineers visit the area and having agreed that there is a need for a kiosk, they insist on selecting the place for it.  In my town of Dungarvan there are two glaring examples.  In Abbey-side the recommendation of the local authority was that the kiosk be placed on the footpath or adjacent to it, immediately in front of the then sub-post office.  However, the Department engineer insisted on taking that kiosk to the corner of the most dangerous crossing in the entire urban area where fast moving traffic sweeps around the corner.  Tourists from Rosslare on the way to Cork or Killarney see the telephone kiosk, pull up and create an immediate traffic hazard because other traffic coming around the corner must <Col N="1054" /> pull out into the middle of the road, causing a danger to life and limb every couple of minutes throughout the tourist season.</P>
    <P>That mistake was not bad enough. We in the council recommended the provision of a kiosk at the other end of the town.  Again, at the most dangerous corner on the Dungarvan to Cork road, the kiosk has been placed on the footpath.  Surely intelligent people should realise that members of local authorities have lived all their lives in the town and have the interest and the safety of their people at heart.  If necessary, the Department officials should hold consultations with such local authority members.  If that were done, we would not have people from outside the town coming in and making decisions and carrying out the work before any local person realises what is happening.</P>
    <P>There was a third instance.  The Department agreed on the need for an additional kiosk in the town.  There was one at the square outside the GPO in Dungarvan and the urban district council recommended that the additional kiosk be placed at the other end of town.  However, despite this recommendation, the engineers placed the new kiosk not more than 100 yards from the other one.  This kind of action is not designed to make the best use possible of the money available.  It is not in the best interest of either the Department or the people who have to use the public telephone.  The first two instances I have given are a source of danger to life and I suggest to the Minister that he have his inspectors examine the situation.  I will be more than willing, at any time of day or night, to spend a half hour with them after which I am sure they will realise I have not been speaking for the sake of criticising the Minister and the Department but in a serious endeavour to prevent dreadful accidents which need not happen.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister on the need to take steps to ensure that all people who have radio and television sets hold licences.  This is purely my personal view: I do not want to commit my Party to it because we have not even <Col N="1055" /> discussed it.  Unless there is some obligation on radio dealers to disclose to the Department the names of people who have purchased radio or television sets or component parts thereof, we shall never be able to enforce the licence regulations, particularly in relation to sound radio and to television sets in a city near the transmitting station.  The old story of the detecting van being able to pick up radio signals and thus detect offenders has worn a bit thin.  I have a special knowledge, having been trained in wireless telegraphy a long time ago.</P>
    <P>One of the Post Office inspectors called to my house and told me a van had picked up my aerial.  I knew he was chancing his arm because there is no such mechanism possible.  It might be possible if one had direction finders and all the rest, but most people in Ireland are by now well aware, with the advent particularly of transistor sets, that there are tens of thousands of people who are not licensed.  It is up to us to use whatever means are most efficient to see that those of us who realise our obligations and pay our licences are not paying for the amusement and the entertainment of those who do not.</P>
    <P>I agree also with the Minister on the need to introduce legislation to prevent pirate broadcasting.  If we are a party to an international agreement, we have an obligation to live up to that agreement. Those commercial pirates&mdash;they are nothing less&mdash;are not responsible to anyone; they rake in the revenue and supply a very doubtful type of entertainment.  The Minister is on the right lines in his proposal to introduce legislation to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>On the question of television programmes, I am a constant viewer of television when I have the opportunity of being at home, away from my Parliamentary duties here.  I do not wish to condemn the programmes <i>in toto.</i> Some are good; some are bad.  It is difficult to choose.  Our television authority must cater for all the people of the country and what might be entertainment for me might be punishment for others and <i>vice versa.</i> The <Col N="1056" /> programmes in general offer a variety of entertainment to the people who get good value for money.</P>
    <P>However, I find there is a considerable waste of viewing time by the repetition of announcements nine or ten times in a night.  They tell us that such and such a programme will be screened the following night or the following Sunday night.  Without using a stopwatch, I should say that during an ordinary evening from 5 p.m. until 11 p.m. at least a half an hour of television time is wasted by these repeated announcements.  They are unnecessary and must be done at some cost to the station.  I should much prefer to see honest to goodness advertisements, from which the station might benefit, substituted for these announcements.</P>
    <P>I read in the morning newspapers that my colleague, Deputy Tully, expressed the view that he did not find any bias towards any political Party.  I do not agree.  I do not intend to name individual programmes or to attempt to identify individual announcers but on certain question and answer interviews, I have found that a certain interviewer when he anticipated a danger of some anti-Government statement being made quickly interrupted and started off on a new topic.  Also, when certain announcers speak of a strike, they start off with the heading &ldquo;labour troubles&rdquo; but when a settlement is announced, they refer to union settlements and the word &ldquo;labour&rdquo; does not come into it.  Certainly many trade unionists are labourers but I do not agree with the description used by certain television announcers.  If they do refer to labour troubles, they should also refer to labour settlements.  I have come to the conclusion that these little announcements are deliberately intended. I am not suggesting that they are being done at the direction of the Minister or the Government but perhaps because of the political views or a political bias on the part of the person responsible.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the claim of Ministers to the right to interfere with certain programmes.  I am not interested in whether or not a camera team was permitted to go to North <Col N="1057" /> Vietnam.  Personally, I think they could spotlight sufficient suffering with their cameras and get plenty of subjects worthy to be interviewed in the parts of rural Ireland where there is unemployment and poverty at the moment without going to North Vietnam either to damage the American cause or <i>vice versa.</i> I do not think the money spent on the endeavour would be justified, even though they might be able to sell the programme to other places afterwards and recoup the cost. There is plenty to be spotlighted at home and there are plenty of problems to be solved.</P>
    <P>However, I object to the principle, even if Telefís Éireann did decide to send a camera team to North Vietnam, that Ministers should have the right to tell them where to get off.  If RTE are to be brought under the control of the Minister, let us have it that way and let the Minister be responsible in this House when we want to query certain things happening.  At present, if a Parliamentary Question is put down and if the Ceann Comhairle passes it, the Minister will tell us he has no function in the matter.  Probably the Ceann Comhairle will direct attention to the fact that the Minister claims he has no function.  If they have no function, then they should not exercise such function in relation to RTE as they have openly admitted doing. They can either have it one way or the other.  In my opinion RTE should be under the control of the Government. It is a State organisation.  I know that part of its revenue comes from advertising, but the advertisers are concerned only to sell their wares.  RTE is the voice of Ireland and the Government and the people of Ireland should have some say in how that voice expresses itself, both in picture and sound.</P>
    <P>It is time that a postman had the right to take part in politics.  Certain employees of the Post Office&mdash;certainly the postman grade, the supervisor grade and indeed post office clerks&mdash; up to a high level in the Civil Service should have the right, both in local and parliamentary elections, to seek representation for whatever political <Col N="1058" /> beliefs they hold, and indeed go on platforms and advocate those beliefs. I know that in the past policemen, soldiers and convicts were excluded, while postmen were always permitted to vote.  But now that we have given the vote to policemen, soldiers and almost to lunatics, because people in mental hospitals were allowed out to vote, the Minister, without favouring any political Party, would be doing a service to the people if he permitted some sections of his Department to take part in political activity.  Politics is not such a dirty thing.  If it is, then we are all unusual people to be so deeply engaged in it.  The Minister should not only encourage the employees of his Department to have political affiliations but also to take part in and assist at elections.</P>
    <P>I would especially appeal to the Minister to consider two things: first, pension rights for auxiliary postmen, or at least some kind of gratuity at the end of a long term of faithful service; and secondly, the accelerating as much as possible of the installation of telephones and the giving of priority to those, who by reason of certain facts such as illness or the need for a telephone in their employment, require installation urgently.</P>

      <P>Ós rud é nach bhfuil duine áirithe san <i>Irish Times</i> i ndan Béarla glan soiléir a thuiscint, sílim go mba chóir dom labhairt i dteanga eile ach siúd is gur i mBéarla a labhair mise agus an Teachta M. E. Dockrell aréir ar an gceist chéanna is i mBéarla a labhróidh mé anois.</P>
      <P>The anxiety of some people to prove that they were right in suggesting a disagreement which did not exist can, I suppose, naturally lead them into error; but when that anxiety oversteps what is fair and proper, I think it becomes incumbent on us to speak out quite clearly and to condemn the attempt of anybody to suggest that there has been disagreement where there is not a scintilla of evidence of any such disagreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night, in a praiseworthy speech, Deputy Dockrell, the Fine Gael shadow Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, <Col N="1059" /> very properly praised the staff of Telefís Éireann for the very fine job they do within the confines of the money available to them.  He made it quite clear, as far as we in the Fine Gael Party are concerned, that the skill, excellence and impartiality of the staff of Telefís Éireann are beyond reproach and deserving of the highest praise.  In saying as much, Deputy Dockrell said, more extensively perhaps, what I said at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis last week when I made it clear that, as far as the Fine Gael Party were concerned, the staff of Telefís Éireann were as competent as that of any station in any part of the world.  It was because we had the utmost respect for their professional ability and integrity that we considered it was very important that they should be free from any intimidation, direct or implied.</P>
    <P>How any person can for one moment infer that there is the least disagreement between Deputy Dockrell and me on this particular issue is beyond the imagination of any rational person.  It is quite clear, as I said last week at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis, that there is a distinct difference between the partisan appointees of the Fianna Fáil Government to the Authority, on the one hand and the staff of the station, on the other.  But we are keenly aware that this savage and irresponsible mischief making has been sown in the fertile soil of the Fianna Fáil benches and that once again public discussion has been bedevilled by something which has absolutely no basis in fact and which no person could reasonably infer from what was said.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Ard Fheis passed a motion which said that the Ard Fheis strongly protested against the continuous efforts of the Government to control the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority and to use it as an instrument of Fianna Fáil propaganda. It called for a sworn inquiry into the manner in which Radio Telefís Éireann <Col N="1060" /> has been functioning since the launching of the television service.</P>
      <P>In speaking to that resolution, the Oireachtas Party, on whose behalf I spoke, expressed the opinion that the staff of Radio Telefís Éireann was very competent but we also deplored the Government's efforts to control Telefís Éireann.  Those efforts have been admitted in this House.  They have been admitted elsewhere.  The former Taoiseach endeavoured to justify them on a number of occasions and latterly we have had further attempts to justify intervention by members of the Government who have no authority to do so on relatively unimportant matters affecting, as they think, their Departments. The statutory right to intervene is spelled out in the Radio Television Act and nowhere else is there any authority for any Minister to intervene with the staff of Telefís Éireann.  It is because they have time out of number done so that we condemn them and the Fine Gael Ard Fheis last week asserted that freedom cannot exist in this country if this particular medium is to be the plaything of any one political Party.</P>

      <P>We have no wish to see it become the mouthpiece of any political Party because the day that it becomes the mouthpiece of any political Party it becomes the tyrant of the Irish people and they become the slaves to biased opinion.  We have stated here on several occasions and we stated last week at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis and we state it here again that as long as the professional staff of Telefís Éireann maintain the high standards which they have displayed in the past they will get the complete support of this Party and of anybody in this country who respects the right of our people to have minds of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because we feel strongly on this matter that we have expressed our dissatisfaction with the personnel of the Authority.  We also declare that as a matter of policy we will, as soon as the opportunity presents itself to us, establish an Authority which can command <Col N="1061" /> the respect of all political Parties and of other groups in this community. The day that happens will be a good day for this country.</P>
    <P>There is no need to pretend, as some people would have us understand, that to assert these things indicates any criticism of those people whose professional careers are concerned with the provision of a satisfactory and impartial television and radio service. We believe that throughout the years the people have been well served by those who have conducted the radio service and latterly the radio and television service but it is deplorable that there has been a trend in recent times to interfere with the independence and integrity of these people and we would hope that the Government will be more cautious in future before they endeavour to colour the presentation of news and views on both radio and television.</P>
    <P>We have had several instances of the kind of improper intervention which we condemn.  It goes back a number of years.  There was a broadcast about radioactive fall-out and about civil defence.  The Minister for Defence, without any authority so to do, stormed into the GPO, I think it was one Saturday afternoon, and practically whisked away the recording apparatus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir, we shall deal with the year under review.  That does not reduce the number that much because the Government have been particularly active in the last year.  We had the Minister for External Affairs endeavouring to prevent the compilation of a programme about the most critical international situation at the present time and we have had further steps to prohibit any mention of the NFA on any agricultural programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> The NFA is not a proscribed organisation and there is no reason why the NFA should not be mentioned on any agricultural programme or any other programme on which the staff of Telefís Éireann think fit to mention it.</P>
    <P>We deplore the Government's intervention here to prohibit the mention of an organisation which is still a lawful organisation.  If the Government want to proscribe it, let them do it and let them justify that to the Irish people. We think that the organisation has done nothing which deserves proscription, although the Government have endeavoured by every possible means at their disposal to provoke it into doing things which would then perhaps justify them to their own supporters in proscribing it.  Such proscription has not taken place and the Government have no fair reason to prohibit the mention of the NFA on an agricultural programme.  The NFA is a substantial farming organisation which on several occasions in the past, as no doubt it will in future, has expressed views on various matters of agricultural policy and it is entitled to be quoted on agricultural programmes and other programmes whenever it expresses such views.</P>
    <P>The Radio Television Act clearly specifies that where there is intervention it should be in writing and it should be the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who makes it.  In no case are the staff obliged to listen to views unless the intervention is made in writing.  If such intervention in relation to the NFA has been made in writing then the writing should be produced but from the silence of the Government in this matter we appreciate that they realise that what they are trying to do is <i>ultra vires</i> and they are endeavouring to do it by backdoor methods.  That is why we in Fine Gael condemn the intimidation which is not only expressed but is implied in the daily actions of the Government.  If this situation is not cured soon the welfare of the Irish nation will be at stake because no party or group in this country has a monopoly of wisdom and it is only by a process of discussion and dialogue that we can arrive at the truth in our time. If there is an attempt to channel discussion <Col N="1063" /> along one particular course alone, there is no possibility of mingling the views and the thoughts of the Irish nation to arrive in our time at the right conclusions.</P>
    <P>The telephone service has been referred to by the Minister, Deputy Dockrell and others, and the Minister has taken some credit for a reduction in the size of the queue.  As Deputy Dockrell mentioned last night, the queue is still there, but there do not appear to be so many people waiting. It is interesting to reflect on one of the reasons why the size of the queue has dropped.  It is not because the people who were in the queue do not want phones but rather because of the penalty which is imposed upon them whenever the Department is ready to connect the phone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell spoke last night of a case which has come to his knowledge where an applicant was asked for a sum of £30 as a condition precedent to connecting the phone.  This was one of the many supplementary budgets which we had last year, where the Department of Posts and Telegraphs imposed this outrageous capital tax, as it were, upon people who sought to install a phone, and the consequence of imposing £10, £20 and £30 charges on people, part of which admittedly is in respect of future phone calls, has been substantially to reduce the number of people who want telephones.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question which I tabled on 26th October last we were told that in April of last year, 87 people had refused a telephone service.  The following month the number rose to 115, and in June, to 122.  Thus we can see immediately the effect of the Government's penal imposition of a connection charge.  In July 231 refused a connection, in August, 162; the number is down somewhat in that month because of holidays.  In September, the number rose again to 227.  In a six-month period practically 1,000 people refused telephone connections because of the high outlay that they were required to incur as a condition precedent to getting a connection at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> Not only is this device being used by the Government and by the Minister to discourage people from making demands upon the telephone service, but there is a further discouragement &mdash;several people have had the experience&mdash;that when they put down their deposit there is no certainty that a connection will follow soon afterwards, and many people have had to wait several months, up to as long as six months after making the deposit, before receiving any service.  That kind of service is simply not good enough from anybody, and particularly from a State-owned monopoly.</P>
    <P>Another serious defect in the telephone service, in this city certainly, is the frequency of the crossing of lines. Any person who uses the telephone frequently will experience innumerable cases of lines crossing and of being involved in the conversations of other people.  It ought to be an instrument that people can approach with confidence. It ought to be an instrument on which people can have confidential discussions, but the frequency with which lines cross in this city makes the use of a telephone an extremely dangerous and hazardous mode of communication between people on confidential matters.  This is something into which the Department will have to look and they will have to remedy the situation; otherwise the telephone as an instrument of efficiency becomes non-existent, and to business people it becomes a dangerous mode of conducting business negotiations.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is not unknown for people here in Leinster House to take up the phone and to find themselves listening to conversations of politicians not of their own Party.  This might come very close to the bone, and that is why I say it.  I am just asking the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to look very carefully into this, because were some of the conversations to be repeated some people might have very red faces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely generous on my part to do this, because were it <Col N="1065" /> not for the fact that I have such a personal high standard of integrity and no wish to listen to these conversations, I would not say these things.  The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary may have no great anxiety to facilitate people in private business, but when their own futures are at stake they may perhaps become a little more aware of the need to ensure that the telephone is an entirely confidential means of communication between people.</P>
      <P>I have raised on several occasions in this House the question of stamp-vending machines for the sale of books of stamps.  I think we can go back seven or eight years to find this matter was being examined by the high and mighty experts available to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs so that a machine could be designed which would give satisfactory service in peculiarly Irish conditions, which was supposed to make allowance for the damp weather conditions which we experience here compared with drier climates elsewhere. When these stamp-vending machines were in operation for several years in the six northern counties, it was difficult to see why we had to design new machines but, in any event, last year we looked forward with great anticipation to the installation of the first of these machines.  Towards the latter half of last year they were installed in three post offices in this city, at the GPO, South Anne Street and Rathmines.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of installing these machines was to provide the people with the service for the purchase of postage stamps after post offices closed, but lo and behold, as far as Rathmines was concerned, the stamp machine was put inside the door so that it could not be used by the public when the post office was shut.  I have attended at Rathmines post office on, I would say, ten or 12 occasions since the machine was installed and I have never found the machine in working order.  Never over the last six months or more since the machine was installed was it in working order when I attended there to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have complained on several occasions in this House about the <Col N="1066" /> inordinate delays which people are obliged to endure at Rathmines post office where there is a substantial counter with four or five different hatches, but it is a very rare thing for any more than a few of them to be working.  People are, therefore, obliged to join the one queue for a multitude of post office services, for the purchase of stamps, for telegrams, savings bank and the other services which are conducted by the Post Office on behalf of other Departments, social welfare payments, dog licences and the like.  I am informed that on a recent Saturday people had to wait 25 to 30 minutes at Rathmines post office in order to get service because only one counter was in operation.  That is not an adequate post office service.  I would not raise this in such detail on this Estimate had the Minister and his Department heeded the several appeals I have conveyed to them in the past in relation to this post office but, because those appeals have obviously fallen on deaf ears, I have to make this public protest and complain in detail about the very bad service provided in the Rathmines post office.  I do not know the cause but, whatever it is.  I am sure it is not incurable and I hope that whatever steps are necessary to provide an adequate postal service in an important area like Rathmines will be taken without any further delay.</P>
    <P>May I also appeal to the Minister, his Parliamentary Secretary and the Department to ensure that the stamp-vending machines in Rathmines are always operative?  If they are not functioning because there are no stamps in them then, for pity's sake, let stamps be put into them regularly to ensure that they do not run out of supplies. May I also appeal to the Minister to put the machines for the sale of books of stamps outside the post office so that people can purchase the books after hours and not have them put under the obligation of looking for dozens of pennies in order to post a few letters after hours.  The machines which are outside are inadequate.  They were put there some 35 years ago.  They are not adequate now to cater for the higher cost of postage today.  Apart from that, the machines have proved <Col N="1067" /> defective over the years, something of which the Department is, I believe, aware.</P>
    <P>On another Estimate I and others urged that the payment of social welfare benefits through post offices should be discontinued, because we feel the post office is not the best means available for the payment of social welfare benefits.  The Minister performs this service for another Department and I would strongly urge him to persuade the Department of Social Welfare to discontinue the practice of requiring payments to be made through the post office.  I doubt if this is one of the profitable sides of the post office business.  I suspect the Post Office earns no profit whatsoever in providing this service for another Department. So far as urban areas are concerned, there is no justification for obliging social welfare recipients to attend at a post office where they are unknown to the officials behind the counter for the purpose of having these social welfare payments made to them.</P>
    <P>One understands the theory behind the use of the post office, that the local postal officials will know the people named on the books.  That may be so in small village post offices where the local postmistress knows everything about everybody, and perhaps a great deal more besides, but in urban areas where there are anything from 1,000 to 1,500 people attending to receive social welfare payments the local officials could not possibly know the identity of these hundreds.  I hope the Minister for Social Welfare will change this practice.  I hope the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will succeed in persuading him to relieve his Department of this rather pointless burden so far as urban areas are concerned.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to learn recently from the Minister that, in relation to labouring employment in the Department, preference is not given to ex-Army men.  I think retired soldiers are deserving of priority in employment in State services.  It is the practice in all progressive countries the world over to give priority to ex-soldiers in State employment.  Soldiers are almost obliged by the regulations and by the <Col N="1068" /> demands of military service to retire from the army at a comparatively early age; because of that the State ought to ensure that suitable employment is available for them after retirement.  I would urge the Minister to ensure that preference is given to ex-Army men in his Department.</P>
    <P>Last March I was informed by the Minister that, even when the Department comes to consider making permanent appointments, they do not give preference to ex-Army men.  That is utterly and completely indefensible. Because of their training and the discipline imposed on them in the Army, ex-soldiers are probably amongst the best available for employment in the Department.  One can understand there might be certain instances in which individual unsuitable applicants might have to be passed over, but the general rule should be that ex-Army men would get priority.</P>
    <P>It is not with any relish that I raise here the question of the disappearance of money in the post.  I do so because of the failure of the Department to prevent this.  I have brought to the notice of the Department a number of instances. I want to state categorically now that I believe the vast majority of postal officials are persons of the highest integrity.  I personally have every confidence in the postal service. I am glad to say I have never experienced any case of mail going astray and I think that is the invariable experience of people who use the postal service.  Indeed, I make a point of exhorting people to post letters.  I have little patience with people who complain that they have spent days on end trying to contact somebody by telephone for the purpose of conveying a message which could have been committed to paper and posted.  There is a much greater certainty in this modern age of a communication reaching its destination through the postal service than there is through any other means of communication.  There is also greater certainty of confidence because there is no certainty that a message conveyed by telephone is confidential; it can be overheard.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion to draw the attention of the Department to the fact <Col N="1069" /> that at least two charitable organisations in Dublin, which receive money through the post, have reason to believe that money posted to them did not arrive.  On some occasions when these complaints were conveyed by me to the Department, an improvement took place, but the extraordinary thing is that disimprovement appears to have set in again.  Again, I emphasise that I have absolute confidence in the integrity, honesty and efficiency of the overwhelming majority of those employed in the postal service and I have no wish to do any damage at all to the reputation of the staff of the Post Office because of the very occasional bad apple which may appear in the barrel, but I do condemn the failure of the Department to root out the bad apples and ensure they will not be there to damage the reputation of the postal service.</P>
    <P>Great care should be taken to ensure absolute security for money passing through the post.  This security should apply even where people put cash in the post.  I know we should discourage people from putting in cash and legal tender notes.  People are well advised to use postal orders and cheques rather than cash but so long as people are using the postal service and putting cash into it, the Department should take additional precautions to ensure that the contents of postal packets are absolutely secure.  If there is any reason whatsoever to believe that money is not arriving, no expense should be spared in endeavouring to trace the leak.  I am sure the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are in agreement with me on this.  I note they have the same view as we all have of the high integrity of the people in the Post Office.  It is in order to maintain that highly-deserved reputation that the Department should be, I believe, more keen than they are in rooting out the very rare cases in which the reputation of the Department is put in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, however, that perhaps the Department are themselves a little to blame for people putting cash in the post.  The extremely high poundage charged on postal orders is, I think, a discouragement. <Col N="1070" /> It is unfortunate that the Minister saw fit in recent years to increase the cost of postal orders by the amount by which he did increase it.  It would certainly improve the security of the postal service if our money were transmitted by duly endorsed postal orders. I would, therefore, ask the Minister to reflect on the wisdom of the charges he imposed and, if he thinks fit, perhaps to reduce them.</P>
    <P>There is another way in which the Department could assist in the transfer of money payments.  I understand that seven other countries have introduced the Giro system which is a kind of transfer credit system which allows money credit payments to pass from one person to another.  When we raised this matter last October, the Minister said that the possibilities of introducing the Giro system here were under consideration.  He said the indications were that the service would be expensive and complex and that, in view of the Department's other commitments, a decision to provide it soon is not likely.</P>
    <P>I think the Department of Posts and Telegraphs here have been guilty, throughout the years, of inordinate delay.  The huge queues of applicants for telephones arose through the delay on the part of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in planning ahead.  We should, at this stage, be planning ahead for the introduction of the Giro system.  It would work to the advantage of the Post Office because it would attract more money to it.  It may be that the Department feel it would attract too much money to it away from the private sector.  If that be one of the reasons for postponing the introduction of the Giro system here, I believe it is the wrong reason for delaying because if it will attract so much money from other quarters then that merely indicates the need for the introduction of such a system and the demand for such a system.  It establishes that even the Department are convinced that the system would widely be used.  It is certainly worth taking another look at the matter.  The Department, whatever their other commitments may be, should not put this on the long finger to such an extent <Col N="1071" /> that it will not be introduced at the time which would be most beneficial to our economy.  With depreciation in the value of money, with the need to send nominally greater sums through the post, the need for a Giro system multiplies and the sooner it is introduced the better.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy M. E. Dockrell in his comments on the Estimate and wish to re-emphasise that, whatever mischief-makers may wish to do, we would ask them to relate their remarks to facts and not to fancy.  One can understand that people whose livelihood depends on news may, in default of something more exciting, endeavour to manufacture news but news which is manufactured out of non-existent disagreement can sometimes boomerang. It would be preferable to study the large area of agreement between people rather than to endeavour, slightly or even mildly, to suggest that disagreement exists where in fact there is entire and absolute agreement.  I have no doubt that if people took the care to study the words spoken by Deputy M. E. Dockrell and myself, and other Deputies, they would find we are entirely <i>ad idem.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle, when the debate started, thought we were discussing the Department of Lands and when I came in here, I must say I thought the same thing, but I would assume that the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs would follow.  However, I have a few notes on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, although it was really on the Estimate for the Department of Lands that I thought I would have the opportunity of speaking. I am not fully briefed on this Estimate but I am not in thorough agreement with the last speaker about everything being so fair in Radio Telefís Éireann.  Of course, everybody speaks as he sees things for himself. This may be a personal grievance of my own and a grievance of Deputies from the west of Ireland in general.  As far as I can see, it is &ldquo;To Hell with the West&rdquo; all the time as far as Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann and all the <Col N="1072" /> rest of it are concerned.  I shall recount, for the information of the House, an example of what happened to me and I shall bring the House back in memory to Wednesday, 7th December, 1966, when Vote 8, Public Works and Buildings, was resumed&mdash;Volume 226, No. 2.  My speech on that Estimate ranged from columns 199 to 205.</P>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I happened to be down in South Kerry in a by-election campaign.  I was so interested in this particular Vote of the Office of Public Works that I came back to this House to make a little contribution for the people I represent in the west of Ireland who sent me here.  I sat here from morning until the Dáil rose that evening&mdash;the next day was a holiday&mdash;in order to be called.  I am not sure what time I got in but I think it was before 4 o'clock.  Anyhow, Question Time came in between.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy J. Gibbons, introduced the Estimate and Deputy Cosgrave led for Fine Gael and then Deputy Larkin spoke on behalf of Labour.  A &ldquo;quiet backbencher from the west of Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;myself&mdash;got in next.  Deputy Dillon then followed and the Parliamentary Secretary concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, my speech was not too long but I thought, myself, that it was long enough to be included in the radio programme &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;.  It ranged from columns 199 to 205 in the Official Report of Wednesday, 7th December, 1966.  I left here at 5 p.m. or 5.30 p.m. and reached my home at about 10 p.m. that evening where the usual number of constituents were in the kitchen.  Before I had my tea, someone said &ldquo;We will switch on `Today in the Dáil' &rdquo;.  I said &ldquo;As a matter of fact, maybe I will be mentioned because I made a speech on the Office of Public Works today&rdquo;. Lo and behold, we switched it on and the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Larkin, Deputy Dillon, and the Parliamentary Secretary who spoke after me, were all included in the programme but there was no mention at all of the &ldquo;quiet back-bencher from the West of Ireland&rdquo;, as John Healy once described me, and I was naturally a bit huffed.  I got my <Col N="1073" /> 3s 3d and put it into the telephone box and range the Director of Radio Telefís Éireann, Mr. McCourt.  I was told he was at a Caltex Award dinner, I think it was, in the Gresham.</P>
    <P>I was very nicely received by a very courteous lady who spoke so nicely to me that I lost my huffiness and made my protest in as gentlemanly a way as I could.  She took a note of it and it took a week for them to reply. On December 15th, 1966, I received the following letter from Radio Telefís Éireann, Donnybrook:</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. Kitt,</P>
    <P>Your telephone complaint of December 7 that the radio feature &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;, did not include reference to your speech in the Dáil that day, has been brought to my attention.</P>
    <P>You will appreciate, I am sure, that the need to compress long debates into a 15 minute programme forces us to omit many useful contributions to each day's discussion in the House.  I can assure you, however, that the question of what is included or omitted is determined solely by objective broadcasting needs.  There is no justification whatsoever for the suggestion that favouritism or bias influences the content of this programme.</P>
    <P>The letter was signed by Mr. G. A. Redmond, Chief Information Officer.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy and he should allow me to make my own speech in my own way. I came up to Dublin the following week and the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Gibbons, had not concluded his reply.  Deputy Ryan's former leader, Deputy Dillon&mdash;although he may not have been his leader as he is one of the younger Deputies&mdash;agreed with what I said as I will prove by quoting <Col N="1074" /> from the Official Report for Tuesday, 13th December, 1966, at column 253 of volume 226, No. 3.  The Parliamentary Secretary was concluding his speech.  Even though the <i>Irish Times</i> and the <i>Independent</i> and the <i>Irish Press</i> reported my speech and &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; did not, the local papers, the <i>Tuam Herald,</i> the <i>Connacht Tribune,</i> the <i>Western People</i> and so on, all of which we have to depend on, or otherwise the people would not know we were there, did.  Anyway Deputy Gibbons said:</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt, rather surprisingly, in view of the great storm that was created in certain localities, was the only rural Deputy, apart from Deputy Dillon, who represents a rural constituency, to mention the Special Employment Schemes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Mr. Kitt: Neither did any other Deputy who spoke about them&mdash;&mdash; I was talking about the west of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>He never does.  There are a few people who have &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; in their pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put that on the records of this House and I am doing so again.  I went down to the correspondent who deals with this programme and he challenged me and he resented the fact that I telephoned the Director of Radio Telefís Éireann.  I said: &ldquo;Well, about a week or a fortnight before that the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;now the Minister for Finance&mdash;rang Radio Telefís Éireann&rdquo;, <Col N="1075" /> and I have as much right as Deputy Dockrell, Deputy Ryan or anyone else to ring Telefís Éireann if I do not feel I am getting my rights, have I not?</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister to ensure that when people speak here one man should not have the right, because he has a certain resentment against certain Deputies and because he has his own favourites, to leave certain people out.  There should be a triumvirate to decide who should be put in and who left out.  Recently I spoke on the Budget and was it not very significant that the very same thing happened?  On the day I spoke everyone who spoke before me and two or three who spoke after me were mentioned.  I was the only one left out. I went back to this man, who was having his tea in the Dáil restaurant, and I said: &ldquo;Thank you for leaving me out once again&rdquo;, and he looked down his nose and resented it.  If that is the treatment we are to get in the west from Radio Telefís Éireann, I do not know why we are paying our licences.</P>
      <P>This programme is in the same category as some other programmes: people are getting fed up with it.  You have the same old team from both sides on it.  I do not know what method they have of getting on to it but I do know that I am putting a nail in my own coffin and that I have not got the right method of getting on to it.  They could change it and put the &ldquo;quiet backbenchers&rdquo; on now and again and not have the same old team on night after night.  I have got myself on it tonight despite them and I am going to make sure of that because they cannot leave me out after this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> This is the only way we can get things straightened out.  I am going to ask the Minister, and the Parliamentary Secretary who is in charge of Radio Telefís Éireann, to ensure that if 15 people speak in this House and if this man cannot put the 15 into the programme&mdash;the gallon into the pint &mdash;let him put ten in and for the bit of froth on the top, he could say that A, B, C and so on, also spoke.  All you would get anyway is a line and if you are to be misquoted, it is better that you are left out.  If my suggestion were adopted, people in my constituency would know that I was one of the A, B or Cs.  They would say: &ldquo;Deputy Kitt spoke and we will buy the <i>Roscommon Herald or Champion</i> or the <i>Midland Tribune,</i> the <i>Westmeath Independent,</i> the <i>Connacht Tribune,</i> the <i>Mayo News,</i> the <i>Western People</i> or the <i>Tuam Herald</i> to see what he said.&rdquo; All these publish what I say and the people would buy them to see what I said.  It would be better if they said &ldquo;The following also spoke&rdquo; and this is a good tip for the pressmen: when they cannot fit us all in, they should say that the following Deputies also spoke.  That is all I have to say about that.  I have got that off my chest and I am glad.</P>
    <P>I did not come in specifically to speak on Posts and Telegraphs but I am very glad I had these notes with me.  Having said so much, I want to compliment the Minister on expediting telephone installation because in the past few months many telephones have been installed in my area.  I also want to appeal for the sub-postmasters.  Both sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses are, in my opinion, insufficiently paid for the onerous duties they perform. Some of them have as many duties as higher civil servants.  They must deal with post office savings bank accounts, saving certificates, handle big sums of money, children's allowances, and old age pensions as well as licences of every description including radio and television licences which I have to pay and for which I get no value.  They have to do all this work and I make a special appeal that they be given remuneration that is in accordance with the duties they perform.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> Finally, I want to appeal for the auxiliary and temporary postmen, some of whom are out from seven o'clock or 7.30 in the mornings until midday or later, travelling on bicycles over long distances.  I understand the Department's policy is to replace them by motor transport.  I do not agree with that.  These men should be retained. Some of them live in cottages, some are very small farmers in the west of Ireland.  Also, I think they should get a pension when they come to 65.  Many of them have come to me to make their case.  In our county at least the road-workers are paying into a superannuation fund from the first day that scheme was introduced.  When they retire they get a pension.  The auxiliary postmen have told me that they are willing to do the same, pay into a fund for their pensions.  The Minister should look into that aspect of the matter and ensure that when these men, after long years of service to the State, bringing good news and bad, day in day out, must retire they will be entitled to a pension.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary every success in the coming year and I hope that my contribution, even though I did not come in to speak on Posts and Telegraphs&mdash; I thought I was going to speak on Lands&mdash;will be useful and that the Minister will look into the matter of reporting proceedings here and ensure that if they cannot put a gallon into a pint measure, they will at least say: &ldquo;The following also spoke&rdquo;, so that the people will at least know that we were here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>As has already been said, the expenditure in this Department is high.  The fact that it is £21 million this year indicates the increasing trend of costs all round.  I noted in the Minister's statement in introducing the vote that despite an increase of £75,000 in respect of broadcasting licence revenue, further money must be provided to the extent of, I think, £411,000.  This indicates the complexity of running a large Department.  Despite the fact that the work of the Department is very important, that it employs a large number of people and even allowing for the fact that there was an <Col N="1078" /> increase in pay for employees of the Department, although that increase was not very large and although those engaged in the service of the Department especially in the lower grades cannot be said to be overpaid, the trend is for costs to increase all round.</P>
      <P>Despite the large number of people employed by the Department and the increasing volume of mail handled, one must compliment the Department on the service rendered and compliment the workers for the way in which the services are carried out.  I am not fully aware whether or not the Department employs a public relations officer; I dare say the higher executives in the Department fulfil this function but, looking at the kind of work with which one is most familiar, one can say offhand that those employed in the field do their work well.  Those of us in this House who have some dealings with Department personnel know this.</P>
      <P>It is also noted in the Minister's statement that increased charges for telephone development are an element in this Estimate.  There are various points of view regarding the method used by the Department to provide telephone services.  There is a fairly long waiting period and it is also a well-known fact that an applicant has to put down a fairly stiff deposit.  One could argue that those items are inhibiting factors so far as the extension of the telephone system is concerned. I have often wondered why some such system as that operated by private concerns in America might not be devised whereby a phone could be provided on the &ldquo;never-never&rdquo; system and a lower deposit sought at the outset.  Again, possibly it could be argued that to do that the Minister would have to come to the House to seek the wherewithal to start that sort of a system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an argument on both sides. From my experience in the rural parts of the country, there is no doubt that this requirement of a heavy deposit plus the prospect of a long waiting period inhibits the spread of telephonic communication.  One could appeal to the Minister to look at this aspect of the matter and see if a more attractive <Col N="1079" /> system could be devised to meet the requirements of those who seek telephones.</P>
    <P>One can readily agree with the Minister's statement, because he has long experience in this matter, that it is very hard to improve on the methods already in use in the postal services.  I am not indeed condemning the postal services by any means nor am I finding fault with them.  I am merely commenting on the statement which the Minister made.  It is apparent from his statement that it is very hard to find an outlet for improving the system, principally, I suppose, because the Department can be deemed to be a labour intensive Department and every item has to be handled individually. There is also the question of amalgamating post offices and putting vans on the road.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is another side to this argument, too.  I think this falls to the politician.  I often heard abstract arguments put forward in favour of the economist.  We have also often heard the politician referred to as the know-all.  As between the economist and the politician, those who are experienced administrators will often come down on the side of the politician, for the simple reason that the politician has to take into consideration the social as well as the economic aspect of any matter.  When we speak on the subject of a labour intensive force, we must recognise that there is a human element involved and that it falls sometimes to the lot of the politician to be a public relations officer, if you like, on behalf of the personnel concerned and try to present their case.</P>
    <P>I recognise that in this area one is up against the terrible problem of trying to improve output or improve methods and at the same time ensure a reasonable human output.  None of us likes to see people coming on to the evening of their lives unemployed. When one comes to the question of costs, one has to take into account the capital investment required to provide the means in relation to replacing those whose services are dispensed <Col N="1080" /> with and the money involved so that if one takes the long view, one can see the difficulty.  I have not had time to read the whole of the Minister's statement, although I listened to him when he introduced the Vote, but I recognise the difficulty in this area.  All I can say is that I would come down on the side of the politician.  It is all right for the economist or the accountant.  He can sit down at his desk, do his sums on both sides of the ledger, balance his books and two and two will make four for him at any time.  It does not always make four in our world when we come to have regard to the human element.</P>
    <P>I was looking through Subhead D. I noticed that this subhead indicates the increased services by air mail, not merely to Britain but to the Continent also.  This brings home to all of us that in dispatching letters, parcels or other mail time is a factor and, of course, time is money.  It also clearly indicates the superiority of the air in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have been looking over Subhead E &mdash;Postal and General Stores.  Here, again, there is an increase because it has to do with the provision of clothing, vehicles and general stores.  One assumes that all this work is done by contract, but I would ask the Minister, if he has a moment when replying, to indicate what the life of a postal worker's uniform is and if he has had any volume of complaints regarding either the make of the uniforms or the quality of the material.</P>
    <P>Having gone through a few of the subheads, there are some further points I should like to make.  Those points, however, are not to be taken as criticism.  Last year I mentioned in the House the work of vandals.  Often times we press for the provision of telephone kiosks, public telephones or letterboxes as an extension of the Post Office service in a particular part of the country. It grieves me when I sometimes go to make a telephone call to see in a new kiosk&mdash;I suppose one could say recently erected, facia boards and all&mdash; that some lout inscribed his initials with, one only can conclude, a nail or something like that and afterwards other people did likewise, the writing being all over the kiosk.  That is where a public relations officer might come <Col N="1081" /> in useful.  Perhaps the desirability of preventing this kind of vandalism could be inculcated into children, at least in the senior groups in schools.  Not merely does this vandalism denote a low standard of civics but it is costing money.  Unless we are able to hammer into the heads of the younger people that they should respect the appointments, the service and the fixtures of the Department, we will get nowhere and this sort of vandalism will increase rather than decrease.</P>
    <P>In passing, I add my voice to the voices of other speakers who more or less, with the possible exception of Deputy Dockrell, paid tribute to the work the Department did during the year.  I think the majority of us can testify that the work was done expeditiously and well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by saying that I think it desirable for me to express my appreciation of the services rendered to me, and I am sure, to all other Members of the House, by the staff of this Department in the many dealings in which I have had to engage with them over some months.</P>
      <P>It is somewhat unusual for me to find it possible to pay a tribute of this kind because, while a superficial courtesy is readily available in all Government Departments, it is not always followed by activity of the kind needed if a Deputy is to be seen by his constituents as discharging his duties to them.  In this particular Department, I must say that I found not alone was I met by the private secretary and the officials with co-operation and consideration but, indeed, by expedition in the particular work which was required to be put in hand.  It is unusual and for that I certainly am duly grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussion on the Minister's statement in this House naturally centres around television and broadcasting perhaps more than any other subject. It is a matter of some wonder.  I suppose, that within a few short years we have managed in this small country to erect a television structure and organisation, physically in the sense of buildings and staff, which, I think, <Col N="1082" /> can compare with that to be found anywhere else.  That is not an easy thing to achieve, I should imagine, in a country such as Ireland.  Because of our small population, because of our close proximity to one another, because of our universal knowledge, as it were, of one another's business and because of the intense competition in political circles, I feel that the wisdom of Solomon would be required by a television authority seeking to do absolute justice in reporting the activities of Dáil Éireann or in affording equal reportage facilities to all Members of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I must say I enjoyed Deputy Kitt's contribution and felt very keenly that what he was saying was the absolute truth in relation to the frustration experienced by many Deputies who make contributions in this House and who are not mentioned in news reports, as they feel they should be.  It has often been a matter of wonder to me as to how these things are ordered.  As I say, I know full well that striking a balance in these matters presents what is probably an insuperable problem, if one strives for perfection.  It just cannot be achieved, any more than perfection can be achieved in any human activity.  But there have been times indeed&mdash;and I do not complain on my own behalf&mdash; when I have seen television time devoted, particularly in the newscasts, to subjects which would strike me as having very remote interest for the population of this country; when to my personal knowledge, there had been discussed on the same day in Dáil Éireann matters of vital importance to people which were not touched upon at all in these newscasts.</P>
    <P>Scarcely a night goes by but we are treated to an adventure in the far corners of the world and to an intensified course of education in the progress of foreign wars.  I often feel there must be somebody specially appointed at Montrose to keep his eye on these things and to prepare a special part of the nightly bulletin to keep us informed as to how things are going in these almost unpronounceable places, while, at the same time, mundane affairs which might concern, we will say, the farmers&mdash;though I do not argue that <Col N="1083" /> they have been without their meed of publicity in recent times&mdash;and other sections of the community, the workers, or the old aged&mdash;people of that kind and local matters of this kind&mdash;do not seem to inspire the same amount of attention as things which happen in faraway places with strange-sounding names.  There is a certain air of adventurous unreality in this reportage. To be sure, we want to know what is going on abroad but we do not want to be dosed with it night after night after night.  We want to know what is happening in Ireland too.  We are far more interested in what is happening here than in what is happening elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I may mention the public press in passing on this very contentious matter which was recently discussed&mdash;and on which there are varying views, I believe, in all parties in the House&mdash;in connection with the proposal to send a group to Asia.  I felt when I first heard of this that it was an incredible proposition.  Indeed, I wrote to the Director General and asked was it true; I just could not believe it because I have seen occasions when there were functions of considerable importance taking place in Ireland which were not covered by television, and the reason given was that we had not enough cameras to cover them.</P>
    <P>In this particular instance, it was proposed to send a camera team to a very far distant place, as we know.  I thought that the conception was hardly realistic, besides which, it seems to me, too, that in this sphere of television reporting, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to present a completely and absolutely objective report on any subject.  Having looked for years at the BBC, Independent Television and our own, it seems to me that the very act of reporting any particular matter or subject seems to make it inevitable that the reporter will express a view pro or con the particular matter he is looking at, or the particular problem at which he is looking.  Objectivity is nearly impossible of achievement.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have enough trouble of our own without seeking to involve ourselves in arguments and discussions <Col N="1084" /> in other parts of the globe.  This is my personal view, not necessarily shared by members of my own Party, though I must confess that at a later stage it seemed to me there was something to be said for sending a camera team to the place in question, particularly if it included one particular interviewer&mdash; not, I may say, Mr. O'Kelly, who was mentioned in this connection&mdash;but a particular interviewer who seems to specialise in insulting the people whom he is interviewing.  He might not find it so easy to do that in other parts, and he might have his ears pinned by Ho Chi Minh, or Westmoreland, or whoever he might be talking to, which might be a beneficial thing.  However, in a matter of that kind, which brings us into, as it were, discussion of international concerns, international political concerns, it is not sufficient that a semi-State body&mdash;this is my personal view&mdash;should have the sole determination of whether such a thing should be done.  This is something which a government must have reference to.</P>
    <P>Having said that, let me say&mdash;to go back to the matter of reporting on television of political events here&mdash;we had the instance of a Minister, we are told, interfering with a news programme, demanding that certain alterations be made in presentation and so on.  That, to my mind, is undesirable.  This is a totally different thing.  In domestic reporting of this kind, unless there is positive and blatant partisanship in the reporting, it is highly undesirable that there should be any interference from politicians because, if they were to be permitted&mdash;as Deputy Kitt says, quite rightly&mdash;who is to say, who could, in justice, say, that one particular politician has the right to interfere and have a news programme changed and another has not: where would it stop?</P>
    <P>Do we not all feel at times aggrieved that our oracular pronouncements here are not conveyed to the tense and expectant Irish nation which is awaiting our wisdom?  Do we not all feel this sense of grievance, and is it not a very understandable thing, human nature being what it is?  But trying to look at it from the point of view of commonsense and the national good, it does seem to be a very improper <Col N="1085" /> precedent and one which I hope will not be followed, and should not be followed in the future, that such interference or influence in news reporting of the domestic scene&mdash;I would emphasise &ldquo;the domestic scene&rdquo;&mdash; should be in any way tolerated by the Government or by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>By and large, Telefís Éireann do a very difficult and a good job.  In some of the programmes they produce for entertainment the recreational and educational content are the equivalent of what you will find anywhere, I think, in these islands, and the standard in these islands&mdash;I believe, from what I read&mdash;is pretty high, higher perhaps than anywhere else, certainly higher than that which prevails in America.  In America if one is to accept what is written about television and radio, it is not admirable.  Our standard compares with that of the BBC, and in many instances favourably, in expertise, in production and in general entertainment value.</P>
    <P>The language is promoted in so far as it is possible to promote it in an excellent manner.  I am thinking, for instance, of the programme &ldquo;Amuigh faoin Spéir&rdquo; every Saturday.  Anybody who has an opportunity of looking in on Saturdays will agree with me that it is a fascinating programme in itself, produced with great skill, understandable to everybody, even those who know little or no Irish.  It provides an opportunity to such people to pick up a phrase or two here and there which is a good thing.</P>
    <P>Another programme which I would commend in the highest possible terms &mdash;I do not think it has been mentioned here but it should be mentioned&mdash;is &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo;.  The men who appear on that programme discharge themselves with an amazingly able professionalism which is a revelation.  It must surely be very satisfying to the public, as it certainly is to me, to see and to acknowledge that we have in the Garda young men of such ability, articulation, coherence and knowledge as to be able to put across, through what is, mind you, a very difficult medium, the difficult message of the law.  They put it over in a manner <Col N="1086" /> which gets the best results, which projects the garda as a friend of the community, as one of the community, as the protector of the people and in an entirely different light from that in which he has unfortunately been seen in other days.  &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo; and all associated with it are deserving of every compliment.  I know people who switch on &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo; just to listen to it alone and then switch possibly to some cross-Channel programme when it is over.  That suggests to me that &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo; could easily be developed to a greater extent with benefit to everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that television is a difficult medium.  It is a matter of wonder to me, if to nobody else, that we have been able to harness the abilities of technicians, producers, commentators and interviewers to the extent which we have done in so short a time and so successfully.  I regretted, and I still regret, the passing of a programme which we had dealing with politics up to last year in which the newspaper correspondents participated.  The presentation of the political programmes as we know them is in very able hands. Certainly one could not imagine a more effective Chairman than Dr. Thornley or a more dispassionate person in charge of this very difficult activity of controlling debates between politicians. It seems to me, too, that with the passage of time, the politicians themselves who are appearing on these programmes are becoming more used to the medium and giving the listeners better value.  They are shouting less together.</P>
    <P>There is not as much cacophony from the box as there used to be.  There is more argument and as time goes on, we all hope that this trend will continue and that it will be realised that it is the duty of everybody who appears on this programme to realise that the viewers, who are the people who put us here, expect debate, reasoned argument, discussion, and do not enjoy looking, for long periods, at the one individual dilating on all the problems of the country.  For some queer reason, they are not as mesmerised by the personality of the speaker as the speaker <Col N="1087" /> is by his own personality.  These are things which we learn by experience. In this particular sphere we are learning and, I feel, developing.</P>
    <P>I would like to see all Members of Dáil Éireann have the opportunity of appearing on television.  It would be a great thing if it were possible for all Members of the House to be afforded the opportunity of appearing on television in lengthy discussions, not necessarily for an hour&mdash;that might be deemed to be too long&mdash;but in reasonably lengthy discussion with constituency colleagues possibly or members from other areas on certain subjects.  In fact I would like to see television being introduced here at Question Time.  I wonder whether we would have as many suspensions&mdash;I do not know; it might lead to a greater number of suspensions, but it might on the other hand, prove a salutary thing.  However, it would show the people what actually goes on in this Chamber of ours and what kind of a Parliament they have working here in Dublin on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see through television a greater examination and exposure of the work of Deputies. There is abroad, as we all know, an uninformed view concerning the duties of Members of this House.  We have seen on many occasions letters to the press and speeches and comments made about the number of Deputies in attendance in Dáil Éireann at certain times.  We here know the reason for this sparsity of attendance.  We know that members of the Dáil, if they are not in the House, are in the committee rooms either interviewing constituents or attending to the endless ocean of correspondence which reaches them, or else attending meetings in their constituencies. Certainly we can be assured that they are attending in some way to the needs of their constituents, the urgent imperative, and demanding needs, which will not tolerate inattention or delay.</P>
    <P>Members of the Dáil who are not present in the Dáil Chamber are doing these things.  It would appear to me that television would be doing a very good job if it could bring home to the <Col N="1088" /> people, as it has the facilities to bring home to the people more than any other medium of communication, just what the facts are.  I think it is a mean advantage to take of Members to criticise them for their absence from the House when, in fact, they are engaged on far more useful exercises on behalf of the people they represent.</P>
    <P>In fact, let me say this.  I will not say the most enjoyable, but the easiest part of the duties of Deputies is the time a Deputy spends in the Chamber, the time when he can participate in debates.  The chore of correspondence and constituency work, as we have seen&mdash;let us not put a tooth in it&mdash; which I have seen in my short time of 15 or 16 years in the House has brought men to ill-health and to their graves before their time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  The point I want to make is that it would be beneficial if the Minister would take thought of this.  The television Authority would be making a contribution towards a better understanding of the function of the Government, and of Dáil Éireann, if they did a deep analysis of the work of Deputies, and if all Deputies were provided with an opportunity of appearing on television. It does not follow that all Deputies would want to appear on television and, God forbid, it should not follow that all Deputies should appear on television.  Those who feel they are being deprived by not getting an opportunity should be provided with an opportunity of appearing and, as it were, swopping political fisticuffs with their opposite numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, while I in common with most other reasonable people took exception to the idea of television personnel travelling halfway around the world to see what Ho Chi Minh or General Westmoreland were at, and poking our noses into affairs down there, I take the other view in regard to things nearer home. For instance, quite a considerable time ago I suggested to the Director General of Radio Telefís Éireann that in the <Col N="1089" /> light of what appeared then to be the imminence of our entry into Europe, it would be a good thing to give the nation an idea of what our people do in Strasbourg and what goes on at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.  I suggested that a camera team might be sent there to study the work done by the Irish delegation and to interview members of the other delegations to see exactly what the Council of Europe, the European Parliament, means.  So far nothing has happened in this regard.</P>
    <P>I urge it again upon the Minister. This kind of thing would be useful and relevant because I find a great lack of information when I meet people and discuss with them things like the Council of Europe and the EEC.  There are not many people in Ireland&mdash;I wonder how many there are in this House?&mdash;who could tell you off the top of their heads, to use a newly-discovered colloquialism, what the letters EEC mean, what EFTA means and what GATT means.  There are not many of us in this House now, and I wonder how many of us really know what all those letter groupings mean. In all fairness, is it reasonable to expect the people outside, the ordinary citizens, to know?  I suggest it is not.</P>
    <P>We have the opportunity and the facilities with television to send people to Brussels to interview those who are concerned with the EEC and to send them wherever it is necessary to send them in connection with the other organisations and&mdash;I think I mentioned this in the House before&mdash;to initiate a massive campaign of information to make the people aware of exactly what these things mean.  Television provides us with the means to do this on a scale which was inconceivable ten years ago. Because of its very nature, television can be regarded as the extra member of the family in most households throughout the country, and a source of information on most things.  The Minister has an obligation to bring the country up to date on these matters and to inform and enlighten the people.</P>
    <P>I find that most people have little conception of what the Common Market and the EEC mean.  Few outside those directly concerned with the <Col N="1090" /> changes suggested have made any study of these matters.  There is a need for a simplification of terms.  There is a need for telling the story in simple, understandable, everyday terms.  The story which is told in the NIEC Report and in the Report on Full Employment is totally incomprehensible.  Let me say that most of it is totally and utterly incomprehensible to me.  It may be that other people are better equipped than I am to grasp the subtleties of economic terms.  I do not deny that that is entirely possible and highly probable. The ordinary citizen is entitled to expect that these things will be put in language that can be understood, and I suggest on behalf of the vast body of people outside the House that that should be done.  How can we expect people to respond to appeals and exhortations made to them and at them if they do not understand in the first instance what we are talking about?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not just trying to hang on this Estimate at all the incomprehensibility of Telefís Éireann. What I am trying to say, perhaps inadequately but still to the best of my limited ability, is that I think the Minister and the television Authority should avail of the television service to provide the people with knowledge and if necessary, instruction in what is meant by these obscure elements which are used in relation to what is happening in matters of trade and commerce in Europe and in relation to what is liable to happen to our economic future.  That is all I am saying.  I am <Col N="1091" /> not trying to be irrelevant or in any way to stray from the debate.</P>
      <P>Let me say that the remarks I had to make about the apparent lack of balance in news programmes on occasions, in so far as news from outside the country and domestic news are concerned, should not be construed as criticism of the newscasters who, I think, do an excellent job.  They have at times a demanding and difficult job to do and they discharge it very well.</P>
      <P>There is reference in the last paragraph of the Minister's statement to what are called pirate radios.  I have a certain view on this.  It seems to me we are far too ready to follow along in the tracks of European countries in our approach to matters of this kind. As far as I know, the first of these pirate radios was started in Britain by a young Irishman who made a considerable success of it.  I know the British Government are legislating to end pirate radios, as they call them. To me it seems to be another form of commercial radio with a claim for existence the same as any other form of commercial activity, but I do not see why we should not follow the British lead in this matter.  I do not know why we should follow the continental lead. I do not think the continentals in their approach to matters of this kind are as finicky as we are.</P>
      <P>One must think of Radio Luxembourg. That little State draws, I am certain, a tremendous income by reason of the activities of that commercial radio.  On thinks of that and wonders is there a possibility that we might very well, without doing ourselves any harm, consider whether we should not go into that sphere of commercial activity.  Is there any reason why, if it is possible for us to earn money abroad from advertising or what have you, we should not set up a commercial radio station comparable with Radio Luxembourg? I do not think there is, other than a conservative outlook and a lack of imagination.  We are moving into a world when we will have to drop our conservative outlook, when we will have to exercise our imagination very considerably if we are to make a living at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> I feel certain my words here on this Estimate will have very little or no effect on the position but I think it necessary for somebody to say that we are displaying undue haste to follow Britain's lead in this matter.  There does not seem to me to be any great obligation on us to hound what is known as the pirate radio.  It is doing us no harm and in the heel of the hunt, it might be of considerable benefit to us. We shall have to change many things in our lives in the future which is before us.  Already things are changing rapidly before our eyes in all sorts of ways.  Things are happening which 20 years ago we could not dream would happen.  This is one of the ways in which I think changes will occur.  We shall have to strike a more independent line in our attitude towards radio. If it can be shown, as has been suggested to me, that there is an opening in that sphere for this country to develop, to earn money from abroad as was done in the case of Luxembourg, why should we not do it?</P>
    <P>I do not think I have very much more to say on this Estimate except to join with other Deputies in an annual appeal to the Minister to consider the plight of part-time postmen and to ask him to do what he can to make the living of sub-postmasters more tolerable than it is.  Sub-postmasters have particularly heavy responsibility and in many cases are ill paid for what they do.  I urge the Minister to lose no opportunity to provide greater returns for them for what they put into their job.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing to learn that the forecast in regard to radio and television is that we shall lose money money in the years ahead.  It is difficult for me to understand that but it would seem there is a falling off in advertising and that the rates may be in need of adjustment.  In any event, that is something we can take up again at a future date.  I will conclude by repeating what I said at the outset.  It has been my experience in dealing with this Department&mdash;a far from usual experience&mdash;that the officials are not only courteous but that they do their jobs efficiently and well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I shall deal with aspects of this Estimate that affect the ordinary businessman and indeed the ordinary private individual.  I shall deal particularly with the telephone service which I regard as quite inadequate for this year of 1967. The Minister, in introducing his Estimate, seemed to think that things are not too bad&mdash;that there has been a considerable improvement.  It would appear that at the end of April this year, there were 9,900 people who had applied for telephones and had not been serviced.  The Minister said in his speech that, disregarding 2,900 cases in course of installation, there were still 7,000 people awaiting connection.  That means, in effect, there were 9,900 applicants who had not been serviced.</P>
      <P>There is a very serious obligation on a State monopoly, which takes over a service so vital to the community as the telephone, to provide a good service. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs have a monopoly in this field. They will not allow any commercial firm to engage in it and to supply or install telephones.  At the same time, they are giving a very bad service themselves.  The Minister says further on:</P>
      <P>Already service has been offered to all but about 100 of the pre-1966 applicants in the provinces.</P>
      <P>That means that people are waiting for a telephone for 18 months.  I simply want to emphasise that, in my opinion, that is not good enough.  I understand that this section of the Department is paying its way and making a profit. The Minister should get more staff, more capital and get on with the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year 1967 a telephone is no longer a luxury: it is an essential.  It is essential to the businessman, whether he is in a small or a large way of business.  It is essential to farmers who can afford it.  It is essential to the private individual.  There are some very cruel cases of people being deprived of telephones.  I knew a man who in the course of his commercial life always had a telephone at his disposal in his office.  When he was nearly 80, he <Col N="1094" /> retired and he wanted the little luxury of a telephone in his private house.  But he could not be supplied with one.  He applied for a telephone but after waiting for a couple of years the poor man died without ever getting it.  That should not happen.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary to spend much time on making a case for a better telephone service.  Facts speak for themselves.  It is outrageous that a person should have to wait for 18 months to be connected.  It would appear from the trend of the Minister's speech that he is satisfied with a delay of about 12 months, I hope that is not the standard he has set himself.  He says:</P>
    <P>By the end of this financial year it is hoped to have offered service to virtually all the pre-1967 cases.  We will then be dealing only with relatively recent applications, a position we have not been in for several years.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that a delay of 12 months is reasonable.</P>
    <P>There is also this question of people who are provided with telephones having to pay large sums, sometimes up to £70 or £80 or more, by way of rentals in advance.  That is not reasonable.  Maybe the Minister can make a case on that and establish that there have been large numbers of people who got in the telephone and chucked it out again after a year.  I do not think there are many such cases. If there are, I would be glad to hear of them.  Failing positive evidence that there were wholesale abuses of that kind, people should not be asked to pay up to £100, representing five or seven years' rental in advance to a State monopoly.</P>
    <P>There is just one minor point, which I think I also made last year, dealing with public telephones in small rural post offices.  You have a public telephone there and if a person goes in to use that telephone, he has to carry on his telephone conversation in public in the office without any indoor kiosk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes.  It is a source of embarrassment <Col N="1095" /> to the person making the call and also to the assistant behind the counter. She does not want to appear to be eavesdropping, but if she goes into the kitchen or some place else, the customers may run off with the stamps. The whole thing is unsatisfactory.  It would not cost very much to provide an enclosed compartment where a person could make his telephone call in comparative privacy.  I was told last year that this only occurred in isolated cases.  I am afraid that is not so.  I am afraid there is no enclosed compartment or kiosk in the great majority of the small country post offices.  I would ask the Minister to do something about that.  I am sure he will not try to say it is satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I want to get a little parochial for a couple of minutes and deal with the provision of a post office in Cavan town.  The Department acquired a very fine premises, known as the Central Markets, right in the centre of the town of Cavan.  I am not certain of the date but I think they got possession in 1962 and the urban district council made it available and sold it to the Department&mdash;it was well worth the money&mdash;on the understanding that a much-wanted post office and proper telephone exchange would be provided. From that date to this nothing has been done, as far as one can see or as far as one can ascertain by Parliamentary Question, to proceed with the building of the post office. There is some cable being provided in the lower end of the yard but when I last put down a Parliamentary Question here about progress on this project, I regret to say that I got no satisfactory information.  I did not get any indication as to when it is proposed to proceed with the building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister that the present post office in the town of Cavan is completely inadequate, that Cavan seems to be one of the few country towns which have not yet been provided with an automatic exchange, that the staff both in the post office proper and in the exchange are working in conditions which are far from satisfactory.  A State Department which takes over a valuable <Col N="1096" /> property situate in the centre of a country town owes an obligation to the people of the town to utilise that building and the site with a minimum of delay for the purpose for which it was acquired.  A Department of State should not take over a large building in the centre of a country town and let it remain there as an eyesore.  Admittedly, when the Tidy Town Committee and the urban council drew the attention of the Department to the fact that unsightly weeds and derelict areas could be seen through the gates of this central market building, the Department got a bit of galvanised iron and closed up the gates so that passers-by could not see the conditions inside.  I do not think that is good enough.  A Department of State owes something to the taxpayers and ratepayers of a county town.  I hope it will not be necessary to continue bringing this matter up here year after year.  It is five years since the Department went into possession of this building.  Five years may not be very much in the lifetime of a Department of State but it is a considerable period in the life of a community.</P>
    <P>I do not want to have any long discussion on Telefís Éireann but I do not want to let this occasion pass without going on record as saying that the people of the country are completely dissatisfied with the manner in which the television and radio services are being abused by the Government for political purposes.  The Minister says here in reply to Parliamentary Questions that he is not concerned and has no say in the day to day running of Telefís Éireann or Radio Éireann but we do know that the Minister and his colleagues have interfered, for what appear to be political purposes, with the presentation of news items on television and radio.  That is a bad trend.  It is a move towards something nearly akin to indoctrination of the viewers and listeners of these State-controlled news media.  The Minister should either admit that he and the Government are interfering in these services and come into the House here and defend that or the Government should keep their hands and their influence off Telefís Éireann <Col N="1097" /> and Radio Éireann unless when something akin to national interest demands it and on these occasions there should be no going behind doors and no private telephone messages to the newsroom.  It should be done, as the Act provides, by a direction from the Minister.  Not until that state of affairs is reached will the people be satisfied.</P>
    <P>It has often struck me as strange that sometimes there are news items in Irish which are not repeated in the news in English.  I wonder what is the reason for that.</P>
    <P>I wish to join in the appeal made from all sides of the House on behalf of this band of men known as auxiliary postmen.  When a postman serves until he is 65 or 70 years of age, he should be provided with an adequate pension.  He is simply turned out with a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; and a small gratuity. That is not good enough.  Alternatively, if he is not to be provided with a pension, he should be allowed to work as long as he is able to do so.  I know of a few cases where the services of men who appeared to be hale and hearty but who were advanced in years were terminated and they were not provided with a pension; they were given a gratuity.  It is high time that something was done about that.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise again the points I have made about delay in the provision of adequate telephone facilities and the disgraceful delay in providing a proper post office and automatic exchange in Cavan Town.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to avail of this opportunity of going on record as supporting comments and criticisms put forward by colleagues of mine in the Fine Gael Party and by members of the Labour Party, inasmuch as I feel, like many other people in public life and many other people throughout the country, that there is too much interference by members of the Cabinet in the everyday administration of Radio Telefís Éireann.  This has become abundantly clear through certain statements in this House and through certain actions of Ministers of the State outside this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> This is not good for democracy.  It is wrong fundamentally, apart from the fact, human nature being what it is, that a Minister will take the necessary steps to ensure that nothing will be broadcast or televised which will be unkind to him or to his Party. However, remembering that a person in public life must take the rough with the smooth, I believe that if some public comment is made which is unkind to Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, or to members of their Party, they must accept that to offset the kind remarks made previously and which no doubt will be made at future dates.</P>
    <P>As a viewer I have yet to witness severe criticism of the Government in news reports or by a political commentator, or indeed any person using Radio Telefís Éireann.  When we in Donegal, who have a choice of three different programmes, select to view the programmes being televised by the BBC or UTV, we can see the difference in the three programmes.  Unfortunately most people in the Twenty-six Counties have not that advantage, nor can they notice the brainwashing that is taking place.  I venture to say that, in all probability, they do not realise they are being brainwashed.</P>
    <P>In this regard I should like briefly to comment on some of the programmes televised by these two channels which are not the responsibility of the Fianna Fáil Government.  On many occasions I have heard news readers reporting the news, which was anything but complimentary to the Stormont Government or the Labour Party, or indeed the Conservative Party when they were in Government in Great Britain.  I have witnessed programmes such as &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; where they state bluntly the facts as they see them.  They have, as it were, invited a Minister of State into the studio and have put him in the witness box.  On a few occasions I have seen many prominent members of either the Conservative Party or the Labour Party made very small people by being forced into a corner and having to admit that they did not fulfil certain promises they made.  I wonder what answer the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would have if he were put <Col N="1099" /> into a witness box and asked about some of the things which the Government told us they would do in their policy prior to 1957, in their policy prior to the general election of 1961, and in their policy prior to the general election of 1965.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I shall convey those sentiments to the television Authority.  I should like to see a programme like that and I should like to see people associated with RTE being free to answer very pertinent, and perhaps impertinent, questions, but certainly asking searching questions of Ministers of State similar to those on programmes like &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; which is a weekly news programme televised by the BBC.  If we had an interviewer like Robin Day asking deep and searching questions of Ministers of State and if those questions related to certain aspects of Government policy, I wonder would the Ministers speak critically, as indeed the Minister for Transport and Power and Posts and Telegraphs did quite recently when he severely criticised a certain policy which was being pursued by his Government under the leadership of Deputy Seán Lemass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a programme would provoke deep thought and a healthy examination by the viewing public, and it would be good for democracy.  A viewing public which would have an informed conscience or opinion would be much better able to evaluate the policies of the different Parties at a future general election.  A television authority such as RTE should be completely above politics.  It is there because the taxpayers pay for it.  It is there, an independent <Col N="1100" /> body, or should be an independent body, by virtue of an Act of Parliament.  It is supported not only by advertisements but by the taxpayers' money, and fair comment should be the order of the day from the station.</P>
    <P>As against the criticisms I may have of RTE.  I should like also, in relation to the political aspect, to go on record as complimenting the Director and his staff on the manner in which they have, as it were, grown up.  They are five or six years in existence and, apart from some very minor incidents, which I expect happen with the BBC and ITV, we have a television service of which we can be proud.  We would certainly have a greater pride in this service if all political influence were removed from Montrose.  Political manoeuvring should be confined to this House and its precincts.  I do not wish to repeat the comments made by members of my Party and of the Labour Party. Radio Telefís Éireann is doing a reasonably good job but they would do a better job if political thumbs were removed from the pie.</P>
    <P>Next week in Lisbon the European Cup Final will be played.  I wonder has the Director of Radio Telefís Éireann made any inquiries as to the possibility of televising this very important match.  Certain people in this House and outside it would, of course, say: &ldquo;Oh, this is a foreign game.&rdquo; This is an international game and one of the teams taking part, namely, Glasgow Celtic, is redolent of our own soil because this team was built out of our emigrants, Donegal and North of Ireland emigrants in particular, who made their homes in Scotland, in and around Glasgow. Great interest is being taken in this match and Radio Telefís Éireann should take the initiative, contact the authorities concerned and try to have the match televised so that those of our people who do not have BBC or UTV can see the European Cup Final.</P>
    <P>With regard to telephones, some years back I raised the question of the possibility of re-directing cross-Channel telephone calls from Donegal <Col N="1101" /> through Belfast.  Donegal is isolated from Dublin, but all cross-Channel calls must go through the Dublin exchange.  Those who live near the Border can cross over to Strabane or Derry and dial the number they require in Britain.  Unless the number is engaged or the line is particularly busy, they get their calls immediately. It takes hours to get a call through Dublin.  I have addressed questions to former Ministers on this matter. Letters have appeared in the local press recommending that this change should be made; some scheme should be worked out to enable these calls to be made through Belfast.  The financial arrangement could be worked out satisfactorily with the Dublin exchange. It should be a simple exercise. I understand there would be no great objection by the authorities in the Six Counties.  They have ample trunk lines and no one can see any disruption of telephone communications there in the foreseeable future because of overloading.</P>
    <P>I should like to go on record in protest against the policy of replacing the rural postman with the rural post van.  Economics should not be the overriding consideration in a matter such as this.  It has been pointed out by the Department that different delivery areas can be serviced at a nominal cost by using motor transport as against the present method.  Many of these men have given loyal service. By no stretch of the imagination could it be said that they were being paid a just wage to deliver the mail.  Indeed, the only reason why many of these men carried out this duty was that they had no alternative.  My experience is that the Department is not concerned as to whether or not these men were paid a just wage for an honest day's work; these men were paid a certain allowance and they supplemented that allowance with some other income in order to provide for their wives and families.  I say this with particular reference to the rural postman in the West of Ireland.  We now find that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs propose to replace these men with motor vans.  Every part of the van itself will have to be imported. <Col N="1102" /> There is nothing in the motor van which could be made at home, except possibly the wires which go from the sparking plug to the distributor cap. The fuel which would serve it would be imported and every replacement that would have to be carried out would be imported.  Economics, therefore, should not be the overriding factor. Our moral obligation to society should be taken into consideration.  I would, therefore, protest in the strongest possible terms against this procedure and hope that the Department would have second thoughts about it.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the proceedings of the House but again, like other Deputies, I should like to indicate to the Minister and to his Parliamentary Secretary that this Party disagree completely with the system of paying a rental in advance as a guarantee that the new subscriber will keep his telephone for a number of years.  When this scheme was first introduced, I, like many other people, thought there was a certain wisdom in it and, quietly, I had admiration for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs at the time.  I felt he was being guided to the decision to draw up that type of policy because too many people were defaulting, too many people were applying for a telephone and, having discovered that the service was very handy but expensive, withdrew from it.  If that were the case, there was every reason for the Department and the Minister to introduce such a scheme but it was not the case.</P>
    <P>The true position is that while the Department could claim certain defaulters it was not a just reason for introducing the rental system in the installation of further telephones.  I am told that the telephone service is profitable. I understand that in many countries it is not the function of the Government to operate it and that shareholders are paid a very handsome dividend.  I understand that, in some countries, all local telephone calls are free and that there is no rental and that the profit is taken out of the trunk calls and telegrams.  When one reads of these things in other countries, the next question one asks oneself is why that cannot take place in Ireland.  I am not <Col N="1103" /> in a position to answer that question. All I can say is that if that is the case in other countries then there is no reason why the Minister and the Department should consider the policy of charging a three, five or seven years advance rental other than that it is a clear admission on their part that there was no money in the kitty to carry out the future policies of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying that many people have been forced to pay this advance rental.  They paid it believing they needed this service and intending to keep the service for the rest of their lifetime.  Some unforeseen reason or another&mdash;sometimes death&mdash;has changed the whole picture.  A widow might find that her late husband drew up an agreement with the Department and paid as much as £80 or £90 deposit under the rental system but that she has no further use for a telephone and, even if she had, she could not afford to keep it.  I wonder if the Minister would take into consideration the merits of such a case and favourably consider a refund to the widow or indeed to the family concerned in such cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first, to deal with telephones and to take this opportunity of urging the Minister and his Department to try to give telephones to as many waiting would-be subscribers as possible.  It is a tremendously urgent problem and, in this day and age, to be without a telephone is a serious handicap.  I should be all for top priority action and, if necessary, for increasing the amount of money necessary to install telephones.  I know there are problems such as shortage of skilled staff, which the Minister mentioned, but I would urge him to get on with the recruitment and training of staff at an even faster rate than at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the matter of courtesy in telephone exchanges.  In some cases, when one rings up the exchange, one is greeted by a very well-mannered girl or man&mdash;whoever is on at the particular time of the day &mdash;and one's business is transacted very quickly.  However, there are still a few <Col N="1104" /> people in the exchanges who are extremely abrupt, who do not tell the subscriber what the delay is likely to be.  It happens occasionally&mdash;not all the time&mdash;but I should like the Minister's Department to keep an eye on this aspect of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>Mention must be made of the condition of some of the telephone receivers in kiosks.  I do not know how often the post office men are supposed to clean these receivers but I frequently have occasion to use these telephone boxes and one cannot but notice that the receiver is in a filthy condition.  I do not know if they use an antiseptic cloth to clean out the receiver but I should like to see a more rigorous approach to the solution of this problem.  Telephone receivers should be cleaned more frequently.  While on the subject of telephone kiosks, I should like to refer to the state of some of the telephone directories.  I realise the problem involved and how expensive it must be for the Department to replace these books, but it is a necessary service and I would urge the Department to consider a stronger type of directory, possibly one with a hard cover, for use in public telephone kiosks.  These are very important points and they are of interest to the public at large.</P>
    <P>I should like now to turn to Radio Telefís Éireann.  Deputy Dunne referred to the fact that there was not enough foreign news given on television.  I agree with him.  I should like to see an extension of the present news programme. Perhaps we could have 15 minutes of home news followed by ten or 15 minutes of foreign news.  The programme could be split up and we could have the home news first, then the commercials, and then the foreign news.  At the moment a certain amount of time is devoted to home and foreign news but frequently 15 minutes is not adequate, particularly if important events are happening all at once at home and abroad.  It would be a good idea if there was a programme on Telefís Éireann similar to &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; on Radio Éireann, a special programme while the Dáil is in session.  There is no doubt that more people than ever are now interested in politics and our people are more <Col N="1105" /> acquainted with what is going on in the national Parliament than are many people in other countries.</P>
    <P>There is some criticism which I should like to voice about some of the commentators on various programmes dealing with politics.  Generally speaking, the programmes are very good.  &ldquo;The Politicians&rdquo; and &ldquo;Division&rdquo; merit no criticism.  As has already been said, Dr. Thornley has a most difficult job to do on occasion, but now that it has been agreed among the Parties that only one member from each Party will appear in these political discussions, his job will be much easier.  One programme about which I am not very happy is &ldquo;Headlines and Deadlines&rdquo; for which the script is written by a well-known journalist.  We in this House are not allowed to mention the names of people outside the House because we would be in breach of privilege; yet these people can refer to Members of this House in, sometimes, a very derogatory manner.  These people should be brought to heel. Recently when I was watching this last named programme, Mr. Al Byrne&mdash; whether he was reading from his script or whether the reference was his own I do not know&mdash;referred to a Deputy as &ldquo;the young lad from Galway&rdquo;. In the House we criticise each other but it is all in good part and when we go outside we shake hands and talk about other things, but this Deputy was elected by the people to represent them.  Mr. Al Byrne and Mr. John Healy are elected by no one and they represent nobody and I should like to remind these gentlemen of that fact.  I should like to see these people going up for election, meeting the people and giving a public service as the people from all Parties in this House do.</P>
    <P>Recently on another programme which I find interesting, &ldquo;Newsbeat,&rdquo; Mr. Frank Hall referred to county councillors and other public servants in very derogatory terms.  This man has not given any public service; he is paid, like the other people, for doing a job of work.  They are professional men and are capable of doing <Col N="1106" /> an excellent job.  I am not referring to these men in particular when I say that many TV &ldquo;personalities&rdquo;, when invited to open a new store or to visit some place, charge a fee.  They get well paid for it but they are working at a profession.  They get more fees than the members of this House who serve the people, or county councillors and members of the corporations who receive no fees or expenses.  These people dedicate their lives to the public service and I become angry when I hear these derogatory remarks.  I wish that more people in this House would stand up and express their criticisms because we all know that this is true. It brings our Houses of Parliament into disrepute.  It is all very well to have your academic degrees, to be an intellectual and to talk down to people and to be one of these liberals or so-called liberals.</P>
    <P>I remember some years ago in England when some of these TV personalities decided they were ripe for election and they went before the people but they were defeated at the polls.  I am expressing these criticisms as fair comment and I have no regrets for expressing them in regard to these people who have power without responsibility. It is about time people in this House stood up and let these individuals know how we feel about some of the remarks they make.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to say that generally speaking I am highly delighted with the service given by Telefís Éireann.  Their programmes are very good and I have no major criticism of any of them.  However, sometimes I think that there are certain Members of this House who are concerned with becoming TV personalities themselves and who would like, if possible, to use the television as a way of reaching their constituents without wearing out any shoe leather. That is doing more harm than good to public representatives.  As I have said before, if the cost of staying in public life were to hold one's tongue and not speak the truth as one sees it, then it would be better not to be in public life.  I would urge some of the young men who are interested in politics to try to be a little more humble in their <Col N="1107" /> approach to their job and to realise, as I have said before, that the art of the good interviewer is never to be more important than the least important person he is interviewing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment on the telephone service but before dealing with that service generally, I wish to comment on the service here in Leinster House.  In making these remarks, I want to make it clear they are not directed in any way against the telephone operators but against the telephones.  I have yet to pick up a telephone in Leinster House and find that there is not a sort of semi-jazz band going on all the time.  There is something wrong with the internal circuit or other circuits in the House.  It is time this was taken up at a high level and looked into, whether it is faulty construction or not.  If you use what are known as outside lines, you can get a distinct line straight away but if you use the internal service, it is very bad, very indistinct and it is very hard to hear what people are saying.</P>
      <P>Another point in relation to the telephone service is this.  I understand that within the Departments the service is manned by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, naturally.  I consider the service is bad.  You ring up and ask if that is Local Government and somebody mutters something.  You ask to be put through to such an extension. They should be able to give the proper reply, that is, to repeat the number and tell you whether to hold on or to wait.  With these few remarks on the service within the Departments themselves, I should like to say that the position is bad generally in regard to operators throughout the country.  I understand that every operator is trained, when asked for a number, to repeat the number so that the caller knows the correct number has been heard and so as to give definite information as to whether the caller should hold on or will get a ring back and, if to hold on, how long it is likely to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These remarks do not apply to all operators but there are operators who <Col N="1108" /> are practising that sort of thing on the public at large.  It is entirely wrong because a telephone operator, once he or she is able to understand the numerous gadgets in an exchange, should show courtesy to the public.  By and large they do not and this is detrimental to our national image.  It is particularly bad for tourism and bad also from the point of view that at the moment we are supposed to be on the brink of getting into Europe&mdash;I have slight doubts on that point&mdash;and if we are, we want up to date, commercial efficiency.  You will not get that without an up to date, efficient telephone service.</P>
    <P>I do not like making these critical remarks because, to a certain extent, I am criticising civil servants but I think every Deputy has experienced much the same treatment as I have.  We are busy men: we want to get on with our work as fast as we can and I ask the Minister to see if he can get us first a proper circuit so that we can use the telephone and hear what is being said and get on with our job.  Secondly, I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that we want efficient, courteous and up to date operators of telephones.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about Telefís Éireann.  When criticising Telefís Éireann, one must remember that it is a comparatively new service.  It must be criticised on many grounds.  The function of a State service is to be absolutely non-political, as factual as possible, to be educational and to produce commentators and interviewers who measure up to the standards of other countries.  Our interviewers, with one or two honourable exceptions, are not up to the standard of the BBC. That is not perhaps up to continental standards but we cannot get foreign stations here and one can only hear their interviewers when one is abroad. Therefore, I would like to make my comparisons with the BBC, and perhaps ITV also.</P>
    <P>I think their commentators are better.  They manage to get more out of the individual concerned, more interesting facts, and they carry out the interviews in a much more efficient manner than our people here can do. <Col N="1109" /> I do not know who chooses them or whether they are chosen on political grounds, but I have a very strong suspicion that there is a bias in many cases and that many of the people appointed not only as interviewers but in other respects in Telefís Éireann are appointed on political grounds.</P>
    <P>Whether the Government like it or not, the feeling is growing in the country that there is a tremendous Government bias in Telefís Éireann.  One of the things that contributed more than anything else to that feeling was the Presidential election.  Without doubt, any unbiased person in Irish life who takes an interest in politics must realise that the coverage the Opposition candidate, so to speak, got on Telefís Éireann throughout the whole of that long campaign was absolutely minimal. The other candidate was certainly not in a position to play an actively political part in the election but he could not complain that he did not get the widest possible coverage in that period. Somebody must have instructed those in control of Telefís Éireann to carry on along those lines.  With all respect to our eminent and, shall we say, our venerable President&mdash;he has reached a ripe old age now&mdash;I have not seen him as often on Telefís Éireann since the election or anything like as often as he had been during the election.  In fact, we do not see him very often now on television but during the Presidential election he appeared practically every day.</P>
    <P>I mention that because it has given the impression, by and large, that Telefís Éireann is a sort of adjunct of the Government.  Anything that is a State service and is mono-political will not be a success.  Telefís Éireann is a national service and running, I think, at a considerable loss.  It will need State subsidisation perhaps over a prolonged period.  I have heard several Deputies say that there is a reduction in advertising.  If so, it means there is a reduction in the number of viewers. One of the things that will cause a reduction in viewing is to have the service used in any way for the promotion of a political party or image.</P>
    <P>I have no recollection of having ever <Col N="1110" /> seen a Minister being, shall we say, interviewed in any spirit of cross-examination other than the former Taoiseach.  I saw one interview of the former Taoiseach on Telefís Éireann in regard to the Common Market when he was tackled by three young men who struck me as being able men and &mdash;a very unusual thing in this country in relation to the Common Market&mdash; they knew what they were talking about.  To put it bluntly, they absolutely made bits of the former Taoiseach. They showed that he was not fully conversant with the subject.  They probably taught him quite a lot also. That is the sort of interview we want on Telefís Éireann.  I am sure many members of the Opposition would prefer potential leaders of their Party to be brought on Telefís Éireann, torn to pieces and interviewed in a critical manner so that they could be asked to give an account of any actions they have taken.  We have none of that here. On the cross-Channel television, the BBC, there is plenty of it.  In fact, it goes on the whole time.</P>
    <P>Deputies from different constituencies were interviewed on television and asked questions by the audience, but that is no longer the case.  Perhaps it is no great harm because it does not appear to have been a great success. On those programmes no Minister or Parliamentary Secretary ever appeared. If Telefís Éireann were the democratic institution it could be, it would endeavour to instruct and interest people in this country in politics.  This is very essential because one of the facts of Irish life is the lack of interest in politics generally.  The only political education available is that which appears in the public press. Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann should be used to educate the people with regard to politics.</P>
    <P>I listen as far as I have time, every day to the British news on television and then I listen to the Irish news.  I always notice that if there is any startling problem of any sort, whether it is in the agricultural sphere or the industrial sphere, the BBC bring on expert commentators.  They give their views in a non-political way.  We do not seem to have anything like that <Col N="1111" /> at all.  The only thing we have is &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; on Radio Éireann.  I say here and now that that is quite good.  It is very factual and very fair.  I do not think there is any bias one way or the other in relation to any political Party.  That is my considered opinion.</P>
    <P>We do not seem to have any experts who are entirely divorced from Irish public life, who are just news commentators. All we have are comments by political correspondents on Telefís Éireann.  That may be all right when Ministers go to London and are interviewed before they go or after they come back or maybe when they go to Bonn or Paris, as we understand they will be going in the near future.</P>
    <P>Another feature which has apparently been taken off Telefís Éireann for some reason or other is the agricultural programme.  This programme has been taken off for the past couple of months.  If it were screened now, would it meet the actual requirements of the modern age from an educational point of view?  It would be very good if we had agricultural commentators and experts.  I would even be prepared to put up with economists, even though they are people for whom I have always had an unholy dread.  I have always been inclined to take the opposite view to theirs because they can often be wrong.  Despite this, they are good at assessing facts.  It would be no harm if we had some of them on Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>We should have some programmes in relation to GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  I am sure many people have read and heard about the discussions on GATT and the Kennedy Round but they really know very little about them.  I am sure if you went out into the street with a loudspeaker and asked 20 people what GATT was, you would probably find that fewer than ten people would know what it was.  We could have programmes about such things on Telefís Éireann for the instruction of the Irish people as a whole.</P>
    <P>We could have more programmes <Col N="1112" /> dealing not only with educational subjects as such but also with advances in education generally.  I hope the Minister will consider those things.  Of course, if all my suggestions were accepted by the Government it would mean that there would be less time for the unhealthy political slant I referred to when I started talking about Telefís Éireann.  Practically every Deputy made reference to that.  It should impinge itself on the mind of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is the type of man who likes to do his best but at the same time, he always likes to think that everything in the garden is lovely. I do not think everything is lovely in the garden of Telefís Éireann.  Hence, my criticism here.  The proof that everything is not lovely in the garden of Telefís Éireann is the reduction in the advertisements.  Commerce will always go where there is a good return. Incidentally, as I am on advertising and before I leave Telefís Éireann, I am sure everybody will agree with me that the advertisements are put across extremely well, whoever is responsible. I always like to look at the Lyons tea advertisement.  It is one of the best advertisements I have ever seen on television in any country.  That applies to many of the advertisements.  They are good, well put across and are well photographed.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word on the question of the advance payment for telephones to which many Deputies have referred and to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that this imposes a hardship.  At the moment it is so difficult for anybody to get a telephone that people are prepared to pay any price for it.  If I or anybody else want to get a telephone, we are asked to pay £80 down.  That is what a person has to pay in rural Ireland.  I live some distance from the exchange, which is no fault of mine. It just happens to be where I live.  As I say, you have to pay £80 down.  That means you are paying four years rental in advance on the basis of the fact that you may opt out, give up the telephone, after putting the State to the expense of installing it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> We gather from the Minister's statement that the telephone service is paying. That is perhaps one of the few things within this national service that is giving a healthy return.  But, is it not a fact that if I or any subscriber is asked to pay four years rental in advance, what in effect is being done is that the State is anticipating four years income?  In other words, if you pay four years rental down for the next four years, the State gets no rent out of you.  It is a way of gathering in capital but it is false economy.  It is possible for the State to vote the necessary money to instal telephones.  Apart from anything else, a telephone service is a necessary service in this modern age, a service which nobody can do without.  In rural Ireland the problem is very different from that in Dublin. This charge should be borne by way of an overall charge on the country as a whole.  In other words, those who live in isolated districts should be encouraged to stay where they are and they should be given the necessary facilities from the State.  After all, let the rest of the country pay for it.  Let it be an overall national charge, so that, in so far as possible, there is an equitable overall charge for telephones and an equitable charge all round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>From reading the Minister's statement, I am confident that most things have been done to bring about improvement, especially in the Post Office service.  Despite the fact that it cost more money this year, one must admit that quite a lot of this money went towards paying wage and salary increases.  If we are to attract the best men into the service&mdash;and we are short of trained personnel at the moment&mdash; we must ensure that top salaries are paid to those men.  I compliment the Minister on taking the necessary steps to get money for such a purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to start off on a minor point in the Estimate, in relation to sub-post offices in this city.  Could the Minister not implore many of the proprietors who get licences from the Department to do something with those entirely drab, depressing premises? They are always drab.  Some of them have been there for 50 years and no attempt is made to brighten them up. <Col N="1114" /> With regard to attracting a post office savings group, these very ugly places are turning people away from it.  The Minister should examine the whole system of sub-post offices, and the way premises are kept should be the concern of the Department.  Let us try to brighten them.  We must remember that apart from people who live in the country, tourists who visit these sub-post offices go home with a very bad impression of how our sub-post offices work.  We just must be official, or semi-official. Were the Minister to consider giving grants to sub-post office owners to brighten their premises with a bit of paint and a few new fittings, the cost would be greatly repaid by way of general appreciation by the public, and particularly by the tourists.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister mentioned the new sorting office which will be opened very shortly.  We welcome this. It will provide the staff in the existing sorting office with better working conditions and I hope that as soon as the new sorting office is opened, the sorting office in Pearse Street will be closed.  For the most part, it is only a wooden hut; it has been there for many years and is very drab.  I hope it will close shortly.  I am sure the staff there will be glad to leave it, and I am sure the Minister will get greater efficiency in the new premises.</P>
    <P>I notice that since last year there is a deficit in the income from the Post Office Savings Bank, a very large deficit.  At a time when savings are vital to the economy, I wonder whether we are failing to attract the small man with the 1/- saving each week.  Are we overlooking the fact that he is very important and that today people can save more shillings than they could 20 years ago?  Are we failing to attract them by omitting to show them the benefits to be derived from a Post Office account?  There was an increase in the interest rate last year and that is a tremendous step forward.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the Savings Committee.  They are, however, falling down in one respect, that is, in relation to publicity, on the city buses.  Some of the advertisements displayed are done with a surrealistic motif.  This is incomprehensible to ordinary people.  It may appeal to the <Col N="1115" /> arty set but these advertisements will not attract the ordinary person who might save 10/- a week, unless they are made more attractive.</P>
    <P>Last year's figures show that we are falling down and that money which could be put to good purpose on deposit in a savings bank account is being frittered away on less useful things.  I ask the Minister to approach the Committee with a view to a report on this whole matter.  While savings are high, it seems to me that there is a decline since last year and that is something that must be checked.  We talk about our external balance of payments difficulties but this relates to our internal balance of payments and is something that must be looked into because savings are vital to the economy.</P>
    <P>The next item I should like to mention is the telephone service.  While it is easy to slight the service, to say nothing nice about it, it seems to me that there has been a tremendous increase in the number of telephones in the past few years.  This is a tribute to the Department and its workers. The Minister mentioned that we are short of trained personnel.  He mentioned the service given by the vocational schools.  Let me say, as a member of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, that that Committee will at all times bend over backwards to have young men trained for this most important service.  Any request by the Minister to the Committee will certainly be given every consideration and if we can at all, we will help.  Every Deputy is sick and tired of people coming to him asking to have a telephone installed.  It is just not possible without more personnel.</P>
    <P>We all know that if you write a polite letter to the Department, you get back an equally polite reply but that will not help the man waiting to have a telephone installed.  I am speaking of private subscribers but in the city and in the country, there is need for many telephone kiosks.  In the city, the number is totally inadequate. A principle of the Department is that no kiosk will be installed unless it can pay for itself.  In this age when <Col N="1116" /> we are told that some countries have local calls free, the Minister should examine this matter.  In a part of my area which is close to Dublin Bay and very remote, there has been no telephone for the past 15 years.  From time to time, representations have been made to have a kiosk installed but they have all been turned down and we are told that it would not be economic.  If a telephone saved one life in a drowning accident or a fire, it would be well worthwhile.  With the healthy state of the Post Office and the Department in general, the Minister might bend to this point.  The telephone may very often be the means of saving a life and a cash value cannot be put on a human life.</P>
    <P>With regard to the television service, at the outset I would say that Telefís Éireann are doing a very good job but I have found myself in the past few months wanting to listen to the radio and not look at television.  Perhaps the fact that you cannot see the people on the radio may be a factor in the decision but I think we are not happy and, naturally, would not be completely happy with the television service.  Every year on this Estimate, speakers refer to the fact that the Government interfered with Telefís Éireann.  I think if the Government did not interfere on some occasions, it would be a very poor Government.</P>
    <P>Recently we had a row over a proposed trip to Vietnam.  I received letters from a number of people protesting against this.  I thought what a waste of time it was that every night on Telefís Éireann, or on foreign stations one saw something about Vietnam and we all know that in Vietnam it is power politics at its worst.  Would Telefís Éireann not think of taking their cameras to the Bihar state in India where people are starving and we do not give a damn whether they starve or not?  If they sent a team to some of these places and showed us the conditions, perhaps we could do something about it; we can do nothing about Vietnam but we could do something about the starving millions in India.  We could put our hands in our pockets, stop being so smug and realise that many <Col N="1117" /> of our fellow human beings are dying of starvation.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann would be performing a wonderful service if they sent a camera team to Bihar or some of those places and brought it home to our people here that there are millions of children dying.  Since I started to speak, probably one hundred children have died in starving India.  Yet we carry on as if in our own country here, we had all the troubles in the world.  Telefís Éireann should stop playing at politics. Some of the programmes appear to show an anti-American bias, which is not shared by the vast majority of people.</P>
    <P>There are many features of the television service which are very good and are comparable with many on foreign stations.  Deputy Esmonde, mentioned that he saw an interview with the ex-Taoiseach when four young men had torn him assunder.  I doubt if it happened. However, I can appreciate the Deputy's concern about the people on these panels interviewing public figures and giving them a rough time.  Recently I saw a programme with the Taoiseach and a panel of five young people. Having looked at it I could only come to the conclusion that four of them had been picked, not for their intelligence but for their precociousness.</P>

      <P>I have never seen such badly-mannered people in all my life. I think the chairman of that programme failed, on that occasion, to keep the panel in check.  When public figures do appear on programmes such as those, we hope that our opponents will have some manners at least.  I would suggest to Telefís Éireann, when they are picking the panels for this programme, or any other programme, that intelligence be the guideline and nothing else.  On their Saturday night programme, which most people look at but at which I have ceased to look, last week I am told a well-known architect and a well-known auctioneer were named.  This is not a sporting way of doing things.  Many of us in this House refrain from mentioning <Col N="1118" /> people who are not here because they cannot defend themselves against us. We have parliamentary privilege and I would say 99 per cent of the members of the Parties honour that privilege.  But here we had a public programme on television when people mentioned names in a derogatory way and these people who are named have very little come-back.  It is always easy to say an apology can be given but you know very well the damage has been done in the first instance and, even though people apologise, it will not repair the damage done to those persons.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be harping on criticism of Telefís Éireann because they are doing many wonderful things. Since the day they went into production they have done some great things.  I would suggest that if the political authorities could come together and form a kind of a watch committee, which would not have any official power to stop a programme or anything else but could examine programmes and make representations to the Department, it would be very beneficial. I suggest that it be on the same lines as the Press Council in Britain, where they can pass judgement on a newspaper. I am not sure that they take action against it but they can pass judgement and the newspapers there take this very seriously.</P>
      <P>If we could get people who would be objective, or impartial enough to maintain that this programme was or was not good for the people, perhaps in that way we would be able to put a strong public opinion forward, which would guide the Telefís Éireann Authorities on the right road.  They are putting on a lot of material the people do not want and we have, of course, this alleged pseudo-intellectual approach to things, that you must show everything, warts and all.  For adults, I do not mind that, but we must remember that television is probably the most potent force of propaganda in the country to-day and incalculable harm can be done to young children who see these things in their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned last year some people from cross-channel who were brought on.  One guest from Britain was held up <Col N="1119" /> as a model to Irish youth, who a week after appearing on a programme here was involved in a most sordid London scandal.  I suggest that Telefís Éireann must have known about that before they put her on.  I am not suggesting our youth are any better than the youth of England, Scotland, Wales or France, but at least let us keep standards our young people can look up to and not bring over people from cross-channel whose artistic talent is very low indeed.</P>
    <P>Last year when I spoke on this Estimate, I mentioned the advertisements. Deputy Esmonde may like the advertisements&mdash;I will admit that the one he likes, I like too, a tea advertisement&mdash; but we have the advertisements for alcohol and smoking also.  Indeed, on the topic of smoking, I may be a bit hypocritical because I do smoke, but I do not drink.  However, at the present time I do think that both of these advertisements should be cut down to the minimum.  The money spent on them must be colossal and I look forward to the day when Telefís Éireann will not be a semi-commercial station, when there will be no advertisements shown but all good programmes.</P>
    <P>I look at one outside station for the simple reason that their programmes are not broken every few minutes for an advertisement for some type of soap powder, whisky or some brand of cigarettes.  Last year it was mentioned that the Telefís Éireann authorities would cut down on the number of advertisements for such products as soap powders, not that I have anything against soap powders or detergents, but from the accents of the people advertising them, the questions they were asked <i>et cetera,</i> they could have been asked in Leeds, Glasgow or Bradford.  I think they were prepared for provincial towns in Britain and we were included amongst the provincial towns of Britain.  The controller or the Telefís Éireann Authority should be most careful on these issues because if the job is not done, then we must consider changing the whole set-up to ensure that the national television service will serve the needs of the people.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann is often criticised on <Col N="1120" /> political grounds.  In looking at this, I am trying to be impartial.  The Fine Gael Árd Fheis was on and some people on this side of the House would say that Fine Gael got too much time. However, if we look at this carefully, I think people on this side of the House, in Fine Gael or in the Labour Party, will agree, if they try to be fair, that, while Telefís Éireann may err for a half minute or for ten seconds, on the whole they endeavour to be fair. People feel that they favour the Party they do not favour but on the whole they try to be objective and fair.  I was engaged in a public controversy at one time and on three occasions the other side was given an opportunity but I was never given any chance to speak for my side.  I could well have protested but I did not.  I say that because I think that on the opposite Benches they think we on this side of the House get the best from Telefís Éireann, but that is not true.  Deputy O'Higgins does not believe me but I assure him that from my point of view they are absolutely impartial.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Party were naturally taken up with that election and why should they not be, but they were suspicious.  However, if they examined it impartially and honestly, they would find there was no bias.  It is easy to castigate Telefís Éireann and I am trying to be fair.  At the same time, I will say that though they did many great things since they started, they did some very foolish things.  They must remember that not all our people are intellectuals nor do we want to be what they describe as intellectuals.  They should get down to fundamentals and serve the people with what they want.  Our people's tastes are fairly high in standard.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The last time I spoke on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, it was, primarily, in any event, in connection with the interference which had taken place with Telefís Éireann by the then Minister for Agriculture. I want to say a few words with regard to the further interference, as I regard it, by the Taoiseach in relation to the proposal to send a film group to Vietnam.  Deputy Moore has referred to this matter.  I feel that possibly he has missed the point of the criticism which has been directed against the Government in this connection.  Deputy Moore made the case, which was very much the same kind of case as was made by the Taoiseach when challenged about the matter in the House, that in any event the ordinary news programmes of the television service carry plenty about Vietnam and that there is no scarcity of news regarding the war there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore made some reference to anti-Americanism.  I am not clear in my mind whether that reference was directed against those in Telefís Éireann who proposed to sponsor the sending of a camera team to Vietnam or whether it was directed against the presumably irate constituents of Deputy Moore who apparently wrote to him on the topic.  I want to make the point that any question of anti-Americanism is quite irrelevant to this issue.  It is also quite irrelevant to this issue whether or not the ordinary television news programme carry continual reference to Vietnam or not.  Those matters are quite irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the merits of the proposal to send a team to Vietnam that are in question.  I do not pretend to know&mdash;I am not sufficiently expert in this field &mdash;anything about the actual merits of the question.  I do not know whether it was a good proposal from an economic or from a financial point of view to send out a camera team; I do not know whether or not results achieved by <Col N="1122" /> sending out a camera team from this country would be such that they would justify the expense involved.  However, as I say, all this is beside the point. What happened here, as I see the situation, is that the authorities of the television service decided on a particular course of action and on a particular course of action which they were entitled to decide on under the terms of the Act of Parliament which established that Authority and that, having decided on that particular course of action, they were deflected from it by the direct intervention of the Head of the Government.</P>
    <P>It is beyond dispute that the Taoiseach did not intervene in the way laid down in the Broadcasting Authority Act of 1960 but that he used his influence as Taoiseach to dissuade Radio Telefís Éireann from sending out this camera team to report on events in Vietnam.  I want to put this point of view to the Minister, that the Minister sitting opposite me is the proper person to take up these matters with Telefís Éireann, and no one else, and that there is a method laid down, a procedure laid down, by an Act of Parliament by which he can intervene if intervention by the Government is necessary.  That particular method was not adopted in this case nor was that method adopted in the previous case when the Minister for Finance, who was then Minister for Agriculture, lifted the telephone and got in touch with Telefís Éireann in connection with a particular news programme.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that this type of interference, no matter what motivates it, should be tolerated.  I do not think it should be tolerated by the Television Authority and I think the sooner Telefís Éireann tell one or other of the Ministers to go to blazes, the better the people will like it and the more the people will feel that they have independence in the Authority established by this House which is maintained and subsidised by the people.  I do not think the question of the merits enter into it but the Taoiseach argued it out in this House on the question of merits.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment make the case <Col N="1123" /> that he deliberately endeavoured to mislead the House.  I think that he or whoever was responsible for briefing him did not do his homework in connection with this, because the case was made to the House&mdash;and I will quote the Taoiseach, in case it might be suggested that I am putting any slant on what he said&mdash;by the Taoiseach that one of the reasons why this venture should be stopped was that it could give a wrong impression to the world.  Here we had a semi-State body, and possibly it might be misrepresented and misinterpreted. The manner in which it might be misrepresented according to the case the Taoiseach made, as I understand it, was that the Television Authority proposed to sell this film abroad, and in that way we would have no control over its fate, over its showing, over its presentation, when it was sold abroad.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will concede to me that I am not overpainting the picture presented by the Taoiseach.  In case they do not concede that to me, I want to refer to the Official Report of the Dáil Debates of 20th April, 1967.  At columns 2156 and 2157, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>The Radio Telefís Éireann Authority is, as we describe it here, a semi-State body.  If a team representing Radio Telefís Éireann went to Vietnam, the peculiar character of a semi-State body, as we know it, would well be misinterpreted all over the world.  I understand that it was the intention of RTE to sell whatever film or coverage this team might have had on Vietnam, presumably to any customer who would come along and offer to buy it. These customers might well be people who had a particular interest, opposed, perhaps, to one side or the other, and there was a great danger that the people in those countries who might buy that film would present the news or whatever items RTE would have given them in a slanted way.  As I said, there is a danger of the misinterpretations of the functions of a semi-State body <Col N="1124" /><i>vis-à-vis</i> the governments in other countries in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Again at column 2159 of the same volume, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>There was a difficulty involved that in visiting one side or the other of the area of conflict, as the Minister for External Affairs has said, they could easily have been brought on a conducted tour.  Even allowing for all that, if this news were sold to other countries, we would have no control over the manner of its presentation, and, as the Deputy knows well, these things can be cut and edited to suit a particular public, once the intention was to sell it, and that was put forward as a means of offsetting the very high cost involved in the mission.</P>
    <P>That was the case made by the Taoiseach. At first hand, that seemed to be a reasonable case, but the fact of the matter is&mdash;and I invite the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to check on this and to contradict me if I am wrong&mdash;that it is laid down in section 16 of the Act which established this Broadcasting Authority, the 1960 Act, that RTE cannot sell anything by way of oral or visual material without the consent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  So, all this case that was built up against allowing this film to be made because we could be misrepresented abroad, because there was a danger of embarrassing the Government if this film were bought abroad and edited and given a slant, is so much rubbish when you consider that it could not be done without the consent of the Government through the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that any sale of this film or any other material by the Television Authority can be made only with the consent of the Minister.  If it was made with the consent of the Minister, is it not ridiculous to be talking about embarrassing the Government? If the Minister gave his consent to a particular sale in advance without knowing how the material would be used, this is a matter that should be investigated.  I do not think it should be done.  If the Government are acting in that way, they are acting irresponsibly and they are accountable to this House for it.  The Minister has a function in relation to RTE under the Act, and this function must be exercised by him in a responsible manner, in the interests of the people of this country, interests of which he is the custodian.</P>
      <P>However, the point I want to make is that any question of sale was dependent on the consent of the Minister. That being so, it is complete nonsense to make the case that was made here and that seemed to be an effective case at the time.  I want to say this also.  Again I am open to correction if I am wrong&mdash;I have not got the Act in front of me.  As I read it, the consent of the Minister is necessary for a number of things.  It is necessary in connection with the compilation, publishing, distributing, selling and exchanging of oral or visual material, but I do not think the consent of the Minister is necessary in connection with the collection of news. I think I am correct in saying that. One of the powers which the RTE Authority are given specifically in the Act is in connection with the collection of news.  There is no ministerial consent or no Government sanction necessary for the exercise of that power by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister, or the Taoiseach, or any member of the Government, wants to exercise any jurisdiction in that field, it can only be done, in my <Col N="1126" /> view, by operating the proper procedure laid down in the Act, procedure which enables the Minister to give a direction in writing to Telefís Éireann to refrain from publishing a particular programme.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government realise the extent to which people are disturbed by the action of the Taoiseach on this occasion, following fairly hot on the heels of the previous intervention by the Minister for Finance. If the Government do not realise how disturbed people are and have been about this, the sooner they begin to realise it the better.  I suggested before, and I make the suggestion again, that the time has arrived when it would be worthwhile to establish some truly independent tribunal to make specific recommendations and proposals as to the fields and to what extent intervention or interference by the Government in connection with news programmes of RTE would be justified, and if the Government do not operate the procedure that is there&mdash;they do not appear to do so as far as recent history goes and they do not appear to intend to operate the procedure that is there&mdash;such a tribunal might suggest some alternative procedure.  At any rate, Government and Opposition and the public at large should realise when and to what extent interference or intervention by the Government might be regarded as appropriate in relation to the news programme of this body.  Clearly there is confusion about it in the minds of a number of people and the sooner the position is clarified the better for everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A tribunal would have nothing to do.  There is too little interference for them to have an agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly when the Minister is replying, he will make that case.  It seems to me that the present Government Party&mdash;I say &ldquo;Party&rdquo; because there has been a change of Government without election &mdash;seem to have a very catholic view on when interference by the Government can be justified.  The former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries <Col N="1127" /> apparently thought it was justified in relation to a home item of news in connection with agriculture, and the present Taoiseach apparently thinks it is justified in connection with items of foreign news or in connection with the efforts of Telefís Éireann to equip themselves to inform the people of this country about events abroad.  They are two completely different aspects in both of which we know as a matter of record that intervention&mdash;I give you the word &ldquo;intervention&rdquo; if you do not like &ldquo;interference&rdquo;&mdash;has taken place by Government Ministers.</P>
      <P>We know the view expressed by journalistic bodies in relation to this matter.  The Minister is not unaware of the statements that appeared in the public press in that respect.  Therefore, I do not think a tribunal such as I have suggested would find themselves short of work.  Even if they were only to investigate the interventions that have already taken place, they might be able to lay down clear, definite, specific guidelines for the Government and for everyone else in relation to the areas, if any, in which Government intervention could be regarded as appropriate. I have said all I wanted to say on that subject and I do not wish to prolong my remarks on it.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies I have heard speaking in this debate have referred in one way or another to the television programmes. Some of them expressed their likes and dislikes in connection with these programmes.  I wish to say only a few words about programmes which all of us, as politicians, are interested in.  I am certainly not sufficiently an authority, or a critic, on television to express my views on many of the programmes, but all of us in the House are entitled to express our views on the political programmes.  I ask the Minister why the political programme known as &ldquo;The Hurlers on the Ditch&rdquo; was dropped or, as one newspaper put it, why were the hurlers ditched?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have our likes and dislikes with regard to the programmes.  While I probably felt just as annoyed as any Deputy from time to time listening to and seeing that programme, <Col N="1128" /> by and large I thought it was an interesting and informative programme, one that had a part to play not only in the television setup but in the general field of political interest in the country.  Whether we agreed or disagreed with particular views expressed in that programme or with the choice of topic for discussion, at least it was a programme presenting the outside point of view, the observer point of view, on politics rather than the purely political point of view of the politician himself.  So long as that programme was screened and no other political programme was on the screen, a case could justifiably be made that it was not right that people who were in the position of observers or commentators should be the only people appearing on television programmes interpreting the work that was going on in this House and in the Seanad and the work of the various political Parties.</P>
    <P>I agree that was a reasonable case to make&mdash;that it was not right that my mind or the Minister's mind should be interpreted for the public only by observers who were outside the House and the political Parties.  It is right that a case could be made, and presumably the case was made, that in relation to a number of things politicians themselves should have the right to express their viewpoints, to interpret their minds, their policies and their actions directly for the people.</P>
    <P>Instead of making some kind of balanced correction, what happened was that that programme, which I at any rate found informative and interesting even if at times annoying, was dropped completely and replaced by two other political programmes which by and large are programmes of the politicians.  One of them is, so to speak, confined to politicians and the other is not.  The other carries comment from people who are not members of political Parties or public representatives, but the pattern seems to have been set that politicians will appear on them and that a reasonable balance will be held between political viewpoints.  It seems to me it would have been reasonable to continue &ldquo;The <Col N="1129" /> Hurlers on the Ditch&rdquo; programme as such or in some modified form, thus enabling comment to be made by observers on the political scene and on political activities as they occurred in the House and outside it.</P>
    <P>At the same time, a programme which would enable the politicians themselves directly to interpret their minds, their work and their policies to the people should also have been incorporated in television programmes. I hope that the Minister will give this matter some consideration.  Both programmes are serving a useful purpose. It certainly seems to me that since RTE went in for political programmes there has been an increasing awareness among the people of the importance of politics in the country, a greater interest in political events and a critical appraisal of the work of politicians and of political parties.  That is all to the good.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Those were the principal matters I wanted to refer to in relation to this Estimate.  A view was expressed by Deputy Moore in relation to telephone kiosks.  I just want to refer to it very briefly because it is a view I hold rather strongly.  Time and again Deputies <Col N="1130" /> have the experience in this House of being told by the responsible Minister that a telephone kiosk would not be erected in such-and-such a place because it would not pay for itself, because the use made of it would not be economic.  I want to urge on the Minister that that is not the right test to be applied.  The test that should be applied in relation to the erection of a public telephone kiosk is whether or not there is need for it in the particular area, arising either because of the population in the area or because it is in an isolated place and in an emergency no other phone might be readily accessible.  A test on the grounds of needs and not on economic grounds is what is wanted here.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I have to say.  I hope the Minister will take these few remarks to heart and do his best to dissuade any of his colleagues in future from usurping his functions in relation to RTE.  That, in effect, is what happens when other Ministers, without using the machinery laid down in the Broadcasting Act, interfere or intervene in relation to RTE affairs and programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs moved his Estimate yesterday.  I wish to say that the Minister's Department is a very progressive one, going from strength to strength each pear.  It is endeavouring to give and succeeding in giving our people a better news service on radio and television, a better postal service and a better means of communication through the telephone.  In a world which is advancing fast it is hard for the Department to meet all the demands made on them and to find the money.  Everybody wants to advance at the same time.  But, in the main, nearly everybody agrees they are doing a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that in the past year more people than ever before were provided with telephones.  The Minister stated that the backlog which had been there for a few years has now been brought under control.  That is good news for anybody waiting for a telephone for a few years.  When you apply for a telephone you are told in due course <Col N="1131" /> what your yearly rent is and that you will probably have to pay five or seven years in advance.  That is not much if you are not living too far from the exchange.  But if you are living in very rural areas it can come to a lot of money.  I know of cases where people were asked to pay down from £100 to £130.  Many of those people in the rural areas are cottiers and small farmers.  None of them can do that.  I would ask the Minister would it be possible to provide some kind of group or communal kiosk, which would be held in the names of five or six people who would be responsible for the ground rent and the cost, but which would have a coin box and be open to the general public in that area.  It will be many years before some of these people can have a private phone.  There may be impediments in the way of implementing this proposal, but I would ask the Minister to look into it.  It would greatly convenience those people.  We all know how important it is to have the telephone, but it is never realised fully until somebody is ill or some animal on the farm requires attention.</P>
    <P>We have had a lot of discussion about news items and RTE programmes. We live in an age in which television is playing a big part in our lives.  The children and teenagers will quote to us what they have seen on television.  Indeed, many of them model their lives on it.  Therefore, we should be very careful about what we present to the public through the medium of television.  The television service is, in the main, very good and very enjoyable. It is impossible to satisfy all tastes but all tastes seem to be catered for.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment all those responsible for the coverage of events appertaining to the Golden Jubilee of the Rising last year.  The programmes were a great education for the younger generation.  Through the plays acted on television, they were able to appreciate the motives for the Rising.  I would suggest that there should be more plays and discussions about the history of Ireland, the glorious past <Col N="1132" /> and our struggle for independence.  It is difficult for the younger generation to realise what their forebears had to suffer.  Through the medium of television they could receive an amount of instruction in the history of the country.</P>
    <P>Of course, we all complain at times about there being too many canned programmes or too much trash displayed on the television screen.  I do not think it is too bad.  The RTE Authority aim to give more Irish plays performed by Irish artists.</P>
    <P>A great deal is heard about political programmes.  I would see no objection to television camera crews being brought into the Dáil.  It would make for better attendance.  People would be looking to see where their own representative was.  It would be no harm to give the people some idea as to how the Dáil functions.</P>
    <P>Political programmes have been broadcast from time to time.  The programme called &ldquo;The Hurlers on the Ditch&rdquo; was very enjoyable.  It was replaced by other programmes.  The programme &ldquo;Politicians&rdquo; on which there were six members of a panel and a chairman, and which ran for one hour, was rather overcrowded.  It is difficult for six persons to express their views in a restricted programme.  There is a tendency for all to be talking at the one time.  This programme was a very difficult programme to chair.  The panel has now been reduced to three members and that is an improvement.  The Opposition should realise how broadminded we are on the Government side, having regard to the fact that we have only one representative to their two.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are making a good deal of capital out of the Taoiseach's intervention to stop the visit of the RTE team to Vietnam.  I ask, in all fairness, of the Opposition, what would they be saying now if that team had gone to Vietnam.  I am sure they would be suggesting that the taxpayer was paying for a few men, whom they would call Fianna Fáil hacks, to go globe-trotting.</P>
    <P>I heard a rumour to the effect that this matter was very nearly a cause of <Col N="1133" /> division at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis.  I should not like to see that.  I should like to see them going down together.  The Taoiseach was right to intervene if it was his view and the view of the Government that this team should not go to Vietnam.  It is a catchery at the moment that politicians should be kept out of this, that and the other, that politicians should have no say in the functioning of one authority or another. Politicians are the means by which democracy works.  The Opposition may think that this Party are alone in believing that the Taoiseach was right in intervening in this matter but I noticed that last week the paper, the <i>Southern Star</i> in an editorial condemned the Fine Gael Party for sniping at the Taoiseach and the Government in regard to that matter.  If, as we are led to believe, the Government were really running RTE, we would not have had the Polish film depicting Vietnamese suffering at the hands of American barbarism.  The film was allowed to go on and nobody interfered with it.  That shows a broadminded approach.</P>
    <P>There are many other programmes which should be mentioned here.  I often watch the &ldquo;Late, Late Show&rdquo;. Sometimes only one viewpoint is presented on that programme.  Somebody is brought on who may have a chip on his shoulder about something and he is allowed to express his views.  In such cases an opposing view should be given expression.  Otherwise the programme is a good and interesting programme and is very popular.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Minister and his Department on a very successful year and wish them the best of luck in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Meaney seems to think that it is an extraordinary situation that there should be two views about the Vietnam situation.  In a Party such as ours, there is freedom, thank God, to have two views.  I have my own view and it does not coincide with what Deputy Meaney thinks.  It is one of the the times when the Government interfered that I personally think they were right.  There have been many other forms of interference and alleged interference <Col N="1134" /> by Government Ministers with which I could not have disagreed more.</P>
      <P>I had not intended to speak on this Estimate but I decided to intervene for a few moments and for a specific purpose, that is, to draw public attention to the fact that agriculture and farming now seem to be an objectionable subject with Telefís Éireann.  The time devoted to farming programmes has been seriously curtailed to the point where they have practically stopped.  This is a very serious situation in a country where agriculture is the principal industry and where approximately one-third of our people get their living from the land.  I do not have to elaborate on the importance of agriculture here.  In any case, I would be ruled out of order on this Estimate, if I were to do so.  I think the Minister has a serious obligation to see to it that the most powerful medium of communication we have in the country is fully utilised so as to ensure that the farmers get the fairest possible treatment, the fullest possible assistance, the fullest possible information and service generally.</P>
      <P>I endeavoured to raise this matter by way of Parliamentary Question and the Ceann Comhairle ruled the question out of order.  I shall not question the Ceann Comhairle's right to rule the question out of order.  I know that he had no personal reason for it, that he was merely acting in accordance with the general rules of the House.  He sent me a note saying:</P>
      <P>I regret that I have had to disallow the question addressed by you to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs regarding the time devoted to agriculture on television as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>
      <P>Not only has the Minister official responsibility but he has a real obligation to ensure that the principal industry in the country gets fair treatment on Irish television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of farming programmes.  The programme &ldquo;Cross Country&rdquo;, which was broadcast twice a week, has been dropped completely.  Three months ago there was an excellent programme &ldquo;Telefís <Col N="1135" /> Feirme&rdquo; and now that programme has been dropped and the man responsible for it and for agricultural programmes generally has resigned. One wonders just why he resigned.  I think it will be agreed by all that Justin Keating was an outstanding performer on Telefís Éireann.  Why did he resign?  I know that he loved his job and there is nothing he would prefer to be at.  Is it the question of a man not being allowed to deal with this subject fairly, fully and freely?  Is it a question of ministerial interference in the wrong way? I think it is and that it is a question of this man being directed practically not to mention farmers on farming programmes, and especially the National Farmers' Association, the biggest and the only farming organisation we have with national status.  Things have come to a poor pass if that is so.</P>
    <P>He is not the only high-level, important personality in Telefís Éireann who has resigned in recent times.  This House is entitled to know why these resignations are taking place and why there is a general air of trepidation in Telefís Éireann in case some Minister or the Government generally might be offended in the course of programmes. That is obvious to anyone who ever takes part in a programme in Telefís Éireann.  There is a first-class group of people there, and I must say I have had experience like Deputy Meaney and other people of taking part in programmes of one sort or another on Telefís Éireann and I should like to place on record my appreciation of the courtesy, kindness and consideration with which we have always been treated when we go there.  However, this general abiding fear is obvious to anybody who goes there that the Government point of view must be kept uppermost and that whatever happens in the programme, nothing must be said to offend a Government Minister or Government policy.  That is interference of the worst possible type and it is objectionable.</P>
    <P>There are all sorts of accusations going around the place about ministerial interference, and one which I should like the Minister to answer when he is replying is this: it has been <Col N="1136" /> said that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs gave an instruction, a verbal instruction not a written one, that the name of the National Farmers' Association should not be mentioned on Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>There has been a great deal of criticism of the Government in the past few weeks, and the idea that Telefís Éireann is under some sort of threat is nonsense, and the Deputy knows it well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not know it well, and he is not convinced there is not an undue amount of interference with Telefís Éireann and with people in high places there.  That is something the Government should drop and drop very soon, because if they do not, they will burst Telefís Éireann and they will have no people working there with independent minds and outlook.  It would be a great shame if we reached that point because, as I said before, we have excellent people there.  A third farming programme &ldquo;On the Land&rdquo; was dropped last Sunday week and no reason was given for dropping it.  It was on again last Sunday, but I understand it is due to be stopped completely in June.  I should like the Minister to explain why farming is now an objectionable subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall quote, if I may from <i>The Farmers Journal:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changed position of farming <Col N="1137" /> with regard to our national television station is one of the more disquieting developments of recent weeks.  The agricultural arm of television is being steadily pruned and the time switched to other programmes. This might be fobbed off as a seasonal rest, but it has not happened to the same extent in other summer seasons nor can it be justified within a station that caters for a predominantly farming community.</P>
    <P>It goes further.  It is a long statement and perhaps it is not fair to give it to the House, but I think it indicates quite clearly that what the Minister says is not absolutely true, that this is the usual seasonal slackening off in farming programmes.  Soon farming will not be mentioned at all on Telefís Éireann, and in a country like this where agriculture is so important and where we had such excellent programmes as &ldquo;Telefís Feirme&rdquo; bringing out to the people in all parts of the country such an enormous amount of important information, the Minister has a serious obligation to see that this programme is restored and that those people who are responsible for farming programmes in Telefís Éireann are given a free hand and given a fair amount of time to do justice to the subject.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney referred to the political programmes, and it is obvious that he did not like his experience when there were six people on the programme.  I did not like it either. However, he seemed to give the impression that it was only people from this side of the House who were hogging it.  All I can say is that whenever I tried to hog, it, the chairman of these programmes made sure that the Government got more than their fair share.  It was quite an impossible task for a chairman to control six politicians all wanting to have their viewpoint made known within an hour.  I am glad the number has been reduced to three.  Unfortunately, I do not know what the change looks like because I never seem to be at home to see any programme except perhaps on a Sunday, when I have an <Col N="1138" /> occasional opportunity.  I believe these political programmes are appreciated and that they should be continued.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins spoke about &ldquo;The Hurlers on the Ditch.&rdquo; I saw this programme on a number of occasions because it used to take place very late at night, and it was a worthwhile programme.  It is right that politicians should be criticised from time to time by political observers, and it is a good thing for the politicians.  If it does nothing else, it arouses an interest in politics generally in the country.</P>
    <P>I had an experience recently that surprises me.  I was asked to speak about politics to a group of boys in the higher classes in a secondary school.  I know that at their age there was nothing further from my mind than politics.  People of that age could not care less about politics or politicians. This school invites a number of people on one night, perhaps every month or every two months, to talk about careers of one sort or another. They invited a number on the same night, but the only person who spoke and of whom the people asked questions, and a considerable number of questions, was the politician.  It is obvious that television has brought politics and politicians into the homes of the people and it has at least given boys, at an early age, an interest in politics, and some day perhaps they will know how to vote intelligently. That is one good thing that television has done for politics, and there is hope for the future if they get an opportunity of seeing and hearing more politicians.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I want to refer is the telephone repair service.  I was glad to see from the Minister's notes that the number of training technicians being taken in every year has increased and that he is now satisfied that he will have an adequate staff of technicians, both for installation and maintenance, in a couple of years.  The standard of maintenance at the moment is, and has been for some years past, very poor.  I work in an institution.  I have no idea what it costs to keep the telephone service in that institution going but there is not a week in which we have not got somebody from the <Col N="1139" /> telephone repair service.  Some years ago we installed the most up-to-date equipment that could be got at the time. Despite that, the telephone causes endless trouble.  I wonder is there any check kept in the Post Office of the cost of repairs on individual installations because the cost must be fantastic from the point of view of the men's time?  There does not appear to be a great deal of material used.  I know these instruments are extremely sensitive and a high degree of technical skill is required in order to do a good job.  I doubt very much if in countries where the telephone service has been in operation for a longer period than it has here, countries in which there is a high standard of efficiency on the part of technicians, repairs cost anything like as much as they cost here.</P>
    <P>Nothing drives me mad so much as finding the telephone out of order every second day.  Every second time one lifts it, one hears someone else's conversation, and that in a place in which there are four lines.  It is difficult to understand why this should be.  Repairs are carried out.  They seem to be satisfactory. Then, once more, one hears a neighbour's conversation or he hears yours.  Perhaps someone comes and tells you what you got for the cattle and where you sold them.  So long as they do not hear anything worse than that one is safe enough.  Increased efficiency in the standard of repairs to telephones is an urgent matter and steps should be taken as quickly as possible to bring about that increased efficiency.</P>
    <P>Deputies, particularly Deputies representing rural constituencies, have spoken about the need for telephone kiosks in various parts of the country. We invariably, when we ask questions about such installations, get the reply that it would not be an economic proposition. There will, of course, be unreasonable demands for kiosks, but I am aware of a number of cases in which a kiosk is well justified on social grounds.  If the suggested kiosk is not an economic proposition from the point of view of the Department, the answer invariably is &ldquo;No&rdquo;, no matter what the need is.  In the case of a national <Col N="1140" /> service like this, economics should not be the only yardstick.  The Minister makes no pretence that there is any other yardstick: it is uneconomic.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the number and the quality of post offices, with particular reference to the post office service in the Ballyfermot area.  There are only two post offices in that area. It is a predominantly workingclass area and tremendous use is made of the post offices there.  On certain days of the week one sees long queues.  That is the position when social welfare benefits are being collected.  There is a strong case to be made for introducing a different system for the payment of social welfare benefits.  The only other solution would be to increase the number of post offices. It is just not good enough to have poor people standing in the rain, queuing for long periods, simply because we want to confine this business in that densely populated area to two inadequate post offices.  Something must be done.</P>
    <P>Again, in relation to post offices, all over County Dublin we are suffering growing pains as a result of rapid development.  No attempt is made to enlarge what was the village post office to cater for the needs of the new community.  There is grave need for a survey to find out needs.  At the moment a survey is taking place in relation to post-primary educational needs.  That was long overdue because in that respect we had the same inadequacies as we have in the post offices, inadequacies of accommodation, location and so on.  A survey will have to be carried out to find out what the needs are.  It is only when the Department has been bowled over with endless complaints that any move is made to improve the post office service.</P>
    <P>I am glad the machines for the vending of books of stamps are doing well.  We were plugging the installation of these machines for years.  It is only right that they should be provided. Indeed, they should have been provided much sooner.</P>
    <P>With regard to deposits, I notice the deposits were a good deal lower <Col N="1141" /> than the withdrawals in 1966.  That is an unhealthy symptom.  It is obvious now that the increase of one per cent in the interest rate has not been a sufficient inducement.  It does not seem to have had the desired effect.  The situation should be examined to see if something can be done to make it more attractive for the small depositor to increase his savings.</P>
    <P>I want to say something now about temporary postmen who are temporary all their lives and who retire with nothing but the old age pension.  A case has been made for the provision of some form of pension for these men, who are described as temporary but who are, in fact, really permanent. In my opinion there is an unanswerable case.  Something will have to be done.  These men are out in all weathers.  In my experience, the motorisation of the post has not brought a better service in most of the areas in which it has been introduced.  The van has to cover a much wider area and some people are now getting their post at one o'clock, whereas the man on the bicycle delivered it at eight o'clock or nine o'clock in the morning.  Added to that, motorisation has put more people out of work.</P>
    <P>There was a disturbing suggestion by the Minister that television licence fees would have to be increased.  The cost at the moment is hefty enough. The greatest density of television sets occurs in workingclass areas.  These people are entitled to this amenity and we should not make it more difficult for them to enjoy it.  They work hard and when they go home in the evening and over the weekend they are entitled to this service.  Even if there is to be some element of social service in it, it should, I think, nevertheless be provided.</P>
    <P>That is really all I have to say but I would again ask the Minister to see to it that Irish agriculture and Irish farming gets the place on Irish television to which it is entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister and his officials on the progress of the modernisation programme of the Department within <Col N="1142" /> the past few months.  My town of Mallow was one of the first selected for the automatic system and, while the move was fairly vigorously resisted by the people of the town at the start in so far as it affected quite a number of staff and caused redundancy, the inevitability of automation was accepted and the people are now very pleased with the new system.  Requests have been made to have the automatic system extended to the adjoining areas of Kanturk and Newmarket.  I would ask the Minister to take note of the fact that there are approximately 420 subscribers in a concentrated area there.  I sincerely hope that, in the next move for expansion of modernisation, this area will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>As I said, quite a number of employees in our town lost employment as a result of the introduction of the automatic telephone service.  I urge the Minister to have regard to this factor in the replacement of skilled officials.  A number of male officials will be appointed to look after the automatic system.  In so far as possible I think these should be based in Mallow.  Furthermore, we have a modern switchboard and, should the need for training staff arise, I appeal for consideration.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Meaney and Deputy Clinton, I feel that rural areas are not getting the type of telephone service they deserve.  I have in mind, particularly, small villages and, indeed, villages that are not so small, where the only type of telephone service available is within the post office. The post office closes at 5.30 p.m., or whatever the time may be, and the public telephone service is cut away from the people of the area from that time until the post office opens on the next weekday morning.  To my mind, that is not at all satisfactory.  During the hours of nightfall, invariably a telephone service is most badly needed. I appeal to the Minister to have strong regard to this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Meaney mentioned&mdash;indeed. I made a submission about the matter to the Department&mdash;the erection of a telephone kiosk in a rural area thickly populated with smallholders.  I can say <Col N="1143" /> with certainty that most of those people will not be in a position to install a telephone service for quite a number of years.  I would ask the Minister and his Department to reconsider the suggestion on the lines recommended by Deputy Meaney, that is, that a number of householders in the area would be made responsible for the upkeep and the maintenance of whatever supervision of the kiosk would be necessary. I can assure him that the rural people of Ireland will not in any way abuse that type of service.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal at length with television, because, quite frankly, I do not see very much of it.  However, judging by the comments of people on the Opposition benches, it would appear that they are specialists in television.  That being so, I doubt if they pay full attention to their duties as public representatives, that is, with the exception of Deputy Clinton and Deputy O'Higgins.  The one point I want to make about television is that we cannot see it properly in parts of our constituency.  Unfortunately, we have a few dark spots there that are still substandard in television reception. I refer chiefly to the areas between Ballyhooley and Fermoy.  The people in those places have been paying as much for their television reception and service as anybody else and, up to now, they have had to endure hopeless television-reception. I would ask the Minister to make a particular note of that. I appreciate that improvements of this nature are costly.  Nevertheless, these people are entitled to as good a service as the other people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude my few simple remarks, I should like to pay a special tribute to Telefís Éireann.  In my belief the standard and quality of the programmes are as good as its resources permit.  Possibly we could have very expensive programmes, top-class programmes from abroad, but they would cost a lot of money and, there again, we would have a clamour from people who are always anxious to criticise these things.  I should especially like to compliment the coverage <Col N="1144" /> by Telefís Éireann of the 1916 Commemoration last year.  They did a very comprehensive job and, thanks to them, our young people now have a better knowledge and appreciation of the efforts of the men of 50 years ago to achieve the freedom of Ireland than would have been possible through any other medium of communication.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak, first, about rural postmen, particularly auxiliary postmen.  I would ask the Minister and his Parliamentary Secreretary to bear in mind that they are a section of our people who, down through the years, have had a very difficult job, as, indeed, they still have. The rural area, particularly in a mountainous region, is much more difficult for the postman than most people appreciate.  Anybody who has had experience&mdash;as I have had myself&mdash;of house to house canvassing in rural areas will appreciate that many homes that have to be served by the rural postman have not even a road to the door.  It is true that we have many more tarred roads in the country now than heretofore and that, every year, additional mileage is added, but my sympathy lies with the older man who has served the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the people so very well for so long a period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind a man in my area whom I remember when I was a young lad going to national school, and he was then at an advanced age.  As I drove through Foxford a couple of evenings ago, I saw that man still delivering letters around the town.  He must be close on 80 now.  That man will probably try to keep going until he drops because he realises he has nothing to get except his weekly pay packet.  After that, it is goodbye and to blazes with him.  That man cycled a distance of six miles to a place called Callow and then four miles to Attymachugh over mountainous territory. There are many such people but because he is local to me, I have him in mind particularly.  As I say, there are many such people throughout the country and it would not take very much to pension them off and give <Col N="1145" /> them what they are entitled to.  It is the duty of the Minister and his Department to look after these people.  It is a poor headline for the Department to set otherwise.</P>
    <P>The younger postmen who serve in the rural areas, particularly in the mountainous areas, are entitled to better rates of pay than men in, say, the midlands where there are fewer mountains and the going is easier and where there is less trouble delivering the post and parcels from door to door. A special case can be made for a special rate of pay for those working in the mountainous regions.  It should be remembered that in these mountainous regions there is the added burden of gift parcels to be delivered at Christmas and at other times of the year.  This does not apply so much outside these areas but it does in the West where you have so much migration and emigration and many of the family are away from home.  Surely this type of case is entitled to better treatment.  For instance, the man I mentioned must have given 60 years of his life to working for the Department. Such cases should be investigated and should receive special treatment.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the telephone system has been improved and modernised down through the years and there have been many improvements since I first came in here in 1951.  Today many areas are served by the telephone system which were not served then.  I should like to pay tribute to the staffs in post offices in our small towns for the very efficient way in which they handle telephone calls.  Sometimes when there are delays&mdash;and there are delays particularly from Ballina, Foxford and Swinford and some of the other western towns&mdash;people lose their tempers and give out to the person in the exchange but generally speaking, the people in the exchanges show great patience and co-operate in every way they can.  However, it is a strange fact &mdash;or is it strange?&mdash;that in regard to the telephone system, as in other matters, the West always seems to be selected for procrastination.  Ballina is still waiting for its automatic system. I heard Deputy Crowley talk about the up-to-date equipment in Mallow. <Col N="1146" /> Naturally it would go to Cork, or Galway or Limerick, but Ballina would at all times be last on the list.</P>
    <P>I have had a telephone in my home since 1938 and I use it for business purposes and the same lines as were used in 1938 when it was installed are still there.  The equipment has not been changed; the poles are the same poles as were used then, unless one of them was broken in a storm.  In my opinion, the equipment used then was equipment that was taken from Cork, Limerick, or perhaps Dublin, and was brought down to the mugs in the West. I must say that when we have had breakdowns in the area if we could get through to the linesmen, they were always quick on the job and they were not too worried about working for an extra half hour or so.  You do find that give and take from the officials of the Department in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I know of a case in Foxford where equipment was installed in a certain business house and it turned out to be equipment which had originally been installed in Limerick.  I have this information from a most reliable authority, from a man who has retired from the Department, and he recognised the equipment when he saw it again after about 40 years.  This proves the point I have been making.  I am convinced, and I have made this point on more than one occasion, that we must have imported a lot of second-hand equipment some time ago and installed it in certain areas.  Deputy Clinton said that the men who repair equipment seem to be in his place of business very frequently.  It is a great waste on the part of the Department that they should be installing inferior equipment.  It is like the secondhand car which is ten or 12 years old and which is in the garage every other week, so that the bills mount up. Deputy Clinton was wondering what was the extra cost involved and the waste of time in using that type of equipment.  It strikes me as being bad economics to be installing out-dated equipment in this day and age.  I appeal to the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to see that Ballina will be given the automatic telephone system at the earliest possible moment and <Col N="1147" /> thus try to make the west of Ireland as up-to-date as other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Like some other Deputies, I do not always have the time to look at television programmes, as frequently I am in the House or engaged on political matters and so on, but generally speaking, I like television programmes and I have seen a lot of them.  Naturally, like all politicians, whenever there is a political programme, I like to see it. I regret that the programme &ldquo;The Hurlers on the Ditch&rdquo; was discontinued. I can assure you I never got any votes from it and on any occasion on which I listened to it I never got any mention, nor did I want one, but I thought it was a fair and honest expression by men detached from politics.  It would please the people if that programme were re-introduced. I hold no brief for anybody in the programme.  I think it so happened that two Mayomen were in that programme representing different papers. That can happen.  As a matter of fact, I think there was a third Mayoman in it from time to time.  Generally speaking, &ldquo;The Hurlers on the Ditch&rdquo;, which I watched from time to time and in which I do not think my name was ever mentioned, was a good programme and I still feel that during their time on the air their criticism was fair and honest.  Indeed, I think Irish television programmes are second to none.</P>

      <P>I happen to receive the BBC programme but not so well. Where I live I can get it at different hours but I usually do not wait very long to see what it is like. Certainly I, as one individual, would not have much time for the BBC: I think our own programmes are far better and I believe they can be made still better if more use is made of native material. Naturally, the question of cost comes into it largely.  We have some lovely programmes in the evenings, little dance bands, Irish music, competitions and so on.  I should like more of that and so, I think, would many of our <Col N="1148" /> people.  It is our own native production; it is good for our people and for our youth and in spite of the fact that it is rather early, many people tune into it.  Naturally, I suppose we must use a certain number of canned programmes so as to keep down the cost but as far as possible we should try to use more of our own people.</P>
      <P>The staff in Radio Éireann and the people who run the show deserve praise.  Many of them in the early days, when Telefís Éireann had its growing pains, undertook work of which they must have had very little experience and despite that they did a wonderful job and deserve great credit.  When commentators, political and otherwise, go far afield and come back with reports they always give fair and well-balanced viewpoints no matter where they go.  It has been said here that much political influence is in evidence and that something queer happens backstage.  It would surprise me if little things like that did not happen from time to time.  Perhaps if there was a change of Government these things would happen also.  It is too much to expect perfection.  I could well imagine that the bosses in Telefís Éireann would, as far as possible, try to put a little polish on the subject matter because of the Government in office.  To be honest, I am inclined to forgive them because I think that the same people, if the Government changed, would probably try to twist things the other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Telefís Éireann deserve every credit for the wonderful work they have done in getting the mast erected and equipment installed.  This was a great achievement.  Radio is still a very important medium and again I would like to compliment those concerned.  There are transistors all over the place now.  Sometimes it can be annoying, perhaps, at the seaside when one can hear a half-dozen of them blaring here and there and the only thing to do is to get out of the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The radio is of particular value to <Col N="1149" /> the housewife while doing her household duties in the morning and while the boss is going out to work.  There are very good lively programmes and news bulletin after news bulletin. These can be heard in the most remote parts of the country.  Even our people across the water in England are being kept well informed of what is happening here at home.  While we can understand that those sponsoring programmes with wares to sell must be given some time to have the plugs made the programmes are of a very high standard, generally speaking.  I should like to pay particular tribute to the 15 minute programme at night, &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;.  One can appreciate how hard it is to get in a little for everybody but, generally, from my own knowledge of the programme, although I seldom hear it, it is very fair and while it gives people a very limited picture it does the best it can in the time available.  It would be a good idea to extend that programme to half an hour.  It has a greater audience than most people realise.  I can speak particularly for rural homes.  After hearing &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;, everybody goes to bed. Old people switch it on, go to bed and listen to it and go to sleep afterwards. It is a very nice little tonic.</P>
    <P>Generally, reception in Mayo is quite good but I have heard complaints of poor reception in some areas of Erris and also in some parts of the Mulranny and the Achill region.  Some people in Mulranny told me that prior to the erection of the new mast at Curraune mountain reception was quite good but after erection of the mast some people were almost cut out.  I know nothing of the technicalities but that seems to be a strange thing perhaps.  I ask the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to make inquiries about these regions and see if this can be remedied.</P>
    <P>I, for one, appreciate the great service the country is getting from both television and radio.  The programmes generally are very good.  Since the Minister has now returned I shall repeat the point I made at the outset that we in the west of Ireland should <Col N="1150" /> not be regarded as third-class citizens in respect of telephone installations and modern automatic systems.  The Minister should go west for a change. I know automatic systems have been installed in Cork and Limerick and in northern areas.  I do not see why we should always be last in the West. That does not encourage the people to stay there.  There is a tremendous tourist potential in the West and the Government receive substantial sums of money from it.  Communications are a vital consideration for the tourists and for our own people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary on the precise manner in which this Estimate has been presented to the Dáil.  It is fully documented with facts and figures for the workings of the Department in the past year.  There are a few matters in his report which strike me as being well worth mentioning.  Firstly, I am glad to note even though expenditure for salaries, wages and allowances increased by over £1½ million for the coming year nonetheless the staffing, numerically, shows a reduction.  This, to my mind, proves conclusively that every effort is being made to run the Department in a businesslike manner. I am also glad to note that special attention is being given to the implementation and the organisation of work study methods and other efficiency methods in the Department. This, to my mind, should show good results before long.  It is not that I like to see fewer people working in the Department but I like to see our postal services being run in an efficient, workmanlike and businesslike manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to note that the interest rate on Savings Bank deposits was increased from 1st January from 2½ per cent to 3½ per cent and that the amount of interest exempt from tax increased from £50 to £70 per person.  It is also noted that the sales of savings certificates for 1966 amounted to £11.9 million and the repayments, including interest, amounted to £.7 million.  The principal remaining invested at the end of the year amounted to £41.6 million as compared with £35.7 million for the <Col N="1151" /> previous year.  I am also glad to note that the intake of technicians came to approximately 100 per annum and that a team of technicians, capable of handling the work of the Department is available and that we will now have fully qualified men to carry on the necessary work.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the proposal to install telephone kiosks in rural areas.  This has been the subject of much discussion throughout the country during the past few years.  We all know that the Post Office must be run in a businesslike manner and that it must pay its way.  However, I feel a case can be made for certain remote rural areas where the public telephone is now necessary.  There are some areas which are up to 48 miles away from the nearest telephone.  The telephone is often required for a doctor, a priest or a vet.  It is commonly used for calling the artificial inseminators in the summertime.</P>
    <P>The local authorities, the county councils and the urban councils, could come to our rescue regarding the provision of telephones.  I know there is provision in the Post Office Act, 1908 whereby local authorities can contribute towards the cost of telephones. The local authorities should be circularised and reminded of their functions in this matter.  I could visualise certain rural areas where the local authorities could well contribute to the annual loss incurred by the Department in providing these services.</P>
    <P>There are other areas which are tourist areas, but which are rather remote from existing telephone services. I should like to make reference to the Gap of Dunloe and the Black Valley near Killarney, which is probably eight or ten miles from Killarney where many tourists go during the summertime.  They travel on horseback through the Gap and they also do the Lakes.  There are occasional accidents and on a Saturday night, it is virtually impossible to phone for a priest or a doctor.  I am informed that very often many of those tourists wish to make certain bookings with business people and with hoteliers in the area and that <Col N="1152" /> there is much comment about the lack of telephone facilities in this area. Bord Fáilte and also the local tourist interest should be asked to contribute any loss incurred by the Department in the provision of telephone services in such areas.  The Department could well appoint a liaison officer between their Department, Bord Fáilte and the local authorities in these matters.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the motorisation of the postal services.  I agree with this policy up to a point.  I feel each case should be taken on its merits and that the Minister should move very cautiously on this line as many hardship cases could arise, having regard to the family circumstances of the temporary postmen about to be displaced.  Perhaps it would be a good policy and good business to move very cautiously in this matter.  I would like to see the Department working closely with the planning authorities in the laying of cables, and in our tourist areas particularly, the cable should be laid underground as far as possible, even though this might involve an increase in the cost.</P>
    <P>As regards Telefís Éireann, I would like to say that I am quite happy about the shows put on by the television authority.  I would feel happier still if more of our home plays and productions could be shown as I regard our artists and artistes as being among the best in the world.  I also appreciate the statement by the Minister that a number of satellite transmitters are about to be erected, including one at Caherciveen in County Kerry.  I will conclude by saying that I feel the post office staff are among the best staff in the country.  Those men and women work under very exacting conditions, many of them at counters and handling hot cash.  They give good service to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just one or two points I should like to make in connection with this Estimate.  My first point refers to auxiliary postmen. In my county, to my knowledge, there has been a laying off of a number of auxiliary postmen in the last two years due to the van replacement.  These men, especially men with many years' <Col N="1153" /> service, are at least entitled to a gratuity, such as the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Lands, pays to men who have been employed in forestry work for 15 to 20 years and over.  They are entitled to a gratuity on the basis of a year's service. Auxiliary postmen with a number of years service are entitled to a gratuity in relation to service and I would ask the Minister to have this matter investigated. These men have been devoted servants of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs down the years; they are men who have had to work in all weathers, wet or fine, delivering the post and they should certainly be recognised and given a gratuity.</P>
      <P>Permanent employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be entitled to take part in politics.  This is a democratic right they should have and I would ask the Minister&mdash;and I know for a fact that there are negotiations in train and that applications have been made to the Department about this&mdash;to allow employees of the Department to become members of any political party they choose.  It is only fair that they should have this right: Postmen should at least be entitled to join any political party they wish.</P>
      <P>I should also like to say a word about postmasters and postmistresses down the country.  Having regard especially to the reorganisation of the telephone service and the reduction in salaries, these people are not, by any means, paid enough.  Considering the amount of money they have to handle and their responsibility, they are not getting the salary they should get.  I would ask the Minister to have a particular look at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my county I know of one postmaster with 12 children and the post office, which is his sole means of livelihood, recently became automatic.  To my knowledge the reduction in his salary is considerable.  This man still has great responsibility.  He can barely exist on his present salary.  He has been looking for some time, for a part-time job to supplement his income and help him to rear his family of 12 children.  Postmasters, with their type of job and their responsibilities, <Col N="1154" /> are entitled to a substantial increase in salary.</P>
    <P>In connection with applications for installations of telephones, I should like to ask the Minister whether owners of guesthouses who are registered with the local Tourist Board have priority. In my county we have a lot of people applying for telephones.  I meet people who are registered not with Bord Fáilte but with the local Tourist Board, the south-eastern region, and I should like to know whether these people have priority in so far as a telephone service is concerned.  Certainly they are people who are doing the country justice in every way.  Guesthouse and farmhouse owners and other people are providing a service that is badly needed. In my county they are opening for business in their hundreds every year. Over the last couple of years I would say that approximately 500 to 600 farmhouses and guesthouses have been opened and I think they should get priority in so far as telephone installations are concerned.  I should like to ask the Minister, if he can, to give me some information about this.</P>
    <P>With regard to telephone kiosks, I wrote to the Parliamentary Secretary some time ago about an extra telephone kiosk for Courtown where there is chaos in the summertime.  It lasts only for three months but then there is absolute chaos in the village of Courtown which has 6 or 7 hotels, numerous guesthouses and caravan parks and there is only one telephone.  During these three months I have often seen a queue of from eight to ten people waiting to make a telephone call.  I would ask the Minister to look into this matter.  Although it might not be a paying proposition, with only three months full use, I think the people who come on holidays should at least get a service and not have to wait 20 minutes and half an hour to make a telephone call.</P>
    <P>I welcome the automatic system in Wexford.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary when it is hoped to have the Gorey service made automatic. I understand the building is almost finished but at the present time with Enniscorthy automatic and Gorey <Col N="1155" /> not automatic the telephone service is most unsatisfactory.  From the point of view of Gorey, I have found, from my own experience, that the telephone service is completely inadequate and I would ask the Minister to have the matter expedited, if at all possible.</P>
    <P>With these few remarks, Sir, I shall finish.  I should like, again, to appeal on behalf of the postmistresses and postmasters down the country.  I feel they are not being treated fairly and I would ask the Minister to have the matter investigated and give them the sympathetic consideration which they deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My main reason for rising to speak on this debate at this time is to emphasise the role of the telephone in modern business.  As a west of Ireland Deputy, I know that it is very difficult for anybody to carry on any type of business, manufacturing or otherwise, without the telephone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even the information in the Minister's introductory speech is evidence of the tremendous efficiency in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to-day and great credit is due to the people responsible for that.  But, I come to a more modern innovation in the telephone system, one which is of the utmost benefit to manufacturers and others involved in building. I refer, of course, to the Telex system.  I have a particular grouse against the Department in regard to the manner in which they assess charges to rural Telex subscribers.  It operates directly against rural business people.  There is a standard rental charge of £160 per annum.  This covers the provision and maintenance of the teleprinter equipment, a charge which applies within a ten mile radius of Dublin city.  If you reside, or if your business is within ten to 55 miles of Dublin, there is an additional charge of £1 10s. for each mile over the ten.  If you are further away&mdash; like people in Galway&mdash;over 55 miles, there is a charge of £1 for each additional mile, which, in the case of a place like Galway, means that the <Col N="1156" /> rental alone on your Telex system is approximately £238 to £240 per annum.</P>
    <P>This equipment is becoming more essential each year in business; there is a greater movement among the manufacturers, a greater air of competition, a greater necessity to be on the ball, to use a rather crude expression, and the Telex provides this immediate contact with potential customers and agents in other countries. I do not see why this system in this country should be geared specially to suit those who subscribe to it in the Dublin area.  There are now, I should imagine, well over 280 subscribers in Dublin city, out of a total of 430 for the whole country.  Naturally enough, Dublin would have a much greater number of subscribers than anywhere else, because of its size, but if one were to investigate the type of people we are facilitating, to a large extent, they are the people who are setting up here with no stake in this country, who set up purely as importers, who import goods from foreign countries and who can do so most efficiently through the use of this Telex system, which we are providing for them at a cheaper rate than we provide for, say, a man who goes to the west of Ireland to provide employment there and who has to pay through the nose for it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to go into this matter very thoroughly.  I have made certain representations and the Minister promised me he would look into the situation but I feel that this is an opportune time to bring it up again.  We have many potential subscribers in the West who, if the charge was the same as it is in Dublin, £160, would instal this equipment, renting it from the Department, but to ask them to subscribe £240 per annum and, on top of that, to pay, the ordinary charge on usage, is just a little too much.</P>
    <P>It is becoming more and more essential to keep in daily contact with sales outlets, particularly in the case of small firms who can get in touch with larger units in England.  I do know that in certain cases the larger firms <Col N="1157" /> in England are not interested in small orders, which they could pass on to firms in the west of Ireland, but they would have to telephone through to them to get the order confirmed, if they were to do so.  The only way they can do that, if the manufacturer in the west of Ireland has not got Telex, is to make a phone call which could cost them £2 and, at the rate of £2 per effort, it is something in which they would not be interested.  This type of thing may seem a little exaggerated but when a manufacturer finds himself in this type of position, one appreciates the advantage it would be to him to have Telex at his disposal.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters to which I might refer, now that I am on my feet.  I have, on occasion, during the course of my duties as a representative, come across certain instances where employees of the Department, upon retirement, had to wait a very long time before the gratuity and the life pension was paid to them.  I understand delays of well over six months are not unusual.  I find this very difficult to understand, especially in the case of a Department which is so efficient and strives so much for greater efficiency in its day to day operations.  How it could treat its loyal staff on retirement in such a manner is something which is certainly out of character with its ordinary workings.  I know there may be difficulties in assessing the gratuities but it is well known, in advance, of the date of retirement and I think these things could be assessed before the actual date.  Certainly, the failure to pay the pension for six months is a very great hardship on a man who finds he has no income whatsoever after his retirement.  This is something I know the unions have brought to the notice of the Department, something I should like to air here and something I should like the Minister to look into, because it would be a nice thing, after a lifelong service, if a small matter like that were not allowed to enter into the relationship between employer and employee.  It is a good thing to make sure that everything possible can be done for a man on his retirement and that he should not be forgotten <Col N="1158" /> just because he will not be turning up the following Monday morning to work for the Department.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I understand has been raised by my colleague, Deputy Geoghegan, is the question of television reception in Connemara. I am not in this House very long but this, to me, is becoming a hardy annual.  We do know we can expect black spots throughout the country&mdash; this was clearly stated when the television service was set up&mdash;but it has been set up quite a long time now and I feel we could get round to it just a little more quickly.  In mentioning this, it would be unfair of me if I did not pay a certain tribute or convey thanks to the Department for the efforts they made last year, after this matter had been raised here.  I know that then two men from Telefís Éireann actually went to Connemara and did an on-the-spot survey of the television reception in the Clifden area. I met these gentlemen; they informed me that something would be done, but they could not say when.  They hoped it would not be too long away, as they agreed that the reception was diabolical in that area.  I would appeal to the Minister to do something about it in this coming year.  Then he will not have Deputy Geoghegan and Deputy Molloy getting up here to raise this hardy annual next year, please God, if we are all alive.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I think should be mentioned&mdash;certainly I should like to hear the Minister's comments on it; it has been aired publicly recently. I suppose arising out of the British Government's decision to do exactly what I am about to suggest&mdash;is the desirability of investigating the possibility of manufacturing our own telephone equipment.  The import figures of telephone equipment, especially the ordinary simple parts which we could manufacture in this country are very substantial.  They run into millions of pounds.  We are attracting other manufacturers to come in here; yet we continue with the importation of large quantities of equipment at a high value.  Knowing how thorough the Minister is, I am sure he must have gone into the economics of this possibility <Col N="1159" /> but I should like to hear him refer to it in his reply.</P>
    <P>Another matter which caused me some concern during the past year was to discover that the widows of employees of the Department who had died were not terribly well looked after, if the employee's salary was in excess of the social welfare figure, which is now £1,200.  I suggest to the Minister that this is something which we certainly cannot be proud of.  We should make some effort to see that for any employee of the Department who is not contributing to the general social welfare fund, another fund should be started up so that these people will not be left to the mercy of the non-contributory pension if they pass away and leave a wife and young children. This is a very difficult position for any young woman to find herself in.  I have come across a certain number of these cases in the past two years and, as I said on a previous occasion here, I felt completely helpless and was rather depressed that I could not be of assistance in extreme cases of hardship such as this.  The unions should press for this and try to get a better deal for all workers, not just those who subscribe to the welfare fund.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt, I understand, made some critical, if amusing, remarks here today about the programme &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;.  He complained about the manner in which certain Deputies are treated in this programme.  Of course, Deputy O'Hara from Mayo, who spoke before me, had every praise in the world for this programme.  No doubt he would, being from the Fine Gael benches.  I am sure the Labour Party had no complaints about it either.  If anybody sat down with a stopwatch and took note of the length of time given to Opposition speakers, he would find that the number of Opposition Deputies mentioned in this programme each night is quite in excess of the number of Government speakers who are mentioned.  I think that all his talk about Fianna Fáil having greater access and getting greater publicity from the mass media in this country is a lot of bull.  It is only a matter of sitting down and <Col N="1160" /> working it out for oneself.  It is quite obvious to anybody that it is not all one-sided, certainly not in this programme. It has been brought to my notice on several occasions.  I know people who have, in fact, made a study of it and the evidence they came up with was that the Opposition were doing terribly well on it.  I have not any personal complaint and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is just something I mention in passing.</P>
      <P>Another matter I would like to complain about, and I think Deputy O'Hara was somewhat on the same line, is this matter of passing off all the old equipment down to the west of Ireland.  This is difficult to understand and rather disheartening.  In the West we are a proud people and we do not like to get the second-class stuff.  It is difficult to understand how second-hand equipment can be kept in stock.  The latest models can be installed along the east coast and yet when we apply in the West, we get something which has been repaired or something that has been in stock for quite some time.  I know about this and I am not bringing it up in a light manner.  I am very serious about this as I feel there should be fairer distribution of equipment.</P>
      <P>I am referring in particular to switchboards.  Many people in my constituency had this stuff installed recently and it did not last very long.  They were told by the lads who were installing it that they did not expect it to work for very long because it was a long time in store, that all the new equipment was being used in Dublin and that they were getting all the rubbish to be installed down in the West. That may seem a bit farfetched but I am sure the Minister will look into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One last thing I would like to ask the Minister.  I want to make a special appeal to him to make the post office in Oranmore, County Galway, automatic. This little village has grown at a tremendous rate in the past five or six years.  They now have in the village two very large factories, something they did not have five or six years ago. <Col N="1161" /> Those factories are employing nearly 200 men between them.  The post office was installed to meet the requirements of three subscribers.  I have not got the exact number of subscribers now in the village but I know the number has risen to a very high figure.  There has been a transformation in the village.  It it only seven miles from the city and it is felt that automation should be introduced there at an early date.  The people who operate the post office are run off their feet and do not know where to turn.  They cannot relax because the telephone keeps ringing and they have to keep plugging in and speaking in a nice, happy voice and pretending everything is all right, but it is a terrible strain.  I mentioned it already to the Minister and I appeal again to him to arrange for the installation of an automatic telephone system at that post office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be failing in my duty as a public representative if I did not add my voice to the voices of the other Members in crying out for a better deal for the auxiliary postmen, night telephonists and many other sections of postal workers who have been exploited for so long by various Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs.  It is a wonder to me that the heart-rending appeals of Deputies from all parts of this House, not merely on this year's Estimate, but going back over a long number of years, representing, I believe, the consensus of opinion in this House, that the exploitation of the auxiliary postmen ought not to go on any longer have remained unheard, it would seem, by the various Ministers.  Why these pleas should have fallen on deaf ears is extremely difficult to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been unrest among various sections of the Minister's Department in recent years.  We have, in fact, seen strikes, sit-downs, parades, even in the vicinity of this House.  We have seen certain sections of the employees of this Department, particularly the night telephonists, imprisoned by reason of their having to take a stand against the slave wages they were receiving from this Department.  This House may not be really aware that up to a very short time ago night telephonists <Col N="1162" /> were expected to work for as miserable a pittance as 2/6 an hour. These men and women were obliged to work two weeks in one, to work upwards of 50, 60 and 80 hours a week, in order to secure something tantamount to a living wage at that time. The lowliest paid in our society were receiving much in excess of this miserable 2/6d.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why the word &ldquo;auxiliary&rdquo; is still in the vocabulary of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  That is something we inherited from another régime.  In all sincerity I suggest that word should be wiped out and considered to be a dirty word in the context of decent treatment for workingclass people.  Auxiliary postmen perform the same duties as appointed men.  They have the same responsibilities and duties, but nevertheless because they have not been formally appointed, they are condemned to work for low wages with no security of tenure, and no provision whatsoever in respect of pension or gratuity at the end of their days.</P>
    <P>I know auxiliary postmen in my constituency who worked for 40 years and were still termed auxiliaries.  They performed the full functions of a postman. One man, long since gone to his eternal reward, got up at 2 o'clock in the morning and wheeled a cart quite a distance to the local station, and there took control of the night mail.  That was a responsible and dangerous job during a most difficult period in our history when there was a war of independence, civil strife and political unrest.  He did this job unprotected. He took charge of quite an important consignment on each occasion and wheeled it back down the streets of the town and deposited it in the post office.  He was up the following morning at 8 o'clock.  He cycled an average of 40 miles a day delivering mail.  After his 40 years he got no thanks whatsoever.  I should say he died on the job after a short illness.  His widow and family were left completely unprotected and uncared for by the Department.</P>
    <P>Were it not for a benevolent fund <Col N="1163" /> called the Rowland Hill Trust Fund which happens to be in existence in the Department, this man's widow and family would be on the subsistence level of existence.  I want to pay a truly deserved tribute to this great benefactor, this great humanitarian, Rowland Hill.  I know not who he was or where he came from, but this fund he created for the benefit of widows and children of postmen, and particularly auxiliary postmen, has been a great boon to those widows and children down the years and has meant the difference between destitution and subsistence or existence.  This fund is still in existence.  The money is doled out in small amounts, admittedly, of perhaps £1 per week to the widows of auxiliary postmen.  Those widows are praying every day and every night for Rowland Hill because were it not for this great man who could see the contempt in which these postmen were held by the régime at that time, and which was continued under our own native régime, many of these families would be in abject poverty.</P>
    <P>Is it too late to hope that the nonsense which the Department continue to apply in respect of auxiliary postmen will end once and for all, and that we will provide some form of pension for those people at the end of their days?  The Department have been grossly unfair to this category of persons.  There is an obligation on an employer to find a full week's work, a full year's work, and a lifetime's work for his employees, and especially when the employer is a State body. There is no justification whatsoever for taking on a man and keeping him on interminably over a whole lifetime working a few hours a week.  It should have been possible for the local postmaster or the local engineer to find alternative for these men in the post office itself or somewhere else in order to give them a week's work and a week's wages.</P>
    <P>The manner in which these people have been dealt with in the past was contemptible.  I know auxiliary postmen who work a few hours per day delivering the mail.  One man has an extremely <Col N="1164" /> large family.  He receives from the Department a sum of £6 10s per week and the time required to carry out his duties is such that he cannot take on another position.  It is only by taking on some work with farmers, mainly at night, when work is available, that he is able to augment this miserable pittance. This is disgraceful treatment by a State Department which should be setting headlines for the country's employers, which should be showing us a lead in respect of co-operation with and respect for workers.  I sincerely hope that appeals for a better deal for these categories will not again fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>It is significant that fringe benefits, as they are called in the trade union movement&mdash;longer holidays, sickness and pension schemes&mdash;are becoming more and more important, even more so than wages.  The Minister will have to think in terms of providing a sick pay scheme and a pension scheme for men who have given long, loyal and devoted service to his Department. Many private firms have already done this: excellent schemes have been put into operation by the building industry, to name but one, and by many others to provide security in sickness and old age for workers.  It is a shame and a disgrace that a State Department have shown such flagrant disregard for the unfortunate workers in their control.</P>
    <P>Mark you, the people in the higher echelons of the Department, the higher civil servants, have covered themselves well, with salaries in the £2,300, £4,000 and £5,000 brackets.  They are now bent on greater efficiency.  This efficiency will be brought about by more redundancy, by further unemployment. The efficiency achieved will always be brought about at the bottom, among the lowly-paid workers, but never at the top.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister is very conscious of costs.  He indicated in his introductory statement, for instance, that it would cost about £60,000 to his Department to provide a one per cent increase in wages.  This was rather a compelling way of indicating to us that one dare not suggest improvement in the meagre standards of those people. On the other hand, without the slightest <Col N="1165" /> compunction the Minister had the audacity to tell us, so quickly after the Budget, that it is on the cards that increases in television and radio licence fees will take place.  If the Minister likes to discount that statement he may do so but I assume from his statement that such increases will occur.</P>

      <P>They will not take place in this financial year, but the Minister has in mind that increases will take place.  The Minister must realise that in any attempt to keep down his Department's costs he has a moral obligation to keep down costs in the community generally.  If it is now his intention to set out to increase the cost of licences, he is deliberately increasing the cost of living.  We already have had steep increases in prices, in regard to meat in particular despite the fall in cattle prices.  It is a well-known fact that <i>vis-à-vis</i> prices and the possible increase in radio and television licence fees, the £1 a week increase in wages granted to workers last year has now been eroded completely and the standard of living of the workingclass is falling.  Many are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet at present income scales. The Minister cannot have it both ways &mdash;on the one hand, pointing out the cost of an increase in wages and salaries and on the other, proposing to increase the cost of living by increasing licence fees.  I submit that if he wants to balance his Department's accounts, he should seek to secure any extra money needed through other channels.  It would be more appropriate to ask those wealthy employers who are utilising the time of his stations, television and radio, to pay extra for advertising time rather than to ask the masses of the people to pay increases in their licence fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy O'Leary congratulate the Minister on his approach to <Col N="1166" /> greater efficiency.  I am aware the tendency in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is towards the provision of the most costly modern devices such as computers costing thousands of pounds.  Time and motion study experts have been rampant in this Department and it was comical in the extreme to see some of these experts walking around with postmen in rural areas and cycling around with others, peeping over the ditches at various times, timing these unfortunate men on their delivery runs to see how they could reduce the time spent in delivering the post.  It is pathetic in the extreme to see money wasted in this fashion, trying to cut down the time of rural postmen.</P>
    <P>The tendency now is towards motorisation, to do away with the man walking around or cycling around with his mailbag.  I am not against efficiency.  I am no Luddite speaking from a Labour Bench.  I am aware we cannot put back the clock but I want the Minister and his Department to come down out of their ivory tower and think twice before they continue this rampage of squandermania supposedly in the interests of efficiency and to realise they are operating in an underdeveloped economy where we have a serious problem of providing jobs for our people&mdash;where continually we have more than 60,000 people unemployed and where many more thousands are forced to emigrate.  In these circumstances we cannot be justified socially in continuing to apply all those modern methods at so great a cost to our society, in the clear knowledge that they will cause further redundancy and unemployment and add to the very long queues at our employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to realise also that the numbers he will displace in his desire to economise in his Department must be counted in terms of the money they will draw from the Department of Social Welfare.  The matter must be seen in its proper context.  Where reasonable substitutes are available to replace these computers, time and motion experts and all these gimmicks, human beings <Col N="1167" /> should come first.  The Minister should be slow to create redundancy without having regard for its consequences&mdash; the signing on at the employment exchange until the man gives up in despair, perhaps, and emigrates to England.  If we had an economy here such as they have in England, where there is full or near-full employment and where these redundant men could find work around the corner, it would be all right.  Many Ministers and many of these higher civil servants seem to have lost their social conscience.  They read these fancy books and accept the views of economists writing for societies very different from ours.</P>
    <P>Some sections of our people derive much better value from television than others.  I refer to the fact that those living within the environs of Dublin, along the east coast generally and along the border are able to receive BBC and Independent Television along with Telefís Éireann.  I asked the Minister's predecessor why, if it was economically possible, should the other sections of our people be deprived of this facility. I do not see anything wrong with asking the Minister whether it is possible to extend these outside programmes to the whole country by making an agreement with the BBC whereby their programmes would be available throughout this country and Telefís Éireann programmes would be available throughout Britain.  Since we can receive the British radio here&mdash;the Light Programme, the Home Service and the Third Programme, as well as Radio Luxembourg&mdash;why should we not receive outside television programmes here as well?  I appreciate that the Department might envisage loss of advertising revenue, but if there were discussions between the two countries I believe it would be to our mutual advantage.</P>
    <P>I believe the many millions of Irish stock in Britain would welcome the opportunity of seeing Telefís Éireann programmes over there.  Already, perhaps the majority of our people here can receive programmes from Britain and Ulster.  I would be glad to hear the Minister elaborate on the feasibility <Col N="1168" /> of such a proposal, especially at a time when we have achieved economic integration with Britain.  Economic integration of necessity implies political integration.  There is a fusion of these two islands all over again.  In all the circumstances then, I cannot see what is fundamentally wrong about an arrangement whereby we can enjoy outside programmes both on radio and television.</P>
    <P>I must make reference to the delay in the provision of telephones.  It would seem from the Minister's statement that an improvement has taken place in this regard, but I have yet to see it in certain areas of my constituency. I am also concerned that I made specific representation to the Department to have telephones installed for three people who, in my opinion, are very important people in the community. They are national officers of my own trade union, who require the extension of the telephone from the union headquarters to their own homes.  That request has not, as yet, been granted.  I also requested some few months ago that a national officer of another trade union be given the facility of a telephone.</P>
    <P>I understand the Department have regard to certain priorities in the matter of telephone applications. Priority is given to certain people, such as priests, doctors, veterinary surgeons and others providing essential services in the community.  I submit that a trade union officer, who has the responsibility of managing the affairs of his union and who is required to keep in close contact with his branch, is a very important person.  This facility should be provided for such persons speedily to ensure that the work of the union is properly carried out and that any industrial unrest that may arise can be dealt with quickly so that, for lack of proper communication, the situation is not allowed to get out of hand with strikes ensuing.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take a special interest in the case of the three officers to whom I refer.  It is a matter of concern to them that this reasonable request for a telephone has not, as yet, been granted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> With so little time remaining to me tonight, I do not intend to go into the pros and cons of the television service, but I shall say a few words about Radio Éireann.  It is pleasant of late to realise that Radio Éireann are doing much to improve our musical tastes. While catering for the younger generation in respect of pop songs, they are <Col N="1170" /> also bringing about a better appreciation of the old songs and of classical music.</P>
    <P>Progress reported: Committee to sit again.</P>
