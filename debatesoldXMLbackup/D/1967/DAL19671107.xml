      <P>Fuair mé an sgéala seo a leanas ón gCeann Comhairle: I have received the following communication from the Ceann Comhairle:</P>

      <P>Peter O'Connell, Esq.,</P>

      <P>Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. O'Connell,</P>
      <P>Will you please acquaint Dáil Éireann that I intend to retire from the office of Ceann Comhairle as from Tuesday the 7th day of November, 1967.</P>
      <P>I would like to express my sincere appreciation of the kindness, courtesy and consideration I received from all Deputies over whose deliberations I had the privilege of presiding, during my term of office.</P>
      <P>I would also like to thank the members of the staff of Oireachtas Éireann, every one of whom gave me, on all occasions, complete, reliable and invaluable service.</P>
      <P Just="Right">I remain,</P>

      <P>I am sure I am speaking for all sides of the House when I say that it is a matter of profound regret to us that the Ceann Comhairle should have retired from that position.  During his 16 years as Ceann Comhairle, he has filled the Chair of this House with quiet distinction, <Col N="1904" /> exercising over all of us a firm but courteous restraint in the midst of even the most heated debate.  He commanded the respect of Deputies of all Parties as an authority on the rules and procedures which govern our debates and he won our complete confidence in the impartiality of his decisions on questions of order.  His links with the Chairmanship of the Dáil go back to its earlier formative years when he was Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  He has contributed in no small way to the development of our parliamentary process.</P>
      <P>Mar a dúirt mé, is cúis díomá dúinn uile go bhfuil an Ceann Comhairle ag éirí as an oifig sin.  Táimíd faoi chomaoin aige as a dhílse agus a dhúthrachtaí a chomhlíon sé dualgaisí a phost mar Ceann Comhairle agus, roimhe sin, mar Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Thuill sé meas agus muinín ó gach taobh an Tí as ucht an údarás agus an cothromas a thaispeán sé i gceannas ar dhíospóireacht, dá acrannaí a bheadh sé.  Bhí sé teann agus cineálta mar ba ghá, agus chuidigh sé go mór ar an mbealach sin le sibhialtacht i gcúrsaí Parlaiminte na tíre.</P>

      <P>In the absence of Mr. Cosgrave, Sir, who is in Cork, may I associate Fine Gael with the statements made by the Taoiseach?  We wish Deputy Patrick Hogan of Clare, as he now is, many years of health and happiness in his retirement.  Everyone knows that the office of Ceann Comhairle is one that requires unremitting attention and it is only appropriate, therefore, that in his years of retirement, he would have that relaxation and health and happiness that I know every member of this Party wishes him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like on behalf of Deputy Corish and the other members of the Labour Party to be associated with the remarks of the Taoiseach.  Deputy Hogan, during his period of office as Ceann Comhairle, did not always meet with the agreement of Members of this House but afterwards on reflection, I think all of <Col N="1905" /> us realised that he was in fact giving the exact ruling and was taking the correct attitude.  He graced the Chair with dignity and that dignity he attempted, fairly successfully, to maintain in the House.  I, too, and we in the Labour Party wish him long life and happiness and a long time representing Clare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, arising out of his discussions with the Prime Minister of Denmark and the President of the French Republic, there have been any developments concerning the application of this country to join the EEC; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether his attention has been drawn to a press statement (details supplied) <Col N="1906" /> that General de Gaulle made it clear that Britain and other countries interested in joining the Common Market should do so as associate members; and whether this was included in the text of General de Gaulle's speech at the luncheon given for him on his visit to Paris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>During my official visit to Denmark last week I had a full and useful exchange of views with the Danish Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and other Ministers on the applications of both our countries for membership of the European Economic Community.  I found that our interests and our problems in this matter closely coincided. The Danish Prime Minister and I agreed to keep in close touch on future developments.</P>
      <P>In Paris I discussed our EEC application fully with President de Gaulle, with Prime Minister Pompidou, with the Foreign Minister M. Couve de Murville and with other Ministers.  All assured me that there is no objection in principle to Ireland's accession to the European Communities and that France looks forward to the day when it will be possible for this country to become a member.  President de Gaulle and his Ministers adverted to the problems posed by the British application and, in this context, mentioned the close trading arrangements which exist between this country and Britain.  The President referred to the suggestion he had previously made in public on more than one occasion that Britain might accept some form of association with the EEC.  He inquired whether we here had given any thought to a similar approach in our case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained why Ireland's application was for membership and the importance for Ireland of simultaneous accession with Britain.  The President stated that, in the event of progress not being possible for a considerable time on the British application for membership, it might be helpful for us to have an interim arrangement with the Communities <Col N="1907" /> pending full membership.  I expressed appreciation of his offer of support and goodwill in this connection but emphasised that our application, which is at present before the Council, is for full membership and that we hoped for an early favourable response to this.</P>
    <P>I was gratified by the assurance of support for Ireland's membership of the European Communities which was given to me by President de Gaulle and by other members of his Government. I am happy to say that this helpful attitude was also reflected in the assurances I received from Prime Minister Pompidou and his Ministers in the context of our bilateral relations. M. Pompidou promised the co-operation of his Government in encouraging French investment in Ireland and in the development of our trade, tourism and cultural links.</P>
    <P>My visit to Paris completed the series of visits to the capitals of the EEC countries which began last June. The discussions which the Minister for Finance and I have had with the Governments of these six countries and with the European Economic Commission in Brussels have resulted in a greater understanding of Ireland's position and have advanced our candidature for membership of the Community. It is now clear that all six Governments and the Commission have no objection in principle to Ireland's application. For them it presents no major problems.  Moreover, they all accept the importance for Ireland of becoming a member at the same time as Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach make any request at all for any definition of what was meant by &ldquo;considerable time&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The President and the Ministers said they could not anticipate the result of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, which is due to take place on 20th November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach realise the extent of the confusion that has been created in the country by the initial contradiction, on the authority <Col N="1908" /> of the Irish Embassy in Paris, of certain reports, particulars of which I have furnished him, which I understand emanated from Reuter and <i>Agence Presse France</i>?  Are we now clearly to understand that the meaning of all the communications made by the President of France to the Taoiseach was that our application for membership of the Community should be deferred, and will be deferred until that of Great Britain has been disposed of and that it is most likely it would have to wait for the settlement of the British application for membership and that <i>ad interim</i> there is to be no special association between the Irish and the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make it clear, as I think I have already done, that President de Gaulle spoke at the luncheon to which he invited the other members of the delegation and me after my talks with him&mdash;he spoke without a script but I understand that a script was issued officially after the luncheon in French, that certain translations were made but I am not responsible for the translations that were made&mdash;and I understood General de Gaulle in the course of the luncheon to mention the movement to greater Europe, the economic necessity for a strengthening of the Six as it stands and he emphasised that Ireland should be associated with this great development. What the meaning of &ldquo;associated&rdquo; in the context is I do not know, but the word &ldquo;associated&rdquo; has a very specific meaning in the context of the Rome Treaty itself.  I mentioned in the course of my reply already that the French Government reiterated to me, the President and the Ministers to whom I spoke, the difficulties they saw in the way of opening negotiations on the British application.  They felt it was a matter for Britain itself to resolve those difficulties.  However, they as a single member in the Council of Ministers could not anticipate what the ultimate decision of the Council of Ministers would be but that they intended to maintain their attitude that negotiations should not take place until Britain took the steps they thought were necessary prior to negotiations. That does not indicate that the <Col N="1909" /> British application was not to be considered or that we are to seek accession other than what we sought.  I cannot comment further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillion Mr. Dillion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillion</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the Taoiseach's dilemma in regard to the word which has been translated as &ldquo;associated&rdquo;, in view of the fact that President de Gaulle throughout employed this word three times in the context of his remarks has the Taoiseach considered it expedient to seek clarification of what precisely the effect of the word is or are we to remain in the agreeable ambiguity that the Taoiseach thinks it means one thing while the President of France can go on thinking it is something else?  This reminds me of the glorious day of the definition of the word &ldquo;Republic&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our application is before the Council of Ministers and that application is for full membership of the Community.  The decision on the negotiation of that application has not yet been made by the Council of Ministers.  The next meeting will be on 20th November.  I am not sure that that will be a conclusive meeting or not, but if it emerges that the opening of negotiations on the British application should be delayed for a considerable time and therefore that the opening of our negotiations might be similarly delayed, then I conveyed to the President and the members of the French Government, to whom I spoke, that we would consider this other suggestion of interim arrangement with the Community, pending our accession as a full member.  I have not put it further than that so far, nor will I until I see what the decision will be in regard to our application for full membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that the Taoiseach is satisfied that the existing ambiguity should be allowed to continue until clarified by the Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting that there is ambiguity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is ambiguity in the interpretation of what was actually <Col N="1910" /> said.  It is important to know what he actually did say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the clear impression from the Taoiseach's statement, without in any way attaching any blame to him and the delegation, that the result of their visit to Paris is that it is clear that it will be a very considerable time before our application is considered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not by any means clear.  The net result so far as my visit to Paris is concerned is that the French Government welcomed our application and see no difficulty in principle in it and look forward to the day when we become full members.  Any interim arrangement to which I have referred would be in the context of ultimate accession as full members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Have I not correctly interpreted the Taoiseach as saying that while the French Government have indicated that while they have no objection to our membership, the negotiations cannot take place until the negotiations with Britain are opened? The impression the Taoiseach has certainly given to the world and to the House is that negotiations with Britain will not open for a very considerable time.  Does the Taoiseach now wish to alter that impression?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not.  I do not think I have given an impression to that effect.  I have indicated the difficulties the French Government see in the way of opening negotiations with the British Government on their application. They also intimated that it was a matter for the British to resolve those difficulties themselves, and the French Government also indicated to me that it need not take any considerable time for them to resolve these difficulties. This is a matter for themselves and I cannot press the British Government on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The impression the Taoiseach has left on me as a result of his visit to Paris is that we are further away than ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach whether consideration <Col N="1911" /> will be given jointly to the several applicants, or whether prior consideration will be given to the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Esmonde has in mind the applications for membership or discussions on the applications subsequently. The Commission recommended to the Council of Ministers that they open discussions immediately on the applications of all members. That is the recommendation now before the Council and on which they have not yet made a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Taoiseach to have ascertained from the French Government that in the event of the British Government's application not being accepted, and not being continued, he is prepared to accept a direct application on behalf of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not talk on contingencies or premises of that nature.  I will await the outcome of the Council of Ministers on the application now before them and the recommendations of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that the position is very much the same as it was before he went to Paris?  There is no change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary; the position is different.  We have now the mind of all Member Governments of the Community, which is that they see no objection in principle to our application.  Further than that, if by any chance there is a long delay in the British application, the way is open to us to examine an interim arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state, in the event of this country joining the European Economic Community, what major changes will take place in regard to the Land Acts in this country; and if such legislation will be amended to <Col N="1912" /> enable free purchase and sales of land and property in common with all Common Market countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in the course of my statement to the Dáil on 25th July, 1967, the provisions of the Treaty of Rome regarding freedom of establishment apply to the purchase of, and settlement on, land.  These provisions are, however, subject to the principles of the common agricultural policy which take into account the distinctive nature of agricultural activity, including its structural aspects.</P>
      <P>So far, only limited progress has been made by the European Economic Community in implementing the provisions of the Treaty as they affect land.  Bearing in mind the importance of farming in the Irish economy and the need to improve the structure of our agriculture, I would hope that, on our entry into the Community, it would be possible for us to retain sufficient regulation over the disposal of land to enable us to apply policies adequate to our needs.  The precise arrangements to apply will be a matter for negotiation.</P>
      <P>So far as the Land Acts are concerned, it would be premature, in advance of entry negotiations, to say what amendments, if any, might be necessary.</P>

      <P>I have also stated that in our view such an agreement could only be negotiated successfully during a total cessation of hostilities which was not interrupted by attacks by the ground, air or sea forces of either side: every effort should be made to promote the speedy opening of negotiations for such a cease-fire agreement.</P>

The answer to the second part of the question is that in pursuance of the Government's policy of complete opposition to the denial of fundamental human rights in any country, they have on numerous occasions publicly declared that they are entirely opposed to the policies of apartheid of the Government of South Africa, and have also made it known that they do not recognise the racist minority regime in Southern Rhodesia.</P>

Radar is an ancillary aid used in conjunction with the landing aids, primarily by the Air Traffic Control Service, to locate approaching aircraft. It is intended to provide a radar system at the airport and I hope to be in a position to invite tenders for its installation shortly.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the statements of the Cork Gas Company on 13th October, 1967.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Board that two distinct offers of appliances were made recently.  The first was sponsored by Electrical Industries Ireland, Limited, and was available to all electrical traders selling that firm's cookers as well as to the Board's showrooms.</P>
      <P>The second offer was made in connection with the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the board.  Such offers are a common feature of present day merchandising particularly in the field of consumer durables.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that aspects of the present ESB policy are wasteful to the national economy or aim at the replacement of gas by electricity.  No measurable increase in electricity generating capacity has taken place or is likely to take place in order to provide for any replacement of gas by electricity for cooking.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that as in other countries a healthy competition between gas and electricity helps to maintain efficiency in both services and reacts to the benefit of consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the Deputy that it would not be possible to estimate it.  For example, the Board's sales commence later in the year and continue during the winter. The employment offered is seasonal. It would be very difficult to attribute the fact that the clerical employees were on strike to any particular change in the finances of the Board's operations. The Board are unable to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Surely any efficient organisation such as Bord na Móna must have sufficient clerical machinery at their disposal to know when there are losses and when there are profits?  It must be simple for the Minister to ascertain, from a Board for which he is responsible, the financial losses involved in connection with the strike to which I refer.  I do not accept for one moment that the figures of financial losses are not available.

There was no discernible effect on the total sales of the Board, but, then, these sales themselves vary, particularly in relation to weather.  Therefore, it would be almost impossible to say with absolute certainty that a change in the value of sales was or was not effected to some degree by the strike. So far, there has been no discernible change in the sales that might be effected by the strike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Radio Telefís Éireann operates in accordance with the provisions of the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1960 to 1966.  These Acts give certain powers to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, including control over such matters as the hours of broadcasting and the quantity of advertising permitted.  In general, however, they give the Authority complete freedom regarding programme content, subject to two special obligations imposed by Sections 17 and 18 of the Act of 1960.  The first of these is that in performing its functions, the Authority shall bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.  The second is that it shall be the duty of the Authority to secure that, when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news or feature is presented objectively and impartially and without any expression of the Authority's own views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 31 of the Act of 1960 gives the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs power to direct the Authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter or matters of any particular class.  Under the same section, the Minister may also direct the Authority in writing to allocate broadcasting time for any announcements by or on behalf of any Minister <Col N="1926" /> of State in connection with the functions of that Minister of State.  Neither of these powers has been used.</P>
    <P>The Authority acts as its own censor but, in accordance with an undertaking given by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when the Broadcasting Authority Bill, 1959, was being discussed in the Oireachtas, it has made a liaison arrangement with the official Film Censor for advice on the standards to apply to its external film material.</P>
    <P>No general directions are laid down by the Government in regard to the Authority's programme policy.  I have, however, indicated in my comment on the Estimate debate that the responsibility rests with RTE to ensure that programmes reflect national progress and national problems and that within its financial limitations RTE should endeavour to increase the proportion of home-produced programmes.</P>

In view of the urgency and importance of the matter and the dissatisfaction as a result of a programme of this kind, would the Minister take the necessary steps to see that at least the truth be made available for viewers of Telefís Éireann in relation to the conduct of our Irish emigrants abroad? Further, is it not a fact that very recently, on the instructions of Telefís Éireann, there has been a round-up of certain well-known Communists for the purpose, first, of having them put on television for interview and, secondly, to ascertain their views?  Is that in accordance with the Government's policy or are these people acting on their own initiative?  If they are acting on their own initiative in relation to the subject of Irish emigrants in Britain and the soliciting of support, for publicity purposes, of Communists, is it not time for the Government to intervene in a matter of this kind?</P>

If the Deputy wants to know anything more about my general views&mdash;which were expressed very generally and which received no criticism in the House&mdash;he can read the comment I made of a general kind on the last Estimate.  The Deputy can take up the matter on the occasion of the Estimate when there is a general discussion of the performances on Radio Telefís Éireann during the year.

Large businesses, and it is to their advantage, have to send a man every evening down with the post to get it there specially.  I know of one concern which does this and although there is a box outside their premises, they cannot use it.  Other people, perhaps, have not sufficient post and it does inconvenience them very much.  It is something to which some of the public have become accustomed but really they should not be asked to do so.</P>

      <P>The immediate cause of the abnormally late delivery in Lower Baggot Street on the morning <Col N="1931" /> in question was the unexpected absence of two regular postmen serving this area and delay in replacing them.

With the exception of the Dublin No. 2 Area, and to a lesser extent the No. 1 Area, I understand the arrival of post is adequate.

      <P>Early in 1966 the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society published a plan which illustrated a possible form of re-organisation of the dairying industry.  That plan has since been widely discussed and while some co-operative societies have been slow to accept the idea of rationalisation, and some of the proposed groupings of creameries in the plan have not met with the approval of all concerned, nevertheless it is, I think, now generally accepted that a carefully planned re-organisation is necessary in the interests of the industry.  Following consideration of the matter by the National Agricultural Council and in order to accelerate progress, I have as already announced, recently made arrangements for the engagement of eminent consultants from outside the country to make a detailed study as to the type of re-organisation of the industry best calculated to meet the needs of the future.  These consultants, who will work in close collaboration with representatives of the industry and my <Col N="1933" /> Department, expect to commence their study early in December and their report should be available in about six months time.</P>

      <P>I have received representations recently for the inclusion of this and other areas of County Monaghan in the Pilot Area Programme.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Inasmuch as this is substantially the revival of the Parish Plan and inasmuch as three such Parish Plans have been closed down by one of the Minister's predecessors, would he consider if Aughnamullen could be <Col N="1935" /> attached to any existing pilot area or whether a new pilot area could be evolved by which Aughnamullen could be attached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure what the Deputy actually said, but, judging from the question, I presume it is something to do with the revival of a Parish Plan.  Whether that is something Deputy Dillon still dreams about or not, I do not know.  This particular area cannot for the moment be included in the pilot area in Monaghan. As in every other county, there is only one pilot area in Monaghan.  The whole idea was to build up from quite a small unit.  The pilot areas were started to find out what assistance and aids are of most benefit to the smallholders.  We have now decided to extend the pilot areas, to try out new things, to find out the difficulties dealing with larger areas and, ultimately, to expand from this central point rather than picking other pilot areas and merely repeating the experience we have gained since the commencement of the first pilot area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from what the Minister is now saying that, as Aughnamullen adjoins an existing pilot area, the next step would be the extension of the existing pilot area to take in adjoining areas?  Would the Minister prognosticate any likely date on which the pilot area in Monaghan might be expanded to cover Aughnamullen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, over a year ago the pilot area was expanded in size by 200 per cent.  The result of this new expansion is that the pilot area now adjoins Aughnamullen.  If there is to be further expansion outwards, obviously, as the Deputy assumed, Aughnamullen would be in line for inclusion in the next stage of expansion.</P>

      <P>I did say that in relation to young workers I would be willing to accept something which I had, at an earlier stage, refused.  The context in which I said it was that I would be more willing to accept the case of the 16 to 20-year-old than something else which had been advocated by the Labour Party, and I think I had better put on record all we have done in the amendments.  The first proposal is to bring within the scope of the Bill all part-time workers who normally work for 21 or more hours per week for the same employers. That was the reduction that was not previously mentioned by the Labour Party.  The next thing was to reduce the lower age limit to 16 years of age, and I undertook to consider raising the upper age limit to 70, and the amendments give effect to this. This widens the scope of the Bill to apply it to all workers who are insured for all the benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, except part-time employees who work for less than 21 hours per week.  It brings the scope of the Bill into line with the social welfare code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about 16 to 70.  When I agreed to take 16 as a starting age, I explained to the House that I started off by taking an age of 18 because of the belief that with a four-year qualifying requirement starting at 16, 20 would be too young for a person to be given a redundancy payment.  I felt that at least he should be 22.  I still have doubts about giving the redundancy payment to people at 20 years of age. However, at some later stage when I had been pressed to accept something which I found contrary to the principle of the Bill, I said I would prefer to accept the proposal to allow a person of 20 to get a redundancy payment. Having said that and having reflected on it, I decided to accept the inclusion of persons at 16 years of age without insisting on the 22 years of age minimum for benefit.  Another consideration is that by specifying 22 we were making a qualifying period of six years for some persons as against four years for others.  That is the explanation. The rest has been agreed by the House and the House sought what I am now proposing.</P>

      <P>In page 8, between lines 53 and 54, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a)  An employee shall not be taken for the purposes of this Part as having been dismissed by his employer if&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  he is re-engaged by another employer (hereinafter referred to as the new employer) immediately on the termination of his previous employment,</P>
      <P>(ii)  the re-engagement takes place with the agreement of the employee, the previous employer and the new employer,</P>
      <P>(iii)  before the commencement of the period of employment with the new employer the employee receives a statement in writing on behalf of the previous employer and the new employer which&mdash;</P>
      <P>(A)  sets out the terms and conditions of the employee's contract of employment with the new employer,</P>
      <P>(B)  specifies that the employee's period of service with the previous employer will, for the purposes of this Act, be regarded by the new employer as service with the new employer,</P>
      <P>(C)  contains particulars of the service mentioned in clause (B), and</P>
      <P>(D)  the employee notifies in writing the new employer that the employee accepts the statement required by this subparagraph.</P>
      <P>(b)  Where in accordance with this subsection an employee is re-engaged by the new employer, the service of that employee mentioned in paragraph (a) (ii) shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be service with the new employer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a complicated matter which was raised by Deputy Mullen and Deputy Booth on Committee Stage. <Col N="1944" /> Both asked me to widen the definition of &ldquo;associated companies&rdquo; in the Bill so as to include companies that are associated by one having a holding of 25 per cent or more in the other.  I explained on Committee Stage the difficulties involved in moving away from the already accepted definition of &ldquo;associated companies&rdquo;.  That definition, as I explained to the House at the time, was a definition based on one company being a subsidiary of another and this is defined in the Companies Act, 1963.  I was satisfied, and still am satisfied, that we should not go outside that definition of &ldquo;associated company&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, I was at the time in sympathy with the intention expressed by Deputy Mullen and I accept that when a worker transfers from one employer to another, it might in certain circumstances be desirable that he should be able to carry with him the service he had with his first employer and to preserve the continuity of his employment even though he goes from one employer to another.  I think this could be of benefit to both the employee and the employers concerned irrespective of whether they were associated companies or not.  This is not exactly what Deputy Mullen and Deputy Booth asked for but it meets the general point of what they sought.</P>
    <P>The important thing in an amendment of this kind is that the employee's interest should be fully protected and, as I explained to Deputy Mullen at the time, whatever we do should not diminish the workers' right to redundancy payment.  If the Deputy remembers, it seemed to appear at the time that if you made the arrangement that he could be sent to another company he would have to lose his rights to redundancy payment by the company letting him go.  I had the question examined to see if the spirit of what Deputy Booth and Deputy Mullen asked for could be met and this amendment is tabled to bring in the result of this deliberation.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendment is that where a worker voluntarily transfers from one employer to another and where both employers concerned agree <Col N="1945" /> that his service with the first employer will be regarded as service with the second employer, that is, the new employer, the continuity of his service for the purposes of this Bill will not be broken by the transfer.  In the interests of the worker it is being provided that before the transfer the employee must be furnished with a written statement on behalf of both employers which (a) will set out the terms and conditions of the new employment; (b) contains the agreement of the new employer that the worker's service with the first employer will be regarded as service with the new employer and (c) that the notice contains particulars of the worker's service with the first employer.  As an additional safeguard for the employee, it is also being provided that the terms and conditions set out in the statement must be accepted in writing by the worker concerned.</P>
    <P>The worker need not accept, of course, and when it comes to the time when he would be leaving the first employer, if he so desires he can claim whatever redundancy payment he would be entitled to.  If he does that, he can take employment with the next employer and start anew from that point.  But, if he opts to go from one employment to another and carry his service with him and both employers agree then he cannot get redundancy payment but the decision is made by the worker himself.</P>
    <P>The essential difference between the proposal and the provisions relating to associated companies is, as I have said, that the employee in this case has the option of refusing to accept re-engagement and to retain his right to whatever redundancy payment might be due to him from the first employer, while under section 16, as the House knows, if he refused an offer of re-employment he would lose redundancy payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has tried to go a long way to meet the points raised in this House in relation to this matter but I do not know how it would cover the particular problem of those engaged in the construction industry because one of <Col N="1946" /> the problems there would be the question of being able to get agreement between the preceding and the succeeding employers.  The Minister's amendment provides that the employee would have to get documentary evidence of the problems in this industry is the lack of continuity of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a separate matter.  This is something raised by Deputy Mullen and Deputy Booth about associated companies.  The background to this is that an employee who is coming to face redundancy in a company may be offered employment in an associated company and the definition of associated company may not be broad enough to cover the situation.  Deputy Mullen and Deputy Booth say that situations exist where, if we extended the definition of associated company further, there would be more opportunities for employees to get employment in other companies.  I felt that what they wanted was to make sure that a man would get an offer of employment as quickly as possible, but to do it in the way I was asked would move us away from the definition of associated companies. What I have produced is a method by which two employers and an employee can so agree that the employee can say, &ldquo;I do not want redundancy payment if I get employment from another employer and my service is continuous&rdquo;.  But, the three, the employee and the two employers concerned must agree to the arrangement.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Larkin is referring to now is the question of special schemes but this amendment is not to deal with special types of employment.  It is to deal with arrangements where an employee says, &ldquo;I will give up my right to redundancy payment from the first employer if he gets me a job with the second employer with continuity of service&rdquo;.  It is a different situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite aware that that is the situation but I am commenting on the fact that in relation to the type of worker that I have referred to and also referred to in the course of the earlier discussions there is the <Col N="1947" /> problem that service cannot be built up because the employment is not continuous with a particular employer or, in many cases, even with clearly associated employers.  The hope of their coming within the scope of this Bill, having regard to the qualification, is very slight.</P>

Section 9, subsection (2) provides that an employee shall not be taken to be dismissed by his employer&mdash;in other words, continuity is not broken&mdash;(a) if the employee's contract of employment is renewed or if he is re-engaged by the same employer under a new contract which does not differ from the previous contract and the renewal or re-engagement takes effect immediately on the ending of his employment under the previous contract, or (b) in any other case the renewal or re-engagement is the result of an offer made in writing by the employer before the ending of his employment under the previous contract, and takes effect either immediately on the ending of that employment or after an interval of not more than four weeks thereafter.</P>
    <P>Now section 16, subsection (1) provides:</P>
    <P>Where the employer is a company, any reference in this Part to re-engagement by the employer shall be construed as a reference to re-engagement by that company or by an associated company, and any reference in this Part to an offer made by the employer shall be construed as including a reference to an offer made by an associated company.</P>
    <P>The effect of these two provisions when taken together is that continuity of service is preserved, when an employee is re-engaged by an associated company as the result of an offer made before the termination of his employment with the first company, provided that the re-employment takes place within four weeks of that termination. The only doubt which arises relates to the question of whether the provisions of section 9 will apply to the renewal or re-engagement that takes place before the Act comes into operation.  My amendment resolves any doubts in that connection.</P>

      <P>The amendment submitted by the Labour Party to which the Minister is referring was amendment No. 66.  He is now indicating that this amendment was put in to meet what was advocated in amendment No. 66.  That is not so because amendment No. 66 related to his amendment No. 65 on Committee Stage.  We accepted the Minister's amendment No. 65 and did not pursue our amendment No. 66.  The Minister is now relating this amendment to amendment No. 66.  That is causing confusion.  As my colleague, Deputy Tully, points out, it refers to a different matter. Perhaps the Minister could give us a more concise explanation of what he is doing in this amendment?</P>

The essential problem was recognised quickly on the last occasion, that is, whether the provision of the section would apply to events that happened before the commencement of the Act.  What I am doing in this amendment is what the Labour Party asked me to do.  The last night I felt it would not be necessary but I undertook to examine it to see if it would be necessary.  The reason for the lengthy evaluation was that the amendment will change the wording of a section other than section 16 and produce the same result as the Labour Party amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;provided, however, that where an employer is insolvent, the Minister shall be entitled to claim in the bankruptcy, arrangement, administration of the insolvent estate or winding up (as the case may be) in respect of, and only in respect of, a sum (if any) equal to the amount of the payment made by the Minister under this section less the amount of the rebate that would have been payable to the employer from the Redundancy Fund under section 29 if the employer had paid the lump sum to the employee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were considering section 32 in Committee, I told the House that I <Col N="1952" /> understood from the Official Assignee that subsection (3) of the section might be defective and that I was having the matter examined further.  The subsection provides that, where a lump sum payment is made to a worker out of the Redundancy Fund because of the failure of his employer to make the payment, the Minister will have the right to take any necessary action to recover from that employer the appropriate amount.</P>
    <P>With relation to bankrupt employers, the intention is that in claiming against the estate of a bankrupt employer the claim will be limited to the net amount due from the employer instead of the full lump sum payment&mdash;that is, the amount of the lump sum payment, less the amount of rebate he might receive if he had made the payment.  I have been advised that, in order to proceed in this way, the intention would need to be made clear in the subsection and the amendment is designed to achieve this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome move, but does it not highlight the necessity for taking steps, if not in this measure, then in some other measure, to ensure that in the case of bankruptcy, the worker will be protected?

      <P>We suggested on Committee Stage that the nominating bodies on the employees' side should be the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The Minister explained that that was the usual procedure.

It is not very difficult to get a licence and it is not very difficult for house unions to come into existence.  It could happen that a number of house unions would get together and describe themselves as an organisation representing trade unions. Apart from the Minister's goodwill, it is imperative to ensure that the nominations will be from reputable representatives of the workers, and that is the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>

      <P>In page 35, line 10, to delete &ldquo;not&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are getting very confused in this. The original amendments I had on Committee Stage were to meet a situation which might arise but which I would expect to arise very rarely.  In explaining the particular paragraphs I thought they were confusing and undertook to try to have an amendment to simplify them.  To explain it properly, I will have to give the background to the sections involved. Section 10 of the Bill deals with the position of an employee who is under notice of dismissal and for some reason wants to anticipate the date of expiry of the dismissal notice.  If an employee knew he was becoming redundant and wished to get other employment which was offering earlier and wanted to leave the employment before the notice of the employer expired, then he would tell the employer that he himself was giving notice of an earlier expiry time and in that way he would preserve his right to a redundancy payment, unless the employer gave a counter-notice telling him that he required his services to the last day of the notice the employer had given.  If, in spite of that counter-notice, the employee did not fulfil the full term of notice given to him by his employer, his right to a redundancy payment would be in question, that is, if the employer were acting reasonably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all here.  What was not here was the position which would arise if an employee died before the employer had given the counter-notice or if the employer had given the counter-notice but the employee died before the date of expiry of his own notice.  In those circumstances, it would be doubtful if the next-of-kin could claim redundancy payment.  Deputies, as far as they could <Col N="1958" /> see the situation arising, felt that this might be unfair in relation to an employee's estate.  The amendments I now propose will have the effect of stating the position positively in favour of the employee or his next-of-kin by treating the employee as if he had complied with the requirements to get his redundancy payments; in other words had complied with the employer's counter-notice.</P>

      <P>In page 36, line 11, to delete &ldquo;one half of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are sorry to have a difference on this point.  The Minister will recall that we considered the lump sum to be inadequate.  We proposed in our amendments to increase the amount of the lump sum to people as they went on in life and we tried to bring the lump sum payment to a more realistic figure for Irish conditions.  I suggested that people disemployed in Ireland might be longer looking for alternative work than in other countries and that the amount of the lump sum would need to be geared to this situation.  We suggested that the amount of the lump sum should be equivalent to the aggregate: we suggested deleting &ldquo;one half of&rdquo;.  The Minister said that it should be only a half week's pay; we suggested one week's pay and our second amendment suggested that it should be increased to one and a half after he had attained the age of 41 years. Both of these suggestions we thought went a long way to strengthen and improve this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We think our amendments would make this Bill a more effective piece of legislation which should be the aim of every political Party in this House. The aim of the Labour Party is to strengthen and improve this Bill and it is in that spirit that we suggest these <Col N="1959" /> matters on the financial side of the Bill.  We do not think that the financial figures laid down here are excessive. We suggest that the minor improvements we suggest would make all the difference in giving the worker some financial protection at a period when he is out of work.</P>
    <P>We have been accused on this suggestion and on others of confusing this Bill with a social security measure and we have said repeatedly that in this country a redundancy payments Bill, in some respects, because of the inadequacy of our social security system, must take on some aspect of what might come under social security in another country.  We do not suggest that the figures here are in any way excessive but we suggest in our country they are very necessary and we ask the Minister to consider this matter very closely.  This amendment proposed by us is another effort to improve this particular Bill.  We feel it is necessary and we hope the Minister can see his way to accepting the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept these amendments.  These amendments would make for very substantial increases in the lump sums payable under the Bill. As I tried to explain before, the principal difference between the scheme we have in this Bill and that in Britain is that in Britain there are no weekly payments.  We have a scheme with lump sums and weekly payments.  I consider this is a better scheme than if the total amount of benefit were paid in a lump sum.  I believe if we try to make the lump sums as big as elsewhere and at the same time give weekly payments we are putting too great a burden on industry, because the contribution would certainly have to be higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already told the House that we have made estimates of what we are likely to get from the contributions. They will be about £1 million a year. We have also made estimates of what the likely outgoings will be and this is the basis of the figures we have arrived at.  I have already made concessions in relation to the age and in relation to <Col N="1960" /> certain classes of workers who work for 21 hours a week.  I said I would make a change&mdash;I have an amendment down to this effect&mdash;to allow the maximum lump sum to be the equivalent of 20 weeks pay rather than 16 weeks pay.  All those concessions will cause additional outgoings and may mean that I will have to come back to ask for higher contributions.  Any such increase would have to be approved by the Dáil.  I have been so concerned about the possible effects on the Redundancy Fund that in an earlier amendment, which we did not discuss, I have provided that the expenses of the administration of this Act will be carried by the Exchequer.  My intention here is to try and avoid having to increase the contributions.  The Exchequer will now carry the expenses of administration except those relating to the appeals machinery which I think should be carried by the Fund.  I do not think I can go beyond that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put this to the Minister, as I stressed on Committee Stage, that if the economy of this country were being managed properly the need for this Redundancy Bill might not be there at all, but because it has not been managed properly, the Minister has been faced with the late necessity of bringing this Bill into the House.  The people who would be affected by this, and in respect of whom we are concerned, would be people in many cases where adaptation procedures have been introduced and where considerable amounts of public money will have gone to aid the employer to improve or instal new equipment.  The very fact of operating this means that workers in such establishments may well find themselves redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We said on Committee Stage that we could give many instances of cases in which, where new techniques and new equipment have been installed, redundancy has occurred in such industries and employment.  We indicated that this measure of a lump sum compensation for workers so made redundant or made redundant because of inefficient management and the failure of management over the years to develop their <Col N="1961" /> organisations should be such as to compensate them fully for what they have lost.  We indicated that in relation to this lump sum compensation, the basis of half a week for each year of service up to 41 years service and a single week for service of 41 years was, in our view, inadequate.  This is not just our view because we believe we are expressing here the feelings of workers who would be affected.</P>
    <P>Take the situation of a worker of 55 years of age with 20 years service who may be affected.  What would that man have?  The most he would have would be compensation for about 15 years. The Minister went a bit further in relation to the maximum period and in many other sections of the Bill, we can see that he has been quite reasonable with regard to the points of view expressed by the House.  This is one of the vital issues, the issue of what is going to happen to the worker who becomes redundant and who will need the compensation, aside from the weekly payments, and consequently we press on the Minister to accept our two amendments, Nos. 22 and 24.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with my colleague, Deputy Larkin, in advocating that the Minister should change his mind in regard to this particular matter.  The point that has to be borne in mind in particular is that people regard a lump sum payment as something very substantial.  The Minister has already used the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo;.  I submit that in circumstances of this kind, where the maximum lump payment is bound to be 20 weeks half pay, it cannot be regarded as a handsome sum and is not a very great compensation for the person concerned after all his years of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another very good reason why the Minister can afford to meet this proposition of ours and it has regard to what he himself has said.  He has said that there will be quite a considerable number of people excluded from this Bill.  He has admitted that there will be a number of people paying in accordance with the provisions of this Bill who will never get anything out <Col N="1962" /> of it.  If we are to have regard in a serious way to the Minister's anticipation of the future and the expectations in regard to redundancy, the amount of money so paid out will not be so big because the Minister is fairly confident of the future in regard to industry.  That being so, I think this highlights the absence of a rush on the Fund, if what the Minister says is correct.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is unreasonable of the Minister to make comparison with the situation which exists in Great Britain.  Once we think in terms of lump sum payments, we also have to have regard to the reliefs that are afforded to the people concerned.  They do not exist here and there is no indication of their coming into existence for the people of this country.  I would entreat the Minister to have another look at this matter.  If he were to accept what we are advocating in our amendment, it would not have a serious effect on the Fund.  As I have already said, there will be a considerable number of people contributing to this Fund who cannot benefit from it because they will be excluded from its provisions.  We realise that this Bill will be regarded by a great many workers as locking the stable door when the horse has gone, because a number of workers who should be included will not be included, even those who have been declared redundant in the past few weeks.  This Bill is leaving us in the position of saying that this is the end of it, that there will not be a dearth of industry. Let us be realistic and face the facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given my reasons and I think the House must appreciate that we can only work on the best calculations possible which are available to us now.  If experience shows that we can afford better payments I will ask the House for its agreement to improvements at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>The figure we are looking for is not excessive.  We have pointed out that the lump sum for the people involved, who are out of work, cannot exceed a certain figure and we do not consider it excessive.  You have made calculations and are you <Col N="1963" /> suggesting that on your budget you cannot give it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know with certainty now how much redundancy will occur.  We do not know the age groups of those who will become redundant.  If they belong to a particular age group, there will be greater amounts involved than if the workers concerned were younger people.  The age, experience and so on of people made redundant will determine the level of redundancy payments.  The provisions of the Bill related to the income of the Fund and no matter how well-wishing you are, you have to relate what you do to what you can afford to do.  This is not a case of Santa Claus handing out.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 37, to delete lines 1 to 8, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.  Where an employee's period of service had been interrupted by any one of the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a period of not more than 52 consecutive weeks by reason of sickness,</P>
      <P>(b)  a period of not more than 26 consecutive weeks by reason of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) lay-off,</P>
      <P>(ii) holidays,</P>
      <P>(iii) service by the employee in the Defence Forces of the State,</P>

      <P>continuity of employment shall not be broken by such interruption even though notice of termination of the contract of employment has been given.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jones raised the matter of the length of time a man might be sick without breaking continuity of service, where he had been dismissed but had been taken back into his employment. The Deputy thought six months, which was the time mentioned, too short.  I have arranged that the period of 26 weeks shall be altered to 52 consecutive weeks in the case of illness.  The periods in relation to lay-off, holidays, service by the employee in the Defence Forces of the State or any other cause not mentioned in clauses (i) and (ii) of the paragraph in question but authorised by the employer, will not break continuity of employment, which, even though notice of termination of the contract of employment has been given, will remain at 26 weeks.  I should like to explain that even if a man had been sick for three years, and his employer wishes to overlook that, it will not break his continuity of employment. However, if a man is sick for over 12 months then, under this new amendment, the employer could terminate the <Col N="1967" /> employment and continuity would be broken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put it to the Minister that the 26 consecutive weeks by reason of lay-off is still very inadequate and that there is a very compelling case to be made that it should be at least 52 weeks.  The Minister will surely have taken into account that there is quite a lot of seasonal employment in this country and that it is not unusual for workers to be laid off for some months of the year.  We know of instances where the period has amounted to some six months, or even more, so that the Minister is placing in a very precarious position those thousands of casual workers in industry, on the bogs, on the roads, in the building industry and the like, by confining them to a 26-week period for reckonable service.  In all the circumstances, I would ask the Minister to have a second look at that stipulation in respect of lay-offs.  I feel that 26 weeks is dangerously low in respect of the very many categories of workers whom we know to have no security of tenure in respect of employment and who are used to being laid off from time to time.</P>
      <P>There is, too, a real danger that, where the employment is checkered, haphazard or casual, the employers may avail of this clause to set their workers outside the Redundancy Payments Bill, when enacted&mdash;disfranchise them, disqualify them, so to speak, of set and deliberate purpose by laying them off for more than 26 weeks.  This is a real possibility in certain industries, in certain spheres of employment: I do not wish to name them here.  It is wide open to an employer to exonerate himself from the obligations contained in this measure merely by keeping them out of work for more than six months, thereby disqualifying them from benefit and exonerating himself in respect of any payments under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister, in introducing the amendment, has <Col N="1968" /> improved the section considerably because, as previously drafted, it provided for a maximum of only 26 weeks.  I wonder if the Minister has gone far enough.  He refers to 52 weeks illness.  This section is dealing with continuous employment for the purpose of the Bill, not reckonable service.  Take a person who may have to spend a period in hospital.  We know that TB is pretty well in hand at the present moment.  Its incidence is not nearly as high as it was.  Nevertheless, it occurs.  It is to be found in the middle-age group at this stage much more than it is to be found in the young.  It is quite a common fact that people have to receive hospital treatment&mdash;perhaps nine months, 12 months or 15 months in hospital&mdash;and may then have to attend clinics before they are fit to resume work.  A person may have been working for ten years or so and contracts TB or is a victim to any long period of illness. Such person will lose, for the purpose of the Bill, continuity of employment. I do not think the Minister would intend to deprive people who are unfortunate enough to be struck down with a serious illness from getting the benefit, on return to work, of previous service for the purpose of this measure. The same thing may come under another heading.  Lay-off has been dealt with by Deputy Treacy, and quite properly so.  There are a number of employments with what might be termed temporary workers who, over a number of years, work for four or five months in the year for the same employer and automatically go back to work with the same employer.  Yet, under this, they would never qualify for any recognition and would never qualify over the years for any protection under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While agreeing that the Minister's amendment does improve the Bill, I would ask him whether he would not look at this question again from the point of view of long-term sickness.  I do not think there is a Member of this House, least of all the Minister, who would, on reflection, suggest that a person who is in employment for ten or 15 years and contracts TB or is seriously ill, or for any other such cause, and is out of work for a period <Col N="1969" /> of 52 weeks, should on return to work, lose all the benefits of his or her employment from the point of view of redundancy payments.</P>
    <P>This section is not dealing with reckonable service, I understand.  It is dealing with the question of continuity. I would ask the Minister to look at the question of sickness from the point of view of continuity of employment for reckonable service. Many good employers are prepared to accept it but, of course, there are a lot of bad ones.  Many good employers are prepared to accept that if a person is out 12 months, 18 months or two years with a serious disease such as I have mentioned and is restored to his or her ordinary employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to explain this but I shall try to do so. If a man is sick for three weeks now and three weeks again and the employer dismisses him, he is gone anyway.  The purpose of paragraph 5 in Schedule 3 is that if a man is sick, or has other reasons for being away from his place of business, an employer cannot dismiss him and later re-employ him and call that a break in continuity. To protect the worker from this being done, that is, the breaking of his continuity of service by his employer, he will have to be absent for at least 12 months before this device can be used by an employer.  An employer could have a worker out for three years and take him back and that would count as service as long as the employer does not dismiss him.  I think we dealt with Deputy Treacy's point about seasonal workers under section 8.  We have made conditions which would discount the annual average period in which he would not be working anyway.  I will have a look at that to see how it affects the protection of the workers in regard to the payment of the redundancy lump sum and, if <Col N="1970" /> necessary, I will make changes, but I think we have dealt with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this period of 52 weeks but could the Minister explain to me how this would operate, having regard to a situation I will describe?  If a person goes on holidays and just at the end of the holidays, becomes ill and his illness lasts for 52 weeks, is the holiday period taken into consideration in reckoning the 52 weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It does happen in certain employments with which I am familiar that a person, a teacher, say, who was ill at the beginning of a long holiday has the whole period treated as a period of illness.  I do not think it would be so treated here.  The period of illness would not be calculated in the period of holidays.  The holidays would be separate and would not come within the 26 weeks period of authorised absence mentioned in the paragraph.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There are circumstances in which an employee might be away with Defence Forces or might be sick.  If he is away for a period in such circumstances, the employer is deprived of his services for that period and he might use this as an excuse to dismiss the worker and re-employ him when he was again available.  Having done that, having dismissed him and re-employed him, the date of the re-employment would start a new period in which that man would build up again rights to redundancy payment. To protect the employee from this, we are introducing these limitations on the employer so that he cannot use sickness, except for a period of 12 months or anything over 12 months, to dismiss a man and re-employ him and so break continuity.  The employer can dismiss a worker at any time for <Col N="1972" /> inefficiency, for illness or a bad health record, but where an employer dismisses and re-employs we are protecting workers so that they will be at least 12 months sick before such dismissal and re-employment would break continuity.  We have tried to cover all eventualities by having a final clause in case something is overlooked. It is just a way of protecting the worker against this device of being dismissed and re-employed to break continuity during a period when his services are not available to his employer. I think all possible uses of that device are covered by the provision as amended.</P>

A man falls sick and has a chronic illness of the kind Deputy Larkin referred to, such as tuberculosis or leukaemia.  It may take a long time to restore his health.

      <P>It is difficult to explain it.  The drafting was difficult but I am assured by the draftsman that it now meets the intention.  An employer could come into the hospital to anybody and say after three weeks &ldquo;You are sacked&rdquo;.  He might wait six months or two years.  Most employers would probably not do that at all.  What this draft is calculated to catch is the use of the sacking and re-employment device.  It cannot be used in these circumstances except after 12 months have elapsed in the case of illness and six months in the other cases.  But at any time an employer can dismiss a person.  What is being covered here is the case where an employer dismisses a worker, takes him back and then says: &ldquo;You have broken your continuity.&rdquo;  Redundancy payments are related to continuity of service and not weekly contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I follow that. What I am anxious to clarify is that we are ensuring that an employee will not lose his redundancy rights under this legislation, unless his employment has been legitimately interrupted by valid dismissal, and that we are seeking to attach to the word &ldquo;valid&rdquo; a moral as well as a legal form, that an employer will not have a right for the first 52 weeks to terminate his employment and disrupt his redundancy rights.</P>

      <P>I am bound to say, with reluctance, that I think this provision in draft here is as comprehensive as the Minister can make it.  If there are these rapacious cut-throats that Deputy Moore and members of the Labour Party speak of, I think the form we have here is as effective as it is possible to provide.  I should like to find fault with the Minister &mdash; it is my business as a member of the Opposition &mdash; but it lends more verisimilitude to our debate if, when he tries to do his best to meet a legitimate point, we say that on the whole he has done as well as any man can reasonably be expected to do, particularly in view of the fact that if this Schedule proves in practice not to be adequate to achieve our purpose, I am quite prepared to come back if cases emerge that men have been unjustly treated. I am often astonished that more people here do not inveigh against the fact that when a man is sick for a certain period, he ceases to become eligible for sickness benefit.  I admit that is another day's work.</P>

      <P>That there are such <Col N="1976" /> employers here was proved by the 1936 Act and the granting of holidays. Within a few months hundreds of employers took advantage of that Act to deprive people of their holidays on technicalities and the Act had to be amended.  In this case those employers who wish to deprive people who have been ill a long time and save themselves the contributions and lump sum payments can after 12 months technically dismiss somebody, bring him back and then say he does not qualify for the lump sum.  Subsequent amendment of the Act will be of little use. The Minister said he was opposed to retrospection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The section says:</P>
      <P>Absence from work by reason of a strike in the business or industry in which the employee concerned is employed and which occurred after the commencement of this Act shall not be allowable as reckonable service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, we suggested that this section be dropped.  One of the difficulties in this matter is that of determining legally what a strike is and of deciding who will keep the records of unofficial stoppages, which may last <Col N="1977" /> for a day or three days, or of a strike which may last a week.  What kind of legal battles will there be in a case like this, where the employer declares that the people have been on strike and, on the other hand, it is arguable that it is a lock-out?  On Committee Stage, we indicated that the interruption of work by strikes was very small in the overwhelming majority of cases compared with the loss of man-days through illness and other causes, compared to the man-days lost through lay-offs, dislocation of industry and other occurrences outside the control of the people in industry.  As I have said, a stoppage may involve only a half day, two days or a week.  While we are particularly concerned, and expressed our concern under another section, that employers should keep proper records, we consider that the attempt to keep records under this heading for the purpose of depriving the workers of reckonable service will only create confusion.  Therefore, we would ask the Minister to look at this again and to accept our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support this amendment.  As I indicated on Committee Stage, if the Minister does not accept this amendment and persists in doing what he has set out to do, he will take the good out of this whole Bill, because it will be regarded as a penalty to be imposed on people who go on strike.  Strikes occur for a host of reasons.  Strikes are not always created by the workers' side, and it is wrong to have this provision when one takes into consideration that in the preceding paragraph, the Minister, for the purpose of determining reckonable service, is disposed towards not regarding strikes which have occurred before this Bill becomes law as being an interruption of service.  Surely he can follow through with this idea, particularly in view of the fact that we have not got a history of strikes of long duration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder at the purpose of putting this in.  It savours of the big stick, and it belies the attitude the Minister has been adopting all along the line in relation to this Bill.  I have said before that I do not think this idea was thought up by the Minister himself, <Col N="1978" /> and I would urge him to reconsider the matter.  If it is to be laid down that anybody who indulges in a strike or finds himself involved in a strike will have that set against him for the purpose of reckoning his service, it will have a wrong effect on such a person.  It does not amount to much by way of punishment, because the period of a strike can be very short. In most cases, fortunately, in our history of strikes, they have been reasonably short.  However, it can be regarded as the wielding of the big stick against people who have to take strike action, and there is no need for this section.</P>
    <P>During Committee Stage, the Minister, in defence of this provision, said he came to the conclusion, as a result of consultations he had with both sides on this matter, that they wanted it.  I submitted then that I thought this did not emanate from the workers' representatives.  I have since checked and I have been assured that it did not and would not.  I am also satisfied that well-meaning and organised employers would not advocate this.  We know from our experience that when a strike is over, a settlement having been made, both sides hope to go back and work together in a proper atmosphere.  Let us go along with that, and when both sides to a dispute have come to an agreement, let there not be hanging over the workers' heads this section in the Redundancy Payments Bill, where it is said that despite the fact that a dispute has been settled, this is going to be set against the worker when it comes to reckoning his service.</P>
    <P>This does not happen in other cases where people, having been on strike, seek to obtain benefits from their employers.  A worker who goes on strike now and who is in receipt of service pay, does not have his service pay interfered with because he has been on strike.  I suggest that if this sort of thing is pressed, it will encourage the bringing about of that situation. Furthermore, if a strike lasts a long time, employers do not generally use this period in assessing holiday entitlement.  Of course, the law in relation to holidays indicates clearly and distinctly that unless the period of <Col N="1979" /> absence from work is of an unreasonable duration, such absence will not be held against a worker in the event of claiming holiday pay.  As I have said before, this provision interferes with people's liberty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider the stand he has taken on this matter.  Apart from any question of principle, this might lead to a considerable amount of dispute in future.  The question of whether a strike is a strike or a lock-out is very often a question of which particular side you happen to be on, and there have been innumerable disputes where one side has claimed that it was a strike and the other side has claimed it was a lock-out.</P>
      <P>Also, we mentioned in connection with the previous section the fact that there are good employers and bad employers, and the Minister saw fit to introduce certain regulations that would ensure that the least decent employer would, at least, meet certain standards in relation to implementing the Bill.  Surely the Minister must realise that the number of days lost through either strike or lock-out over a period of twenty or thirty years will be very little?  The good employer would normally tend to disregard the small amount of time that would be accumulated due to strike or lock-out, but you will find that the bad employer may come to a man and say that fifteen years ago he was out on strike for three days, that ten years ago there was a stoppage which lasted for a day, and this type of argument will develop in future if the Minister persists in leaving this in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should bear in mind that during negotiations for the settlement of a strike and after a strike one of the major considerations as far as trade unions are concerned is that there should be no victimisation of those who have been on strike and are returning to work.  I would suggest that if the Minister thought of this for a moment he would agree that this in fact is a type of victimisation that would have the power of law.  The <Col N="1980" /> Minister should reconsider his attitude on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Jones speaks for the Fine Gael Party and has forgotten more about these problems than I know and has given very close study to the Bill.  I should, however, like to comment on this.  I see the force of the argument advanced by Deputy Cluskey and Deputy Mullen but I see a great difference between a strike sponsored by a responsible trade union and an unofficial strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be much more comfortable about this proviso if it were possible for the draftsman to distinguish between a strike sponsored by a responsible trade union and an unofficial strike.  I think there is a good deal of force in what the Labour Deputies have said that the Legislature should follow the practice we have always followed down through the years, and that is, that where there is a genuine labour dispute, with a responsible trade union informing the Labour Court that they have reached deadlock with a responsible employer and have done as much as they can to resolve their difficulties, the men are going to exercise their constitutional right as free men to strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to avoid if I could injecting into that position the argument on the side of the employer, &ldquo;Remember boys, if your trade union leaders bring you out on strike it is going to reduce your benefits under the Redundancy Payments Act&rdquo;.  I would not be at all sure that there would be objection to the proposal, where you get some irresponsible chap who is kicking up ructions and trying to make himself shop steward or trying to advance himself in the union and is a scourge to responsible trade union officials who are trying to defend their members' interests and at the same time exercise the immense power of a trade union responsibly and resolutely if the trade union officials were in a position to say, &ldquo;For God's sake go back boys because this kind of wild cat operation will interfere with your rights under the Bill, as well as all the other <Col N="1981" /> evils.  We will negotiate.  Go back to work.  We will take up your grievances and we may have to call you out on strike but if we do call you out on strike you may forget about the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Act.  They will not operate because this is an official, sponsored strike for which the union will answer and which the union certificate is sufficient to exempt from the consequences that would accrue if it were unofficial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The time has come, both here and in Great Britain, where it will need passionate devotion to the right of men to belong to their trade unions and the right to use the power to strike through the machinery of the trade union but the time has come when legislatures in every free country are beginning to ask themselves is there no means whereby we can differentiate between that fundamental right of free men to organise in trade unions and to strike as their last sanction in a trade dispute and the kind of goings on which I will not particularise but which is generally described as an unofficial strike which many of us know and which is frequently precipitated for reasons far different from those alleged by the people who promote the strikes, often to the detriment of the trade union rather than the employer.</P>
    <P>So, I should like to say to the House that I have not given this matter the very careful consideration that Deputy Jones has but, personally, I would have great sympathy with the view expressed by Deputy Cluskey and Deputy Mullen but if we were going to accept their point of view we ought to try to distinguish between a strike sponsored by a responsible trade union or, indeed, by any recognised trade union and a strike sponsored by nobody, commonly known as an unofficial strike.</P>

      <P>I hope I never have to try to persuade my members to go back off a strike because of the fact that if they did not they would lose their claim to redundancy payment because in that case the best advice to give them would be to look for another job.  If redundancy payment <Col N="1982" /> came into it the job would not be worth staying in.</P>
      <P>The arguments made from the benches here that this is something which is rather irksome, which may be used in order to cause trouble in the employment at a later stage has not so very very much in it.  The Minister is breaking a nut with a very big mallet because in this case he is saying, in effect, that if people are on strike then those people will lose their right to redundancy pay.</P>

If the Minister pauses to think for a moment he will realise that very few employers are prepared to consider at all the question that they are going to close down and that is where redundancy pay comes in or a lay off will occur. There is no big principle involved on which the Minister has to stand. Because of the fact that Deputies on these benches said here earlier that this is simply an irksome thing, something which might possibly cause trouble at a later stage of the job, I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment suggested by the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>The arguments of Deputy Larkin and his colleagues in the Labour benches recalled to my mind certain circumstances in connection with some strikes with which I had rather close connection in my time, and convince me that I should advocate that the Minister should accept the Labour <Col N="1983" /> Party amendment.  I recall the bank strikes with which I had close connections, on two occasions, I think.  I also recall a strike with which I have very little connection, the teachers' strike.  I recall another strike with which I had no connection.  The issue was raised with the bank clerks, the teachers and the Post Office officials, that if they went on strike, they interfered with their superannuation.  That was never allowed in the end to prevent a settlement. It was never allowed in the end as something which had to be taken into account in penalising those who went on strike.  It seems to me that the analogy between the teachers, the bank officials and the Post Office workers is clear in this case.  I am convinced that the Minister should accept this amendment. It seems to me that this will cause nothing but disruption and trouble between the workers and employers and will effect no useful purpose.</P>
      <P>There is one last remark I should like to make.  There is a provision in the Bill that absence from work by reason of a lock-out shall be allowable as reckonable service.  You cannot reckon service for a strike or a lock-out. Who is to say what is a lock-out and what is a strike?  In every strike, the workers say they are locked out and the employers say it is a strike and not a lock-out at all.  Who will decide that as an issue of fact?  It will be impossible, and this will cause nothing but trouble.  The Minister should consider the amendment favourably.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>What is in the minds of Deputies is a principle but it is not a principle which applies to the Redundancy Bill.  Deputy Tully argued rightly and concluded wrongly.  If there were any question of penalising people for striking, the British Labour Government would not have brought this into their legislation.</P>

      <P>The basic principle of redundancy legislation is that a man is establishing certain rights in his firm, or industry, or job, because he is being employed in that job and contributing <Col N="1984" /> to the welfare of the firm.  We do not say that the period of a strike would break continuity of service.  There is the principle that if a man is not working for his employer then the period he is away from his employment, if it is not the employer's fault&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The period when the employer is not getting the benefit of the employee's presence and labour, while it does not break his service, should not be reckoned as a period in which the employee is building up that firm.  The whole basis of redundancy legislation is the contribution of the employee to the firm.  Deputy Tully is right that the periods involved would hardly amount to anything.  The 26 week period for benefit is weighted in favour of the employee.</P>
      <P>The principle I see in this is that a man is establishing rights in a firm.  If he is locked out that is not his fault. Therefore we will penalise the employer and make him pay to the man who was willing to contribute, by his services, but if the employee is away from work and not contributing, then that period should not fall to be reckoned in the aggregate period of service for the calculation of redundancy payment.</P>
      <P>I know that the question of whether a strike is a strike or a lock-out can be raised.  I imagine that in actual practice the question will not often arise.  We have provision for an appeals tribunal machinery if such a question should arise.  I feel that at the end of the period of dispute, it would be a problem for the trade unions firmly to establish whether it was a lock-out or a strike.  The appeals tribunal would be available to determine such questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker has confused the issue.  He has deliberately confused it in order to create a certain situation.  As Deputy Costello said, there are many schemes of compensation and retirement benefit operating in which interruptions in employment have occurred because of disputes, lock-outs, or strikes, and they have been settled on the basis that there would be no interference with the full rights of the employees concerned.  In the case of the bank clerks, they were paid in respect of the period during which they were on strike.  Now, we are <Col N="1987" /> not asking for that, but we are putting it to the Minister that, if there is a dispute next February, a month after this Bill comes into operation, and a dozen people stop work and 988 other employees find themselves out of work for three days, according to this legislation, a record will have to be kept for maybe ten, 15 or 20 years in order to show what interruptions have occurred during the ordinary working life of the employees, what the cause has been, whether it has been a lock-out or a strike, and these statistics will be compiled and kept for the sole purpose of depriving some workers of a very small amount of money.  I think the Minister should explain this further.  There are eminent legal people here who would find it difficult after a lapse of 20 years to pinpoint the actual cause of a stoppage of work and decide whether it was a strike or a lock-out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision will create uncertainty. Might I remind the Minister&mdash;he may not be aware of it&mdash;that this type of situation kept the port of Dublin closed for a long time?  After a week in which there was a dispute, and during which the workers did not even picket the port, the Labour Court intervened.  A settlement had almost been reached when the question was raised as to whether the rights of the workers with regard to superannuation would be affected.  The manager at the time was doubtful and because of his doubt, the port was almost closed for an indefinite period.  Does the Minister visualise a situation arising in which part of the <Col N="1988" /> settlement of a dispute will turn on the question as to whether or not the redundancy compensation rights of workers will be affected five, ten, 15 or 20 years hence?</P>
    <P>In relation to the question raised by Deputy Dillon, it is our view that a strike, whether it be official or unofficial, should be treated in the same way as a lock-out.  No contribution towards peace in industry will be made by thinking in terms of legislating unofficial disputes out of the picture. However, this is not the time to deal with that particular matter.  I put it to the Minister: how will anyone keep the type of records which will be required for the possible purpose of depriving someone of half a week's pay, or even a day's pay?  This type of section creates nothing but problems. There is no principle involved other than that the Minister wants&mdash;I am sure it is unintentional on his part&mdash;to use this particular piece of legislation as a prelude to further legislation.  The Minister is well attuned now to the views of Deputies.  He has improved the Bill, following on consultation with certain people.  I put it to him that it would be of great benefit both to employers and workers if he were to accept this amendment.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 28 not moved.</P>
    <P>Bill, as amended, received for final consideration.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I said earlier on that I hoped to bring in the redundancy payments scheme based on this legislation on 1st January of next year and I told the House that in order to do this I would go ahead with certain administrative arrangements over the summer holiday period and later in anticipation of the Bill so that when the Bill would become law the scheme could be brought into operation without delay. I made the administrative arrangements anticipating legislation and I am satisfied that with the progress we have made it will be possible to introduce the scheme on 1st January, 1968.</P>
      <P>A stage has now been reached where I consider that I should inform the House of certain measures which are necessary to facilitate the introduction of the scheme.  These measures involve the making of announcements inviting the co-operation of people who will be affected by the scheme.  I feel that before these arrangements are made I should tell the House of my proposals.</P>
      <P>One matter on which immediate publicity is necessary relates to arrangements for the issue of redundancy contribution cards.  I would like to tell the House what is involved in this.  The redundancy cards for men will be issued through the employment exchanges and offices and the local agents of the Department of Social Welfare in conjunction with the exchange of the current social insurance cards.  Employers will accordingly on the surrender of this year's social insurance cards for male workers receive in exchange two cards for each male worker, the social welfare insurance card for 1968 and the new redundancy contribution card.  In the case of women, the social insurance cards are not due to be exchanged until the middle of the year and it will be necessary therefore to make special arrangements for the first issue of women's redundancy cards.  What is proposed is that the issuing offices, employment exchanges and so on, will issue redundancy cards for women workers on the basis of lists supplied by the employers on request.  These lists will give the names and the social insurance numbers of female employees who are to be covered by the scheme.  This procedure will require the co-operation of employers and I propose to request employers through various public announcements to send, as soon as possible, to their nearest employment exchange, employment office or Local Agent of the Department of Social Welfare a list of the names and social insurance numbers of all their female employees who come within the terms of the redundancy scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that Deputies will be in general agreement with this proposal which involves taking necessary publicity measures before the Bill is law, because it is designed to make sure that we can bring in the redundancy <Col N="1991" /> scheme on 1st January next.  I would like to give some details of my proposals in relation to publicity material. I am very concerned that workers should be fully advised of their entitlements under the proposed redundancy payments scheme when it comes into operation and I intend to take all the necessary steps to ensure that this is done.  On Committee Stage, I undertook to have a booklet about the scheme available for general information. This booklet will be available free of charge in the employment exchanges and local offices or direct from the Department of Labour on request before the 1st January next.</P>
    <P>In addition, I intend that a special leaflet for the guidance of employers on how to make their arrangements will be available free of charge, too.  I feel that those publicity measures to make workers and employers aware of their rights and obligations under the scheme are well worth having and I am sure the House will agree to this type of publicity being undertaken in anticipation of the enactment of the Bill by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has taken those steps to publicise this Bill as fully as possible and that there will be available to both employers and employees the kind of information which is very necessary for the proper working of the measure so that people will be aware of their rights in this matter.  This is a very good thing.  This matter of redundancy has been mentioned from time to time and I hope there will not be any great necessity in regard to payments under this redundancy measure.  I hope the figures will not be large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Redundancy may occur once during a person's life time or it may occur twice but the important thing is that the person who becomes redundant should be taken care of as soon as possible and as fully as possible. Another important matter is that elderly people who become redundant take more time to settle down than younger people.  One thing which struck me in relation to an amendment tabled by the Labour Party was the question of strikes.  I would very earnestly ask the Minister to look at <Col N="1992" /> this matter between now and the time he takes the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Superannuation schemes were mentioned in this context.  Hardship could be imposed on individuals in regard to superannuation schemes because of loss of service, even a number of days. That is true particularly in regard to the teaching profession, about which I know most.  Where teachers may be absent five or six days, this could mean a loss of years as regards pension.  The Minister, as Minister for Labour, occupies a position midway between employers and employees.  His job is to ensure good industrial relations. Anything he can do to keep both sides together and remove resentment of any kind as between employers and employees is something the Minister should bear in mind.</P>
    <P>I would earnestly ask the Minister between now and the time he takes this Bill to the Seanad to look again at this matter and see if he could meet the point.  I do not think it involves much but from the point of view of goodwill it could mean a great deal that the workers should not feel that this is something which would mitigate even against half a week's payment and in doing that the Minister will not be doing a disservice to anybody but as Minister for Labour, who is guiding the workers' interests at this stage, he would be doing them a great service.  I would again earnestly appeal to him to consider this matter.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has given us some of those details and proposals to go ahead with now that we have come to the end of the passage of this Bill through this House.  The members of the Labour Party have made a concerted effort in regard to this Bill.  We put forward a number of amendments and if we should take away anything from this debate it is the fact that the Bill has been improved by the amendments which have been inserted during the course of this Bill through the House. The Minister has in some cases opposed our amendments but in many other cases he has accepted them.  We look on this as a creative role.  We consider that the amendments which have been accepted have strengthened <Col N="1993" /> this legislation.  They have improved the Bill a great deal.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in my Budget Statement this year I announced that I proposed to recast extensively the legislation on the taxation of profits from dealing in or developing land which was originally enacted as Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965 and is now contained in Chapter VII of Part IV of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  I also announced that I proposed to include my proposals in <Col N="1994" /> a Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in the autumn.  The recasting of the provisions of the 1965 legislation is the primary purpose of the present Bill.  I therefore propose to discuss Part IV of the Bill, which contains my proposals for the replacement of the 1965 legislation, before going on to deal with the remaining provisions of the Bill, many of which are also of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>There is no disagreement on the fundamental need for legislation which would charge to tax profits or gains from dealing in or developing land and the criticism of the existing legislation has been directed not at the principle on which it was based but rather at the fact that the tax liability operated over too large a field.  The 1965 legislation imposed in the first instance a very wide charge and then excluded from that charge various cases in which relevant transactions could not be regarded as profit-making ventures of a trading nature.  The main criticism of that legislation arose from the fact that the exemptions did not embrace all appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>I decided at the outset that, instead of attempting to amend the existing provisions, a fresh start should be made.  Part IV of the Bill represents an entirely new approach to the problem in that it confines liability to cases in which a business of dealing in or developing land is carried on instead of laying down a very wide charge, with exemptions, as the existing legislation does.  The new provisions will be fully retrospective in so far as they give relief, but they will operate only as from the 6th April, 1968, in so far as they may impose any additional charge.</P>
    <P>Before going on to discuss the provisions of Part IV in greater detail, I should mention that when the Bill was circulated I invited interested parties to make any representations they considered necessary, and that, in response to this invitation, memoranda have been submitted to me by a number of bodies and associations concerned with tax matters.  I have considered the views of these organisations and I have arranged discussions on the points <Col N="1995" /> involved in a number of cases.  Some of these points have been disposed of satisfactorily either in correspondence or in discussion, and I am considering the outstanding points with a view to introducing any necessary amendments at Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill comprises sections 15 to 22.  Section 15, which contains a number of definitions and other provisions dealing with interpretation, closely resembles the corresponding section in the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 16, the new charging provision, is the main section of Part IV of the Bill.  As I have said, it represents a new approach in that it confines liability to cases in which a business of dealing in or developing land is carried on.  Broadly, the section provides that certain profits, not taxable under the general law, on disposals of interests in land are to be treated as trading profits and charged under Case I of Schedule D accordingly.  The profits concerned are those which would be taxable under the general law, but for the circumstances that the interest disposed of was not the full interest held by the disponer or that he did not acquire his interest with a view to turning it over at a profit.</P>
    <P>The modifications of the general law provided for in section 16 will apply only in cases in which dealing in or developing land is carried on in such a way as to constitute a business.  The section does not attempt to define the expression &ldquo;business of dealing in or developing land&rdquo; but leaves it to bear its ordinary meaning.</P>
    <P>Section 17 lays down the principles to be followed in computing the profits of a business of dealing in or developing land which is, or is deemed to be, a trade or part of a trade.  Broadly, the treatment provided for is that acquisitions and disposals of interests in land are to be treated as purchases and sales of trading stock.  Any consideration other than rent is to be brought in as a trading receipt.  Rent is, of course, fully taxable under the general law.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is designed to prevent a person chargeable on profits from dealing in land from avoiding liability by <Col N="1996" /> buying the land at an artificially high price or selling it at an artificially low price in cases where the transferor and the transferee are &ldquo;connected&rdquo; persons within the meaning of section 15 (3) and one of them does not carry on a trade of dealing in or developing land. Instead of the artificially high or low price, the section provides that for tax purposes the price will be deemed to be a price equal to the market value.</P>
    <P>Section 19, which is an anti-avoidance measure, reproduces section 101 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 with modifications which confine its application to cases in which the profit arising on the type of sale with which it is concerned would be taxable under the earlier provisions of Part IV of the Bill.  The section deals with a case in which a company formed to erect a building would, if it sold the building in the ordinary way, be chargeable on the resultant profit.  If, however, effective control over the building were transferred to the prospective purchaser by the sale to him of the company's shares, the previous holders of those shares would, in the absence of special provision, be able to obtain their profit in non-taxable form.  The broad purpose of the section is to secure that in such a case the consideration received by a previous shareholder will be taxable up to what would have been his share of the taxable profit which would have arisen to the company if it sold the building.</P>
    <P>Section 20 is designed to apply the provisions of section 19 to cases in which another company, or companies, is interposed between a company which would be within section 19 and its ultimate proprietors.  Where shares in such a holding company are sold to a person who wishes to acquire a building which a subsidiary has constructed, the seller of the shares in the holding company will be liable under section 19.</P>
    <P>Section 21 contains miscellaneous provisions bearing on the interpretation of sections 19 and 20.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that for the years 1965-66 and 1966-67, Part IV of the Bill will have effect in substitution for Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965 and that for 1967-68 and subsequent years <Col N="1997" /> it will apply in substitution for Chapter VII of Part IV of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  This is subject, however, to the proviso that, for the years 1965-66, 1966-67 and 1967-68, the application of the new provisions is not to result in increased liability in any case.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the other provisions of the Bill, most of which will make worthwhile changes in the law relating to income tax, sur-tax, corporation profits tax and stamp duties.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill is concerned with Income Tax and contains a number of important provisions.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 and 3 implement a recommendation in the Seventh Report of the Commission on Income Taxation to the effect that &ldquo;the Special Commissioners should be an appellate body only, and that all their administrative functions should be transferred to the Revenue Commissioners, who should not then be ex-officio Special Commissioners&rdquo;. The Commission also considered that the title &ldquo;Special Commissioners&rdquo; was not an apt one and recommended the substitution of &ldquo;Appeal Commissioners&rdquo;. This too is being done.</P>
    <P>Section 2 will enable the Revenue Commissioners to delegate to an authorised officer the power to make certain assessments which is being transferred to them from the Special Commissioners by Section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the time-limits within which income tax and sur-tax assessments and claims to repayment of such tax may be made.  I need hardly remind the House that we devoted a considerable amount of time on the Committee and Report Stages of the Finance Bill, 1967 to this question of time limits.  Since the Finance Bill debates, I have given a great deal of consideration to the matter and I have decided, in deference to the views expressed by Deputies on all sides of the House, to provide in this Bill, for the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Income Taxation on this question of time-limits for making assessments. Section 4 of the Bill will introduce a new time-limit of ten years within which income tax and sur-tax assessments <Col N="1998" /> may be made but this is subject to two qualifications: first, that in a case involving fraud or neglect (which is defined), assessments may be made at any time, and second, that except where there is fraud or neglect, assessments may not be made for a year earlier than 1961-62.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also extends to ten years the time-limit for making claims for repayment of income tax and sur-tax subject to the condition that this will not apply to tax for any year earlier than 1961-62.  This condition, which is in line with the provision regarding assessments, will ensure that years which are now closed cannot be reopened.</P>
    <P>Section 5 creates an obligation on persons who are chargeable to income tax and who have not been served with return forms, to give notice of their chargeability.  A similar obligation already applies to persons chargeable to sur-tax and companies chargeable to corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>Section 6 repeals a number of sections in Part VIII of the Income Tax Act, 1967 which are concerned with the machinery for issuing and obtaining returns and other information necessary for the purpose of income tax assessments. The provisions in question no longer serve any useful purpose and some of them could possibly be a source of difficulty.  Subsections (2) to (7) provide for amendments which are consequential on the repeal of section 167 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides a new relief, retrospective to the commencement of Part IX of the Finance Act, 1963, which concerned the taxation of income from rents out of lands and buildings.  The section, which will be of limited application, is designed to secure the allowance of relief by way of carry forward in respect of interest on borrowed money employed in the purchase, improvement or repair of the premises where the taxpayer's circumstances are such that effective relief cannot be granted in the year of assessment.</P>
    <P>Section 8 corrects a minor drafting error.  Section 9 exempts from Irish tax, with effect from 1967-68, retirement <Col N="1999" /> pensions and annuities payable under the United States Social Security Act or the United States Railroad Retirement Act.  As things stand, these retirement benefits are not chargeable to tax in the United States and it has been represented that the fact that they are liable to tax in this country is not alone unjust but is also a serious disincentive to persons of Irish origin and other who now reside in the United States from coming to live in this country on their retirement.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill, which deals with Stamp Duties, contains three sections, all of which are designed to reduce the duties on certain kinds of instruments.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is designed to bring the duty on a life insurance policy for a period not exceeding two years into line with that charged on a policy of insurance against accident, by substituting a duty of sixpence for the present <i>ad valorem</i> charge of ten shillings per £1,000 of the capital sum insured.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Section 11 is to reduce the cost of equipment-leasing schemes by limiting the charge of Stamp Duty on agreements for the hire of goods, wares, merchandise, plant and machinery to the fixed duties which now apply in the case of hire-purchase and credit-sale agreements. Instead of the existing rate of 2s. 6d. for every £5 of the periodical payment, the new fixed rates will be 6d for an agreement under hand and ten shillings for an agreement under seal.  The section also exempts from the greater charge guarantees of sums payable under agreements for hire.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is designed to reduce the heavy Stamp Duty which would, under existing law, be charged on a foreign issue of bearer bonds.  Instead of the present rates which run as high as £2 per cent, duty will, under this section, be charged at the rate of 2s 6d per cent in the case of a foreign issue of bearer bonds made by a concern within the State and expressed in the currency of a country outside the sterling area.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides time-limits for corporation profits tax assessments <Col N="2000" /> corresponding to those provided for income tax and sur-tax assessments by section 4.  Section 14 and Part V of the Schedule provide that the appellate functions exercised by the Special Commissioners in relation to corporation profits tax will be transferred to the Appeal Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I now come to Part V of the Bill. Section 23 provides that references to the Special Commissioners in the enactments relating to turnover tax are to be construed as references to the Appeal Commissioners.  The provisions of the turnover tax enactments containing such references apply also, as appropriate, to wholesale tax. Section 24 amends section 27 (3) of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, so as to secure that it will apply to persons appointed as Appeal Commissioners as it has hitherto applied to persons appointed as Special Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 25 is designed to remove a doubt as to whether the Collector General is a creditor within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Acts so as to enable him to take proceedings in bankruptcy in his own name.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides superannuation terms for established Appeal Commissioners who are not established civil servants before appointment as Appeal or Special Commissioners.  As Deputies will be aware, it has been a long standing practice to appoint one of the Special Commissioners from outside the Civil Service.  The person appointed has usually been a barrister of standing and, because of the relatively late age at which such a person is appointed, the superannuation position can give rise to difficulties.  It is essential, of course, that if persons of the required calibre are to be attracted, special superannuation terms should be offered.  Since the post of Appeal Commissioner is a quasi-judicial one, it is reasonable to apply to it superannuation terms in line with those enjoyed by district justices and county registrars instead of the normal Civil Service terms.</P>
    <P>Section 27 contains the usual provisions on short title and construction.</P>
    <P>I think that, in principle, the provisions contained in this Bill will be welcomed by Deputies on all sides of <Col N="2001" /> the House.  It contains little if anything of a disagreeable nature.  Some of its provisions are necessarily complex but I will be glad to give any explanation which may be called for at the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I now ask the House to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is, of course, correct in saying that the main reason for this Bill is Part IV, and the only reason why Part IV of this Bill has to be introduced is because of wooden obstinacy by the Minister's predecessor, who is now Taoiseach, in 1965.  In 1965, everyone told the then Minister for Finance that Part VII of the Finance Bill for that year&mdash;the part dealing with the profits or gains attached to developing land&mdash;would not work.  Everybody told him his approach to it was all wrong but he would not give one inch.</P>
      <P>What has been the result?  One of the worst results of it has been the creation of a shortage of building land around the city of Dublin which has pushed up inevitably the high cost of site developments in and around the city of Dublin.  There is no doubt whatever, as anybody who is at all acquainted with the position will verify, that the prime follow-through from the wooden approach in the 1965 Act was to mean that land was held back that otherwise would have been available much earlier for building development. It is only, in fact, since the announcement by the Minister for Finance in the Budget of the broad outline of what was intended now that more land has been coming forward.</P>
      <P>While I agree with what the Minister said today at the end of his statement about Deputies quarrelling with this Bill in broad outline now, at the same time it must be put on record that it was the Fianna Fáil Party, and the present Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, who created the mess from which the present Minister for Finance is trying to extricate the existing legislation. I do not think he has done it entirely successfully in this Bill.  I think there is considerable room for uncertainty in some of the provisions of the relevant sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition section, section 15, <Col N="2002" /> and the charging section, section 16, still leave a very great opening for uncertainty.  I appreciate, of course, that we shall discuss these things in much greater detail on Committee Stage, but it is only right we should indicate to some degree the defects that people outside see in the interpretation of the Bill as introduced.  I am afraid the second paragraph on page three of the Minister's statement is not true. The modifications of the general law provided for in section 16, according to the Minister's statement today, will apply only in cases in which dealing in or developing land is carried out in such a way, et cetera.  It does not attempt to define the term &ldquo;business of dealing in or developing land&rdquo;.  It does not attempt to define &ldquo;business&rdquo; but it most certainly attempts to define &ldquo;development&rdquo;; and one of the quarrels I have with this Bill is the way in which &ldquo;development&rdquo; is defined.</P>
    <P>As I understand the approach in relation to this Bill, it is desired not to bring into the tax net a person who has no connection of any sort with developers themselves, be they builders or other developers, but who wants to dispose of property so that someone else entirely unconnected can develop it and so that the transaction or transactions by the owner will be entirely capital transactions.  I admit that is not a very systematic definition but it is a rough, round statement.</P>
    <P>That was what the then Minister for Finance in 1965 alleged he was attempting to do in that year, but we told him at that time that he would not achieve it&mdash;that he would merely create a situation in which no one would know where he stood.  Everybody will agree, and the Minister for Finance would be the first, that one of the essential things in relation to taxation is that the incidence of that taxation would be certain.  Where are we in relation to taking the Minister up on this paragraph dealing with development? &ldquo;Development&rdquo; means, according to section 15:</P>
    <P>in relation to any land, the construction, demolition, extension, alteration or reconstruction of any <Col N="2003" /> building on the land or the carrying out of any engineering or other operation in, on, over or under the land to adapt it for materially altered use; and &ldquo;developing&rdquo; and &ldquo;developed&rdquo; shall be construed correspondingly.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The carrying out of any engineering or other operation in, on, over or under the land to adapt it for materially altered use.&rdquo;  Take land used as grassland for many years.  If it were ploughed, it would have an engineering or other operation.  It would be a &ldquo;materially altered use&rdquo;.  If it were then sold, that would be &ldquo;development&rdquo;. There should not be any doubt whatever that that is not intended in the Bill.  There could be, for example, a man&mdash;there is one very near my own home&mdash;who has some land that he wants to sell for building sites, which is entirely desirable.  He fences three sites off and sells each of these sites to three different people who want and need a site badly to erect a house.  The mere fencing-off of these sites undoubtedly brings him within the phraseology of &ldquo;development&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When one bears that in mind and when one goes on to consider, then, the wording of section 16, we see that the activities of a business of dealing in or developing land are included in that section.  The word &ldquo;business&rdquo; is not defined.  It is undoubtedly not merely possible but easy to argue that the sale of sites 1,2,3, consecutively, in a short period of time, means that there is a business in selling sites.  Because of the word &ldquo;development&rdquo; and the meaning of &ldquo;development&rdquo; in section 16, it means that the man who has marked off and fenced off these three sites is thereupon involved in the business of developing land under this section and, as such, is subject to what in fact is, in that case, a capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>If we are to be able to provide&mdash;I think we should provide&mdash;a method by virtue of which there should not be a capital gains tax on one sort of property alone, then it seems to me clear that we must make this Bill far more certain and, at the same time&mdash;and I give this completely to the Minister&mdash; make it far more certain in a way that <Col N="2004" /> will not permit of avoidance by those who are in fact engaged in what we commonly call the building industry. But we must make the provisions of the Bill such that the ordinary case cannot be caught.</P>
    <P>This is not something that has been thought of merely by one or two people.  Virtually every memorandum I have seen on this Bill, and every article that has been published in any paper, makes the comment that there is no certainty that the type of capital transaction that I have indicated will not be caught.  It is all very well to say that this is not intended and that nobody need worry about it.  That was one of the arguments used in relation to the 1965 Act.  Yet, the effect of it has been that, since that Act was enacted, a great deal of time and ingenuity has had to be spent in endeavouring to see if ways could be found to ensure that, within the provisions of the law, people would be enabled to carry out their business as the then Minister for Finance suggested they should but which, in fact, within the ambit of that Bill, was not possible and, in consequence, many people held back what otherwise would have been satisfactory building sites, with the consequent scarcity which we have seen in the past two years.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I think, quite deliberately, probably, used the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; and refused to define it but made the mistake, as I have indicated already, in doing that, of defining another word that came into the operation of the section.  As far as I know, the first use of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; in a taxing Act was in 1915 in the excess profits tax inclusion there.  It was used, further on, in corporation profits tax.  Since then, the courts have always construed the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; in tax cases in its widest possible sense.</P>
    <P>When one considers that aspect on the one hand, and when one considers, on the other, that the business must be related to the definition included in subsection (1) of section 15, which definition includes for &ldquo;development&rdquo;&ldquo;any engineering or other operation in, on, over or under the land to adapt it for a materially altered use&rdquo; we then <Col N="2005" /> see that this so-called relaxation as drafted now is something that requires much more than the wooden approach of the Minister for Finance of 1965. We shall have opportunities, on Committee Stage, of going into the wording of it.</P>
    <P>Let nobody think, however, that the Minister for Finance, in introducing this Bill, is conferring a great Fianna Fáil benefit on mankind.  He is making an effort to redeem or to attempt to redeem a serious blunder made by his predecessor who is now the Leader of his Party and of the Government.  The reason I have said &ldquo;attempt&rdquo; is that I think the Minister has completely failed in his purpose.  The memoranda submitted to the Minister by some of the people concerned indicated their difficulties in this respect.  I know that some of these bodies, in submitting memoranda to him, have had the advantage of opinions of counsel well qualified to deal with company and taxing matters.  We have seen similar comments in the newspapers.  An article in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 3rd October, 1967, for example, makes it clear that the weakness of the Bill lies in the charging section.  It seems, according to the barrister who made that comment there, that the attempt to be definitive has had the result that a charging section with the dual purpose that is involved in section 16 seems to include virtually any transaction without exception.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also take note of articles that were written in another newspaper.  Unfortunately, I have not got the date of it and I think by the type that it was also the <i>Irish Times</i> but I am not sure.  In it comment was made on the wide legal and judicial definition of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo;.  In the article it was set out that if the courts here were to follow the definitions in British courts of &ldquo;business&rdquo; in the various tax cases that have been heard it would seem inevitable, on the same line of reasoning, that anyone who sells land with a view to profit must be held to be carrying on a business of dealing with lands, no matter for how long he had held that land, no matter whether the necessity for the sale of the land arose because, perhaps, <Col N="2006" /> of death duties payable on the death of a predecessor in title, or perhaps because of a sale being necessary by reason of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, or any other reason of that sort where property is sold by consecutive transactions rather than by one global transaction.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the effect of that uncertainty that there is in relation to Part IV of this Bill is going to achieve what I desire, that there would be a greater availability of sites for building without the capital gains tax on that availability.  We shall, therefore, have to consider very carefully in Committee the desirability of an amendment to it. I should like also, apart from commenting on Part IV, to ask the Minister some general questions in relation to taxation.  I understood that we were going to have made available to us a copy of the Income Tax Act, 1967, in loose-leaf form.  I am disappointed to see that there has been no progress yet towards that availability.  The loose-leaf edition of the stamp legislation has been of inestimable value and it is to be hoped that something similar will be made available in relation to the very bulky income tax volume.</P>
    <P>I understood also, as I am on the question of separate types of Acts, that we were going to see long before this a new consolidating book, as apart from consolidating statute, in relation to the Death Duties Acts, that we were going to be able to get something in relation to death duties on the same basis as we have already got in relation to stamp duties.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not made adequate staff available to get that work done.  I say that the Minister has not made adequate staff available to get that work publicised because I know that those who are concerned in the Estate Duty Office in the preparation of that type of volume, from the Assistant Secretary in charge of that office downwards, must be, and are, particularly anxious to provide that the benefit of their work and research would be available to the public as a whole.</P>
    <P>I must confess also that I find great difficulty in understanding section 2 of this Bill and the manner in which there has been no restriction at all in <Col N="2007" /> it.  As I follow it, it says that anything that the Revenue Commissioners may do they may delegate to any officer, no matter how lowly or how junior that officer may be.  It is no argument to say that the Revenue Commissioners are not going to delegate their function too low, there should be a statutory restriction in a delegatory power of that sort to make quite certain that the delegation must be held up to a certain level and that they cannot delegate functions below that particular grade.  In fact, there has been a general tendency in all legislation, not merely in taxing legislation, to provide that where a Minister is empowered to delegate to certain personnel that the grade to which that delegation can be effected must be specifically nominated.  It is widely so in various aspects of the Land Acts, in Agricultural Acts, Fisheries Acts and in Factory Acts where there is any question of inspection and so forth. This is the nearest analogy I could get to that.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of ballyhoo by the Minister and by people writing about this Bill in relation to section 4. I do not think that section 4 conveys at all the widely publicised benefits that are alleged in respect of it.  What does it say?  It says that an assessment cannot be made at any time later than ten years provided that it is not a case in which there has been any form of fraud or neglect.  Of course, we all accept that if there is any question of fraud at all the Revenue Commissioners must be entitled to go back. There was considerable argument here about whether the fraud was to be fraud in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners or fraud in the opinion of the courts.  That seems to be gone now.  Then it refers to any form of neglect.  There is, for example, a statutory obligation on every person to produce a proper return of his taxable income.  If a person sincerely believed that something that has occurred in his affairs was not taxable, did not, therefore, include it in his return and it was discovered by the Revenue Commissioners 12 years later, he could be made amenable for it <Col N="2008" /> under this section because he had been in neglect of the statutory obligation to return all his income.  That is no concession at all.</P>

      <P>No, it is not.  What we asked was in relation to preventing fraud but otherwise to provide that the ten years would be there.  But it virtually means, because of the statutory provision, that every single case can be caught without any restriction to the ten-year rule.  I thought also that there was a clear implication in the report of the taxation commission that, while there would be the restriction on the one hand for ten years, equally on the other hand the period for repayment would go back for ten years.  In fact, it does not.  The effect of subsection (5) (b) of section 4 means it goes on from 1961-62 but not behind that year.  In other words, it goes back six years from now but hereafter the restriction is for ten years, not six years.  The same balance is not preserved. What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister considers subsection (5) (b) he will find it does not operate in that way.  The reason in relation to the provision for neglect is contained in section 5 of the Bill itself, which provides for what is, in fact, neglect.  Some people might say that section 8 reveals that there is something slipshod in the consolidating Income Tax Act of 1967.  It is a tribute to those who drafted and dealt with that Act that only a very trifling thing like this has turned up.</P>
      <P>I will admit frankly I do not quite follow the reasoning behind section 12 of the Bill unless because where bearers of securities are transferring outside the State it would be virtually impossible for the Minister to succeed in any event in collecting duty.  He may have been making the best of a bad job in making it not illegal to have these transfers because, even if they were illegal, he would have no power to control operations outside Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2009" /> There are some other matters I would have hoped the Minister would have included in his Miscellaneous Provisions Bill.  One of the effects of the rebate and allowances provided in relation to children for death duty purposes in section 29 of the Finance Act, 1965, as amended by section 19 of the Finance Act, 1966, has been that, where there is a provision that a child will succeed if and when it attains a certain age, then no allowance for death duty purposes is given in respect of that child when the claim arises.  It means, therefore, that if there is a provision that a testator, for example, gives property to a widow for life and equally among such of his children as may attain the age of 21 years, no allowance is given for the children at this stage.  When the children do attain 21 years the allowance is then given. That is a most cumbersome method of dealing with the situation.  It would be far better to reverse it around and to provide that the allowance would be given forthwith, but that if a child died and did not for that reason attain a vested interest, if his or her contingent interest became divested, there would be an extra claim for duty to the extent of the allowances made.  Otherwise, duty has to be paid now with a rebate later on, with the consequent trouble involved.  In addition, it means that the duty is being paid at a time when there is inevitably a greater shortage of funds rather than when, by reason of a death at a later stage, a claim would not arise.</P>
    <P>Complaint has been made to me also in relation to section 9 of the Bill, which exempts payment under the American Social Security Act and the Railroad Act there.  The complaint is that it is unfair to people afforded a pension by a foreign government, particularly people forced to emigrate in their early years, who then came back here to finish their days in their own country.  Why would they not likewise receive the concessions included in section 9, particularly when we bear in mind that by their coming here they are improving our balance of payments position?  I was surprised, too, that the Minister did not in relation to a miscellaneous tax Bill consider attuning <Col N="2010" /> our taxation laws more to the European Community.  Perhaps he has made up his mind that that is so far away he is going to have plenty of time to consider what would be desirable there.</P>
    <P>The basic problem every individual has to consider in relation to salary is what his take-home pay, his purchasing power, is going to be.  I came across this week in one of the journals, <i>Management Today,</i> some rather interesting figures, which, unfortunately, do not include us.  It makes quite clear one of the reasons why they are complaining on the other side of the brain drain.  When we go on to consider how we stand in relation to similar people in the United Kingdom, we can see that we are in the same danger.  In terms of a person carrying on the same job in the UK, Germany, France, Holland, Italy and Denmark, the job has been assessed by this international firm as carrying in the United Kingdom a salary of £2,000 a year&mdash;and this is before tax&mdash;of carrying in Germany the equivalent of £2,600; in France, £2,780, in Holland, £2,410; in Italy, £2,540, and in Denmark, £2,600.  The purchasing power, after taxation has been taken, is, in the United Kingdom, £1,640; in Germany, £2,110; in France, £2,020; in Holland, £1,740; in Italy, £1,820; and in Denmark, £1,620.</P>
    <P>Taking that analogy, and so far as we can make an analogy here, after any provisions of the 1967 Budget, it would seem that our people, whom we must consider from the point of view of a brain drain would be about equivalent to the United Kingdom personnel, would be very much worse off than the French because there is a quite substantial percentage worsening as between us and France.  Our take-home pay would be about 85.4 per cent on this level for a married man with two children, as was the assessment taken in <i>Management Today</i> to which I have referred, compared with 94 per cent of France.  We would be worse off than all those countries in the Community, even if we are to accept that we are more or less on a par as regards purchasing power and take-home pay after tax, with the United Kingdom.  That will not help us at all to develop in this <Col N="2011" /> technological age when we must make an effort to take advantage of every possible piece of brainpower that the country has and could use.</P>
    <P>I was hoping, too, we might see in this Bill something towards the oft-expressed views of Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance that we intend to do something to streamline and to reduce the Civil Service.  I remember the great flourish of trumpets that the then Deputy Dr. Ryan made when he took over as Minister for Finance and said he would succeed in reducing the numbers of civil servants and streamlining the Civil Service machine.  We have had that intention or promise oft-repeated by Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance. We have not seen any sign whatever of their being able to make any successful move in that direction.</P>
    <P>I wonder did the Minister, if I might conclude in a lighter vein, come across an article by Anthony Lejeune where he advocated that the only way of reversing Parkinson's Law in relation to a civil service was to provide that any civil servant who succeeded in abolishing another civil service post should for the remainder of his career receive the salary of both jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>Without going quite as far as that, I do think there is not enough inducement in the Civil Service for people to provide ideas, to push their ideas and to ensure that, when they see, as many of them do, personnel waste, and waste in administrative procedures, that waste would be eliminated.  The tendency, unfortunately, is far more the other way.  I would have hoped, without going further into that humorous vein, that we would see some real results along the road of streamlining the Civil Service today in Ireland and making its procedures more in accord with the job that has to be done by a civil servant nowadays, which is not merely restricted as it used to be in the Department of Finance to preventing unauthorised expenditure.  The job should be very much more to ensure <Col N="2012" /> that there is better value for that expenditure, and that the productivity which is so frequently preached by Ministers for Industry and Commerce would be brought home to the Departments of which Ministers are the political heads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure like all tax legislations, is mainly a Committee Stage Bill, and to try to discuss it properly here tonight would take very much longer that is available to us.  I propose therefore to be very brief, but there are a few comments which I think should be made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman referred to the brain drain and expressed concern about the effect of the tax laws on the people in that category.  I would be more concerned about the brawn drain because the tax laws on those who are earning by the sweat of their brows, so to speak, are so severe that the drain from this country is very substantial. A question answered today by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach showed that there was a loss of 150,000 jobs from 1951 to date.  I am afraid a lot of this can be put down to the fact that our tax laws are becoming more and more severe on the unfortunate man who has to earn his living as a labourer or a craftsman.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister remembers, but when the Budget debate was going on in this House earlier this year, I brought to his attention the fact that since 1955 no alteration has been made in tax concessions to workingclass people, that at the time the taxable income of a single man was about £6 5s. per week, and since the average wage in rural Ireland, indeed in many of the towns, was then about £5 a week, he could earn over a £1 of this money or one-fifth of his earnings as overtime without being taxed.  We have now reached the stage where wages are between £9 and £14 and the taxable income is still around £6 5s.-£6 10s.  It is ridiculous that when legislation dealing with taxation is introduced, some attempt is not made by the Minister to remedy such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree also with Deputy Sweetman when he says that what is sauce for the <Col N="2013" /> goose is sauce for the gander.  The Minister said that the same law applies to tax assessment as to the question of the date from which tax can be recovered. I have been reading through the Bill.  It did not appear like that to me but if the Minister says it I will take his word.  There is very little concession made for the person who has made a mistake.  The Minister uses the words &ldquo;fraud or neglect&rdquo;.  All of us will accept fraud.  An error of any kind can be attributed to neglect.  A person deemed guilty of neglect is liable to have his assessment brought back to the commencement of the State.  The case was well made before by a Deputy on these benches that a person might have been in a position to pay tax if it was known to be due whereas ten, 15 or 20 years later that person might not be in a position to pay the tax without grave hardship.  If, due to error on the part of a citizen, liability to tax was not apparent it is most unfair that tax should be recoverable with the result, as in one case that I know of, a person in a small line of business could be put out of business.  The Minister should have another look at that section. &ldquo;Neglect&rdquo; covers a multitude and the Minister might be a little more explicit.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, Part IV is the kernel of the Bill.  We will all welcome anything which will obviate a situation which has been building up for a number of years, mainly due to the Planning Act of 1965, that the amount of building land available became scarcer and scarcer and people were being forced into areas around towns and cities and even villages.  While this was happening the sharks were sailing around waiting for somebody to tip them the wink that certain areas would be areas for development and then they bought up all the land and waited for the demand to grow, until the scarcity of land became apparent.  The result is that land which they bought at £50 to £100 per acre is being sold at £500 to £1,000 for a site comprising 50 feet by 100 feet.  Anything which will have the result of taking illgotten gains from these people should be welcomed by the House.</P>
    <P>We talk about what happens in Dublin City, but I know of rural areas <Col N="2014" /> where the local authorities have been asked for £2,000 per acre for undeveloped land because the people who own the land or who had bought the land in a hurry realised that they could cash in.  The local authorities could not buy it and the persons concerned were able to hold on until somebody with more money came into view and then they made a quick profit and got out.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter about which I am not clear and the Minister may possibly explain it.  The definition of land is probably in some other Act. It is not in this Bill.  Do sites on which there is already a building constitute land?  If so, does it mean that somebody in this city who buys an old building and allows it to go into disrepair, knocks it down or resells it, is caught by this Bill or is he able to get out because of the fact that there is a building on the site?  Recently I had the experience of the argument being successfully upheld that a site was not land within the meaning of the Act. Would the Minister tell me whether or not the definition is contained in some other Act and, if not, what is land within the meaning of this Bill?  It is important that this should be known.</P>
    <P>There is far too much of this thing of people thinking it is smart to know how to get information and how to use it and that we should be inclined to be amused by the clever fellow who has got enough money to use information &mdash;no matter where he got it.  We should remember that these people are doing a great disservice to the State and to their neighbours and to those waiting to get homes of their own.  While this Bill means that the State will get certain moneys from these people it will not remedy the situation because, as Deputy Sweetman has said, a great deal of harm has been done over the past few years and I would agree with him that the Finance Act and the Planning Act of 1965 were mainly responsible for the situation that we now have.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any comment to make on the question of streamlining our tax laws?  We hear a great deal about the EEC and the harmonisation of tax law that is in operation.  Has the Minister considered that matter or <Col N="2015" /> will he continue the existing tax law? Does he feel, as Deputy Sweetman suggested, that there is ample time in which to make a change and that the next decade does not matter very much as far as harmonisation of tax law is concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the rather murmured remarks of the Minister towards the end of his introductory statement, I understood him to say something to the effect that there was nothing very distasteful in this Bill.  I must take issue with him on that.  I think the Bill could generally be described as another piece of machinery emanating from the Department of Finance designed and calculated for the express purpose of enabling the Revenue Commissioners to get more money from the taxpayer and to cause greater anxiety and more concern to the unfortunate people who are the subject matter of the Revenue Commissioners' researches.  Certainly, whether that description of the Bill be correct or not, there is no question whatever that there is not a single portion of this Bill that gives the taxpayer any ease of any substantial measure at all and there is certainly nothing in it that conveys any incentive to industry to expand or any hope for a further increase in agricultural or industrial employment or production. This is a Bill merely to get more money, as I understand it, and it will cause more anxiety, concern and harassment to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>It will be of no great consequence to the ordinary taxpayer to know that this Bill will give a measure of relief to those people who are unloading foreign bonds in this country.  It will not be of great concern to anybody to learn that that heavy taxation will be relieved.  There is very little hope either for the general taxpayer in the reduction from 10/- to 6d on the very small policies of insurance referred to in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see nothing in this Bill to give any hope to the taxpayer, nothing in the Bill to fulfil the functions that a Finance Bill ought to fulfil as being an instrument of economic concern <Col N="2016" /> and the furtherance of the economic betterment of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman has referred to Part IV, and so has Deputy Tully, on the question of what is now to be called, as I understand it, taxation of the business of carrying on the development of land.  Deputy Tully will have no great difficulty in learning from experience that in no Act is there a definition of &ldquo;land.&rdquo;  So far as I can see this is a matter more for Committee Stage than Second Stage.  The part of the Bill dealing with the carrying on of the business of development of land may result in bringing more revenue into the Treasury, but it certainly will not result in bringing more houses at economic rents or prices to the hard pressed community who are looking for houses.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, this is really a Committee Stage Bill.  I want to deal with two topics only in any great detail.  I should like to deal first with the provision relating to the Appeal Commissioners.  This was put in at the outset of the Bill and I suppose the Minister, when he said he was carrying out the recommendations of the Commission on Income Taxation, thought he was doing something grand.  It goes a little distance, but only a very little distance, to cover the area dealing with these Appeal Commissioners.  This should have been long since covered, and it should be covered in this Bill. These people were known as Special Commissioners and the Minister is now calling them Appeal Commissioners. He is taking away the administrative duties which they had before, nominally at least, but which in recent years they did not carry out to any great extent.  They become Appeal Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The House should appreciate the fact that these people who are now called Appeal Commissioners are very important from the point of view of the taxpayers.  They should be their guardians and the persons to whom they can look for justice from excessive depreciations by income tax inspectors, and excessive charges for income tax and sur-tax.  They are the persons provided by law for appeal against assessments of income tax and other surcharges <Col N="2017" /> of that kind.  They ought to be in a judicial position.  It is recognised in this Bill that they are not in a judicial position.  The Minister gave the show away, gave his whole case away, when he said they are in&mdash;and I think this is the phrase he used&mdash;a quasijudicial position.  If that is the position he wants them to be in, and that they are in under this Bill, the sooner they are taken out of that position the better.</P>
    <P>They ought to be in a judicial position and they are not in that position at present.  That is what I want to advocate on this stage of the Bill and in subsequent Stages, so far as I can. They are called Appeal Commissioners and they should be judicial functionaries. Their whole function should be to stand between the taxpayer and the Minister for Finance.  The taxpayer should be in a position to know that when he goes to have his case heard, the person hearing it is independent of the Minister for Finance, a person he can trust to give an independent hearing to his case, and that they are not civil servants as they are at present. Some little advance has been made. When I went originally as counsel before the Revenue Commissioners&mdash; these people were called Special Commissioners then&mdash;they were sitting cheek by jowl with the inspector of taxes before the taxpayer I was representing came into the room and they had probably discussed it beforehand with him.</P>

      <P>They are now to be called Appeal Commissioners but they are being allowed by a subsequent section in the Bill to remain civil servants.  Section 24 provides:</P>
      <P>Section 27 (3) of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, is hereby amended by the substitution of &ldquo;under section 156 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, to be an Appeal Commissioner&rdquo; for &ldquo;under subsection (1) of section 67 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, to be a commissioner for the special purposes of the Income Tax Acts&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 27 of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, provides that the Special Commissioners who are now to be called Appeal Commissioners are to be appointed by the Minister for Finance in an unestablished position unless he makes them established.  The position is that they are to be appointed by the Minister for Finance, in an unestablished position, as civil servants and to remain civil servants, servants of the Minister for Finance who is collecting revenue from the taxpayers and they are supposed to stand in a judicial position between the taxpayers and the Minister for Finance.  It is utterly wrong that that should be so, and the Minister merely glibly throws across the floor of the House &ldquo;Why did you not do it?&rdquo; That merely shows how weak is the ground he feels himself on.  Whether I was wrong does not answer the question and whether I should have done it does not answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people are Appeal Commissioners and they are being allowed under this Bill to remain civil servants appointed by the Minister for Finance in an unestablished capacity, if the Minister thinks that right.  No judicial person should be in that position.  How will they get the trust of the people whose cases they are trying unless they are in an independent position. These people should be independent of <Col N="2019" /> the Minister and there should be a provision in this Bill to the effect that they hold their office, like judges, on their good behaviour and they should be appointed by the Government certainly, not by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>That is absolute nonsense.  This is supposed to be a cheap tribunal of easy access.  A person is supposed to be able to go in with his accountant and deal with the matter in a business-like way and not have to go to the expense of going to the courts.  This is what should be done here.  It should be taken away from the Department of Finance and given to the Government&mdash;like the judges. These people should not be in the position of being unestablished civil servants. They have to deal with taxpayers' rights of a very difficult and very trying character.  They are vital to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>The second and last point I want to speak to on this Bill has already been dealt with by Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Tully, that is, section 4.  This section means, in fact, that there is no limitation in relation to the raising of additional assessments no matter what the period of time.  As has been stated both by Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Tully, nobody objects to the Revenue Commissioners having power to make additional assessments when fraud is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2020" /> No matter what the Minister may say, I can say for myself that I personally took away from the Land Commission the privilege of having unlimited time for the recovery of debts. That was done under the Statute of Limitations.  Revenue are the only ones left now and this means that there will be no statutory limitation of any practical kind in connection with the assessment of people.  There is no doubt about that.  The Minister was an accountant and he must remember; there is no doubt about that proposition. I know places in which pressure was brought to bear and the people involved suffered nervous breakdowns and were almost brought to the verge of insanity.  People go through quite extraordinary mental anguish when they are caught up in the turmoils of income tax.</P>
    <P>There should be a specific limitation on the right of an inspector of taxes, or anybody else, to re-open a transaction that has been closed, unless on the grounds of fraud.  Fraud is always a let-out in relation to a statutory limitation. The situation should be the same for the Revenue Commissioners and only in cases of fraud should they be allowed to re-open transactions.  Under this section, any transaction can be re-opened up to a period of ten years. Thereafter any transaction can, in effect, be re-opened because of the definition of neglect.  I should like Deputy Tully to consider the position of a workingman under this section.  He is bound to write to the inspector of taxes or walk into the office and say: &ldquo;I am subject to tax.  Will you please assess me?&rdquo; It will be a new thing in this country to have people in the category of workingmen, who are subject to income tax, having to walk in to the inspector of taxes and ask him to please assess them.  If a workingman liable to income tax does not do so, he is liable to a penalty and ten years later he is liable to have his entire tax position opened up.</P>
    <P>In subsection (2) (b) neglect means negligence.  As has already been pointed out, negligence has a very wide interpretation.  An honest mistake can be made; that honest mistake can result in a person being <Col N="2021" /> harassed by an inspector of taxes for 15 or 20 years afterwards. Neglect means negligence or a failure to give notice.  An unmarried man earning £20 a week must sit down and write to the inspector of taxes telling him that he is liable to tax.  If he does not do so, he can be assessed any time thereafter.  To say there is nothing distasteful in this Bill is a misdescription.</P>

      <P>It is a pity&mdash; perhaps it is the by-election&mdash;that Deputy Sweetman introduced a particular note into his speech on this Bill.

I am sorry Deputy Costello has left the House because I wanted to ask him a few questions.</P>
      <P>In this Bill the Minister is obviously trying to meet a certain situation and certain arguments which were made.  I have no close association with either the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners and I hold no particular brief for them, but these people have a job to do.

      <P>I do not want to introduce a personal note.  I want to talk about the job of work that has to be done by the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  I should like to remind Deputy Tully that we are all very vocal when we want something.  We are very vocal about social services and all sorts of State expenditure, but we seem to take a different line when it comes to the question of getting money to pay for it. That might be a salutary thought to start a discussion like this.  We have had huge State development sought by every Party in this House and that development has to be paid for.  Therefore, we must face a Bill of this nature with the realistic knowledge that no matter how much a Minister wants to do&mdash;and in this case the Minister is trying to meet the constructive points made on a previous occasion&mdash;he and his Department have the task of seeing that revenues are furnished for running the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2023" /> The reason I make that comment is simply because extreme attitudes such as those adopted by Deputy Costello do not help in those circumstances. Those problems are not easily solved nor can they be solved as Deputy Tully seems to think when he talks about relief of taxation and so forth.  Deputy Tully on other occasions would be the very one who would want to spend more money.  If we can get this Bill back into perspective we might get further on it.</P>
    <P>To my mind it is encouraging that even with the pressures that are there in modern times a Bill like this should be introduced with the present approach behind it.  I have no doubt I could suggest some very admirable amendments or suggestions for inclusion in this Bill which would get very popular acclaim but I can equally well imagine that these could hardly be implemented for very good and practical reasons.  What really got me on my feet about Deputy Costello's speech was his strong advocacy. There might be a different point of view on this.  I for one am prepared to advocate a different point of view on the function of the Appeal Commissioners. He seized on the word of the Minister &ldquo;quasi-judicial&rdquo;.  I want to say that provided the proper judicial functions are preserved it may be administrative efficiency to provide for quasi-judicial functions within the framework of the Civil Service which may save time and money for the State and for the client.  I would go all the way with Deputy Costello if there was not the judicial appeal available but as I understand it and I would like to be corrected on this if I am wrong, I have not practised law for 17 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see, when there are appeals to the court available, the force of Deputy Costello's argument. On the other side, I see the advantages of having an administrative procedure that will make it only necessary to appeal to the courts when there is some fundamental question of right or where the court should be appropriately invoked.  The difficulty about this taxation business is that it is so much on the borderline between what I might call individual rights which must be safeguarded and administration.  I would be prepared to argue the case for the present set-up if Deputy Costello were challenging that, always, of course, on the basis that there is the appeal to the courts.  On the other hand, I would go a little bit further and perhaps tease Deputy Costello with this thought: there are a number of people who are concerned and I am one of them with the constant filching of jurisdiction&mdash;I do not want that word &ldquo;filching&rdquo; to be taken in any wrong sense&mdash;but there is under modern conditions in every modern state that I know of this side of the Iron Curtain a tendency for judicial functions and jurisdiction of the courts to be appropriated by the administration in the name and under the duress of efficiency.  This, I feel, is something that should be resisted as far as possible. The stock argument against the normal procedure of the courts is the question of time and cost but notwithstanding that I feel the principle is extremely important and that it is better wherever possible to leave the full jurisdiction in the courts.  If Deputy Costello wants to set up a fully judicial tribunal within the Service or something like that it seems to be cutting across the appropriate functions of the courts.  At least that is how it seems to me.  It was to make those points that I got up.  The difficulty about Deputy Costello's point is his extreme advocacy here and his extreme interpretation and <Col N="2025" /> approach to this which has not been very helpful and there is another point of view.</P>
      <P>To my mind an important thing is that machinery provides as far as possible for fairness.  I hear an awful lot by implication.  It seems to be fashionable to suggest that all inspectors of taxes and people like that are ogres going about seeking whom they may devour.  I have no brief for them but there are an awful lot of people who would evade their lawful debts also and there is a function to be performed for the community here.  I do not think it helps to approach the taxpayer on the basis that he is a complete criminal because most people are fundamentally honest and let me say that one can go too far in assuming powers just to get those people who are fraudulent but there is a balance to be struck.  But then, one should also realise that the people with the responsibility of dealing with these matters on the official side are equally worthy human beings and that, by and large, the same standards of integrity and honesty at least would be found among them as among the body of the public. There is no point in approaching this from the ogre complex point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, I did not accuse the Deputy of that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>What I did accuse the Deputy of was setting the ball rolling on the wrong lines with a somewhat carping approach to this Bill.  I did not accuse the Deputy of the other certainly.  When Deputy Sweetman intervened I was about to say that one of the things that has struck me outside &mdash; Deputy Byrne might perhaps confirm this&mdash;is that accountants and people who have to deal with the State machinery in these matters&mdash;I have very seldom heard anything from people of that category who are dealing with those problems that would suggest what I might call any shortcoming in the personal way or in integrity.  They <Col N="2026" /> quarrel with the legislation and the interpretation of it but I have very seldom heard anything in that way that would remotely suggest anything touching on the integrity of the body administering the law in this regard.</P>
      <P>I might recall something which was said already, and which I see no reason for not saying again.  I refer particularly to the committee which sat on the Income Tax Bill.  Those of us who sat on that committee certainly had an opportunity of seeing the point of view from which the whole problem of taxation was approached and the efficiency of the approach.  Everybody without exception expressed their admiration&mdash;I do not think that is too strong a word to use as the record is there&mdash; for the people who deal with taxation. I feel it should not be necessary to say those things but for the suggestion of Deputy Costello that there is something all wrong.  I do not mind that he reacted to something that was said but when he was talking he said if he had so many years to do it he would have done this, that and the other.  Was there so much to be done in that particular way?  There will always be plenty to be done but the suggestion that everything was completely wrong from the very beginning may be a misleading one for a debate such as this.</P>
      <P>There is one thing which perhaps I might ask in common with Deputy Sweetman and that is in connection with the question of limitations.  Everybody agrees that if there is any taint of fraud there should be no limitation. Deputy Costello recalled that the Statute of Limitations had tidied up a number of those things.  If there is a point, as Deputy Sweetman seems to think, that the limitation might be more explicit, we might work at that but that is a detail which we can take on Committee Stage.  I think this is a Bill which can fairly be described in the words which the Minister used at the beginning and that as I have said at least twice already and if it is used for the scoring of points it does not help with this type of legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy de Valera's last point it cannot be too often reiterated, particularly <Col N="2027" /> from this side of the House, that we in this country are most fortunate that we have in the Revenue Commissioners and in their staff from the inspector of taxes down, as indeed we have in the entire Civil Service, a body of dedicated men of high integrity, whose service to the State is probably without parallel.  Deputy Sweetman has frequently made that point but in so far as Deputy de Valera appears to imply that we on this side of the House have been harping in a personal way where State officers are concerned, I hasten to assure him that this is not the case.</P>
      <P>Indeed, I am only too well aware that at the present time inspectors of taxes are overworked and under-paid. In passing, I would mention to the Minister if this is so still more is the case that the professional gentlemen who deal with them primarily, namely the Minister's professional colleagues and my colleagues, are subject to tremendous harassment with staff difficulties and shortages at the present time and so far as the computer is now working efficiently the assessments this year in the Dublin area have been out three and four months earlier than they were in previous years.  I would ask the Minister to drop a hint, if it may be needed, to ask them to be as forbearing as they can in dealing with members of our profession if they are a bit behind time in their work which is due to no fault of their own.</P>
      <P>I have nothing much to say on this Bill.  I was not aware it was coming up tonight and have come without my brief.  I wish, therefore, to speak for a very limited purpose.  This is a Bill which is making a general provision in connection with finance.  It is not in every Finance Bill that we have provisions relating to the Special Commissioners, now the Appeals Commissioners, and as their position is being dealt with I want to make a case to the Minister that it is time to extend the powers of the Appeals Commissioners who deal with death and estate duty problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in recent months there has developed in the Estate Duty Office a degree of rigidity and <Col N="2028" /> harshness in dealing with the valuation of small, private family businesses. This is a harshness which is something new and something to be deplored.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there are no people who easily avail of the appeal tribunal from the Estate Duty Office unless they are income tax, surtax and corporation tax matters.  The only appeal is to the courts, which is an expensive business and this is a situation which is exploited to the taxpayer's disadvantage as far as estate duty is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have in recent months a system of dealing with the valuation of small private businesses as if they were public companies.  You can have a twopence-halfpenny business in the provinces dealt with as if it was Jacobs or Bolands.  As far as I can recall the Institute of Chartered Accountants, a body to which the Minister and I have the honour to belong, in their submission earlier this year adverted to this matter of an informal appeal in relation to death duties.  As the Minister is now dealing with the powers of Appeals Commissioners and the position of Appeals Commissioners it seems that this would be an appropriate time to deal with this matter. We can consider this aspect more fully on the Committee Stage.  We are indebted to Deputy Costello for his exposition here tonight of the position in relation to negligence and the interconnection between section 4 and section 5 of this Bill.  Having said that, I want to say in fairness that I can see that the Minister is going a long way to meet the amendments in relation to the time limits which we on this side of the House tabled a few months ago.</P>
    <P>Once again it is my pleasant duty, as it was in relation to the amendments brought in in regard to the health expenses, to acknowledge the Minister's action and to tell him that we are pleased to see him, to the extent that he is doing so, taking a leaf out of our book.</P>
    <P>In connection with Part IV, it seems to me and I am not an expert on property development, that the Minister is restoring what we might term the <i>status quo</i>; that instead of the broad charging sections comprised in <Col N="2029" /> the 1965 Act, he is now approaching this problem of property development from the right standpoint.  I have nothing further to say on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I begin by saying that the way of the reformer is hard?  I have come in here today with a piece of legislation, the whole purpose of which is an easement of the situation of taxpayers of one sort or another.  As thanks for the reforming efforts I have made, I have to listen to Deputy Costello complaining about old ladies frightened to death by the Revenue Commissioners.  I found on previous occasions when one comes in here to attempt to improve some altogether draconian provision that has been there for a long time, one is not given any credit for the improvement of the original provision which one is trying to achieve.  However, this attitude by Deputy Costello will not debar me from continuing to try to improve the legislation governing our taxation system.</P>
      <P>I want to appreciate on the other side the gracious remarks of Deputy Byrne and perhaps to refer very briefly to the fact that he and I were members of the same profession at one time.  However perhaps I shall say for the benefit of the Fine Gael candidate in the Cork by-election, that I am not a member of any firm of accountants and have not been for some time.</P>
      <P>This is, of course, a measure which can be more properly and adequately discussed on Committee Stage.  I want to assure Deputies opposite that I am certainly prepared to take plenty of time on this piece of legislation.  This is a complex and difficult area and the provisions which we have before us are the results of long and assiduous consideration by myself and my advisers. They represent the best effort we can make at this stage to come to a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my opening remarks, we have been, and are prepared to continue, discussing these provisions with all the interests concerned and listening to every point of view which has been put forward, and listening seriously, and that applies to <Col N="2030" /> every Deputy.  I want to assure Deputies that any amendment which is put down on any aspect of these particular provisions will receive very earnest and serious consideration.  I am quite open to make any changes in these provisions which would help to make the situation more certain or definite to enable the taxpayers concerned to understand precisely how they stand.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman suggested that we were not quite keeping the balance between the Revenue Commissioners and the taxpayers so far as this question of going back to re-open assessments is concerned, but I submit that we are.  The business of the year 1961-62 simply arises because of the practice to which I adverted on the other Finance Bill of not going back beyond six years.  But, with regard to the other side of the question, we are providing in the case of the Revenue Commissioners that they cannot go back beyond ten years and in the case of the taxpayer, he cannot claim for more than six years.  Whereas there can be fraud or neglect on the part of the taxpayer, the same cannot apply to the Revenue Commissioners.  We cannot attribute any fraud or neglect to the Revenue Commissioners and that is perhaps why Deputy Sweetman suggested there might be some difficulty.  In fact, we are making these provisions equally applicable, whether it is a taxpayer looking for a refund or the Revenue Commissioners seeking to raise additional assessments, subject only to the question of fraud or neglect.</P>
    <P>Again, Deputy Costello is a lawyer and one has to excuse him for overstating cases.  He very dishonestly quoted from section 4 (2) (c) while refraining from adverting at all to the proviso, which is fairly generous, and which states that:</P>
    <P>Provided that a person shall be deemed not to have failed to do anything required to be done within a limited time if he did it within such further time, if any, as the Revenue Commissioners or officer concerned may have allowed; and where a person had a reasonable excuse for not doing anything required <Col N="2031" /> to be done, he shall be deemed not to have failed to do it if he did it without unreasonable delay after the excuse had ceased.</P>
    <P>If any Deputy wants to suggest any further modifications of these provisions that seem to be reasonable, I am perfectly prepared to consider them.  Deputies will recall that I argued here very strongly against there being any necessity for a statutory provision of this sort but I think it was Deputy Booth who finally tipped the scale by coming in here and supporting the case which had been made by some Opposition Deputies and caused me to wonder whether I should perhaps re-examine my own thoughts on this matter.  Having done so and having discussed it, as I promised, with the Institute of Chartered Accountants and others, I brought in provisions which seem to me to do exactly what the Opposition Deputies and Deputy Booth sought on that occasion.  I argued that the practice was there and that the practice was sufficient and the main case put forward by the Opposition was that a practice was not good enough&mdash;that we should give statutory effect to it.  That is what I am doing here now.</P>
    <P>One point made by Deputy Costello was about the provision that people will have to bring to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners the fact that they are chargeable to tax.  That is an eminently reasonable, sensible provision because I do not think anybody pays taxes with joy.  Certainly the thing that annoys people most is the suspicion that while they are paying their taxes, others are getting away with it. A great deal of pain would be taken out of tax-gathering if the person knew every other taxpayer was paying his full share.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello spoke about workmen earning £20 a week.  Surely any such workmen are paying their full stint under PAYE and surely such people want an assurance that every other person earning £20 a week is also paying his share?  It is eminently reasonable, therefore, that every taxpayer should do this, not only in the <Col N="2032" /> interests of the Revenue Commissioners, of the running of the State and of the raising of finances, but also in equity and to provide the assurance to taxpayers that they are not being asked to bear all the burden while others, equally able to pay, are getting away with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman asked about the loose-leaf edition of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  I am afraid I can do no better than fall back, though fall back truthfully, on the old public administration cliché: &ldquo;It is at present with the printers and every effort is being made to expedite its publication.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were discussing this Estimate the other night I dealt with certain aspects, some of which have been somewhat reinforced by events in the interval.  The Minister will remember that one of the things I raised last week with him was the manner in which two of the State bodies under his aegis had failed to co-relate themselves and that we had what amounted to Ceimicí Teoranta trying to take over a function that should more properly be that of Córas Tráchtála.  I was surprised by the number of people who, outside, commented to me on the few remarks I had made in this respect the other evening.</P>
      <P>One of the most interesting comments I heard was that this effort by Ceimicí Teoranta arose perhaps from the examination of their affairs by the Litton Organisation and that in their efforts to diversify and widen the base of Ceimicí Teoranta for the purpose of diluting their higher executive expenses, this had been considered.  One can have sympathy with the efforts of any of these efficiency experts, management consultants&mdash;call them what you wish&mdash;in endeavouring to get a basis for an individual concern.  That, however, does not absolve the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or indeed any other Minister in any other sphere, from being the person who in his job and from his job calculates the national interest, as apart from the individual interests of State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed by the number of people, some in private business, some not in private business, who seemed to go out of their way deliberately to contact me and suggest that it was very wrong if there was any suggestion such as that I had indicated.  I know there was such a suggestion from the letter the Minister wrote to me.  At least I must pay tribute to the fact that he was honest enough to answer me categorically in that respect.  I believe that when he sits down and considers the matter in its proper function and pattern, he will see that the interest of one State body is not the national interest as a whole&mdash;that the national interest as a <Col N="2035" /> whole would be very much damaged by an extension of the operations of a State body in the manner I suggested.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion, too, I made some reference to the fact that it seemed undoubted that the manufacturing industries and transportable goods industries were not making anything like enough progress to pick up the slack that inevitably was arising, year in year out, in relation to those employed in agriculture.  We were glad last year that, according to the Minister's speech, some 2,000 extra were employed in manufacturing and transportable goods industries but it is nothing like enough and it is something that this year may very well be offset by another threat.  We had discussions here at Question Time today in relation to the Common Market and the factual position in relation to our application. Stripped of the verbiage, I cannot feel that there is anything that one can construe out of the Taoiseach's remarks today, and his remarks in public in Europe and since he came back, but that any extension of our markets in Europe must be deferred for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>Indeed, as I understand the Taoiseach today, the phrase &ldquo;a considerable time&rdquo; is not one we on this side of the House coined in interpretation but is one which was used by General de Gaulle himself.  In that position, we have to consider very carefully whether the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement of last year carries with it the promise that was then made by the Government that it would be a sure stepping-stone towards our accession to the Common Market and that it would have, and that it did have, within its framework adequate provision to prevent disemployment in our industries through the flooding of our markets. The conditions that were considered at that time were that, with the advent of our accession to the Common Market around the corner, it would mean a substantial improvement in outlets for the efficient Irish industry and, at the same time, a substantial improvement in outlets for the livestock part of our agricultural production&mdash;the cattle, <Col N="2036" /> sheep and dairying industries in particular.</P>
    <P>It was in the acceptance that there would be that expansion in our efficient industries and for that side of agriculture that people here were prepared to consider the inevitability and the urgency, if one may use the phrase, of certain changes in the structure of industry in Ireland.  We must all accept that if there is a restriction in certain industries then, unless at the same time we can ensure an extension in other industries, an enlargement of markets in these industries, employment in manufacturing industry will fall.</P>
    <P>One of the things I fear about the new developments is that we shall not get the extension, on the one hand, that the Common Market would give us and yet, on the other hand, we shall get a restriction in certain industries brought on by the Free Trade Area Agreement.  If the two were there, I think the balance would be in our favour.  The two are not there.  It seems to me that we shall get the unfavourable breeze without getting the favourable. One of the worst examples of it, from our point of view, is the motor tyre industry.  The phenomenal increase in imports of tyres for motor vehicles which has arisen as a result of the Free Trade Area Agreement has endangered the employment of many engaged in that industry.  In some respects, unfortunately, it is not merely a question of endangering: it is a question of having done so.  It has created, also, an air of unease, and understandably so.  If we have not, simultaneously with any wave there may be against certain industries, a wave in favour of others such as accession to the Common Market would give then we shall be caught in an interim position for much longer than was visualised and one that will be particularly unfortunate.</P>
    <P>We had hoped, too, before the Minister came in with this Estimate, that we would have some clearer view of where the Government saw the motor car assembly industry would go in the period ahead.  That industry, as we know, involves the employment and the lives of a very large number of our people.  It is unfortunate that the <Col N="2037" /> Minister was not able, some considerable time back, to give a clearer picture of what the Government saw in this respect.  It is part of the same pattern I indicated in relation to State-sponsored bodies.  We are not seeing anything like enough of a clear picture of objectives by the Government and by the Minister in relation to them.</P>
    <P>If, in relation to every State-sponsored body, there were as clear a statement, objectively, of its functions, hopes, desires and possibility of future attainment as the Department of Labour have put out in relation to An Chomhairle Oiliúna, we should be travelling a desirable road.  It is not often that I pay tribute to something that is put out by the Government but that which was put out by the Department of Labour is a clear statement which could well be imitated.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed, too, that the Minister did not give us more of an indication whether there are any hopes of off-shore exploration here in Ireland in relation to petroleum and gas and the distance over which we have rights in that respect.  Are we now on the 12-mile limit?  The mining industry&mdash; and I suppose one can associate with it the effort to find petroleum and natural gas &mdash; is something that has grown up substantially here during recent years.  It has grown up largely because of the tax incentives of 1956, amended, extended and improved by subsequent Ministers for Finance.  I do not deny for one second that the initial incentives have been substantially improved in many respects. During the period ahead, I hope we will find that there will be a better chance of the lower grade ores being recovered as a result of these incentives. I should like to see some evidence that an effort was being made to search for the possibility of petroleum and natural gas under the offshore shelf.  I was very glad to see in the papers the other day a suggestion that one of the larger international mining concerns was thinking of setting up an aluminium smelter here.  I hope that is true and that the Minister by his injudicious Smelting Bill, which was <Col N="2038" /> introduced earlier this year, has not spoiled the possibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not affect it the slightest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, the definition of smelting in that Bill does include aluminium.  The Smelting Bill may have been introduced by the Minister with only the baser metals in view, but the smelting of ore and ore concentrates seems to be something that clearly covers aluminium as well, at least on the advice given to me by those who are in that technical line of country.  The Minister is like me in that respect: he is only able to consider the drafting on the best technical advice that he can get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And the technical advice I have got is that it also includes aluminium.  If my advice is right, then I fear that the Bill, which happily has gone to some type of limbo for the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>You will have it shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would have prevented Rio Tinto, or anybody else, dealing with smelting of that sort.  I hope, too, we will find in the immediate future that the development in Longford in the mining industry by that particular firm will be such as to give further assistance to our balance of payments.  It is peculiar thing and one with which the Department of Industry and Commerce is especially concerned, that the major politico-industrial issue of today is not what it used to be.  It used be the relations between the trade unions and society.  Everybody will agree that the issue now has changed from that sphere to one of the relationship between the Government and the private sector of industry.  We have that, on the one hand, in the Prices Bill and on the other, in the Restrictive Practices Bill, while on another side again, we have it in the method of operation of State-sponsored bodies.  It is perhaps unfortunate that in that respect we have not had as clear a view as one would like of the occasions on which and the policy for occasions on which the Government, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in particular, should intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2039" /> As I mentioned the Prices Bill, may I ask the Minister categorically to tell us whether the rumour that is running around this town is correct, that inside the next week to a month, we are to have another increase of 2d in the price of the loaf?  It has been mentioned to me from all sides, not necessarily by people concerned with politics, as we are, but by public contacts all around, that an increase of that size is inevitable.  We had on other occasions increases of that sort arriving just coincidentally after the voters in constituencies went to the polls.  If an increase is inevitable&mdash;and I can understand the Minister in these days of rising expenses finding that it is inevitable&mdash;I would ask him at least to have the honour and honesty to announce it before Thursday, and not after it.  Equally, I should like to give him the opportunity of having the chance before Thursday of denying the rumour that is abroad, if the rumour is untrue.  I am, as I say, giving him the chance of denying it and I would welcome that denial.</P>
    <P>I mentioned a minute ago, before I got on to the Prices Bill, that the present political issue is perhaps the degree of intervention that is desirable by the State in relation to the private sector of the economy.  It is always very easy to plead in a general way the national interest.  It is always very difficult to show in relation to any action or intended action that that individual action is something that in the long run is going to go contrary to the national interest.</P>
    <P>But it seems to me that Government must be involved with industry in a variety of different ways.  In the first place, it must obviously be involved as the protector of the people, in the sense that it is concerned, amongst other things, with restricting industry from damaging the people by polluting their air and water, from unjustly invading their living and recreational areas, from abusing through excessive marketing power their rights as consumers, accepted in the Restrictive Trade Practices Act to which I referred; by treating them harshly as work people, accepted in <Col N="2040" /> our labour legislation; by harming their interests as shareholders, accepted in the Companies Act; and so on in many varied fields.</P>
    <P>The Government must be concerned also in industry as the provider of services of a widespread kind, such as postal and telecommunications &mdash; although, goodness knows, some of us may feel at present that the inefficiency of our postal deliveries and the continued breakdown in telephone services require something of a breath of fresh air.  The Government are also responsible for the provision of the infrastructure and facilities in respect of transport.  Again, we have had from time to time grave misgivings in that respect.  There is also the safeguarding of services connected with health, police, protection from fire, services in the production of energy, education, labour exchanges&mdash;all those are things which obviously must be provided by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government must also be a customer responsible for the expenditure of a very large proportion of the value of things the nation produces. It must be concerned as an industrialist with managing industries like the ESB, the railways and the State-sponsored bodies.  It must be concerned with the management of the nation's resources. It is in this latter respect that I wonder whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce is doing all that should be done.  I wonder is he mobilising our raw materials and resources?  Is he providing the incentives for that mobilisation that is necessary and desirable at present?  He has certain schemes in his Department for adaptation and for market analysis, but they do not go anything like far enough. They are not pursued with the energy the times require.  We are not getting that sense of urgency across to people in all walks of life, particularly those in management.  The clarification of objectives is something all managers say is not done sufficiently, said particularly, I suppose, by the new ones coming on the scene.</P>
    <P>In the long run in any private enterprise economy&mdash;and I hope we will long remain one&mdash;it is the lead the Government can give by incentive and <Col N="2041" /> by leadership that will ultimately determine the pace of the economy.  I do not think we are getting that leadership in industry from the Government and the Minister at present.  One of the reasons we are not getting it is that there is not a sufficiently frank facing up to and public acceptance of the problems of the day.  I do not think we are going anything like far enough in making it clear that research in industry is vital to improve technology and productivity.  We are not going far enough to provide for companies engaged in industry to have the incentives by way of tax remissions and otherwise to get on with the job of that research, to do so on a long-term basis and know where they are going in long-term development.  That must be governed first by where we are in relation to trade abroad.</P>
    <P>I would welcome from the Minister a new leadership in that respect.  I would welcome from him something more than what I may describe perhaps as a pat on the back for some new opening.  There must be a much more realistically designed campaign to make it clear, first, that we want a wide expansion and, secondly, that in relation to that expansion, if a person is able to make a profit out of it, he is doing something that will improve the community as a whole, will increase the national interest and that it is not immoral to make a profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the profit motive is the greatest motivating force we can have.  While I want to make sure that people are not able to utilise restrictive legislation or restrictive practices to prevent enterprise, I want to make equally certain that where there is enterprise, the reward for that enterprise can accrue for the individual in the shape of profit.  If it does, I personally have no doubt whatever that it will accrue in a far wider way to the national interest in production, in the balance of payments and in the extension of our employment of people at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce <Col N="2042" /> each year gives us an opportunity of reviewing the entire situation in so far as it affects every section of our community.  Seeing that the Department of Industry and Commerce covers such a very wide field, we think it only right that we should make reference to employment in industry, the establishment of industry, the export of the products of our industry, and the furtherance of the participation by our people in a Buy Irish Campaign.</P>
      <P>The more we produce for export the better and the healthier it is for our economy.  When we see the vast amount which is imported into this country we often ask ourselves, after so many years of supporting Irish industry, whether we have as yet achieved our high ambitions in that regard.  I have the greatest admiration and respect for all who are engaged in Irish industry.  Our industrialists and those engaged in industry are certainly playing a very important and noble part.  It is only right that we should take this opportunity of expressing our appreciation to them.  We can produce in this country commodities of as high a standard if not higher than those produced by any other country in the world, and certainly of a standard equal to, if not better than, that of the goods imported here today.</P>
      <P>That can be very easily seen in the footwear industry.  When the Minister is replying to this debate, he should make a special reference to the footwear industry.  I do not know what has happened in relation to this industry.  We have seen a number of shoe factories closed down and there is a good deal of unemployment and short time in the footwear industry. At the same time, we see in every big store we enter, large supplies and a great variety of imported footwear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it that the Buy Irish Campaign has failed in relation to Irish footwear, or is it that the Government have allowed the footwear industry to collapse completely?  In my constituency, there were two very important factories, one which is closed down altogether and the other which is not working full time.  I fail to understand this situation when I know that the workers engaged in the manufacture <Col N="2043" /> of boots and shoes in these centres produce footwear of such excellent quality.  I venture to say that the footwear which is produced from our own factories is as good as, if not better than, the imported boots and shoes that we see prominently displayed in all our shop windows.</P>
    <P>I have wondered what has been the cause of the collapse.  Has it been that those who are purchasing boots and shoes here in Ireland are buying the imported boots and shoes in preference to those made here?  If that is so, then our Buy Irish Campaign has failed.  I cannot understand the mentality of people who buy imported goods when by buying an article that is manufactured here, they are, as well as cutting down the necessity for imports, keeping their fellow workers in employment and contributing generously to the country's economy.  Is it that this message has not been sufficiently conveyed to the public?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give the House the full picture in relation to the footwear industry, in regard to the short time that is taking place therein, and the growing amount of imports of boots and shoes, in spite of the excellent standard of Irish-manufactured footwear.  I feel I should pay this tribute to those engaged in the footwear industry.  They are highly skilled operatives, and I feel safe in saying that those engaged in the industry across the sea or elsewhere cannot be any more highly qualified than those here in our own country.  We must endeavour to break down the prejudice on the part of some consumers that home-produced articles are not as good as imported ones.</P>
    <P>I believe in Irish industry and have faith in the workers of this country who have perfected their skills in Irish industry.  I believe in the policy of assisting, promoting and investing in Irish industry.  While there has been a good deal of criticism in relation to Government policy in fostering industry in preference to agriculture it must be realised that in the modern world in which we live all our labour force cannot find employment on the land and therefore industrial development is necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2044" /> It is encouraging to see the growth of Irish industry during the past 25 years.  Tribute must be paid to all Ministers for Industry and Commerce, to Deputy Lemass, to the former Deputy Morrissey, to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and to all who have held that office and who believed in a future for Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Department of Industry and Commerce are inundated with requests from various areas and from development associations for the establishment of industries.  There is nothing easier than to ask that an industry be set up but regard must be had to the raw material to be used. The most profitable industry is one based on home-produced raw material. Naturally, such industries are few and far between.  For most of our industries we have to rely on imported raw material.</P>
    <P>In recent years, I have wondered whether it was a wise policy to grant special facilities for industries sited west of the Shannon which were not applicable in other areas.  If we invite foreign investment and if industrialists are prepared to invest their money and their skills in establishing industries in this country, is it right to encourage them to go to any particular area where probably transport costs may be higher and where there may be a problem of availability of raw material?  The generous grants made available by the Government are a great encouragement to industrialists. However, grants were made available for industries sited in certain parts of the country which were not available in other areas where industrial development is equally necessary and desirable in order to provide the local employment which cannot be secured from agriculture.  I am glad to note that in so far as the Industrial Development Authority and the body charged with the allocation of grants for industries are concerned there is no distinction now as between areas.  That is as it should have been.  The removal of artificial boundaries in this matter will be for the benefit of the country.  The country will be taken as a unit and <Col N="2045" /> facilities will be universally available for the establishment and promotion of industry.</P>
    <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to express my personal delight at the development and progress in the industrial estate at Shannon.  Deputies on all sides of the House may have their views in relation to investment in that industrial estate.  I have said here, and it is on record, that I firmly believe in the development of the industrial estate at Shannon.  The test is the number employed there.  If men and women are working and have their pay packets at the end of the week, to me that represents progress.  It is far better that Irish men and women should be working in an industrial estate like that at Shannon rather than at the same type of work for the same employers in Germany, Britain, the United States or Canada.</P>
    <P>I want to say again that I have been impressed by the lay-out of the industrial estate at Shannon and by the manner in which the estate has been managed.  From time to time there may be words of criticism that some industries there have failed and others have not thrived to the extent we would have liked.  There is nothing easier to do than to criticise.  Those of us in public life would feel there was something wrong if in our own line of activity as public men, we were not subject to criticism of one kind or another very frequently.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that from time to time the industries in the Shannon Industrial Estate have been the subject of criticism, very often unwarranted criticism, I think.  Constructive criticism may be good for industries which are in their infancy, and instead of criticism, words of encouragement and praise may in the long run have far better and more beneficial effects.  The industrial estate at Shannon is young and, indeed, I may say still in its infancy.  I have faith and belief that in the years to come, there will be expansion and development to a far greater extent at Shannon.  There are possibilities there.  The possibilities are very great.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2046" /> I trust that the development authority at Shannon Airport may be reinforced by the knowledge that the work they have undertaken there has met with a measure of appreciation. I hope every effort will be made to solicit the goodwill and co-operation of industries that can be obtained from any part of the world.  We have the facilities here to offer to industrialists because we have the workers.  I may say that the workers engaged at Shannon&mdash;no matter in what branch of industry they are engaged&mdash;are efficient and capable and worthy of every support and encouragement.  I am sure the board charged with responsibility for further development at Shannon are wide awake to the need for even more and greater investment in the industrial estate.</P>
    <P>I trust that every avenue will be explored by that body which, in my opinion, is a most efficient authority, composed of men of intelligence, men of ability, men of foresight and courage who have belief and faith that the workers can produce excellent articles. All the articles I have seen which are manufactured in the various industries at Shannon reflect great credit on the skill, the craftsmanship and work of the workers engaged in the various branches there.  I want to avail of this opportunity again to express for the record my appreciation of what I saw at that estate.  I trust that work will continue energetically, and that the Minister and the Government will continue to be helpful and generous in regard to any capital that may be needed because it is a sound investment, and a good investment.  Any investment that produces articles for export and at the same time, keeps our men and women at work at home in our own country is a sound and a good investment.</P>
    <P>It has been noted from announcements made that other industrial estates, perhaps similar to that at Shannon, are planned for the future. One is planned for Galway and one for the Waterford district.  I am wholeheartedly in agreement with the establishment of these industrial estates.  I know that in the city of Waterford, which has a good industrial <Col N="2047" /> tradition, they are helped considerably by the fact that Waterford port is probably one of the greatest attractions for industry.  Waterford port is one of the finest ports in this country. I remember not very many years ago &mdash;I was a member of this House at the time&mdash;I heard the late Deputy Mrs. Redmond asking the Government to give a measure of assistance so that some use could be made of the great harbour facilities available in Waterford. Afterwards I heard the late Deputy T. Lynch speaking in the same vein.</P>
    <P>I remember 1955 when a serious effort was made to bring business to Waterford by utilising all the facilities available at Waterford port.  I am glad to see that the foundation laid during those years has brought both employment and business to the city of Waterford.  I am speaking as if I represented that city&mdash;far from it&mdash;but I know the background and the tradition of Waterford and Waterford port. I have seen that harbour without a single boat in it.  I have seen the quays without the least sign of any activity. It is a pleasure now to see the amount of work and activity at the quays in Waterford.  There are greater and greater and greater possibilities for further development there.</P>
    <P>It should be very easy to direct the special attention of foreign investors to the great possibilities at Waterford, just as they can be encouraged as to the great possibilities at Shannon where the airport is so convenient and duty-free facilities and water facilities immediately available.  In the city of Waterford, investors can be offered what we can claim to be one of the finest harbours in our country.  I trust that within the next five years a very serious and genuine effort will be made to provide much-needed employment in the city of Waterford and in the south Kilkenny and south Tipperary districts, including that portion of Waterford west of the city.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2048" /> I have little doubt but that the Minister has gone very fully into this matter.  After all, it is his job.  The responsibility has been given to him by this House.  It is hardly necessary for Deputies to direct his attention to the importance of the areas I have mentioned. The Minister has very capable and very efficient officers in his Department to advise him, to prepare for him and submit to him all the information he may require to help and guide him in making decisions.  I fully approve of the Government's intention to establish an industrial estate in Galway because, again, the employment is needed there and the facilities are there.  I am sure if investment is required it will be, as it is in the case of Waterford, readily forthcoming and readily available.  With thriving industrial estates in the Shannon area, in Waterford and in Galway we must ask ourselves what will the position be in the Midlands from the point of view of providing industrial employment for the manufacture of certain commodities for export.  That brings me to the question then of the provision of worthwhile industrial employment in Laois-Offaly, in part of County Kildare, and in County Westmeath. There are in the midlands vast numbers of unemployed.  There are a number of small progressive towns.  There are a number of very worthwhile industries.</P>
