      <P>When I reported progress last night, I was commencing to talk on the very topical subject of the day, our application for entry to the Common Market.  There is a great deal of diversified debate in this country on that subject.  There are some who believe that if we get into the Common Market, it is the end of all our economic problems, that we can have a higher standard of living, work shorter hours and get higher pay; in other words, everything is going to be perfect for the future of this country.</P>
      <P>There are others who believe that if we go into the Common Market, we shall be unable to compete with other countries and that our economy will run into considerable difficulties almost immediately.  There is a third school of thought that believes that we do whatever Britain does, that we should not move in any direction without the fullest consultations with the British Government; in fact, that our application is not a separate entry but a united application with that of the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>I should like to take a somewhat different line.  I do not feel committed in any way to any of those schools of thought.  This country is a self-governing unit and as such, is entitled to follow its own line and take its own decisions.  The suggestion that we are entirely dependent on the application of the British Government does not appeal to me.  First of all, in spite of the many optimistic writings in the Press and by different statesmen in different countries about the certainty of Britain being a member of the Common Market this time, I do not follow that line of thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary in this connection to refer briefly to Britain's application to the Common Market, as ours is, to a certain extent, tied up with it. She has many difficulties to overcome. It is not alone General de Gaulle, as some people believe, who may prevent the United Kingdom entering the <Col N="961" /> Common Market.  Outside the Party of the Right, General de Gaulle's Party, there is a considerable volume of opinion in other political parties in France to the effect that Britain is not yet ready for the Common Market and that she has not fully accepted the European idea.  One often hears the opinion expressed by parliamentarians, by French statesmen and European statesmen as a whole, that Britain still believes that the Atlantic is narrower than the Channel, that her eyes are directed more towards a unified policy with the United States of America rather than with Europe. I also know that there is considerable doubt among other countries within the Common Market as to whether it is feasible or advisable to admit Britain at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to say these things because so many people write and seem to think it is only a matter of completing this tour that is being made, under full cover of television and publicity, by the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary throughout the countries of Europe, and then Britain enters the Common Market and we automatically enter afterwards and the EFTA group enters as well.  I want to point out to the House that the EEC has been through considerable difficulties in formulating and agreeing on its final policies.</P>
    <P>There is no need to go back over past events and to the negotiations that led up to the signing of the Treaty of Rome but certainly the negotiations within the Community itself which led up to agreement on its agricultural policy were extended and often acrimonious.  When this agreement was finally reached, it was only done after very lengthy discussions and all-night sittings.  If they had such difficulty in finalising an agreement among themselves, is it not self-evident that the entry of any new partner is going to cause new and protracted discussion? It is inconceivable to my mind that if the United Kingdom does get into the Common Market, which I personally very much doubt, we and the EFTA countries can get in as well.</P>
    <P>Is it not self-evident, after all the <Col N="962" /> trials, tribulations and troubles that EEC has already experienced, that the entry of seven or eight new countries is going to cause very protracted discussion? We are on the eve of the Kennedy Round of negotiations.  It is that fact which made it imperative for the countries of the Common Market to face up to the necessity of having a common agricultural policy.  If a country like the United Kingdom, with its agriculture in its present state and its large State subsidies to agriculture, is admitted to the Common Market, that fact is bound to cause trouble, difficulty and disruption of the present Common Market agricultural policy and they will not be able to face the Kennedy Round which will have to be finalised by next July.  Therefore it is very doubtful if Britain will be admitted.</P>
    <P>Added to this is the fact that Britain is the custodian and guardian of sterling.  When Britain was a great empire with territories overseas, she was well able to maintain and guard sterling.  The balance of payments was right and they were able to meet any requirements made on them.  They are not in that position today.  Although the Labour Government have taken strong steps to redress the balance of payments, the pressure is always on them.  It is conceivable that if they are forced to concede a review of wages and prices, the balance of payments situation will again go against them and it is also conceivable that they might not be able to meet heavy demands made on sterling.  These things will all be taken into account when they are negotiating their entry into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>One of the clauses of the Treaty of Rome is that if a country runs into balance of payments difficulties, they should be granted a waiver and this makes it likely that if the balance of payments situation in Britain were to go wrong, their application would not be accepted.  There is also the question of the agricultural situation there and Britain is asking for a considerably extended period to alter her agricultural position.  The sooner they alter that position the better for us <Col N="963" /> because it is detrimental to our agricultural economy here.  For these reasons and from information I have from certain European sources, it seems to me that it is unlikely that Britain's application will be accepted. The British must already know that as a result of the conversations they have had in France and in other countries where it was hinted that they should seek association.</P>
    <P>Where do we come in then?  We would appear to have based our economy on the be-all and end-all of our economic association with the United Kingdom, contrary to the advice of OECD.  Therefore, we must face the fact that either we must go in at the tail-end of the United Kingdom or else go it alone, or perhaps in association with other countries.  It is a known fact that Denmark and Austria have been negotiating for entry. Spain is not a member of the Council of Europe or of NATO but she has been negotiating for association for some time.  I indict the Government here that they have done nothing.  Recently, possibly under pressure from Opposition speakers, they have sent Ministers to the EEC Council to have a review of the situation but it seems to me that even if our application were to come before the Common Market, there would be long and tortuous negotiations before it was decided whether it would be accepted.</P>
    <P>We have done nothing.  We have made an application and then we let it lie in abeyance awaiting the British decision.  That application was made some six or seven years ago and it has been lying in abeyance ever since. Now, when the time comes when we decide we are going to try to get in, we will have to start the negotiations from the very beginning and the Minister will possibly agree, or be advised by his officials, that there must be at least three years' negotiations before our application will be accepted and finalised.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I had the privilege of acting on a consultation committee of the Council of Europe where five or six of us sat opposite the foreign Ministers of the Council and <Col N="964" /> discussed the question of European unity.  I posed the question that in the event of Ireland being admitted as a member of the Common Market and in the event of the United Kingdom not being found acceptable for entry, what would our position be <i>vis-á-vis</i> Europe, in view of our existing and long-standing trading arrangements with the United Kingdom.  I asked whether we would be allowed any benefits from that long association. The question was replied to by the French Foreign Minister, M. Couve de Murville, who said it was a good question and said there was no doubt that the European Community would take into account Ireland's special relations and position in regard to Great Britain.  That seemed to me to be an indication that it was open to Ireland to go it alone.</P>
    <P>There are some people who seem to throw up their hands in horror at the thought of Ireland going it alone.  We have become so pro-British, so far as those on the opposite side of the House are concerned, that it is almost felt to be dishonourable to suggest we go it alone.  Is it going to be so terrible after all?  Are we not already reducing our tariffs here?  Are we not being told every other day by the Taoiseach and his Ministers that we should get our house in order for our entry into the Common Market?  Is it not an evident fact that at the moment there is only one stablised agricultural market in the world other than those carrying out this heavy subsidisation, which obviously has to go under the extended co-ordination of trade in the world as a whole?  If we get into the Common Market at least we will have a fixed agricultural policy, a fixed price control, so that our farmers will not have to suffer these terrible fluctuations they have had to go through in the past few years.</P>
    <P>I should like to direct the attention of the House to the fact that the price of livestock and milk products in the Common Market is considerably above what we get in the top market here today.  If we enter the Common Market is it not a fact that, although we may face considerable problems and dangers, many of our industries will <Col N="965" /> survive and surmount these and increase their production and employment? Is it not a fact that we will open the door directly to considerable investment from other countries, instead of begging countries to come here, building factories for them and finding in many cases that, when they fulfil a contract, they lock their doors and clear out with no return of the money given them? I appreciate that an industry such as Potez is going to &ldquo;have it&rdquo; overnight.  Every Deputy will agree that the sooner they &ldquo;have it&rdquo; the better.  They should have &ldquo;had it&rdquo; long ago.  If we open a channel to the Common Market, is it not sound and common sense that the capital investment will be considerable?  If we had to enter the Common Market to preserve our economy and to preserve our farming industry, which is the very fundamental of our economy, we would have an avenue of approach for investment not only from the United States but from Britain and other countries.</P>
    <P>It is repeatedly said in this House that we have labour available here.  We are the only country in Western Europe today apart from the United Kingdom, which because of her particular difficulties has a large unemployment quota, that has available labour to offer. Therefore, our standard of living, although it is high and increasing, is still not as high as that of the Common Market countries.  We should be able to produce here, provided we have the capital and technical skill, goods to compete with anybody else.  It has been stated that if we enter the Common Market the motor assembly plants here will go overnight. That is pure, unadulterated moonshine. All manufacturers of motor cars in the world, no matter where they are, are limited for space.  The cost of a square foot of space in the industrialised countries is enormous in relation to Ireland. Nearly all these factories lay off the assembly of their cars outside in other countries.  Therefore, we would still have a function in the assembly of cars, provided we assemble them well and efficiently.  I regret to say that cars assembled here are not always perfectly assembled.  I know of many cars which had to go back to the works three or <Col N="966" /> four times to be put right.  Provided we compete, I do not see why we should not be able to stand up to any of the risks, dangers or doubts involved in entry into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>As I see the position, Britain's entry is doubtful.  It is doubtful, even after prolonged negotiations, whether she will get in or not.  So far as the thaw supposed to be coming from France is concerned, one must always remember there is a general election due in France at any moment.  Forty per cent of the French are in the favour of the entry of Britain to the Common Market, but there are still 60 per cent of them against it.  I am not too satisfied that the Germans feel Britain is really ready for entry to the Common Market.  Our Government are the only people who really have, or should have, the inside facts.  Are they going to stand still and do nothing, or are they going to make application in the fairly near future for this country on its own for entry into the largest market in the world today?</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to say a word on the question of Mr. Wilson's reply to Deputy Seán Dunne's question in the Council of Europe. There seems to be a growing feeling in this House among some Deputies that Britain's thinking on Partition has changed.  Although I am no longer a member of the Council of Europe, I receive all the documents.  I have read the full report of Mr. Wilson's speech and his reply was exactly the same as any reply ever made before by a British Minister to a question on that subject.  It is this : like Pontius Pilate, they wash their hands of the situation. It is something not their responsibility. It is supposed to be the responsibility of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>There is also a theory that the Labour Government in Britain are more friendly towards the abolition of Partition than a Conservative Government.  That theory is largely based on the fact that the Six Counties at the moment return to the Imperial Parliament 11 very useful votes for the Conservative Party.  At the moment that does not matter to the Labour Government because they have a <Col N="967" /> considerable majority.  But when they had the majority of three or four, or seven as it actually was, it would be very useful to them if they could dispose of those 11 votes.  But there is also a theory among Unionist circles in Belfast, or shall we say a knowledge, that eventually the Unionist seats, which are largely given to them by workingclass votes in and around the city of Belfast, will change with the course of time and ultimately those seats now held by the Unionists, or the greater number of them, will be held by Labour. When I was in Stormont not so long ago, I discussed that with a group of out-and-out Unionists.  Their considered opinion was that that change was coming. Therefore, although Mr. Wilson may tell Deputy Seán Dunne he would like to see Partition abolished and although Members of this House may feel that the reason for that is that they lose seats, make no mistake : British parliamentarians do not change in relation to this country.  As far as they are concerned, it is what the French call a <i>fait accompli</i>.  As long as they get a chance, they will maintain it as it is.</P>
    <P>Whether our entry into the Common Market will make any difference or not, it is very hard to say.  If the economic difficulties still prevail in the United Kingdom, as they are likely to do in any country losing an empire and a lot of its trade such as they are, if we can find a Government with courage enough to go it alone and if our economic position is improved by this vital entry to the richest market in the world, those north of the Border may take another road and look towards a united Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all happy about the manner in which payments in respect of the maintenance of our forces in Cyprus have been dealt with. I know I am speaking for a large section of our citizens in saying that.  As far as I could gather from the Minister yesterday, since March, 1964, the Irish taxpayers have been called on to provide £1,600,000 in respect of this force. We sent a bill, evidently, for <Col N="968" /> £1,290,000, of which we were paid £664,000.  The Minister told us yesterday that the Secretary-General told him in respect of this outstanding account that he would do his best to pay us.  That is a very familiar report from debtor to creditor.  If I owed the Minister a solitary £20 and he approached me and I told him I would do my best about it, I am sure the Minister would ask for something more specific.  It is about time that some business efficiency was introduced into our dealings with the United Nations in respect of the sum outstanding because, in addition to the amount of £1,290,000, I understand we are sending a further account for £316,000.  In replying, the Minister might tell us in respect of what period that £316,000 is due, in respect of what it is due and he might also explain why the situation has arisen that we have not yet sent this account which, on its face, must obviously have been going on for quite some time.</P>
      <P>The fact is that we are owed £945,000 in respect of our forces in Cyprus.  It is time we made up our minds what pressure we will bring to bear on the United Nations in respect of that sum.  Are we to continue our mandate indefinitely?  Or are we to say to the United Nations: &ldquo;This money is owing; we will not spend a single brass farthing extra until we know what you are going to do about this cool £1 million that is due to us&rdquo;? I think the original refusal to accept money from the voluntary funds was a mistake and that the country disapproved of that decision.  Now that we have taken it, the Minister owes it to the country to give an assurance that he will not be satisfied with being told that they will see what they can do about paying us this £1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the Minister for Defence visited the forces in Cyprus and came back and said they were all in high heart.  We are glad to hear that, but at a time like this when we are cautioning the average citizen to be careful about expenditure, I doubt if the Minister for Defence should have been sent to Cyprus and the Holy Land.  The Minister <Col N="969" /> might tell us how much that particular expedition cost.  My personal regard for the Minister for Defence &mdash;I think every Deputy has a similar personal regard for him&mdash;cannot interfere with my duty to ask the questions that my constituents and fellow citizens ask in respect of matters like that. I am quite sure that the personal integrity of the Minister for Defence ensured that no extra charge was incurred by the taxpayer by virtue of the fact that the Minister's very chaming wife accompanied him.  I think it well that that should be made plain to the people because people will talk, as they are entitled to do, and I am sure there is not any foundation for that talk.  It is well that Departments of State should be as frank with the people as possible and thus at the source prevent discussion of the kind to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Every Department of State when introducing its Estimate should try to be a model to the ordinary citizen and should aim at counselling by example rather than by precept.  Suggestions are going forth that people should live within their means and I do not think it is sufficient for the Minister to come here and say that extra provision for travelling and expenses&mdash;it comes to only £7,000&mdash;is explained by saying that it reflects the increased costs of providing these services.  In the ordinary life of the ordinary citizen, a similar reflection of increased costs is experienced by the average citizen but he has to cut his cloth according to the measure and it would be a good thing if the Minister could have said that the cost of travelling had gone up but that they were economising.  If he had come here and said he was going to cut down his trips to the United Nations, which, perhaps, would only reflect a saving of anything from £1,000 to £5,000, it would be an an economy and it would be an encouragement to the ordinary man in the street to economise.  It is time for Departments of State to economise and as this Estimate is now before the House, I suggest this Department should engage in the exercise of giving some good example to the country in general.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> Similarly, in respect of the cost of Post Office services and telephones and things like that.  I realise it is only an extra £2,000, but when the ordinary citizen finds that his housing loan is held up, sometimes indefinitely, because the country has not the money to pay it, and when the ordinary old age pensioner is told he does not qualify for the increase he thought he would get before the recent by-election, that only people whose means are nil will get this increase, it would be well if Departments could behave like ordinary citizens and cut their cloth according to their measure.</P>
    <P>May I mention that this year the Estimate for the cost of entertaining distinguished persons has gone up by £2,000?  I am not a person who would agree that we should not entertain distinguished persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has anything to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate shows that this year the cost of entertaining distinguished persons has gone up from £22,000 for 1966-67 to £24,000 for 1967-68.  That is in subhead G on page 173.  All I want to say is that, first, I doubt if we have £24,000 worth of distinquished persons coming here.  When they come, they should be well and fittingly entertained, but I think an economy, no matter how small, could be effected by cutting down the guest list and not having some of the usual hangers-on found at these functions.  Even if we saved only £2,000, the ordinary man in the street would say that those in authority were making some effort to cut their cloth according to their measure, and ordinary citizens should do likewise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to know that information material is to be circulated to writers, journalists, publishers and various other such people.  It is important, having regard to our personal experience of the Minister's performance in this respect, that we should have a library to furnish that information because, since the publication of <i>The Facts About Ireland</i>, I, and many <Col N="971" /> others in the House and throughout the country, find ourselves unable to trust the Minister's discretion in these matters.  Anything sent out from the Department for consumption in other countries should be made available in a library so that, on behalf of the people who sent us here, I and others like me should be able to inspect all material to see that there is nothing tendentious in it, nothing which is not to the benefit of the country and the people in it.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wanted copies, he should have raised the matter.  Why did he not use the telephone <Col N="972" /> or send a simple letter to the Department?  The difficulty about Fine Gael and Labour is that they do not want to produce a policy; they manufacture artificial grievances when they have not got legitimate ones.  On the Order of Business, the Labour Party raised the question of the disposition of business in relation to Estimates and Supplementary Estimates for this year. The Labour Party knew all the issues involved and they knew that I would have been prepared to facilitate them, if they had given some notice, in relation to the Estimates not discussed here last autumn.  We notified them of the way we proposed to deal with these Estimates in the House and it was only a day or so before we came in that they decided to demand a debate they had not asked for at any time in the previous two months.  I wish the Labour Party spokesmen and the Fine Gael Party spokesmen grew up and decided to engage in a rational discussion on matters pertaining to external affairs.</P>
      <P>This is not a very peaceful world.  It is pretty troubled and no matter what Fine Gael or certain Fine Gael Deputies may say or what Labour Deputies may say, I will not be inhibited in the matter of going anywhere I think it is proper to go and staying there for as long as I think it proper to stay if I can do anything to help our neighbours in the world to avoid further conflicts between nations.</P>
      <P>There is one item relating to the work we do in the Department that was quite seriously discussed by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Cosgrave, and by a few other Deputies, and I should like to deal with it.  It is the question of how far it is our duty and what is our ability to help those of our citizens who emigrate to England. This is not a new question.  Emigration to Britain is not new and up to the last year or two, all Governments here approached this question more or less along the same lines.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, there was very much higher emigration during the last year of the Coalition's time than ever before or since&mdash;indeed since the Famine.  The Coalition Governments during their six years in office did nothing about it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave discussed this matter in a reasonable fashion and I want to discuss it reasonably.  First of all, I shall give a little of the background.  Since I <Col N="974" /> became Minister for External Affairs, I have been taking certain steps to ensure that any of our citizens who have emigrated to Britain and who have fallen into such a state that they needed assistance have been given assistance when it has been within our competence to do so.  We have also encouraged their neighbours to help. Everybody, I think, realise that it would be impossible for the State to extend all our social services to the Irish in Britain or in any other part of the world.  In order to take care of Irish citizens in Britain from the cradle to the grave, we would have at least to double the amount already spent on social services.  I appointed a special officer in the Embassy in London to organise Irish groups to help themselves and, in particular, to help any of the Irish people needing help who came to their particular districts. That has been pretty successful. I have also persuaded the Department of Finance to recompense the Ambassador in London when he finds it necessary to send an Irish citizen home; he is entitled to send the citizen home and the Department of Finance will subsequently cover the expenses involved.  That has worked reasonably well.</P>
      <P>We cannot undertake to take care of every Irish citizen who goes to Britain, if he remains in Britain.  If he wishes to return home, the State will, of course, give him the same rights and the same access to public assistance of various kinds as he would have, had he remained at home.  I do not think we can go further than that without grave hardship to the Irish taxpayers.  If we were to double what we are paying at the moment for social welfare, or even increase the amount by ten per cent, in order to take care of our people who are resident in Britain, that would affect our ability to develop our own economy in order to take care of more of our citizens who might remain at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy O.J. Flanagan and others raised the question of young people going to Britain. Preventing these young people would be an attractive idea if it could be worked out, but there is no effective <Col N="975" /> way in our circumstances to stop either young or old people going to Britain.  One way in which it possibly could be done would be the introduction of a passport system between here and Britain.  In 1949, the Coalition Government were very concerned to establish that Irish citizens and British citizens should be free to move to and fro across the Irish Sea without passports. The introduction of a passport system would be very upsetting to thousands and thousands of travellers who cross both ways during the year. It would gravely delay the clearance of passengers through air and sea ports and it would not effectively stop any person who wanted to get to Britain without a passport.</P>

If he does not want us to do that, he should show us how we can put a stop to it, how we can pick out and interrogate people we think are too young or have not got their parents' consent.

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave suggested we should encourage Irish acting groups to go abroad.  The Cultural Relations Committee make grants to encourage groups to give dramatic performances in other countries but the amount of money they have is, of course, very limited.  He also suggested we should have press representatives here.  I have dealt pretty fully with what we did to bring press and other representatives of television and radio here and I adverted to the good results which had accrued.</P>
      <P>I am glad it was not left to me alone to pay tribute to the Irish diplomatic service, particularly after the utterly unwarranted attack made on that service by Deputy M. O'Leary.  I do not know what good cause can be served by that type of allegation, be it a Party cause or an Irish cause.  The truth lies more with the Deputy who said that Ireland was very well served by its Diplomatic Corps, by the officials of the Department of External Affairs. Having had 34 years intimate experience of the Civil Service in various Governments, I want to say that the officials of the Department of External Affairs are well to the fore.  The people can be assured that they are doing a highly intelligent job and that they are extremely hardworking young men and ladies.  We have a right to be proud of them and to be thankful that we have people like them to do the work that requires to be done. I also consider that we are lucky in this regard when I see the difficulty that some of these younger countries, countries which have newly found their freedom, experience in keeping up with the work of their foreign affairs departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary alleged that we <Col N="977" /> have said nothing about the Vietnam War at any time.  I have said everything, in public and in private, which I considered it appropriate to be said by an Irish representative in the present circumstances.  We all know that is just not a war between a single big state and a single small state; there is very much more behind it than just that.  We know, too, that the American people are very concerned to see that the war is brought to an end as quickly as possible and that a peace which will safeguard the people of Vietnam and their neighbours from war is arrived at.  I must say that I am altogether in favour of the invitation issued by President Johnson to the Viet Cong&mdash;an invitation which has been supported by all sorts of people in all parts of the world, for whom I have a great respect&mdash;that the Viet Cong should agree to come to a conference table and see whether, through negotiations, a peaceful settlement of this disastrous war cannot be brought about.  If it is going to be settled, it will have to be either settled by one side blotting out the other or by the commencement of negotiations which will be brought to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary alleged that in some way we had lost the confidence and goodwill of the small countries of the United Nations, particularly of African nations.  I do not know how he has got that impression, certainly he has no firm evidence for it.  If I wanted to, I could quote dozens of tributes which over the years, and particularly during the past couple of years, have been paid to the Irish delegation by the delegations from the young African countries.  One of the best tributes&mdash;and which cannot be disputed&mdash;was the vote which was cast on the motion first introduced by the Irish delegation in regard to mandatory assessments for peace-keeping and which when it finally came to a vote, received 33 votes, of which 16 came from Africa.  That is a pretty good indication of where the Africans stood.</P>
    <P>There is simply no truth in the suggestion that the Africans regard us as being attached to any great power, <Col N="978" /> east or west.  The African delegations and all other delegations attending the United Nations are intelligent enough to see the Irish line and how closely we try to follow it and how insistent we are in promoting the solutions to problems that we think are appropriate in the circumstances. While you had these 16 African nations voting for this peace-keeping resolution, not a single big country voted for it.  We have been fighting the battle for the restoration of these mandatory assessments for peace-keeping for the past two years and the Africans know our attitude perfectly well.  They also know perfectly well what our line is in regard to South Africa, Rhodesia and South West Africa.</P>
    <P>We treat the Africans for what they are.  Their representatives are intelligent men who are, like ourselves, doing their best for the peace of the world and the happiness of mankind.  We treat them as intelligent men.  If they put up a proposition that we do not think is wise, we say so and we give them our reasons.  We argue it out with them.  We neither vote for a proposition because it is made by Africans nor vote against it because it is made by Africans; we vote for a proposition whether it is put forward by Africans or Asians, by a big power or a small power, because we believe it is in the interests of the peoples of the world that it should be passed.</P>
    <P>At the last session of the United Nations when the Africans put forward a resolution in relation to South-West Africa, the matter was discussed for several days.  I told my friends among the Africans that I did not like their resolution, that if it was not amended, I would vote against it as it stood.  I made a speech and the suggestion I made in relation to the problem of South-West Africa was that the United Nations should repudiate the Republic of South Africa's claim over the territory and set up a commission of 14 to report to the Assembly as to the best means of establishing the democratic rights of the people of the territory. That suggestion commended itself not only to a number of Europeans but also to a number of Africans.  The result <Col N="979" /> of it was that the resolution, amended as we suggested, was finally, after months of negotiation, adopted and there were only two States who voted against it, South Africa and Portugal, and one or two more abstained.</P>
    <P>Coming to the question of Rhodesia, when the United Nations passed a resolution calling for voluntary sanctions on Southern Rhodesia, we implemented them here without any hesitation.  It was not that I thought at that time that voluntary sanctions imposed on Rhodesia were likely to be extremely effective, but that we wanted to make certain that if they were not effective, the blame or any share of it, could not be thrown on us.  When the recent Security Council mandatory sanctions were imposed, we found that all the commodities they said must be excluded from purchase by other countries had already been stopped by us.</P>
    <P>Many people think that the imposition of sanctions is some sort of magic ring and that it is a very simple method of pressing a country to yield to the popular will of the United Nations.  As one whose memory goes back to the dire failure of sanctions against Italy at the time of the war in Ethiopia, I approach any proposition for sanctions with my eyes open.  I do not shut them and swallow sanctions automatically and gratefully. I am convinced that there are cases in which sanctions will not compel the country against which they are applied to change its policy. Where a country is rich, has a great deal of the essential resources for a full and opulent life, and if these are within its own borders, it is not too easy to press such a country to the point where it is prepared to yield what it does not want to yield.</P>
    <P>We had the experience of sanctions here, too, when what was equivalent to a regime of sanctions was applied from 1932 to 1938.  Although they imposed terrific economic hardship on sections of our people, the people were prepared to stand up against them and not to yield until we got the <Col N="980" /> settlement we thought was right and just.  If we had not stood up against them, we would have lost any claim to independence in our affairs, no matter what was written in the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Another thing about sanctions that presents a great difficulty and about which I spoke in the United Nations, and particularly to a number of my acquaintances who were on the Security Council, is that a policy of sanctions decided upon by the United Nations can be very unfair in its effect on the various members of the United Nations.  If the United Nations decide to impose sanctions against country A, country B may be 10,000 miles away from it and will go gaily along with the idea of sanctions, not having bought anything from country A or ever expecting to sell anything to it.  However, country C may be living very closely beside and may be dependent upon A for transport facilities to the sea, maybe dependent upon A for the vital necessities of life, which it cannot get elsewhere.  These are difficulties in the application of sanctions that I suggest should be taken into account.  The burden resulting from the imposition of sanctions should be distributed among all countries whether or not they have been engaged in trade with the country against which sanctions are being imposed.  These considerations have always made me hesitate to vote for sanctions against South Africa, because anybody who knows the country or has read about it knows the vast resources there are in that country.</P>
    <P>They have all the gold in the world and nowadays people seem to be willing to give any service in order to get gold.  They have all the food they want, all the clothes they want.  They have not got sufficient petrol but already they have started to produce synthetic petrol from their coal and they have unlimited supplies of coal of the best quality for hydrogenation into oil. Once they have a ten per cent production with a little reserve stock they could easily adjust themselves to a total embargo of oil and continue to prosper even if they were cut off from the <Col N="981" /> rest of the world for many decades to come.  So sanctions are not as easy as people try to make them sound when they parade with placards demanding sanctions as the simple, obvious and just solution to all the problems that affect us.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to our application for membership of the European Community and Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde dwelt on the matter for a very long time last night and this morning.  I cannot fully follow what Sir Anthony Esmonde wants us to do. The British have made an application for membership of the European Community. We have made an application for membership of the European Community and no speaker for Fianna Fáil ever attempted to conceal the fact that as 75 per cent of our present trade is with Great Britain the erection of a tariff barrier between us would cause great difficulty to us.  If we went into the Common Market and Britain was left out the European Community tariff barrier would be erected between us and Britain and I do not think anyone in his senses would say that that would not be a very serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Esmonde is making that proposition or not.  He seems to be hinting that that is what we should do.  I do not think he is speaking for Fine Gael because I do not think that they have come out with the proposition that we should apply to join irrespective of the result of the British application.  I think that all sensible people who wish to see the European Community grow, who wish that we should be a member of it, will agree that the efforts we have made towards our application for membership are appropriate in the circumstances, that we have made a reasonable approach and a proper approach.</P>
    <P>I do not think that in the circumstances of the past four or five years the Community would have been extended, no matter what anyone says. There have been difficulties in the way of admitting new members up to this time as a solution had to be found for internal difficulties before the members of the Community <Col N="982" /> could face up to the difficulties of the admission of new members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer to give my own summary in my own words.  I have given it.  Responsible people who do not want to make political capital out of this matter but who want to see what the Government has been doing in this vital matter of the EEC realise that we have been responsible about it, that we have been as active as was necessary, without importuning people at the wrong time and in the wrong way when our efforts would have had a negative effect.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde said that I said that bilateral agreements are a thing of the past.  I did not say that.  I said that as freedom of trade extends there is greater difficulty in negotiating bilateral agreements of any importance. We have bilateral agreements which we are negotiating and trying to make as useful as possible for our exports with France, Germany and Finland and we are proposing to make a trade agreement with Japan.  Bilateral trade agreements are not nearly as productive as they used to be. There are less restrictions on trade, and bilateral agreements were largely designed to lower restrictions between the countries involved in trade in certain commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have dealt with the major issues raised in the debate.  I realise that, by not making speeches on many occasions open to me to make them on items of policy related to external affairs, it might have given the impression to some people I am not particularly interested.  But I feel&mdash;<Col N="983" /> I do not know whether I am right or wrong&mdash;that, if over the years I came back here from the United Nations and accepted all the invitations I get from colleges and groups of all sorts all over the country, and repeated the arguments I made in the United Nations on the China question, the question of Tibet, non-dissemination, restoration of mandatory assessments for peace-keeping and so on, the Opposition groups would think I was trying to collect votes on it, that I was going around the country repeating what I said in the United Nations for the purpose of getting votes.  Their natural reaction might be that they would try and pick holes in the policies I have been associated with in the United Nations for the past ten years.  I deliberately refused to go and make these speeches all over the country, and I think that has paid off in the long run.</P>
    <P>There are few countries in which the main Parties have so much general agreement on external affairs as we have.  In conversation with some of my colleagues at the United Nations I have given instances of this solidarity. One of them we have all a right to be proud of was in relation to the Congo.  Notwithstanding there was a general election in progress when the Jadotville incident occurred and the Belgian papers started screaming that an Irish company had been wiped out, none of the Opposition Parties tried to make an issue of the dire tragedy that was supposed to have befallen our troops or tried to make Fianna Fáil responsible for it.  Indeed, there was just one or two gentlemen who tried to cross the line and make some play with it, but they were closed down by their own Parties.</P>
    <P>It is healthy, though a little bit of a nuisance, that when we debate external affairs instead of the broader issues being raised petty sniping points are made.  But that should be regarded as a tribute to the agreement that has been maintained on the main issues affecting our external relations.  There is no difference between this House on <Col N="984" /> partition, which in one way can be regarded as an internal affair.  I do not agree with Deputy Esmonde when he said there was no difference between what Prime Minister Wilson said on partition and what had been said by his predecessors.  I have had very intimate experience of dealing with his predecessors on the partition issue for this last 34 years and for longer.  I know exactly what they said about their attitude towards partition.  They did use some of the words used by Prime Minister Wilson that they would like to see Ireland united, but they stopped at that.  If you followed that up by asking them &ldquo;If the Irish will agree, will you agree?&rdquo;  they would not say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Prime Minister Wilson the other day said that they would agree, that it would get his blessing.</P>
    <P>That is a very big step forward.  It is no harm to recognise it is a step forward and to hope that, not only would he give his blessing to an agreement to restore Irish unity when the job had been accomplished, but that he would do everything he could to help to bring about that situation. I think he realises, as most Irishmen have always realised, that Irish unity is not against British interests but is as much in the interest of Britain almost as it is of Ireland.  Instead of Irish unity doing damage to Britain, it would do her a great deal of good. I think Deputy Esmonde was quite wrong in saying that Prime Minister Wilson's attitude is the same as that of his predecessors.  To my knowledge, it was quite different.  The difference was very welcome indeed and I hope it will be followed up in the future.</P>
    <P>On that issue of Partition and on the question of joining the Common Market, I do not see any great difference between us.  We make little points as to whether we are going in before or after, an inch in front or an inch behind, but that is all so much play.  Fundamentally, I think we would all be glad that Europe should get together, that the Six would open up their ranks for the admission of other members prepared to join in and accept the conditions <Col N="985" /> of the Rome Treaty.  By and large, the great majority of Members in all Parties agree that the world would be very much improved and much more stable and likely to make greater progress towards a really stable peace if Europe were organised and if this part of the world in which so many quarrels led to such terrible bloodshed over the centuries and over the millennia, finally made peace, came together and united as a European group.  That would have a tremendous influence on the future of the world.  I am glad that we see eye to eye on these matters.  It is a very healthy thing for the country.</P>
    <P>Some of the matters that were not raised today were also significant.  I did not make any secret of the fact that I spent the last two sessions at the United Nations trying to get a restoration of the mandatory assessment for peace-keeping.  Everybody knew that; it was in all the papers and we sent the information to all the Deputies.  The fact that this was not raised and not a word said against it is significant.  I am very grateful for the indication that in making the stand we made for the restoration of mandatory assessments, we appear to have the unanimous support of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page, to delete lines 14 to 17 and substitute &ldquo;of &lsquo;(if the dwelling is neither a house nor a separate and self-contained flat) or forty pounds (if the dwelling is a house) or thirty pounds (if the dwelling is a separate and self-contained flat)&rsquo; and by the insertion after &lsquo;forty pounds&rsquo; of &lsquo;(if the dwelling is neither a house nor a separate and self-contained flat) or thirty pounds (if the dwelling is a house) or twenty pounds (if the dwelling is a separate and self-contained flat)&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to remove from the scope of the rent restrictions code self-contained flats having valuations exceeding £30, if they are situated in the Dublin area, or £20 where they are situated elsewhere. Of course, any tenants affected by this decontrol will be given automatically the right to the protection afforded by Part III of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  This means that they may have a 21 year lease at something less than the open-market rent, less an allowance for any improvements which they or their predecessors have made.  However, where payment of this rent would cause hardship, special provision is made in section 12 of the Bill, as it is now proposed to be amended, to ensure that in such cases a lease of ten years duration is given at a rent which the tenant is able to afford.  As in the case of houses with valuations exceeding £40 in Dublin&mdash;£30 elsewhere&mdash;which the Bill already proposes to decontrol, it is extremely unlikely that the kind of person who occupies a self-contained flat of such a high valuation will not be in a position to pay the economic rent; but if there are any such persons, their requirements are fully catered for in the provision for having a reduced rent in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> This is really an extension to self-contained flats of the decontrol by reference to valuation already provided in the Bill for houses.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 is of course related to this in that it proposes to transfer from the protection of the Rent Acts to the protection of the Landlord and Tenant Act any houses or self-contained flats which become occupied, after this Bill becomes law, by an unmarried person between the ages of 21 and 65 years.  It means that in this limited category, while the tenants' right to security of tenure is being fully protected&mdash;in fact they will be automatically entitled to a lease for 21 years at least&mdash;the rent may be increased to what they can afford to pay.  As in the case of the other premises which are being decontrolled under section 2 of the Bill, section 12 will ensure that where payment of the economic rent would involve hardship, the court may fix the new rent at a figure which the tenant can afford, and this figure will continue to govern the rent for the following ten years.</P>
    <P>My main object in moving this amendment is that of encouraging the fullest use of the existing housing accommodation.  There are many cases where houses are seriously underoccupied because they have passed into the possession of unmarried men and women who remain in possession because the rent is so far below economic levels.  In my opinion, there is no strong case for continuing the application of the Rent Acts to such persons and the protection of the Landlord and Tenant Acts to which I propose that they should be transferred is fully adequate in present-day circumstances.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 16, which is also being discussed, is really a consequential amendment on Nos. 1 and 3.</P>

      <P>On Second Reading, I made a case, generally speaking, that a time of acute housing shortage was not the time to proceed with decontrol.  I also pointed out that there is an anomaly in the rent restrictions code in that what we are in fact doing is requiring private landlords to <Col N="988" /> subside tenants.  I pointed out, I think, that whatever might be said for the case of needy tenants&mdash;on the balance of hardship, I thought most people would come down on the side of the needy tenant and there is a case for requiring, as we are doing in this legislation, a landlord to subsidise the needy tenant&mdash;there is that distinction in the view of many people, the distinction between the needy tenant and the tenant who cannot be classed as needy. By and large, the grievance which householders have against rent restriction is not so much the question of control of rent but control of getting possession.  I wish to query the Minister on this point.</P>
      <P>Having regard to house values today, a case can be put up that in reducing the valuation limit to £40 and £30, we may be continuing to benefit what one might call the comfortable or well-off tenants who are obtaining subsidies from their landlords.  I imagine that in many cases houses with valuations of £30 have a market value of anything up to £5,000.  Therefore, by relating the poor law valuation to the market value of the house, we are saying that an owner of a £5,000 house must continue to subsidise the tenant of that house because the house is controlled. My query is whether we are holding the scales of justice evenly in this case. I am not talking about control of rent but from the point of view of the landlord not being able to get possession. The Minister has pointed out that in cases where control has been taken off by reducing the valuation limit, the tenant's rights under the Landlord and Tenant Act to get a lease&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is my view that when there is a housing shortage, it is not good to go in for a policy of decontrol.  I am trying to distinguish, and I think I can, between the needy tenant and the tenant who is not needy. I am in favour of extending decontrol in cases where you cannot make out a case that the tenant is needy or that he requires this additional subsidy which <Col N="989" /> is being imposed by the legislature on the Landlord.</P>
      <P>One other point I wish to raise concerns the drafting of the Minister's amendment.  The amendment states, &ldquo;if the dwelling is neither a house nor a separate and self-contained flat&rdquo;. The definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; in the 1960 Act is &ldquo;a house or part of a house&rdquo;.  It seems to me we are becoming a little absurd if we read the Minister's amendment and then have regard to the definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;. Here we state in the amendment: &ldquo;If a dwelling is neither a house nor a separate and self-contained flat&rdquo;, whereas, by definition, &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; is a house.  Reading the definition and the amendment together it would come out something like &ldquo;if a house or part of a house is neither a house nor a separate and self-contained flat&rdquo;.  That is what the Minister is asking us to do now.  The distinction is in the use of the word &ldquo;means&rdquo;, in the definition section of the 1960 Act.  This seems to me to require further amendment to make it state that &ldquo;dwelling includes a house or part of a house&rdquo;, again condensing it, rather than stating: &ldquo;A dwelling means...&rdquo; If we retain the definition it simply makes nonsense of the amendment.  I should like the Minister to look at that small point which might make trouble.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment to the provisions which for the first time give a small landlord the right to have a fair rent determined by the District Court.  It is designed to deal with the case where the landlord and tenant can agree between themselves on the amount of that rent, and thus obviate the necessity for any court proceedings.  Of course, having the rent fixed by the court has the advantage that the amount becomes a matter of court record and there can be no subsequent dispute about it. On the other hand, I think we ought to avoid litigation wherever possible and encourage agreements voluntarily entered into.  The amendment accordingly <Col N="992" /> provides that any revised rent which is agreed between a small landlord and one of his tenants shall have the same effect as if the rent had been determined by the District Court itself.</P>

There is a very grave distinction between what the Minister has described as being a matter of court record&mdash; where the merits have been discussed by a judicial person&mdash;and a determination made of a rent in the matter of a private mutual agreement which, in this case, is almost always an agreement between two parties, one of whom is vulnerable and the other relatively invulnerable.  I take it these agreements are very largely in respect of tenants of very small lettings.  If every such tenant knew the law as well as an experienced Dublin solicitor does, he would, of course, know there was protection for him under the law.

The nightmare that hangs over her is the fear that she will be evicted.  A blustering small landlord tells her: &ldquo;This is now the law and, if you do not pay up the new rent, I will bring you to the District Court.&rdquo;  She does not realise that the District Court is, in fact, her protector. She does not like going into the District <Col N="993" /> Court at all.  Am I right in understanding the Minister to say that, if such an elderly person, apprehending being brought into the District Court, enters into a private agreement with a small landlord, that will have the same statutory effect as a rent fixed by the District Court?  If it has, then I think the Minister ought to look at it again.</P>

      <P>I suppose Deputy O'Higgins knows what the statutory definition of a self-contained flat is!  I do not.  Some of the so called self-contained flats I have been in in the poorer parts of Dublin consist of a bedroom, something that is described as a kitchenette, and a lavatory in the yard. That would not be what most of us conceive a self-contained flat to be. Deputy O'Higgins has a good deal more experience of this kind of thing than I have.  If he is satisfied with this arrangement, then so am I, but it causes me a little concern that the protection afforded by the intervention of the District Court should be weighted in this way if we are to give statutory effect to the rent created under the amendment the Minister now submits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know a small two storey house in the city of Dublin.  The landlord lives in what I and the Minister would ordinarily regard as a bedroom.  The tenant lives on the ground floor, which consists of one <Col N="994" /> substantial room, one small room, a kitchenette, and a lavatory in the yard shared between them.  For the purposes of the Minister's amendment, I think the bottom of the premises would be deemed to be a flat.  I can see that it is unreasonable to ask the Minister to answer this off the cuff: does that description adequately describe a flat or a room?  What I am always afraid of is that, when one makes a concession of this kind and gives statutory effect to an agreement arising therefrom, it is some little anonymous person who gets hit.  I do not know if the Minister saw Dr. Zhivago where you have a Russian colonel describing a <i>femme fatale</i> as having disappeared into Siberia as a forgotten number on a mislaid document.  I am always thinking of the forgotten numbers on mislaid documents and we in this House are the people who represent them.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking, we should encourage voluntary agreement between two parties, in this case between the small landlord and the tenant but, by and large, the tenant is in the weaker position.  Quite apart from the landlord seeking to take advantage of the tenant, the tenant probably feels that he is in a position in which he cannot argue.  The only thing that worries me is clause (c) (2) of the Minister's amendment in which it is specifically stated that where there is this voluntary agreement, there can be no question of an application to the court.  Deputy Dillon is, therefore, correct in arguing that, whatever protection there is, there is no protection even if the tenant subsequently regrets the agreement and feels that, had he understood the position properly, that he could have gone into court and had the rent fixed, he would have done so. But here there is no remedy.  There is no appeal.  There is no way of bringing the matter into court.  I see the Minister's difficulty.  Offhand, I cannot think of an escape route.  Possibly the answer is that, if there is any question of fraud, or anything like that, the tenant can then go in and explain and the agreement may be set aside.  That is the only worry I have.  In principle, I approve of the idea.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the section and the amendment is in ease of the small landlord who, as Deputy Dillon is aware, is in most cases quite poor.  The section is in answer to representations made to me by a number of small landlords throughout the country.  The definition is limited to a landlord with six, or less, houses or self-contained flats.  We provide that the landlord must state the fact that he is the landlord of six, or less, houses or self-contained flats. There is nothing misleading in the form of the notice.  The tenant has a remedy there because the landlord if he gives misleading information will be criminally liable and the tenant will also have his civil rights.  I see Deputy Dillon's point.  No matter how tight we make the regulations or the laws hardship may be done to some person but, on balance, I think there is a case for easing the position in relation to the small landlord.  Here you have two small people, as it were, meeting each other by way of a voluntary arrangement. We do not want to drive them into court if they can reach agreement. If they can reach agreement on the new rent in the prescribed way, we say under the amendment that that will be the rent without the official court determination. I can appreciate Deputy Dillon's fear, the case of the strong landlord and the weak tenant but here we have an equalisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think I am being unreasonable when I ask the Minister to elaborate on &ldquo;self-contained flat&rdquo;.  The Minister obviously must have given the matter some thought.  The ordinary definition of a self-contained flat is that the flat should contain all the normal amenities of residence, save what may be a common staircase.  In the poorer sections of Dublin city, and I am sure, in Cork and Limerick, you have what are called self-contained flats where you have a livingroom, bedroom, what is described as a kitchenette and not infrequently in the rear yard of the building, common sanitary accommodation. Many of these premises do not have running water in the premises except in the yard.  Would such an apartment, if the landlord were living in the top flat and the tenant on the ground floor, be deemed to be a self-contained flat for the purpose of this amendment?</P>

      <P>I will.  As far as lawyers are concerned, the meaning is clear enough.  It has been on the strict criterion that a flat is self-contained provided the only amenity shared is the common staircase.  Anything outside that category is not self-contained. That has been a reasonably rigid categorisation which has been interpreted by the courts and has not been the cause of dispute.

We frequently find in regard to adapted flats in urban areas that before the flat building is adapted the central heating system primarily designed for the residential part of the house had one heating unit or one radiator in what is now euphemistically described as the garden flat.  Now the Minister might, with the best intentions, rush in to give a definition only to discover that the presence of the one radiator in the garden flat had taken that flat out of the category in which it was clearly his intention to include it.  I acknowledge freely the question is one of some difficulty, because while we are here primarily concerned with an anomaly, I do not want to rush the Minister into a categorical undertaking that he will make a statutory definition which he might find it extremely difficult to make. However, if he will think about it and do the best he can, we shall be satisfied.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to paragraph (e) of the new subsection (1A) which section 4 of the Bill proposes to insert in section 8 of the 1960 Act.  Paragraph (e) provides that where a small landlord applies to the District Court for the fixing of a fair rent he or she is to be liable for the tenant's costs in that Court.  It seems to me, on reflection, <Col N="1001" /> that an inflexible rule of this kind may operate unfairly in the case of some of these landlords who are elderly and in reduced circumstances, and where some of the tenants in these cases could be fairly comfortably off. On balance, I think it is better to leave the decision to the Court, having regard to the circumstances.</P>

      <P>In the Minister's amendment should he not insert that the Court will have particular regard not merely to the means of the tenant but the means of the landlord. Obviously the Minister is correct; the small landlord may be deriving only a very small income from a property and he will not be well off, and there are cases where the tenants who are not needy would be continuing to get protection.  That kind of case could come in here, but what the Minister is doing in his amendment is directing the attention of the Court particularly to the income of the tenant.  I do not think it would unbalance the Minister's amendment in any way to say simply that the court should have regard both to the means of the landlord and the tenant.</P>

      <P>Yes, this amendment is consequential on No. 17 which proposes to repeal subsection (3) of section 8 of the 1960 Act.  Subsection (3) of section 8 of that Act provided that the basic rent of a dwelling which was let on 31st December, 1960, and whose basic rent was, therefore, automatically fixed at the actual rent being paid at that date, could be adjusted by the tenant to the figure it should have <Col N="1003" /> been under the 1946 Rent Act simply by his going to the Court and producing evidence that the basic rent under the 1946 Act had been determined by the Court or by arbitration in accordance with the previous Rent Acts.  This remedy of the tenant was a refinement of the remedy he was already given by subsection (2) of section 8 of that Act to have the rent reduced where he considered the 1960 rent to have been unduly high, that is, by exceeding the reasonable rent by more than 12½ per cent of the basic rent.  This is really a deletion because in practice since 1960 it has not been used at all.  Whatever might have been the case for putting it into the 1960 Act, I think it is an unnecessary refinement now.</P>

      <P>In subsection (3), to delete &ldquo;subsection&rdquo; where occurring firstly in line 44, page 5, and to substitute &ldquo;subsections&rdquo; and to add after line 17, page 6, the following:</P>

      <P>(a) apart from this subsection, paragraph (f) of subsection (2) of this section would not apply in respect of a controlled dwelling which is not the sole controlled dwelling of which its landlord is landlord, and</P>
      <P>(b) taking all the controlled dwellings of which he is landlord&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) during the period of three years ending on the 8th day of June, 1966, he has expended a <Col N="1004" /> sum exceeding one-third of the aggregate of the basic rents, or</P>
    <P>(ii) during the period of six years ending on that date, he has expended a sum exceeding two-thirds of that aggregate,</P>
    <P>on maintenance such as is referred to in the paragraph of all or any of the dwellings,</P>
    <P>the paragraph shall apply in respect of the controlled dwelling.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that landlords of more than one dwelling who have spent sums in excess of the prescribed amounts on repairs during the six years between 1960 and 1966 would be entitled to the 15 per cent increase allowed by section 6 of the Bill on each of their dwellings.  In other words, once a landlord of more than one controlled dwelling can produce evidence that he has spent more than the prescribed sums on the maintenance of all the dwellings during the period&mdash;that is, either a sum exceeding one-third of the aggregate of the basic rents during the three years ending on 8th June, 1966, or a sum exceeding two-thirds of the aggregate during the six years ending on that date&mdash;he becomes entitled to the increase.  This amendment is in line, therefore, with the policy of the Bill, which is to give the presentage increase only to landlords who have, in fact, been spending reasonable sums on repairs. The purpose of the amendment is really to aggregate the repairs over the total number of dwellings on which a landlord has spent money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The case was <Col N="1005" /> made to me by a number of landlords that otherwise there would be an undue burden placed on them.  They want this 15 per cent in respect of such repairs. The case was made that if the increase were allowed only in respect of each of the houses repaired, this would place an undue burden on them in respect of administration and accountancy. The case was made that, if the specified sums were spent on all the property, they could increase the rents in each case by 15 per cent.  There is some merit in that case.  We are giving very minimal rent increases in the Bill and there is no doubt that a number of these properties are falling into disrepair.</P>
      <P>The case put to me was that if the 15 per cent increase had to be justified for each house in a big property, it would cause an undue administrative and accountancy burden for the landlord. They have done many little jobs here and there over the past six years in order to keep the property in repair and they maintain that it would be a burden on them to account for each of these jobs.  They have made a case for a 15 per cent increase, but it is a matter on which I have a fairly open mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the importance of allowing a reasonable sum for repairs for the preservation of property.  That is the case made for this Bill and the whole justification is that the money is spent on repair of these premises.  Under this amendment, it could be that this 15 per cent increase, which is intended to be justified only if money has been spent on repairs, can be put on five out of six houses, even if not a penny has been spent on five of the houses.  If a landlord spends a lot on one house out of the six, under the amendment he is not only going to be allowed to increase the rent on that house by 15 per cent, but he is also going to be allowed to increase the rent by 15 per cent on the other five houses on which he has not spent a penny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that this is running completely counter to the arguments advanced in favour of the principles of the Bill, arguments which have considerable strength.  It is necessary, <Col N="1006" /> if houses are to be preserved, that landlords should get some compensation to encourage them to keep their property in proper repair but this amendment gives an increase to the landlord for five houses out of six, although he has not spent a penny in repairs on these five.</P>

He repairs one of the houses in Sandymount and he arrives out to the tenants in Palmerston and tells them that he is going to increase their rent by 15 per cent.  The tenants ask him why and he says that it is because he has spent money repairing his houses in Sandymount.</P>

If the principle of rent restriction is to be maintained at all, and on the Second Stage it was apparently determined to maintain it, surely it is a complete departure from that principle to say that the person who is in possession of six houses and carries out repairs on one can charge a 15 per cent increase on the six.</P>

      <P>My prescience is positively astounding.  I thought I heard rumours of this proposal in circles far removed from the destitute landlord. This is in relief of the big property owner who has been hit by the recent Finance Act.  Up to the passing of that Act, revenues from some of these properties were not subject to the ordinary code of income tax and these people have suddenly found a fresh burden of income tax placed on them.

They are a body of people owning very valuable property which has given them a fair return but which, over the past ten years or so, has not given a corresponding revenue expansion. It is our business to see that they are equitably dealt with under the law if they are citizens of this country, but I think that the Minister is going too far in saying that this proposal is consistent with the principles of the Bill.  Under it, a person who owns ten flat buildings in Dublin can come along and say that because he repairs one of these buildings, he is therefore entitled to raise the rent on all ten by 15 per cent in order to compensate himself for the exceptional outlay he has made on one of them.  This is an amendment the Minister would do well to reconsider.  I think it will be felt to be a concession to a not inconsiderable vested interest, which is more than they can reasonably expect to enjoy under a rent restriction code.</P>

The effect of this amendment will be that the landlords will concentrate money on a few houses to the deteriment of <Col N="1008" /> others.  I am not satisfied that the arguments put forward to the Minister by the representatives of the landlords are valid at all.  The landlords are business people and, as such, keep strict accounts of the money they spend and where they spend it.  I do not think they are so careless as not to be concerned about what house they spend the money on.  These arguments do not hold water and are too trivial to support this amendment.</P>

      <P>I think there is a misunderstanding about this.  This is the basic 15 per cent rent increase we are talking about, not the ten per cent allowed for the future expenditure on maintenance.  This applies in effect to repairs that have already been executed since June, 1960 and before June, 1966.  This was dealt with very fully on the Second Stage.  It goes to the whole root of the Bill.  We must get down to the reality of how repair costs have risen since 1960.  Everybody is familiar with the rise in building cost since 1960.  Repair costs have gone even higher and are in the region of from 35 per cent to 40 per cent of an increase.</P>

      <P>We are dealing here with a situation of the inability of landlords to meet mounting repair costs since 1960.  I am providing here that, where they have in fact spent money on repairs since 1960, they may have an increase of 15 per cent, although in most cases repair costs have increased from 35 per cent to 40 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is where the Minister is going off the line.  If it is being spent on a particular property, the rent of which is being increased, I do not think anybody objects to that; but what the Minister is recommending in his amendment is that, if it is spent on any part of the landlord's property, he can increase other parts of his property.</P>

      <P>I am coming to that.  All we are doing here, in effect, is providing a minimum increase as far as the landlord is concerned.  All the attacks on me have been on account of the inadequate nature of the increase. The case has been put to me, and I am convinced of it, that it is not sufficient to meet the repair costs falling on landlords since 1960.  In order to keep their property in a proper state of maintenance, an average increase of from 35 to 40 per cent has been required.  Going strictly on that, this 15 per cent is entirely inadequate.  The amendment proposes that their property be looked at <i>in toto</i> in assessing this 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is in case of the good landlord. That is the ironical part of it.  It is not in case of the bad landlord who allows his property to fall into disrepair. They do not come under this. This is in case of the good landlord who has a proper repair service.  There are a number of property companies, in Dublin particularly, who may have between 100 and 500 houses under their control, who are concerned about keeping their housing investments in proper repair and who have spent money on housing repairs over the past six years well in excess of the minimum required to qualify for the 15 per cent increase.  These people do not keep an itemised account of each house repaired.  The case has been put to me that it would be an intolerable burden that, every time a plumber or carpenter went out to do repairs to a house, an itemised account be kept in respect of a couple of hundred houses week in week out over a period of six years.  These people say that is out of the question.  They have not got these records.  As I say, these are the good <Col N="1010" /> landlords.  These are the people who are known in the city to keep their dwellings in proper repair, who have tenants happy in their dwellings, at a lower rent in practically all cases than local authority houses.  These people have not kept such records.  They know in total what they have spent on repairs over that number of years, but they could not keep an itemised account in respect of each small repair. They have not done so in the past.  This amendment is designed to case their burden.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister is very naive on this, but I am quite sure he is being honest about it and is making an honest case.  I do not want him to misunderstand me therefore, when I say I do not accept that case.  I do not.  The person who is efficient and who has been doing work over the last six years, the person of whom the Minister speaks, is the person who most certainly has kept accurate records of exactly how much has been spent on each house. There may be some cases where that has not been done and where there is simply a global figure.  But I would be very surprised to find any substantial number of cases where there is only a global figure.</P>

      <P>Even if we accept it fully, what is the Minister doing here?  Even where it can be proved up to the hilt that no repairs at all were done on a particular house, that not a single penny was spent, under the Minister's amendment, because the landlords can produce and prove a global figure spent on their property, that house is going to be subjected to a 15 per cent increase.  I would go further.  I think the Minister will agree with this.  Under the amendments a landlord is going to become entitled to the 15 per cent increase even where he is not liable for repairs. If he has 600 houses and is liable for repairs in some and does these repairs, spending whatever the appropriate sum is, under this amendment as I read it, he will become entitled to increase by <Col N="1011" /> 15 per cent the rents of houses where he has no responsibility for repairs at all and which he has not repaired and has no intention of repairing.  That is going much too far.</P>
      <P>I could accept the position, commend and see the justice of the position of compensating a landlord for repairs done and money spent on them, but I find it extremely difficult to accept the argument that because my landlord does repairs for me. Deputy Fitzpatrick should have to pay for that if he is a tenant of the same landlord.  There seems to be no justification for that sort of arrangement. It seems to me that under this amendment that if Deputy Fitzpatrick and I are tenants of different houses of the same landlord and if Deputy Fitzpatrick arranges with the landlord that he, Deputy Fitzpatrick, will be responsible for all repairs to his house and the landlord will not do anything there but if the landlord has done repairs to my house and has spent, over the past six years, sufficient to justify a 15 per cent increase in the rent, notwithstanding his agreement with Deputy Fitzpatrick, Deputy Fitzpatrick's rent is subject to an increase.</P>

If there is a very large number of houses concerned and a repair service in operation, I can see that it might be difficult to segregrate. Presumably this was the kind of case made to the Minister.  Where a large number of houses is concerned, it is quite understandable that records might not be kept but I am thinking of a number of houses up to five or six, or even 12.</P>

      <P>I accept that there is a case here.  While Deputy O'Higgins was speaking I was trying to think of some scheme whereby you could give tenants the right to come in and prove that nothing was spent on their houses and thereby they could avoid the 15 per cent increase.  That could give rise to too much litigation.  I think this idea of Deputy Fitzpatrick, which has been followed up by Deputies Pattison and O'Higgins, might help&mdash;if we could write into the Bill some limit by way of valuation or number of houses and that over that certain valuation or number this amendment would apply.  In that way one would avoid, as I have been trying to avoid, putting the onus on a good landlord&mdash;and I am satisfied the people who came to see me were good landlords, operating a repair service&mdash; of itemising accounts in respect of petty repairs over a number of years. We must draw the line somewhere. Between now and the Report Stage, I shall possibly look into the possibility of drawing an equitable line or division between the categories and having this amendment apply only to the upper category while the lower category, the case of two or three or six or 18 or 20 houses&mdash;I shall look into the level at which we should put it&mdash; should be able to itemise.  In their case this amendment would not apply and landlords could only increase rent in particular cases rather than in the total.  There is much merit in this idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the <Col N="1013" /> best thing is to leave it at that until we see the Minister's recommendation; but I believe he will have to go further. When I was speaking about the, if you like, efficient landlord and his inability to say from the records where the money was being spent, I was thinking of the activities of the landlord who owns up to half a dozen houses.  I could not see how such a landlord would not be able to say: &ldquo;I spent X pounds on repairing this hous,&rdquo; without knowing which house it was.  I can see that if there is a very large number of houses, and some of these people have 200, 300 or 400 houses, if it was not of importance to them to have a record of which houses the money was spent on, it might only go into some kind of global account showing that so much was paid to such and such a builder's provider and so on.</P>
      <P>I want to correct myself.  I can now see that the other situation could arise but even if the suggestion that has been made now to meet the case were accepted, I think the Minister would have to go much further.  Merely fixing some arbitrary line on the valuation basis or on the basis of the number of houses would not be sufficient because, to my mind, it would still be doing less than justice&mdash;to put it that way&mdash;to the tenant of a house where no money was spent that he be required to pay the increase, the justification for the increase being that money was spent on repairs.  The Minister must try to fit in with his new thinking on the matter something possibly on the lines suggested by Deputy Pattison.  He must try to fit in with his thinking the requirement that in spending the aggregate sum over all his property only houses on which some work has been done should be increased.  In other words, if it can be clearly established that no repairs have been done on a particular piece of property, the justification for an increase fails completely in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if I am right in this but I think the Minister must also look into the question of liability for repairs. As it stands, the Minister's amendment permits the landlord, even though he is not liable for repairs in some cases and <Col N="1014" /> is liable for them in other cases, to increase the rent, even where he is not liable for repairs, provided he has spent money on houses where he is liable for repairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should go the full way in this matter and give the same protection to all tenants of all landlords, no matter how many houses a landlord has or how many tenants.  A tenant should have the protection that where no repairs have been carried out for five or six years, he will not be burdened with this 15 per cent increase.  The Minister has leant over a bit too much in making the case for the 15 per cent increase. Building costs have gone up, as the Minister said, but the value of these properties has gone up much more.  The fact that repairs have been done to premises has increased their capital value also.  Property owners, landlords in general, have got the increases in their assets in the past six years.  That alone is sufficient to compensate them and to induce them to keep the property in repair because they are getting rents that have risen in some places by more than the 40 per cent or 50 per cent by which the cost of repairs has gone up.</P>
      <P>This is something we should not lose sight of.  We must be satisfied that the increase is granted only in places where it has been clearly shown the work has been done&mdash;where there is no doubt that adequate steps have been taken to keep the property in good repair.  Landlords have got adequate compensation for repair costs through the increases in the value of their property.</P>

      <P>We must look at realities.  An appreciation of capital value is a doubtful benefit when the property is subject to the rent code. I am attracted by what Deputy Fitzpatrick has said but again we must get down to realities.  We are here dealing with the good landlords.  A landlord with a large number of houses will, or the company will, have kept the houses in repair during the six year period.  Anyone with 600 or 1,000 houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am referring to such people.  They have kept each house in proper repair.  They are in business, they are professional landlords and it is in their interest, as well as in the interest of their tenants, that they should do so.  Such people have spent up to ten times the specified minimum sum on repairs.  That is why we should give these people the benefit of the amendment.  We may put an onus, which I think is a reasonable onus, on smaller landlords to show that in each individual case the repairs have been done.  To my mind that is a reasonable approach.  It would be unfair for the landlord with a limited number of houses who has not done anything in the case of one house to increase the rent of that house.  A person might not be the most efficient landlord in the world&mdash;they are not, these small landlords&mdash;and it might be unfair that the cost of repairs to all the houses should be aggregated and as a result the 15 per cent put on the tenant of a house in respect of which no repairs were carried out.</P>
      <P>In the case of some smaller landlords hardship might be imposed on tenants.  On the other hand, in the case of the big landlord it would be a fantastically unfair burden on him to vouch in an itemised way for each item of repair carried out to individual dwellings.  However, I shall have a look at the matter and at the points made by Deputies O'Higgins, Pattison and Fitzpatrick before the Report Stage and, perhaps, meet the case half way.</P>

At the same time, I do not think there is justification for an increase in the case of a house which had no money spent on it.  There would be a common form of agreement, probably covering all tenants, but if you had a situation where a landlord had property in respect of some of which he is responsible for repairs, under agreement with the tenant, but in respect of the <Col N="1016" /> remainder of which he has no liability for repairs, he should not be entitled to increase the rent of the property in the latter category.</P>

    <P>The effect of this amendment is to delete subparagraph (iv) of paragraph (a) of the new subsection to be inserted in section 13 of the 1960 Act.  Subparagraph <Col N="1017" /> (iv) provided an additional ground to the tenant for objecting against a notice of increase of rent based on expenditure by the landlord on improvements, structural alterations or repairs.  That ground was that, at the time of the application by the tenant to the Court to disallow or reduce the proposed increase in rent, the dwelling was not in good and tenantable repair. On reconsideration, it seems to me that this additional ground is unnecessary because the tenant is already entitled under section 15 of the 1960 Act to apply at any time to the Court to have the rent reduced on the ground that the dwelling is not in good and tenantable repair.  The amount of the reduction in rent provided for by section 15 of the 1960 Act in such cases is a maximum of 20 per cent.  That maximum has been increased by section 8 of the Bill to 33? per cent.

    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> That is a pretty accurate summary. Here, in section 7, we are dealing with the question of an increase of rent by means of amending section 13 of the 1960 Act.  Section 13 of that Act deals with the &ldquo;Determination of rent to be paid by tenants&rdquo;, finding out what is the rent to be charged by virtue of the increase to which the landlord claims to be entitled. It is made quite clear in section 7 here that what the court is getting is not a direct mandatory order from the Legislature but a discretion, amongst other things.  If the dwelling is not in good and tenantable repair at the time the application is made the court is getting discretion to deal with the increase entirely, in which event it probably goes back to section 15 of the 1960 Act, or discretion to reduce the amount of the increase to which the landlord would otherwise be entitled.</P>

Section 7 of the Bill applies to houses about which there is a dispute as to whether or not the work was done, as to whether or not certain repairs were adequately carried out.  There is no question of a dispute in section 15 of the 1960 Act as to work being carried out or not carried out, as the case may be.  It is a question of no repairs being done and the tenant applying for a reduction in rent because of the condition of the dwelling.  My reading of section 7 is that certain work would be carried out, the tenant would not be completely satisfied and would apply to the court for a reduction in the increase or the waiving of the increase in full.</P>

      <P>This is the section which deals with restriction of assignment.  It prescribes that a tenant shall not assign a tenancy without the consent in writing of the landlord. The consent may be withheld only if the assignment is other than to a member of the tenant's family <i>bona fide</i> residing with the tenant.  I think here again it is a question of having another look at it.  In this kind of legislation we have to try to do justice to both landlord and tenant.  As I said earlier, from the landlord's point of view, what he finds most irksome is not so much the question of control as rent as the feeling that he will never get his house.  There might seem to be a presumption in section 10 that something positive is being done to enable a landlord to get control of his property; in fact, very little is being done.  The definition of &ldquo;family&rdquo; in the 1960 Act, section 31, is very comprehensive.  Subsection (5) <Col N="1020" /> of section 31 of that Act goes a great deal further than what one would normally regard as members of a family.  Where there is undoubted <i>bona fide</i> residence justice is served by what is there at the moment, even with the fuller definition of family. Where, however, the <i>bona fide</i> nature of the residence is open to question the position is somewhat different.  I am thinking of a member of a family who takes up residence with an elderly relative in order to cash in on the tenancy when the elderly relative dies.  That is something I would not be keen to encourage.  I wonder is there something that could be done about that either from the point of view of the definition of family as contained in the 1960 Act or by some limitation on the length of time of the residence; it should not be less than 12 months, or something like that.  I am not inclined to press the Minister too hard on this but I should like him to have a look at the section in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in substantial agreement with Deputy O'Higgins.  Section 10 invites us for a moment to reflect on the whole principle of rent control.  I have been watching rent control operating in this House for over 30 years.  I often doubted the wisdom of rent control at all.  If we never had rent control, which began after the 1914-18 war, the housing problem would be far less intractable than it has proved to be. There is no use, however, crying over spilt milk; that was the decision taken 50 years ago and we are operating in the light of the situation that evolved from that fundamental decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to <Col N="1021" /> evolve in an equitable way but I have always tried to preserve in my mind the position of the sitting tenant whom in the atmosphere created by the legislation 50 years ago we determined to protect.  We are in danger now, by a whole series of amendments and judicial decisions and the abracadabra which has grown out of the original decision, of creating a situation in which we invest a sitting tenant with an interest that he can bequeath to a pretty wide category of persons who have come to be determined as members of the family and we are inviting him to make this bequest, not at his own expense but at the expense of the owner of the house in which he has lived under privileged conditions for ten, 20 or 30 years.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, it is not now impossible for a person who comes within the wide definition of a member of the family, who is herself contemplating matrimony, to come and reside with an elderly relative to establish this residential qualification as a genuine resident with the sitting tenant so as to be in a position to say to the landlord, when the elderly tenant either assigns or dies: &ldquo;Either you provide me with a dower or I propose to get married in this house and start the whole cycle all over again&rdquo;, and we can carry on the provision of rent control in this house for the next ten generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to find a reasonable <i>via media</i>.  This is a matter of special interest to Deputy Pattison.  None of us wants to go to the point of extending rent control to the stage where it could become an abuse.  We want to find an equitable arrangement which will protect legitimate interests and yet not open the door to what would develop abuses at the expense very often of people who have small properties and are dependent for their livelihood upon them.  We all know of cases of elderly people who have been left two or three houses by their husbands, who have been collecting rents from them for 30 or 40 years and which could maintain them in a modest standard of comfort but who <Col N="1022" /> are now living in dire poverty while the houses they own are deteriorating to the point where they will qualify for demolition as being dangerous structures.  I have forgotten the full scope of the categories of relatives but I think it extends to cousins.</P>

I could see a strong case being made for children, or people certainly in close family relationship, being entitled to an assignment or a residence qualification which would be relatively light if we got into the outer categories of relationship, and then I think the burden of <i>bona fide</i> residence with the sitting tenant at the time of assignment might equitably be made somewhat more onerous than would be appropriate for a son or daughter or somebody who is genuinely living with an elderly couple for the purpose of looking after them.  I recognise that the segregation may not be all that easy but I believe it could be undertaken in view of the fact that the distinction would involve the heavier burden of proof on the less closely related person, that the <Col N="1023" /><i>bona fide</i> resident was in fact <i>bona fide</i>.

      <P>The average weekly earnings of industrial workers engaged in transportable goods industries was £11 8s 7d in the year ended September, 1966, the latest period for which the data are available. This figure is derived from the data on weekly earnings collected in the quarterly industrial inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No comparable series exists in respect of agricultural activity, for which the information available is in a different form.  In 1966 it is provisionally estimated that total income arising in agriculture, excluding land annuities, was about £157 million; this covers wages and salaries of employees and income from self employment and other trading income in agriculture, as defined in the national accounts.  The estimated number of persons whose <Col N="1024" /> principal occupation was in agriculture in 1966 was 323,000.  These two aggregates which are not strictly comparable in scope and coverage, yield an average of about £9 7s per week.  It should be kept in mind however that both the estimates of agricultural income and of employment are very tentative as they are based on incomplete information and may have to be revised substantially when fuller returns are available, particularly the results of the January, 1967 Livestock Enumeration and the occupations figures from the 1966 Census of Population.</P>

The second type provided for a <Col N="1032" /> flat price of £10 per ton, without bonus.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will comment on the fall of over £4 million in total farm incomes in 1966; and what plans he has to reverse this trend in 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Firm figures for farm income in 1966 are not yet available but it is tentatively estimated by the Central Statistics Office that total farm income was about £3 million lower in 1966 than in 1965.  This reduction can be attributed in the main to the prolonged bad weather in the spring and to the decline in cattle prices in the second half of the year resulting from unfavourable conditions on export markets.  The situation in the cattle market has already improved considerably and stocks are at record levels.  There are indications that the acreage under wheat, barley and beet will increase substantially in 1967 and <Col N="1035" /> the prices for these commodities are at a high level.  Milk production&mdash;and with it the size of the producer's creamery cheque&mdash;has been rising steadily.  A further increase of 1d per gallon in the premium for quality milk comes into effect on the 1st April. Taking all these factors into consideration and bearing in mind that certain price and other improvements introduced last year will only this year become fully effective, there is every reason to believe that, given reasonable weather, farm incomes will increase significantly in 1967.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a special problem within the overall problem of a reduction of agricultural income.  I am asking the Minister if his attention has been directed to the special circumstances of the small farmer in the congested areas, whose problem is not one of falling values primarily, but of utter inability to find a purchaser for the yearling cattle on which his economy depends and at a time when his fodder supplies are seasonally dwindling.  If we have snow between now and 1st April, thousands of these cattle will die.  I would like to know if the Minister has applied his mind to that problem peculiar to the congested areas in which he himself was born and reared and which he ought to understand?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I fully understand the position but I do not subscribe to the view that fodder is a vital question at this particular time.  Nor do I subscribe to the view that if it did snow now, thousands of these cattle are going to die because thanks to the excellent season we have had so far, we have got back because of this good weather to a point which this time 12 months ago we probably thought we would never reach in regard to fodder supplies.  In the hard winter and spring of last year, we completely depleted the fodder we had and that is the first time, I believe, in my memory and in the memory of others that this happened.  The extraordinary season we have had has made up for that and I do not contemplate, even if it did snow <Col N="1038" /> now, anything of the calamitous nature suggested by the Deputy would happen. I have been keeping, and I shall continue to keep this matter closely under review because I appreciate its importance fully but I should not like it to get out that snow now would, in fact, mean the deaths of thousands of these cattle.  We are not in that critical position as regards fodder.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware of the depressed state of the agricultural community at the present time; and, if so, what action he intends to take to see that they get fair and just prices for their produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's contention about the state of agriculture or that the Government have not been doing everything possible to ensure that farmers get fair and reasonable prices. There are effective price support arrangements for a considerable range of important agricultural products, including cattle.</P>
      <P>The decline in cattle prices in the second half of 1966 was primarily due to a number of external factors over which the Government had no control, but the Government took every means open to them to alleviate the position, which, of course, has since improved considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prices of other commodities, particularly pigs, milk, wheat and sugar beet, increased in 1966, and the Agricultural Price Index for the year 1966 is expected to be only very slightly below that of 1965, and will be higher than in 1964, in which year it rose by 10 per cent.  There is no doubt but that <Col N="1039" /> there has been an improvement in the standard of living of farmers in recent years, thanks largely to the comprehensive measures which the Government have taken to increase their efficiency and to protect their markets and prices.  The Government will, of course, continue to take all practicable measures to improve farm income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with most of what the Deputy has said, and I usually do.  Farmers, far from being relegated to the position of second class citizens, have had their situation improved steadily over the years and by a strange coincidence, this improvement began about the time Fianna Fáil first came to government and has continued with only two breaks since then.  I have no doubt that the farmers' position will continue to improve until they have reached their rightful place in the community.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>I had a very useful exchange of views with the Vice-President of the EEC Commission in charge of agricultural affairs and with other representatives of the Commission about a wide range of agricultural matters, including in particular the position and prospects regarding Irish exports of cattle and beef to the Community and also questions likely to arise in relation to this country's application for membership of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further meetings are envisaged with the Commission, at Ministerial and official level, from time to time at which developments in connection with the Community's agricultural policy and Irish exports of agricultural products to the Member States would be considered.  In meetings with the EEC and also in the Kennedy Round of <Col N="1041" /> negotiations which are at present in progress in the GATT, every effort is made to secure the maximum possible improvements for our exports of cattle, beef and other agricultural products but it would be rather optimistic to assume that any really satisfactory and lasting arrangements for this country's agricultural exports to the Continent can be established until Ireland becomes a member of the EEC.</P>

      <P>It was announced in the House by the Minister's predecessor that a remarkable transaction had been completed between this country and the Federal Republic of Germany, providing for the export of 2,000 Irish fat cattle.  It then transpired this was an arrangement with Eastern Germany.  Is it true that the export of these cattle, referred to by the Minister for Agriculture at the time as Irish fat cattle, is now proceeding on the basis of 100 elderly bulls each month?  This Minister knows the answer to that.  Is it not true that this quota is being filled by the piecemeal export of 100 elderly bulls&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statement referred to.  As to the extent of the salmon disease here, my Department has issued periodic press releases which included accounts of the river systems affected.  Briefly the position is that of the 100 or so salmon rivers in the Twenty-Six Counties about 36 may be classed as major salmon rivers. Since the outbreak of the disease six of the major salmon rivers and six others have become seriously affected by disease.  They lie in the sector from the Liffey round to the Shannon inclusive.</P>
      <P>Detailed investigations into the nature of the disease are being conducted in the Veterinary Research Laboratory of my Department in close consultation with outside experts, and any further findings resulting from these investigations will be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that the only practical measure which might be taken to prevent <Col N="1055" /> the spread of the disease is the removal of diseased fish from the waters during the open fishing season and this is being done.</P>

Secondly, will he get the scientists who are conducting the investigation to consider the question as to whether this new virus, which appears to be associated with an esturine location, may derive primarily from lampreys, creating the unprecedented situation with which we are at present confronted?</P>

One of the major objectives of this programme, as I informed the House in the course of the debate on the Fisheries Vote, is to increase the catching power of the industry and to generate more employment in it.  As the incomes derived by the owner of a fishing trawler and a farmer are dependent on so many factors it would not be possible to deal satisfactorily with the matter of income within the scope of a reply to a Parliamentary Question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As was explained in reply to the Deputy's previous question in this matter, the acquisition of lands for housing development specifically is not subject to my approval.  Dublin County Council's application for sanction to the purchase of 36 acres of land at Newcastle, County Dublin, was made under section 82 of the Local Government Act, 1946, which covers advance acquisition where the local authority have not determined the purpose for which the land will be used.</P>
      <P>The Council were informed on 15th December last, following examination of the proposal, that it was not possible to approve of it in the absence of a full report relating the acquisition and use of the site to the development objectives for the area generally.  Such report has not been received.</P>

The deal for these site lands was made over 12 months ago and the price was fixed and still no sanction has been received from the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The council were asked to revise the plans for the scheme because their proposal for six rural cottages at the entrance to the village of Clonaslee was unacceptable on the following grounds:</P>
      <P>1.  From a planning viewpoint the erection of detached rural type cottages immediately adjoining terraced development in the village street is undesirable.</P>
      <P>2.  The layout proposed by the council would leave the backs of six cottages exposed to the main entrance to the village from Mountmellick.</P>
      <P>3.  The use of the site for detached rural cottages would be wasteful. Terraced type houses would enable savings to be made in the cost of development and more houses to be provided on the site.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that there has been unnecessary delay in dealing with the proposal.  There should be no further difficulty in getting ahead with the scheme on the basis of the revisions to the plans which were discussed last December with the Council's technical advisers.</P>

      <P>I am informed that at 31st December, 1956, the number of licensed taxis in the Dublin area was 572 and the number of licensed hackneys was 275.  At the corresponding date in 1966 the numbers were 945 and 572 respectively.</P>
      <P>Under the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána is responsible for the issue of public service vehicle licences.  Before a licence for a public hire vehicle, i.e. a taxi, may be issued, the Commissioner must be satisfied that, in respect of character and previous conduct, the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold the licence and that the vehicle complies with the requirements for public hire vehicles laid down in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963.  The vehicle may not be operated in a taximeter area unless it is fitted with a taximeter.  On application for a hackney licence the Commissioner must be satisfied that the vehicle is safe for the carriage of passengers.</P>

      <P>The provision of traffic lights at any particular location is a matter for the road authority, acting with the consent of or at the request of the Garda Síochána.  I understand that representations were received by Dublin Corporation for the provision of traffic lights at this junction and that a number of fatal accidents have occurred at this point.  Further, I understand that it is proposed, as part of a traffic management scheme involving the route from Amiens Street to Clontarf, to create a one-way outgoing traffic diversion along Lower Buckingham Street and Killarney Street and to restrict right-hand turns at the Seán MacDermott Street/Buckingham Street junction.  The Corporation and the Garda consider that these measures, which are designed to eliminate major traffic conflicts at the junction, would render the provision of traffic lights unnecessary.</P>
      <P>I understand that it is hoped to have the scheme in operation in a few months time, and that the traffic position at the junction would be kept under review to determine whether any further modifications become desirable.</P>

      <P>The improvements expenditure sanctioned by the Land Commission in connection with the division of the Walsh Estate included a sum of £570 to meet the cost of sinking wells with a view to providing a water supply for the allottees referred to in the Question.  The work, however, did not go ahead as it was ascertained subsequently that arrangements were in train for the establishment of a group water supply scheme which would benefit the allottees on the Walsh Estate.  It is understood that proposals for such a scheme, covering an extensive area, are at present under consideration by the Department of Local Government.  The implementation of this scheme would render wells drilled by the Land Commission redundant; also I am advised that there is some evidence that a water supply derived from such wells might not be satisfactory.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no entitlement under the Army Pensions Acts to free medical or hospital treatment whether the pension is temporary or final.  A person in receipt of a temporary award may, however, as a condition of its continuance, be required to undergo such treatment with a view to containing, reducing or finalising the pensionable degree of disablement. These factors do not exist in the case of a final award.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years many requests have been received for free hospitalisation in St. Bricin's Hospital. The Old IRA organisations have made requests, not only for men suffering from wounds, but also for people disabled by disease.  These requests were refused by the Government on 19th August, 1952.  I have examined the matter many times since I became Minister and I have satisfied myself that that decision was a fair decision. The situation arises here that if you admit one class, you would have to admit others and there would not be sufficient accommodation in our military hospitals.  Pensioners, in common with other sections of the community, are entitled to benefit and hospitalisation under the Health Acts, if their circumstances warrant it.  I think, therefore, that the decision of the Government in 1952 was a fair one.</P>

Is the Minister not aware that there are certain individuals who can get such treatment?  It is very annoying for those who feel that they also are entitled, and who may have sufficient or even more justification, to find they are refused.  Would the Minister, because of the fact that some people might take advantage of this, not agree that this is something which needs an up-to-date appraisal and which should not be dependent on what somebody did in 1952 in order to prevent embarrassment to the Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>There are several factors making for unavoidable delay in the completion of the mid-term review of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, now in hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work done in analysing the differences between targets and performance will have to be recast in the light of a substantial revision and enlargement now being carried out by the Central Statistics Office of some of the data for the years up to and <Col N="1087" /> including 1965, on which the analysis had been based.  The new data, which will include a new series&mdash;estimates of output of the services sector&mdash;will not be available for some time yet.  Other data are also awaited for revising estimates of national income aggregates for 1966 and for estimating likely trends in the current year.</P>
    <P>Estimation of the public capital programme for the remainder of the decade, which is a critical element of national investment expenditure, must be given full and careful consideration in dealing with future resource allocation. The estimates for 1967-68 have been settled, but those for later years will not be available for some months. To these must be linked the national investment forecasts for the remainder of the programme and the assessment of other major variables such as savings, personal consumption and external deficits.</P>
    <P>When allowance is made for these factors, for consultation with the National Industrial Economic Council and for consideration by the Government, it is unlikely that publication of the mid-term review will be possible before the middle of the year at the earliest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside the mid-term review, is it proposed, in view of the failure to reach the targets as laid down, to revise the programme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is not just a question of fixing targets and that the problem is, as was pointed out by NIEC also, not merely the fixing of targets but the mapping out of the road by which the targets could be achieved?  In other words, is it not a question of working out ways and means of achieving targets?</P>

      <P>The outturn for the first eleven months of the year shows a welcome improvement in our balance of trade with Great Britain and Northern Ireland as compared with the corresponding period of 1965.  A rise of £5 million in imports was more than offset by an increase of almost £13 million in total exports, with the result that the import excess at £20 million was £8 million less.  Domestic exports showed an increase of almost 8 per cent despite the difficult conditions experienced in the British market during the period.</P>

      <P>Existing law provides that the incomes of a husband and wife may be separately assessed where an application in that behalf is made.  In that event the personal allowances and reliefs to which the husband would have otherwise been entitled are apportioned between the spouses, so that the total amount of tax payable in respect of the combined incomes is not affected.  Possibly, however, what the Deputy has in mind is that a husband and wife should be dealt with as if they were not married and that each should be entitled to the personal allowance available to a single person.  This treatment would reduce the amount of tax payable only where both spouses had substantial income.  Where, for example as is commonly the case, the wife had no income, or only a small income, the liability would be increased and there would be a gain to the Exchequer, not a loss.  The overall effect could not be estimated without a detailed investigation involving an expenditure of time and money which, in my opinion, would not be justified.</P>

      <P>The Minister correctly assumes I was concerned about earned income allowances for both spouses being assessed separately.  Is it not true that there is a moral question here and that in fact in operating the present system, you could more or less say there is a State subsidy on sin, because if people were getting married and had reasonable incomes, they would probably find it would be cheaper to live together without tying the bonds of matrimony so long as this system prevails?  I think the Minister will agree that more wives are working now and also that incomes are going up, and therefore it is time this matter was reviewed?</P>

      <P>The Free Trade Area Agreement between this country and the United Kingdom makes a distinction between, on the one hand, import duties imposed for protective purposes and, on the other, fiscal charges, which include both customs duties applied primarily for raising revenue and also internal taxes on goods.  Under the agreement no new protective import duties may be imposed on goods subject to the Free Trade Area arrangements and existing protective duties are to be gradually reduced and eliminated.  There is no restriction on the imposition of new fiscal charges provided that these apply equally to imported goods and to domestic goods.</P>
      <P>No new import duties have been imposed and no existing import duties have been increased since the Agreement came into operation on 1st July, 1966.</P>
      <P>The wholesale tax which came into operation on 1st October, 1966, is a fiscal charge.  It applies equally to the sales of certain goods within the State and to the import of such goods.  It does not, therefore, infringe the Agreement.</P>

    <P>Imported motor spirit is liable to customs duty as mineral hydrocarbon light oil at the rate of 3s. 9.95d a gallon.  It is also liable to turnover tax at the rate of 2½ per cent <i>ad valorem</i> but in practice the amount of such tax collected at the point of importation is negligible because nearly all motor spirit is imported by traders <Col N="1092" /> who are registered for turnover tax purposes.</P>

This resolution has not been referred by the urban council to the authorities primarily concerned, the Department of Defence and the Commissioners of Public Works.

      <P>As has already been announced, it has been decided to transfer the provisions for Urban and Rural Employment Schemes, Minor Employment and Bog Development Schemes and the Rural Improvements Scheme to the Vote for Local Government, and the provision for Miscellaneous Schemes to the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.  The transfer will be effective from 1st April, 1967, and is designed to enable the Minister for Local Government to consider the re-organisation, in the interests of efficiency and economy, of the services transferred to him.</P>
      <P>No immediate change is contemplated in the procedure for carrying out the schemes financed from the miscellaneous subhead.  As regards the other subheads, the Minister for Local Government is reviewing the operation of the schemes, and in the meantime they are being operated on the same basis, and by the same staff, as they have been since the beginning of the present financial year.</P>
      <P>Two thousand two hundred and fiftyfive inquiries for grant have been received since the acceptance of new applications under the Rural Improvements Scheme was suspended.

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that the absence of a district court in Dún Laoghaire with full jurisdiction in all matters is a great hardship on school attendance and similar cases with children, parents and relatives having to travel to courts in Dublin and Bray; and that it is also a great inconvenience to traders, business people and Corporation officials in having to travel to courts in Dublin and Bray to transact legal business that could be transacted more conveniently in Dún Laoghaire; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 128 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>I have considered very carefully the various representations made to me urging the establishment in Dún Laoghaire of sittings of the District Court and Circuit Court with full jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The present arrangements under which the Dún Laoghaire area is included for District Court purposes in the Dublin Metropolitan District, with sittings at Dún Laoghaire for certain limited classes of business, are of very long standing, have worked well, and have not until recently been the subject of representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the relatively short distances involved and to the transport services available, I do not accept that travel to Dublin, which is the <Col N="1107" /> venue for practically all the cases not heard in Dún Laoghaire itself, constitutes any significant hardship on Dún Laoghaire residents.  The number of school attendance cases arising in Dún Laoghaire is only about 28 a year.  It is in the interests of all concerned that children's cases generally which arise in Dún Laoghaire should be disposed of by the specialised Children's Court in Dublin Castle where full-time Probation Officers are in attendance.</P>
    <P>The information available to me does not support the contention that the present arrangements cause great inconvenience to traders, business people and Corporation officials in Dún Laoghaire.  The number of defended civil cases arising in Dún Laoghaire does not exceed 50 a year. Personal appearance by the applicant is not required in routine licensing cases; these are normally handled by the applicants' solicitors who, in practically all instances, have their offices in Dublin.  All cases arising by way of summons by Dún Laoghaire Corporation are disposed of in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the present arrangements in relation to Dún Laoghaire are those best suited to the efficient and economical functioning of the District Court.  While I can appreciate that the idea of full sittings would be attractive to some Dún Laoghaire organisations for prestige reasons, it is clear to me that the balance of advantage lies with retaining the existing arrangements and I do not favour any major change.</P>
    <P>The law as it stands at present confers on the President of the Circuit Court the power to fix sitting places of the Circuit Court.  Having examined the proposal to hold sittings in Dún Laoghaire, I am satisfied that it is a course which has little to commend it. For practical reasons, criminal jury trials would have to be heard in Dublin, so that a Circuit Court in Dún Laoghaire would be concerned only with appeals from the restricted District Court hearings, and with civil business.  In the latter case, the parties or their legal advisers would have the option of selecting Dublin rather than <Col N="1108" /> Dún Laoghaire as the trial venue.  This is an option which would be widely exercised.</P>
    <P>The small volume of business which would be dealt with in Circuit Court sittings in Dún Laoghaire would make such sittings wasteful and uneconomic. Because of the short distances and the transport services, the present system cannot be said to impose a hardship on Dún Laoghaire residents, and I am not prepared to sponsor any change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the resolutions passed by the Chamber of Commerce and by other organisations in Dún Laoghaire, representing a number of different interests, as well as by the legal profession there, that it would not merely cheapen litigation but make it easier for litigants who at present have to attend in some cases the Bray District Court, which is a considerable distance away, or the Metropolitan District Court?  The population of Dún Laoghaire is anything from 60,000 to 80,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of all that and I have given deep and long consideration to the whole matter.  I have received the representatives to which the Deputy referred. This is one of those matters in which one has to weigh the balance of advantage and I am convinced, because of the low volume of litigation that would obtain in either a District Court or a Circuit Court in Dún Laoghaire, it would be uneconomic from the administration point of view to establish courts specially in Dún Laoghaire.  From the point of view of the public generally, the transport services available and the immediacy of Dún Laoghaire to Dublin do not make it that inconvenient for residents to attend either the District or the Circuit Court in Dublin.  On analysis of the situation, short of a very substantial increase in litigation in Dún Laoghaire, which is something I am not inclined to encourage, I would not be justified, I think, in moving courts to Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the Circuit Court, does the Minister not <Col N="1109" /> think there is a case for making provision in District Court sittings to cover cases that at present have to be dealt with either in Bray or in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The balance of advantage lies, as I say, in the existing arrangement, but I shall continue to have a look at it.  When representations were first made to me, I was attracted to the idea.  However, having gone into it at greater depth, the balance of advantage is against it.  I will receive any representations the people in the area may have to offer and I shall continue to keep it under review.</P>

Two of these persons have been convicted and fined 20/- each.  The remaining cases are for hearing at Cork District Court on the 20th February, 1967.  In addition a number of persons have been cautioned.</P>
      <P>Officials of Córas Iompair Éireann, in uniform, attend at busy omnibus stopping places in the centre of Cork city to regulate queues.  The Garda co-operate with them, particularly at busy periods, and generally give assistance whenever it is requested.</P>

    <P>Since November, 1966, a garda has <Col N="1110" /> been specially assigned to the duty of co-operating with and assisting officials of Córas Iompair Éireann in regulating and controlling queues at peak periods in the city centre.

The Garda co-operate fully with corporation officials in dealing with wandering animals, but the presence of numbers of itinerants on a large area of unfenced corporation land is the root of the trouble.</P>

      <P>I have already discussed with representatives of two separate organisations in the licensed trade the feasibility of implementing a scheme for a reduction in the number of licensed premises in the country. An outline scheme prepared by one of these organisations was examined closely by me on several occasions and I have explained to the organisation concerned that I could not accept it as the basis for a workable scheme. Furthermore, I explained that I could not see how any such scheme could be made to work.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I expect that work will commence at Ballacolla, Ballickmoyler and Birr in the financial year 1967-68.</P>
      <P>At this stage, I cannot say when work will commence at the remaining centres.  The Commissioners of Public Works have acquired a site and have prepared plans for the new station at Shannonbridge.  Sites have been acquired at Ballybrittas and Pallas but plans have not yet been prepared. Sites have not so far been acquired at Geashill, Portarlington and Wolfhill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A claim for maternity grant by the person referred to was received on 23rd September, 1966. Payment of the grant was authorised on the same day, and the relevant documents bear an indication that a cheque in payment issued on 26th September, 1966.</P>
      <P>The first, and only, intimation of non-receipt of benefit was the Deputy's own letter received in my Department on 2nd December, 1966, to which a reply was sent on 12th December, containing the information I have repeated here, and adding that as the claimant had not received payment a substitute cheque for £4 was being issued to her.  A cheque for that amount was sent to the claimant on 13th December, 1966.</P>
      <P>Enquiries made in the matter established that the cheque noted in the records as having issued in September last, was not, in fact, sent out, and that this failure was due to a regrettable error of a kind which occurs very infrequently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that recipients of unemployment assistance, who through force of circumstances have to go from a rural to an urban area to live, are declared ineligible for unemployment assistance and so left destitute; and whether any arrangements can be made to have this state of affairs altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 15 (1) (e) of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, as amended, lays down as a condition for the receipt of unemployment assistance in the case of a person resident in an urban area that either&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> (a)  he has, at any time before making his application, been ordinarily resident in any urban area for a period of five years, or for a number of periods which amount in the aggregate to five years, or</P>
    <P>(b)  he has been ordinarily resident in any urban area for at least one year immediately preceding the application, or</P>
    <P>(c)  he has had at least three months employment in any urban area within the year immediately preceding the application.</P>
    <P>The urban areas affected by these provisions are limited in number&mdash;they consist of the county boroughs of Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford, the borough of Dún Laoghaire and the urban districts of Athlone, Bray, Carlow, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dundalk, Galway, Kilkenny, Sligo, Tralee and Wexford.</P>
    <P>It will be evident that it is only applicants moving from rural areas into one or other of these 16 urban areas and failing to satisfy any of the three tests I have quoted, who are made temporarily ineligible for unemployment assistance by reason of change of residence.</P>
    <P>As my Department recently intimated in a letter to the Deputy the question as to whether the condition referred to needs modification in the light of present circumstances has been under examination for some time past.  I expect to have the examination completed at an early date.  Any change in the position would, of course, require amending legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that it is a ridiculous condition that somebody who has been living in a rural area because he has nowhere else to live and goes to live with relatives in one of the areas mentioned should be left destitute and have no income while he is seeking work?  Surely the Minister should endeavour to hurry up a decision, if a decision is being made to alter the situation, so that this state of affairs will not continue?  The Minister must be aware that the only thing these <Col N="1118" /> people can do is to apply for home assistance, which is something some of them do not want to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This was written in the 1933 Act for definite reasons.  It was supposed to create an incentive for people not to move into urban areas because the rate was higher.  The three conditions laid down are not difficult, particularly that relating to the three months employment.  I am examining the matter and while there are still some reasons why it should not be changed, there are many reasons why it should.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Waterford Disability Benefit Delays.</Title>
    <P>142.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason for the continuous delays in payment of disability benefit to members of the social insurance fund in Waterford city and county; what steps he has taken to rectify this neglect following complaints made on several occasions; and the longest delay between the suspension of benefit following a request for a district medical referee's report, the actual date of the examination and the date of payment of benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there is, in general, any delay in the payment of disability benefit under the Social Welfare Acts to claimants in Waterford city and county and I can assure the Deputy that the prompt payment of social welfare benefits is at all times the concern of all officers of my Department.</P>
      <P>There are always, of course, the occasional instances in which, for one reason or another, delay of some kind occurs despite all efforts to avoid it, and if the Deputy will let me have details of any specific case which he may have in mind I will have enquiries made in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the latter part of the question I should perhaps point out that, as the Deputy is, no doubt, aware my Department has also the responsibility of ensuring that benefit is paid only to those persons duly entitled to it.  When, therefore, it is considered that there are reasonable <Col N="1119" /> grounds for obtaining a second medical opinion in the case of a claim for disability benefit the claimant is required to present himself for examination by a medical referee, but unless in exceptional cases where there are clear grounds for doing so, this does not entail as the Deputy suggests, immediate suspension of benefit. Payment of benefit is not normally suspended until a report indicating that the claimant is fit for work has been received from the Medical Referee.</P>
    <P>Medical referees attended in the Waterford City and County area at intervals of two to three weeks but records in relation to disability benefit cases referred for medical referee examination are not kept in such a form as to render the information which the Deputy requests readily available.  The required information could not be extracted without a very considerable expenditure of time and labour which would not be warranted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the one big slur on his Department is the delay which occurs between the report of the referee and the hearing of an appeal as a result of somebody's being dissatisfied with the referee's decision.  There are many instances&mdash;in fact, in almost every instance&mdash;where months pass by before the second examination takes place. The Minister's predecessor said it was not important because the Department had made up their minds that they were fit for work and therefore it did not matter very much to have a delay like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will take immediate steps to restore to all pensioners cuts made in their pensions on receipt of increases in their British benefits; and if he will ensure that this matter is dealt with as one of urgency in view of the poor circumstances of such pensioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to answer Questions Nos. 144 and 145 together.  The items which constitute means for old age and widows' pension are laid down by law.  It is not open to me to direct that the means test be relaxed or that any item be ignored in the calculation of a person's means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of an increase in a British pension, is it right that the money paid by the British Government to a person who is now residing in this country should <Col N="1122" /> be the cause of a decreased pension from the Irish Government?  Surely the Minister must agree that there is a special case here for immediate review?  Many such pensioners throughout the country have suffered as a result of this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined this matter very carefully.  It is not just as simple as the Deputy says. British pensions have to be taken into the calculation of the means test.  The whole pension must be considered. The law does not provide for ignoring any part of it.  It would be a peculiar anomaly if I were to introduce legislation to ignore the recent increases and then continued to have the full pension of future pensioners taken into account.  A very good case could be made for our own contributory pensioners, who do not get non-contributory pension, if we ignore the British contributory pensions for means test and refuse non-contributory pensions to our own people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Irish Government have made reciprocal arrangements about increases in the British pension, instead of the recipients getting it, the Irish Government have intercepted this increase and cornered it for the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct, although it is frequently stated.  The vast amount of the increase in the pensions has gone to the pensioners. If one examines the figures for this year, it will be found that we by no <Col N="1123" /> means saved the entire round, as the Deputy suggests.</P>

      <P>Cuilagurrain national school is a two-teacher school and I am satisfied that it would be in the best educational interests of the children that they should be catered for in a larger school.  I am having an investigation made as to how its amalgamation with another school or schools in the parish might be effected.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, my Department has sanctioned a grant towards the cost of the provision of a prefabricated classroom which will relieve overcrowding. The Commissioners of Public Works have been asked to advise the Reverend Manager regarding the provision of the classroom and also to recommend what works might be carried out to the existing building to render it suitable for such period as it will continue to be required.</P>

      <P>Doolough national school has been closed since 16th January, 1967, and a transport service has been set up to convey the pupils to the larger school at Geesala, which is in the same parish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I urge the Deputy and his colleagues to urge the parents concerned at least to give this a trial and see how it works out?  I think I could say on behalf of the Minister for Education that the door would not be closed on the question of re-opening, if there is a trial given to the present arrangement and let everybody see how it works out.  I do not think this is unreasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very keen personal interest in this school and I have tried very hard at local level to bring about a situation such as the Minister is now asking for, without result.  There is nobody availing of the transport except one child.  Children have been at home since 16th January and are likely to remain at home unless we ask them to use the transport without leaving them under the impression that they would have to continue it, by indicating to them that <Col N="1132" /> the matter would be reconsidered if the transport did not appear satisfactory. This, of course, is a Gaeltacht school and has been all down along the line a Gaeltacht school.  It has been in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  Geesala school used to be in the Breach-Ghaeltacht. In 1966, these distinctions were abolished and Geesala was brought into the Gaeltacht.  Even though I must accept some responsibility for it, I do not think it is quite as much Gaeltacht as the village of Doolough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would undertake on behalf of the Minister for Education that if a fair trial is given to the transport system to let everybody see how good or how bad the system is, the Minister would at the end of a reasonable period of operation, not before the end of the current school year, I would say, reconsider the whole matter.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my reply to similar questions on 29th September, 1966.  There has been no material change in the meantime.  I mentioned then that certain things were taking place and that it would be inappropriate for me to make a general statement until these things were completed.  This is still the case and I am not yet in a position, therefore, to make a full statement to the House on the present situation or on the future prospects of the industry.</P>

      <P>As the reply is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to have it circulated with the Official Report.  The statement includes, in reply to part (e) of the question, particulars of the numbers of factories under construction as at 31st December, 1966; other industrial proposals current at that date were at varying stages and it would not be possible to furnish in respect of them the information requested.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority <Col N="1142" /> do not maintain records of all inquiries which they receive.  The records indicate only the numbers current at the end of each quarter.  For this reason it is not possible to state the numbers of all inquiries received in 1965 and 1966.  Furthermore, since very few inquiries mention location it is not possible to give a breakdown by areas.</P>
    <P>The information available may be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>(a)</i>Inquiries current on 31st December, 1965 &mdash;683.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Inquiries current on 31st December, 1966 &mdash;758.</P>

      <P>There is a difficulty here in that, on the one hand, if you are to be fair to the purchasers of goods, prices should not be increased any more than is absolutely necessary and lawful.  On the other hand, if you <Col N="1147" /> want to be fair to the producers, you cannot delay the necessary investigation of it for months on end, maybe at the cost of very large sums of money to such producers and say: &ldquo;It is unfortunate for you that it took us so long to investigate.&rdquo;  This would not be equitable.

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if the Government intend to implement their undertaking to have rates for health stabilised at the 1965 level; and, if so, how health authorities will be enabled to meet the deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt now aware, from the statement issued by the Government Information Bureau on Friday last, the Government are honouring in full their undertaking in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the public announcement gives the impression that there will be no increase in the health rate that existed in 1965, whereas in fact this is not so?  As I understand it, £600,000 has been provided by the Minister as an addition to cover increases in health costs in 1967-68.  Dublin Health Authority alone has an increase of £700,000.  If we were to get even half that from the Minister to keep prices stable at the 1965 figure, how is the remainder to cover the whole country?  I should like an explanation of that, because difficulties are arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy has it right.  The figure of £600,000 is not the extra amount being provided this year.  In point of fact, the <Col N="1148" /> extra amount is over £2 million.  If you take what was added on for 1966-67, in order to operate the freeze as against 1965-66, you must add that figure to the £600,000 before you get the total contribution the Exchequer will be making for 1967-68.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases where a health authority have struck the rate, based on the assumption it would be stabilised at the 1965 figure, there will not be any deficit as far as they are concerned?  They will not need extra money to bridge any gap?  The Minister will provide any extra money required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. I want to make this clear.  In regard to 1966-67, the Government gave an undertaking that the level would be frozen at the previous year's rates contribution. When the accounts eventually came in, this involved an additional expenditure of £2½ million.  I will be introducing a Supplementary Estimate in order to make that available in respect of the current year.  As regards next year, the Government decided they will give the same Supplementary as last year, which was about £900,000 or thereabouts, plus £600,000 over and above that to be distributed proportionately throughout the country, having regard to the existing level of rate contribution and also having regard to the undertaking in the White Paper that some formula would be devised whereby the weaker western counties, where there is a very high rate and a low yield from each pound of valuation, would be assisted.  This has been worked out tentatively.  It will mean that in the weaker western counties, and other counties such as Cavan, there will be an estimated increase in the rates of approximately 9d and in no case, urban or otherwise, will there be cause for an increase in the rate in excess of 1/6d.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister regard the situation in which, last Monday morning, Louth County Council was informed that while we would be facing a general increase in the rate of 2/7d, because of a circular which was awaited and the contents of which it was sought to get by telephone, the extra increase in the charge on foot of health over the old charges as they existed would not be met and that this 2/7d would be increased by a sum that had to be worked out?  How does this fall in line with the Minister's visit to Louth when we met him very cordially and when he told us there would be no falling off in the rate for health and that any increase would be met by Exchequer subvention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I gave that undertaking, which I agree I did give, I did so in good faith.  At that time, I understood that the deficit arrangement operating in accordance with the White Paper for 1966-67 would continue in 1967-68, even though there is no such undertaking in the White Paper.  The enormous increase in expenditure frankly came as a shock to me and to the Minister for Finance in respect of 1966-67 as did the size of the Supplementary Estimate of over £2 million which I had to have in order to operate the freeze for 1966-67 and the huge increase over the projected figure of £32 million to £35 million.  He frankly felt that for this particular year some small proportion, at any rate, will again have to be borne by the rates.  There appeared to him to be an open-end situation in which the local authorities were free to go ahead without having regard to the propriety or otherwise of various <Col N="1150" /> extensions of the health scheme on the basis that it did not matter, that the Minister for Finance would pay.</P>
      <P>I do not like the prospect of asking the ratepayers at this stage to pay anything but I can see the justice of asking for some small contribution because I believe it can be an incentive to county managers and officials to prune their health expenditure so as to keep it productive and worthwhile.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 181 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obligations of a district medical officer as such are to provide general medical services for persons entitled to them under section 14 of the Health Act, 1953.  The obligations extend only to the provision of services within the dispensary district and normally to persons resident in that district.  This has been the position for a very long time. In practice, however, most district medical officers&mdash;and indeed most doctors&mdash;will provide services according <Col N="1152" /> to medical need in emergencies without regard to the niceties of contractual obligations.  This is borne out by the virtual absence of complaint that eligible persons were unable to obtain attention in circumstances such as those mentioned in the questions.</P>
    <P>On present information I do not feel that it is necessary to introduce any change in the system as it operates in this respect at present but I shall bear the point in mind in formulating the new proposals for choice of doctor as envisaged in the White Paper on the Health Services and their Further Development.</P>

      <P>As the reply to this question is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The cost given is the average daily cost per patient as this is the form in which this information is supplied to my Department.  The figures of occupancy and cost relate to the year ended 31st March, 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospitals are divided into eight different categories according to the type of service provided.  A number of hospitals provide two or more of these <Col N="1156" /> services and are included in more than one category.  Where this occurs the number of beds and the occupancy relate to the particular section of the hospital, while the cost relates to the entire hospital.</P>
    <P>The bed complement given is the number of beds normally available. Where the average occupancy exceeds this it indicates that special provision had to be made to accommodate extra patients.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    <P Just="Center">REGIONAL HOSPITALS.</P>
    <P>These hospitals provide a general medical, surgical and, in a number of cases, maternity service.  They also contain units for certain specialities such as paediatrics, ophthalmology, cardiology and ear, nose and throat conditions.</P>

      <P>The last report published on the work of my Department was in respect of the year 1957-58.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the number of publications available, which give information about the health services and developments in them, particularly the White Paper on the Health Services published last year, and also to the comprehensive review which is <Col N="1165" /> undertaken annually when the Estimates for my Department are prepared and presented to the House, I consider that an annual report would not be worth the effort involved in its production. However, I am at present considering whether a long-term review, covering perhaps a ten-year period, would be worthwhile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appreciates that the information obtainable in the yearly publications has not been published for years.  Does he appreciate the problem people have in deciding how best to administer health services without the fundamental, basic information which ought to be available, but is not? Irrespective of all the reports to which the Minister referred, a great deal of useful information is not available to the medical profession or to the non-medical profession who are concerned in administering the public health services.  I earnestly urge on the Minister that the information which used be published and is not now published in any form should be brought up to date so that it will be made available before we vote on any change in the health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of places in the residential institutions for the mentally handicapped at the end of December last was 3,606.  This represents an increase of about 200 beds over the past year and nearly 500 beds over the past two years.  A further 20 beds became available last month. No serious difficulties in regard to the staffing of extra accommodation have been experienced.  Additional accommodation is under construction or in planning.  I have made arrangements that certain institutions which had been used for other purposes will be converted for use by the mentally handicapped and I am having examined the possibility of converting others.  It is impossible yet to know with certainty how many of the possibilities under examination will bear fruit, but it is my hope that substantial accommodation will become available over the next two years for severely and moderately handicapped children.  While the main demand for residential care is in respect of these classes and I am giving them priority in the provision of accommodation, I am keeping under review the question of increased residential accommodation for mildly handicapped children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy has in mind the report of An Foras Talúntais to the effect that the average solids-not-fat levels of samples of milk taken in the Dublin liquid milk area in the months of January, February and March, 1965, were 8.45 per cent, 8.39 per cent and 8.32 per cent respectively, the standard prescribed <Col N="1167" /> being 8.5 per cent.  I am satisfied that the variations in question are seasonal and do not constitute a public health hazard.  It has always been known that there is a slight seasonal variation pattern in the solids-not-fat content of milk.  The report acknowledges this by stating that &ldquo;in the remaining nine months of the survey the levels of solids-not-fat were about 8.50, giving an average for this period of 8.68 which compares reasonably well with values obtained in other countries (the English national average for solids-not-fat content is approximately 8.70 per cent)&rdquo;.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to the statement in the Irish Medical Association Journal that the proper control of hypertension and the elmination of cigarette smoking would cause a dramatic reduction in the incidence of precocious and middle aged coronary heart disease in women; and, if so, what steps he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statement referred to.</P>
      <P>Regarding the proper control of hypertension, the essential requirement is that persons in middle age should consult their family doctors regularly, and it is in their own interest to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dangers to health associated with cigarette smoking have been widely publicised in recent years, and I am quite sure that the adult public are well aware of the position.  In this matter I favour an educative approach rather than one of prohibition.  I feel strongly that my functions are best discharged by continuing to inform <Col N="1168" /> the public of the dangers of smoking so that each person can decide, in the light of this knowledge, whether to smoke or not.  Special efforts are being made, and will continue to be made, to encourage young people not to start smoking or, where they have started, to give it up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if any arrangements have been completed between his Department and representatives of retail pharmacists for the provision of drugs and medicines at reduced prices to necessitous persons who are not holders of medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>No arrangements have yet been completed.  The practicability of formulating a satisfactory scheme for the distribution, through retail pharmacists, of drugs and medicines to persons who are entitled to them, either free of charge or at a reduced cost, under the provisions of <Col N="1169" /> the Health Acts, is at present under examination in my Department, in consultation with the various interests in the drug industry.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is, no doubt, aware of the existing arrangements under section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, for the supply, through health authority dispensaries, of drugs and medicines to persons not covered by medical cards, where undue hardship would be involved if they had to purchase them from their own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the headaches of the health service.  To my own knowledge, certain people who are ordered to have certain drugs, fathers of families, for instance, rather than spend the money, will do without these drugs.  This will affect their health much more in the future.  If there were an arrangement whereby they could get the drugs from a wholesale druggist they would not cost half as much. This is a very urgent matter which seems to demand action.  I am not suggesting that there is profiteering but it seems to be a crime to deprive a person of the drugs he needs to cure himself because the price is beyond his limited income.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this is a very difficult and complicated problem from the point of view of a person who must have expensive drugs. I should hope that in cases such as those mentioned by the Deputy, the health authority would operate their &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo; clause which they can use but since this is a difficult and complex matter, I invite the Deputy to express his views on it on the Supplementary Estimate in a couple of weeks time.</P>
