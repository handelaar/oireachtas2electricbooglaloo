      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if his attention has been drawn to reports that the ESB have been putting pressure on building developers by way of agreeing to a reduced price for supply installations on condition that houses involved are fitted with electric points; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always been the policy of the Electricity Supply Board to request a contribution to the cost of an extension of its mains if expected revenue appeared inadequate to cover the cost of the extension.  In the case of building schemes a decisive factor in assessing the economics of extending <Col N="156" /> the mains is the expected degree of utilisation of electricity in the houses. Experience shows that adequate electrical installations increase the use of electricity leading to a higher estimate of revenue which enables the Board to extend supply either without any capital contribution or at a reduced contribution.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Electricity Supply Board is under a statutory obligation to balance revenue and expenditure and cannot, therefore, undertake extensions of its system except on an economic basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Board that it is correct to say that the Board offers discounts to builders who purchase electric cookers from the Board for installation in new houses. This is, of course, normal business practice and the Board is in competition with other suppliers of electrical appliances in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the Deputy's question, I am not so aware.  If, however, the Deputy would give me more precise information I will have the matter taken up with the road authority concerned.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, my Department has in fact had under consideration the general question of improving the indications given at road works and intends to study some specific devices in conjunction with An Foras Forbartha. I understand that the particular solution suggested by the Deputy is not practicable, since there is no suitable luminous paint for this particular purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>The temporary rules giving effect to the clearways were made by the Garda Commissioner with my consent, and it is to the Commissioner that complaints, if any, would be addressed, since the modification of the rule is a matter for him in the first instance.

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>According to the statutory assessments of housing needs submitted by the housing authorities under section 53 of the Housing Act, 1966, there is at present an accumulated need for 8,518 local authority dwellings in Dublin city and for 1,375 local authority and private dwellings in Cork city. An estimate of the present need for private dwellings in Dublin city is not available.</P>
      <P>Assessments of need have not yet been submitted by a number of housing authorities.  Figures for the rest of the country are, therefore, not yet available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  The housing authorities were required to submit these assessments by 30th September last.  There are 14 authorities that have not submitted them yet but they should be available in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister, in that context, has regard been had, when these assessments were made in respect of the housing requirements of Dublin city and Cork city, to the number of houses in both cities which are notoriously at present unfit for human habitation but which have not been examined or condemned by the appropriate municipal authority for the past five or six years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Regard has been had to the fact that there is a number of houses that should be demolished but I would not say that a comprehensive <Col N="159" /> assessment of this category has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from those that are standing and that are in need of demolition because they are dangerous, has the Minister adverted to the fact that there are large numbers of houses in Dublin and Cork which have been condemned as unfit for human habitation? Have these been taken into account in making this assessment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>These have been taken into consideration to a certain extent but standards in these matters will change according as more houses are provided.  For some time to come there will always be houses which will gradually become substandard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment benefit is payable only in respect of days of unemployment. In order that a day may be treated as a day of unemployment a claimant must not merely be out of work on that day but must be capable of and available for work.  This is one of the fundamental statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit. A person who is obliged to give up employment in the circumstances mentioned in the question is clearly not available for work or in a position to take a job and cannot therefore qualify for unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>I do not think that any change in the law would be justified.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister recognises the need that something should be done in a matter of this kind.  Does he not feel that something should and must be done in this case? It is a case of positive verification of illness, a case of a girl who has to stay at home from work because she has to look after her sick parents who are in receipt of the old age pension and for whom no provision is made?

      <P>Deputy Mullen's question contains an implication that the claim for a 5-day 40-hour week for certain nonnursing personnel employed by the Dublin voluntary hospitals has not been considered by the employers.  In fact, this claim has had a very full measure of consideration, including several meetings between the employers and the workers, five conciliation conferences under the chairmanship of a Labour Court officer and two open hearings by the Labour Court.  During that time, the hours were reduced from 45 to 42½ while the working week for most of the categories involved was reduced to 5½ days.  Earlier this year the employers made a further offer of a 5-day 42½ hour week with a 6-day spreadover.  However, the workers rejected this offer, even when it had been endorsed by a Labour Court recommendation.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the implication that a claim is outstanding merely because, irrespective of its merits, it has not been conceded in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully share Deputy Ryan's concern for the welfare of the patients in <Col N="163" /> hospitals affected by the union's ban on overtime.  At my request, the Hospitals Commission has asked each hospital authority to indicate, as a matter of urgency, what steps they propose to take to maintain essential services whilst the ban on overtime is in operation. I am awaiting a report from the Commission which, I hope, will be reassuring. I shall keep in close touch with the position and the Deputy may rest assured that every effort will be made to safeguard the welfare of the patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to what the Minister has said are the implications in my question, does he not agree that it is of the utmost importance that discussions should take place between both parties in order to avoid a continuance of the overtime ban?  Would the Minister not ask both parties to come to a conference with him, without giving any indication as to what is in his own mind?</P>

      <P>I do not accept that what the Deputy has said is so and I do not intend to intervene.  I do not know what is to be gained by calling yet another conference.  The workers have already been assured by the Federated Union of Employers that the negotiations may be recommenced in April but apparently they are not prepared to wait until then and apparently the union is not prepared to advise them to wait until next April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that the workers were warned by the employers that if industrial action was taken, court actions would be taken against them?  They took the only course open to them and surely, in these circumstances, there is a clear need for ministerial intervention?</P>

If this is so, does the Minister not agree that this would be a hard blow to sick and deserving people?  I would ask him to intervene at this stage because six months is far too long to leave sick human beings at the mercy of improvised services.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>In regard to the publication of literature, two leaflets entitled &ldquo;Starting to Smoke&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tobacco Smoking and Lung Cancer&rdquo;, have been published by my Department and are available in Irish and English.  They have been distributed widely, especially to school children.  There is also available a booklet entitled &ldquo;Smoking and Health&rdquo; and subtitled &ldquo;A Summary of Surveys of the Evidence&rdquo; which was published in 1964 and also widely circulated.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of the introduction of controls on advertising, the tobacco manufacturers co-operated with my Department in restricting the form of cigarette advertising, with particular reference to television.</P>
      <P>I have the entire matter of the campaign against cigarette smoking under review.  It is my intention to intensify the campaign which at present consists of the distribution of leaflets, the showing of films in schools and the use of my Department's contribution to the &ldquo;Home Truths&rdquo; television series as appropriate.</P>
      <P>As I said in my reply to Deputy O.J. Flanagan on 26th October last, I believe that the most effective course in present circumstances is to continue to bring to public notice the health hazards involved in smoking cigarettes.</P>

      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go gceapfar an Teachta Seán Dunne mar Leas-Cheann Comhairle. </P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom an Teachta Seán Dunne do mholadh mar Leas-Cheann Comhairle na Dála.  Molaim an Teachta Dunne mar is é mo thuairim agus is é tuairim ár bPairtí go ndeánbaidh sé obair an phóist go maith nó níos fearr ná aon duine eile sa Tí seo.  Is Teachta Dála é le cúig nó sé bliana deág anuas agus tá a fios ag gach éinne go bhfuil an-taithí aige agus go bhfuil sé ábalta an gnó do dhéanamh.  Fíor-Ghael is ea é agus mar is eol do gach éinne, tá sé taobh thiar de athbeochan na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I have great pleasure in proposing, on behalf of my Party, that Deputy Seán Dunne be elected Leas-Cheann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann.  Seán Dunne has been a Member of this House for 16 years and it is, I think, recognised by both sides of the House&mdash;as, indeed, it is recognised by the public&mdash;that he is an experienced parliamentarian.  In particular, I am sure the Members of this House must be aware of how well he is acquainted with Dáil procedure. This arises from the fact that ever since he became a Member of Dáil Éireann, he has been one of the most frequent contributors to debates during his long term as a Deputy.  It may also be said for him that, whilst he is able to give and take, and is well equipped to give and take in debates, he is one who does not bear a grudge and is one, therefore, who, if elected to this office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle, would be impartial in his decisions.  I have no doubt that he would carry out his functions in a fair and impartial manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, he is recognised as a true Gael.  He is a fluent Irish speaker and we must, therefore, recognise that he has one of the most important qualifications for the post for which we now propose him.  Apart from his fluency <Col N="167" /> in the Irish language, he has been, and this again is well known, one who has all his life promoted the advancement of the language.</P>
    <P>There is one final comment I should like to make.  Every Member of this House should be conscious of what we are now doing.  We are electing an officer of the House.  This is an important and vital office in Dáil Éireann. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will preside over debates for approximately half of the time.  He will preside over an assembly comprised of three Parties &mdash;Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour &mdash;and three or four Independents.  I believe that the election of Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in view of the importance of the position, is one which should be the responsibility of Deputies of all Parties.  As I say, this is a man who will decide very many important issues.  This is not just a social or an economic issue.  It is not one on which we can have reservations.  On social and economic issues, it can be pleaded to be legitimate to abstain in view of certain obligations; but this, let me repeat, is a decision in which we will decide who will be Leas-Cheann Comhairle and my Party believe that, because it is such a decision, we should give a positive expression of our choice, not by silence and not by default.</P>

      <P>Mar is eol díbh tá sé ag gníomhú mar chomhalta i gceannas sa Dáil le roinnt bhliain anuas agus le linn dó bheith ag gníomhú mar sin ní dóigh liom go bhféadfadh éinne a rá nár thug sé cothrom na Féinne glan do chuile dhuine.

      <P>It has been well established by tradition and invariable precedent that when the Ceann Comhairle has been elected from amongst the Deputies representing the Government side of the House, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is nominated from amongst Deputies representing the Opposition.

      <P>Last night I was dealing with statements made by Deputy Flanagan who said that persons applying for certain positions had to be supporters of the Government and that such support for the Government was one of the best qualifications for these jobs.  The Deputy then went on to praise two of the boards appointed by political jobbers, namely, Aer Lingus and the Shannon Industrial Estate.  I am not aware of any political interference in any positions held under semi-State bodies.  The personnel manager of a semi-State body in my constituency, which gives the largest amount of employment there, is an ex-Fine Gael organiser.  All the Deputies in the constituency endeavour to get workers in there, and I do not think we could claim we get too many Fianna Fáil fellows in under those conditions.  You have the same situation in respect of the Agricultural Institute in Kilworth, the bulk of whose people turned out at the local elections with their cars plastered with Fine Gael posters to draw voters for the day for Fine Gael.  Yet I did not accuse the Minister for Transport and Power, in the one case, and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, in the other, of appointing Fine Gael nominees to those jobs.  But those are the facts, unfortunately for some of us who have to endeavour to get <Col N="173" /> employment for our people in these places.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with the position of CIE.  I would like the Minister to say what steps CIE have taken to bring their charges into line with the charges in the EEC countries with which we will have to compete in a few years. Some 14 years ago I had to get up here repeatedly to prevent the wiping out of the Cork to Youghal and Cork to Cobh line.  I defy contradiction now that the best paying and most economic unit under CIE today is the Cork to Cobh line.  I would nearly say it is the only one that can show a profit.  It takes some 1,200 workers each day to and from employment, Cork city workers going down to Rushbrooke Dockyard and to Irish Steel, and Cobh workers coming up to work in the industries in Cork.  I am very proud that the efforts I made some 12 to 14 years ago succeeded in preventing CIE closing down that line.</P>
      <P>What is the position today?  Every one of us farmers who is producing has been advised to prepare for the Common Market and has been warned in regard to our charges and so on.  One of the semi-State bodies with which I have very close association in negotiations for a long number of years is still shouting that the price of beet is the highest in Europe, ignoring the fact that in the Continental countries, the beet is purchased in the farmyard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing transport and the relation of transport to what we farmers are producing.  I am sorry if I did anything wrong.  I just wish to point this out, that in the EEC countries, the contract is made from the farmyard and the produce is purchased in the farmyard, all transport being paid by the company.  We come <Col N="174" /> up against the position that transport charges in Ireland bear not the slightest relation to transport charges on the Continent.  Last year and the year before, a rather quick one was pulled on us representatives of the Beet-growers Association in this respect, that about two months after we concluded negotiations and had signed the contract, we were then presented with a bill for an increased freight charge. We called attention to that last year, and this year we were happy to receive a reply from CIE before negotiations had been started; that reply told us in plain language that we are going to pay in the coming year for the transport of our beet an increase of ten per cent in freight charges.</P>
      <P>When we went to the Sugar Company about this, they said: &ldquo;We shall absorb 50 per cent of it and you should absorb the rest.&rdquo;  It is grand for a company that has a couple of million pounds profit on the year's business to say they will absorb a bit of a freight charge, but it is a different position altogether when it comes to asking farmers whose price has been cut to the bone already to bear that increase. I would suggest to the Minister that he take that old man of the sea off the backs of the Irish people, for it is nothing else but an old man of the sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About two years ago, we had occasion in another industry with which I am associated, namely, the vegetable industry in Cork, to look for contracts for the haulage of some 360 acres of beet to the factory.  The CIE tender in that respect was somewhere between 25 and 33 per cent over the tender of the local hauliers' association.  I challenge the Minister here openly now to deny that the hauliers' association are contracting for the haulage of beet at roughly 12½ per cent under the CIE charges.  On the one hand, we are asked to prepare for the Common Market, to keep our prices low and to increase production; on the other hand, you have a completely incompetent body, at least 35 per cent of whose lorries are privately-owned and who have to pay 7½ per cent to CIE for hauling the farmers' beet to the factory. A 7½ per cent increase in the price of beet would be a pretty good <Col N="175" /> thing for us.  Here, however, over 30 per cent of the total haulage is done by private lorries without a plate, hired by CIE from whom they probably get a loan of one at a cost of 7½ per cent of the price.</P>
    <P>What is the justification for inflicting 7½ per cent extra on the agricultural community?  We have a little industry down in Cork that is advancing by leaps and bounds.  When I spoke here last on this matter, the tender was for 350 acres.  The tender was for 750 acres in this past season, and will be for 2,600 acres next year, giving employment to farmers, to workers in the factory and to the men who haul our produce.  Is all that to be crippled by an incompetent, inefficient body? If a man in Kerry who owns a lorry has not the £1,200 or £1,500 to pay for a plate and lends that lorry to CIE at 7½ per cent less than what CIE charge the farmers and can maintain a wife and family on the profit, what is wrong with CIE?  That is a fair question to which we should have a fair answer.</P>
    <P>There is no justification for what is going on in this country at the present day.  CIE will haul your fertilisers for you and will hire the unfortunate local lorryman who had money enough to buy the lorry but no more and he will have to pay them 7½ per cent of what he charges for hauling the fertiliser. The same thing applies in the case of ground limestone and every other commodity the farmer needs.  I would ask the Minister to get this whole management of CIE off our backs.</P>
    <P>Since the State took over the B &amp; I Company I see that following the noble example of CIE, they are losing £380,000 for this year.  My experience of the B &amp; I Company, who earn their livelihood from the port of Cork, is that when repairs or a new ship are required they go over to mother England with the order.  Can we have an assurance from the Minister now that within the next 12 months orders for overhauls and new ships will be placed in the port of Cobh, Rushbrooke dockyard or Verolme dockyard?  It is rather sickening for workers in those <Col N="176" /> dockyards and for farmers whose produce is carried in B &amp; I boats two or three times a week to see those boats which earn a fine fat livelihood out of the port of Cork going to mother England for repairs.  I shall not go further on that line but I would suggest to the Minister that a comparison should be made now between the freight charges of our competitors or those who will be our competitors in the EEC and those of CIE.</P>
    <P>Now we are to have luxury hotels and we wonder why there has been a reduction in the number of tourists coming to the country this year.  About two months ago, I had the misfortune to take some foreign visitors into a hotel in this benighted city for a meal. Unfortunately, one of them glanced at the menu card.  &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you mean that I buy the bull here, take it over to Italy; it is killed there and the steak comes back here to be eaten?&rdquo; In no other way could he account for the charge made by that hotel for a steak.  The price of beef in Italy is £14 a cwt.  That gives some idea as to what he thought of the price here which would be an extortionate price in Italy, where he came from.  The bill was around £15 for seven.  I brought them into the Dáil Restaurant the following day and we got a much better meal for £4.  That is a fair comparison&mdash;£15 as against £4.  Then we are talking about luxury hotels.  One pays for the luxury or pays for looking at it.</P>
    <P>Let us get down to bedrock.  If we are to have tourists, let us make some provision for them.  The majority of the tourists are not millionaires.  They are ordinary middle-class people.  In fact, the great majority of them are our brothers and sisters who had to go abroad to earn a livelihood and who come home for a holiday.  Do not bring them home to skin them.  They are being skinned.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should leave the hotel business so far as it goes to hoteliers and keep CIE out of it.</P>
    <P>I shall say nothing about Bord Fáilte because the language I would use in connection with that body would not be fit to be heard in this House. Therefore I will remain silent, very reluctantly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> These are all the points I wish to deal with on the Estimate.  It is due to the agricultural community and to the people generally that we know where we are going.  I do not want to be squeezed in between the semi-State body of CIE and the semi-State body of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann when I go looking for a price for farmers' beet.  If I do find myself in that position, there will be less beet grown.  We have had it tough enough up to the present to get better beet prices.  Up to last year we were dealing with a man who at least understood the policy of give and take.  We have no experience as yet of the new man but I think that, after the passing of the next year or two, we will be saying: &ldquo;God be good to General Costello.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would like to take this occasion, Sir, to offer you my congratulations on your election to this most important post and to wish you long years of service in the exalted position of Ceann Comhairle.  The last speaker is the second in seniority in this House; he is a county man of mine who has great experience in public office and public life.  A sentence used by him was that there is no justification for what is going on in this country at the present time.  I took note of such a statement coming from a senior Member of the House of great experience and a member of the Government Party.  Evidently what Deputy Corry has in mind is that there are many things out of tune and that it is the duty of this House to make corrections where corrections are necessary. I am sure that Deputy Corry had in mind the administration of this Department and of other Departments.  There are many people throughout the country who would agree with Deputy Corry's statement that there is no justification for what is going on in this country at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power has come in for a great deal of ridicule in this House for the evasiveness of his replies to questions and his statements here that he has no functions in regard to the operation of State-sponsored bodies.  He has stated here that his powers do not enable him to get information from these State-sponsored <Col N="178" /> bodies in reply to questions asked in this House.  I think that is wrong.  This Parliament is the supreme authority in this State and more powers should be vested in the Minister as far as these semi-State bodies are concerned. We have established here a number of semi-State bodies which the Minister has listed in his introductory statement and he has also listed his own powers in relation to these semi-State bodies.  It has been claimed, and I now repeat the claim, that this system should be changed so that we will know what is happening and that we will get more information on their day-to-day activities.</P>
    <P>All of these State-sponsored bodies exist on State subventions from the taxpayers and the people who represent the taxpayers are entitled to know how the taxpayers' money is being utilised.  These bodies are different from private enterprise concerns, the boards of which have to get their own finance and balance their own accounts or else go out of business.  That principle does not apply to the semi-State bodies. The first of these mentioned by the Minister is CIE and we are all aware of the history of that body, so far as the balancing of its budgets is concerned.  The present Minister told us in 1957 and 1958 that if we removed the deadwood from CIE, deadwood such as the railway in West Cork, the railway in Clare, the railway in Waterford, within five years CIE would be a self-supporting body and would require no further injections of State aid.</P>
    <P>I felt it necessary to say at that time that the Minister was talking through his hat and that the board of CIE who had advised him to this effect were also talking through their hats.  There was no justification at that time for such an assumption and I was surprised that the Minister should have accepted such advice.  He must admit now that the board and himself were wrong in that assumption and that all the assurances that CIE would become a viable concern were completely out of tune with what happened subsequently.  At that time we made a claim that CIE must be regarded as much as a social service as a transport <Col N="179" /> service and that it was unfair to remove that social service from those parts of the country where it was uneconomic. We said that this would leave these areas without any transport service at all and that it was wrong not to give licences to private concerns to cater for such districts.</P>
    <P>We know now that the board's assessment of the situation and the Minister's prophecy have all gone haywire so we must assume, on that basis, that the board of CIE are not sound businessmen.  If they were running a private company, they would be out of business in a short time.  In any case our present injections to CIE have been rising steadily, as the Minister's statement indicates.  In 1966-67, the subvention from State funds reached the record sum of £2,400,000, or some £170,000 more than last year.  This subvention may be necessary.  The Minister has told us it is necessary.  But my argument is that it is the taxpayers who contribute this money, and they should, therefore, have much more detail on the necessity for this subvention than is given at the moment.</P>
    <P>So far as CIE and the other State bodies are concerned, it is my contention that there should be a Committee of this House&mdash;I believe this has been mooted in earlier discussions&mdash;akin to the Public Accounts Committee before which could be brought the senior executives of CIE and the other State and semi-State bodies.  I exclude none. These executives should be required to explain to the members of that Committee how they expended the finances under their control and why they required subventions of the order, as in the case of CIE, of £2,400,000.  We are entitled to that information.</P>
    <P>I am not critical of these bodies because we have not got sufficient information to make a proper assessment as to whether or not such bodies are being managed in a businesslike way. The only comment one can make is that the anticipations some years back as to their future activities and finances were not borne out.  Indeed, the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>Take the Electricity Supply Board. <Col N="180" /> It has a very important function. According to the Minister's statement the Board's balance outstanding on 31st March, 1967, was approximately £109 million, of which £58.5 million was borrowed from the State and the remainder from the public, insurance companies and so on.  Undoubtedly the ESB are doing good work, but are they doing it as economically as it could be done?  Are they discharging their functions and obligations in the same way as a well-managed private company would?  We do not know.  But we should know.  It is a public body and if the members of that body have fallen down on their job, it is the public purse which is called upon to make good deficiencies.  It is essential that there should be a Committee of this House to examine into the affairs of all such bodies, a Committee with the same terms of reference as the Public Accounts Committee.  I believe such a Committee would be most helpful, even from the point of view of the Minister of the day because he would then not be in the embarrassing position of having to disclaim responsibility and to refuse to answer questions addressed to him by Deputies in relation to the activities of these bodies.</P>
    <P>We are a relatively small country and £1 million is a sizeable sum, taking into account our economy as a whole. We must be watchful not only of £1 million but of every pound given to State bodies.  The only way in which we can be watchful is by having more control than we have at present.  My main reason for contributing to this debate is to try to bring home to the Minister, to the Government, and to the House the necessity for a closer examination of the accounts of these State and semi-State bodies in order to ensure that they are working in a businesslike fashion and are not throwing the taxpayers' money they get from us down the drain, so to speak.  We must be assured of that.</P>
    <P>I am not making any charges of political discrimination, or anything else, but it has been the position&mdash;I am not now reflecting on the Minister or anyone else&mdash;that men have been appointed to such boards in the past <Col N="181" /> who, in my opinion, and in the opinion of others, did not have the necessary qualifications.  Membership of boards like CIE, Bord na Móna, the ESB and so on require very high qualifications. Those who manage these bodies, who have a say in their direction and control, should have such qualifications. It has been known that people were appointed to such boards who had few qualifications other than political ones.  I am not against a man with political affiliations being appointed.  I do not agree with the assertion that, because a man is a follower of a political Party, he should be precluded from consideration.  I do not agree with that.  People who are prominent in politics have a right to be considered for all such appointments, provided they have the other qualifications necessary.  I do not want to see a man appointed because he is a Party hack.  That has happened in the past.</P>
    <P>We had an assurance recently from a Minister that, so far as appointments to boards were concerned, preference would be given to their own Party men, all things being equal.  That would not be too bad if that were the real position, but it is not.  Take the appointments to the boards down through the years.  I am not now reflecting personally on any of those who have been appointed; I am reflecting on the system which enables them to become members of such boards. They are appointed because they were defeated in an election, failed to retain a seat, failed to get into the other House, the rest home&mdash;I do not want to be disrespectful&mdash;the Second House of Parliament, in which those who fail in an election usually find accommodation. Then we have this third&mdash;I do not like to use the term &ldquo;resting place&rdquo;&mdash;outlet, the taking up of a berth in some State-sponsored body.</P>

      <P>I am not reflecting on the Minister; I am reflecting on the system, a system the Minister possibly inherited from his predecessor. It is a system I should like to see changed.  The best brains in the country should be appointed to these boards. They have important work to do.  I do not mind what their political affiliations are if they have the other essential qualifications.</P>
      <P>I shall not labour the point.  I have endeavoured to make myself as clear as possible.  We should have a closer examination of the affairs of public bodies and some system should be devised akin to the Public Accounts Committee, of which you, Sir, are the Chairman, and therefore understand and appreciate its workings, so that we could bring before it the senior executives of every State and semi-State company for examination on the workings and management of the different concerns.  I do not want to labour this question further at present.</P>
      <P>Let me be a little more parochial&mdash; although what I say applies generally in the country&mdash;in relation to electricity supply.  The ESB commenced its work in, I think, 1924.  Credit must be given to the men who planned it and got it off the ground.  It has been of immense benefit to our people in providing lighting, heating, and so on.  This was a national scheme and, at the time of its promotion, it was clearly emphasised, and even Dáil Debates will prove, that the scheme was intended to serve all our people and not just sections of our people.  It was not possible to do so at once.  Everybody realised that it would take a number of years to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The percentage of households in this country enjoying electricity is 85.  That means that 15 per cent still await electricity services.  It may safely be assumed that these 15 per cent are in remote and isolated districts.  Possibly a small percentage of this 15 per cent <Col N="183" /> could have availed of the service at an earlier date, if they had agreed to do so.  One can understand that it is a problem to have to return to a district after service has been provided for those who said they would take it. There is the problem of moving equipment and men a second time when it would be more economical to complete the district in the first instance.</P>
    <P>What is the cost?  Why have people refused to avail of this essential service? Over the years, I have pointed out in this House that it is due entirely to the special charge.  Again and again, I have made representations to have this special charge wiped out.  A few weeks ago, I had a call from two incapacitated people who are living on the disablement allowance.  In order to avail of the service, they will have to pay £42 15s 0d special charge to the ESB.  I advised them to take it as possibly it would not be in their district again for quite some time.  Consider the problem facing those people in respect of that special charge.  The Minister says the ESB must find the money, which is correct.  I have asserted here that if money has to be found, it should be obtained from the general body of consumers.</P>
    <P>The special charge should be wiped out and there should be a proportionate increase on the general body of consumers.  That would be quite fair. The ESB cannot work without money. The standard rate should apply in the remote area as well as in the area adjacent to a town or village.  I do not find fault with the Minister's assertion that it would be unfair to ask public funds to give further injections in respect of the special charge.  However, I believe the special charge should be wiped out.  Were it not for the special charge, many households would enjoy electricity supply.</P>
    <P>Without electricity, a farmer has not the advantage of an electric milking-machine, of a water-pump, of a television set, and so on.  Some day we shall have to get down to the question of the special charge.  It is a matter for Government action.  They have provided <Col N="184" /> subventions in some of the poorer areas towards this charge but it should be wiped out altogether.  I have said here on other occasions that it is unconstitutional.  This service was to be given to all our people at a flat rate, except big concerns in urban districts where, naturally, a special rating would apply, due to their high consumption. Again and again, the Minister has replied that it cannot be done as it would be too costly.  When the previous Government provided subsidised lime, they provided it at a flat rate all over the country.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and to the Parliamentary Secretary to address themselves again to the question of the special charge and to urge on the Government the desirability of removing it.  Every Deputy must agree with that plea.  I do not think the general body of consumers would object in this instance and, if they did, I do not think they would have a good case.</P>
    <P>The services provided by some of our State-sponsored bodies could be linked up here&mdash;CIE, ESB and Bord Fáilte.  CIE is practically non-existent in West Cork, except for a few buses. The ESB services and Bord Fáilte services could be linked up.  In South-West Cork, we are endeavouring to develop tourism.  We are endeavouring to make the most of our resorts and of our coastline and the most of what nature has given us.  I was pleased to see the Minister in south-west Cork on a number of occasions and that he has rated the tourist potential of the area very highly.  He was more charmed with our scenery in south-west Cork, and rightly so, than with that in any other part of the country.  Naturally we are trying to build up this industry.  I readily concede that the Minister is making every possible move to expand tourism.  Whether he is going the best way about it may be open to question but I know that he is sincere in his efforts to develop tourism and to get the most we can from it.  It is unfortunate that despite our efforts, the figures for last year showed a decrease.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to do all he can to ensure that the ESB services are supplied to all pockets in my area which <Col N="185" /> have not got them at present.  I have in mind particularly pockets in the south-west peninsula which the Minister has visited and where he has commented upon the potential for tourism.  It is essential to get ESB services there.  I would urge upon him the desirability of making funds available for the extension of ESB services to districts which are without them at present and to have this work completed.  Naturally the same claim could be made for a number of other such places but possibly they can be made more ably by representatives from these places.</P>
    <P>In regard to money provided for accommodation, I should like to see a greater proportion being diverted to farm guesthouses.  This is something new in tourism.  It is still in the infancy stage but it has caught on well in my constituency, and I believe the same position applies generally. These farm guesthouses could be of marked advantage and could supplement the income of uneconomic holders.  A number of such people in my area have been very pleased with their returns in the past few years.  In addition, the guests, many of whom were foreigners, were very pleased with this type of holiday and preferred it to a holiday in an hotel within urban bounds.  I suggest to the Minister that grants should be made available to people who intend to provide this type of accommodation, say, grants for those with three rooms upwards.  To provide five rooms or ten rooms is very costly.  There are many people in south-west Cork who are anxious to get grants to add three rooms to what they have.  I was a member of the County Development Team for two years and the county manager, who was chairman, and the other members, were very anxious about this question so far as west Cork was concerned. The Minister should discuss the matter with Bord Fáilte in an endeavour to have grants made available for people who are inclined to provide three additional rooms up to the required Departmental standard.  This would have the advantage of providing good-class accommodation for visitors because such farmhouses are capably managed, are clean, comfortable, and <Col N="186" /> the food is first-class as it comes from the farm.</P>
    <P>This is one aspect of our tourist development in which we should take a closer interest.  In regard to hotels, I am inclined to agree with the proposal of the CIE subsidiary company establishing comfortable hotels in which we are told the prices will be moderate, say, 40/- to 45/- for bed and breakfast.  We know that in summertime many of our hotels are taxed to capacity and visitors, particularly non-resident, have difficulty in obtaining mid-day meals.  A number of hotels who have benefited from State subventions have no hesitation, when the house is full at lunchtime, in turning away non-residential guests.  I see no harm in the CIE subsidiary promoting additional accommodation.  However, I hope that the prices will not go beyond 45/-.  We want to provide something which is fair and reasonable for our people.  The prices in Grade A hotels are beyond the financial capacity of visitors of moderate means. Taking Western European standards, the price of not more than 45/-, around £2, for bed and breakfast would not be unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to consider a local matter, that is, the representations made by Cork County Council regarding Bantry pier.  The Minister has turned down certain recommendations which the county council sent him.  Everybody is aware of the new status of Bantry pier and the importance it has assumed.  I am not going to be critical of the Minister but I would ask him to look again at the county council's proposal.  I am sure that if he examines it in the light of what is happening in Bantry at present, he will change his viewpoint. Before concluding, I would again like to ask him to consider my main point, that is, the desirability of establishing Committees with power to bring before them the chief executives of our State-sponsored bodies.  I am not going to labour it but I think it most desirable.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as you have just been elected, I should like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate you on your election <Col N="187" /> and to wish you every success in your exalted position.  Personally, I have no doubt that you, like the Cheann Comhairle, will give justice and fair play to all Deputies, irrespective of what side of the House they sit on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it gives me immense pleasure to be addressing you thus and to say, appropriately under the title of Transport and Power, that I am sure the House will go very far under your stewardship and that you will be a tower of strength to us in our deliberations.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with a number of what might appear to be minute matters in relation to this immensely important Department.  If I concentrate on them. it is not due to any lack of appreciation of the appreciation we have been given by the Minister and the State Departments over which he presides, even from a remote position. It is because the matters to which I will be making reference are those which are the daily experience of tens of thousands of our people, things which understandably vex people day in and day out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The city of Dublin has experienced in the past six months the most extraordinary behaviour on the part of CIE and the Garda Síochána in removing a substantial number of bus stops from convenient positions and replacing them with alternative bus stops, smaller in number and at very inconvenient positions for the larger number of intending passengers.  Not unnaturally, many people, including some of the national papers, have sought to put the blame for this on the elected councillors of Dublin Corporation.  It is important it should be put on record here&mdash;and I am sure the Minister will support me in this because his own replies to Parliamentary Questions have emphasised this&mdash;that the responsibility for this extraordinary behaviour lies entirely upon CIE and the Garda Síochána, and that Dublin Corporation have no function in the matter, and are not even consulted in the matter. Not only is the legal entity known as <Col N="188" /> Dublin Corporation not consulted through its executive, but the elected representatives have no say in this, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I can say of the members of Dublin Corporation, irrespective of Party, that they all have had occasion in the past six months to protest about the behaviour of both the Garda and CIE in the rearranging of bus stops. The replies to their protests are somewhat in this vein.  From CIE comes a letter saying responsibility in the matter lies with the Garda Síochána and from the Garda Síochána comes a reply saying responsibility lies with CIE.  From the Minister comes a statement from time to time saying that the responsibility lies on CIE and the Garda Síochana and he has no function in the matter.</P>
    <P>Suffice it to say that the people who intend to travel by bus have been seriously inconvenienced, and it would not appear that any balance of advantage has been gained by the changes. We are told that the changes were brought about so as to improve traffic flow, whatever that might be, and to make the bus services more efficient. It is beyond understanding how you can make bus services more efficient if you make it more difficult for people to embark and disembark.  That is exactly what has happened here.  It is exceedingly important that bus stops should be placed in convenient positions and that they should be placed at points where the majority of people will be convenienced in boarding and getting off the buses.  If there has to be a conflict between bus passengers and other users of the road, I believe bus passengers should get priority. They represent the greater number of people at any given moment.  I think the figures for commuters in Dublin are roughly 50 per cent by public transport and 50 per cent by other means.  It is proper that the bus travellers should receive prior consideration.</P>
    <P>I instance one case at Terenure Cross where the bus stop has, ever since the replacement of the tram services by buses, been sited opposite the national school at a point where, I think, from <Col N="189" /> the commencement of the tram services, the boarding stop was.  This is on the way into the city.  This has recently been shifted a considerable distance down the roadway towards the town. The result is that people who walk from Templeogue Road, which has only a No. 15 bus service, to Terenure, must now walk the better part of a quarter of a mile before reaching the next bus stop.  The bus stop at Terenure Road has the advantage of being served by the Nos. 15. 15A and 15B bus services.  Therefore, it has a frequency of services four times greater than that available on either Templeogue Road or Terenure Road West.  It is reasonable to afford people who wish to go to the routes of greater frequency a reasonable distance from the Cross, but the extension of the Terenure Cross bus stop to a distance far removed from Terenure Road is wholly unnecessary and has not conferred any advantage on other traffic using that road.</P>
    <P>Indeed, this has created a new hazard for many road users, particularly for children.  The traffic warden for the local school was not placed outside the school gate some years ago on the ground that by so doing, the warden would be too near the bus stop and the traffic lights at Terenure cross roads. Now we have the situation that the children accumulate around the &ldquo;Lollipop Man&rdquo;, as they call the warden, to cross at a point where they intermingle with the people queueing at the bus stop.  Motorists approaching the bus stop, when there is a stationary bus there, have no view at all of the large number of children who congregate at that point to be assisted across the road by the &ldquo;Lollipop Man&rdquo;.  Our second state is now worse than the first.  Now we have the bus stop, the school warden, the children and the bus passengers all congregating at the one point.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that I could probably illustrate several other instances of the lack of consideration on the part of CIE and the Garda in the change of bus stops, but to do so in detail would prolong this debate unreasonably.  But I crave the indulgence of the House to emphasise that more people are affected daily by these wrong sitings of bus <Col N="190" /> stops than are affected by very many other matters which are discussed at great length in this House.  It therefore behoves us on the one occasion that we have an opportunity of protesting, to make our protest effectively and loudly against the indiscriminate and unfair resiting of bus stops in this city within the past year.</P>
    <P>We must also make the only protest which is available to us against the substantial reduction in the number of bus stops in the city in the past year which has imposed unnecessary hardship upon a very large number of people in our community.  I would hope that even at this late stage some consideration would be given by CIE and by the Garda to the multitudinous representations which have been made to them by members of this House, the Seanad and Dublin Corporation. We have been contacted by the people who have been affected.  We are speaking the protests of these small people, of these humble citizens, and it is only correct and proper that these people's complaints should be listened to.  It is not sufficient to say in answer that the experts think otherwise.  The experts are wrong, if it means misery, unhappiness and inconvenience to a large number of people, and the present chaotic state of the Dublin bus services is a fair indication that the experts have gone quite seriously wrong in all their planning.</P>
    <P>Another thing which affects people in their daily lives is the extraordinary destination scrolls which we now have on Dublin buses.  It is an extraordinary understanding of patriotism to replace Dublin-manufactured destination scrolls in the English language with London-manufactured destination scrolls in the Irish language or in some language which purports to be Irish, although its relationship to any names that people learned in school is extremely remote.</P>
    <P>For many years a first-class firm in Drimnagh made the destination scrolls of the Dublin buses.  A couple of years ago, they were asked within 14 days&mdash; I may be wrong in relation to that but I think it was 14 days&mdash;to tender for new scrolls.  Because the amount of time and information given to them <Col N="191" /> was inadequate, they were not in time with their tender, and the Minister has given this as the justification for giving a large contract for the manufacture of scrolls to an English firm.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, this strange exercise in so-called patriotism has resulted in new destination scrolls being manufactured for the Dublin buses.  It is interesting to note that in a recent survey of Dublin buses, it was found that 82 per cent of them had destination scrolls which were either out of order or which were not showing the correct termini or stages through which the buses in question were passing.</P>
    <P>I cannot think of all the confused scrolls which I have seen but I instance a few which come to mind. Although No. 22 route bus goes from Fleet Street to Drimnagh, it had on it that it was going to the city centre, and the portion set aside to indicate the areas through which it was passing indicated Fionn Radhairc and Sráid Seoirse Theas.  To those who may not be familiar with the native language, such as the Minister, this means Fair-view, which is probably up to three miles from the city terminus of the No. 22 bus route.</P>
    <P>On the Drimnagh bus route, on which I live, it is a very frequent experience to find that the Terenure or Templeogue buses are, according to the scrolls in front of the buses, supposed to be passing through Baile Phib and Rath Maonas.  They certainly pass through Rath Maonas, otherwise known as Rathmines, with which the Minister is familiar, but Baile Phib happens to be Phibsborough, and Terenure and Templeogue buses do not go next or near Phibsborough.  I have also seen on several occasions the Templeogue bus which goes from O'Connell Street through St. Stephen's Green, Rathmines, Rathgar and Terenure, having on its scroll that it was going through Baile Liam and Carraig Dubh, which for the benefit of those who are not familiar with those names, are Williamstown and Blackrock, places through which the Templeogue bus service naturally does not operate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> It is a very frequent experience to see buses going through the city centre to the suburbs and bearing on their destination scrolls the only indications of &ldquo;City Centre&rdquo; and &ldquo;An Lár&rdquo;.  It might be said that you do not need the destination scrolls because the route numbers are there to guide people.  That would be all right if the route numbers were always right, but I will come to defaults in that regard in a moment.  However, it is quite ludicrous to make an argument of this kind because if it is valid, then money should not be wasted on the provisions of destination scrolls at all; we should rely on the route numbers or go back to the days of the horse trams when they did not have numbers at all, when apparently because of the degree of illiteracy in the city the people identified routes by coloured symbols, yellow triangles, red circles, black squares, and so on.  We could go back to that rather antiquated system and avoid the waste of money which has been involved in the changing of destination scrolls on Dublin buses.</P>
    <P>It may be all right for the natives, who probably know where they are going, but some assistance ought to be given and some consideration should be shown for the many visitors to our city.  People who are advised to get a particular route number might reasonably expect that there would be some indication on the bus in question whether it is going to or from the city centre, but you have at this very moment a large number of buses proceeding towards the suburbs bearing on their scrolls that they are going towards the city centre.  This is bound to cause a considerable amount of confusion, inconvenience and indeed hardship. Of course the Minister travelling in his expensive Mercedes Benz car is not aware of these acute problems which are experienced by the ordinary, little people of our land and the small people who come to visit here and who cannot hire expensive limousines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister probably knows the bus on which he is travelling. He may have had experience, as I have had, of people on the buses finding that the buses were not going in the direction in which they had thought.  This has all resulted because some crackpot in CIE decided that the destination scrolls which were being used for decades were not good enough.  Therefore we have had literally thousands of pounds spent in cutting out the fronts and the backs of a large number of buses used in the Dublin fleet to change the scrolls from one complete scroll in one window to scrolls in two windows, and the result has been the kind of farce I have had to illustrate here.  I have no doubt the Minister feels the dignity of Parliament is greater than the tripe I have had to illustrate here, but I make no apology for doing it.  I am dealing with the kind of outrageous performance we have had from CIE whose function is first and all the time to provide for this city an efficient transport service. If a little consideration were given to the provision of a proper transport service and less to the inventing of placenames in a language that is not used by 99.9 per cent of the bus travellers, we might get some kind of bus service in this city which would meet the needs of the people who have to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that I would deal with the route numbers on buses.  Not only have we the wrong destinations showing on the buses, but we often have the wrong route numbers showing on buses and when complaint is made by passengers, no sympathy is shown to them by the operators but, rather, scorn is heaped on them that they did not guess better than they did.  I have known of cases of young children of tender years getting on the wrong buses because the numbers were wrong.  Again I speak with intimate knowledge of the Terenure area.  A large number of children have occasion to use the Nos. 15, 15A and 15B buses.  I have known of several occasions where the No. 15A bus which goes to Whitehall Road has borne the number 15B and the No. 15B <Col N="194" /> which goes to Templeogue has borne the number 15A, with the result that young children have arrived home to anxious mothers hours late and, indeed, I have also heard of a case where children, having got on the wrong bus through the wrong number being on it, were put off by the conductor at the wrong terminus which, as the crow flies, is probably three miles away from the terminus to which they should have gone, and not allowed back on the bus in question to be returned to a point where they could have collected the correct bus.</P>
    <P>This is outrageous and unforgivable. It is the kind of thing that a Minister may say is, of course, within the authority of CIE to look after because it deals with the day to day operations and that he has no function in the matter but I say that if there are in this city hundreds of thousands of people being inconvenienced by the clowning going on in connection with destination scrolls and route numbers, the Minister has a specific and urgent duty to intervene and call an end to all this kind of nonsense.  I trust the Minister will do so, and although he might not be prepared to admit it here, I think he will bring my remarks to the attention of those who have responsibility and I would ask him, when doing so, to urge CIE to do something once and for all to see that the destination scrolls work.  Not only have you the type of farcical exhibitions to which I have made reference but you also have a very large number of these buses with their new windows disclosing nothing except the tatters of the destination scrolls or crumpled up destination scrolls because apparently the machinery installed in the new destination scroll windows is so inefficient that a large number of the scrolls are not operative at all.</P>
    <P>As I say, I make no apology for raising this because it is the kind of thing the ordinary little people of this city have to experience and they should not be asked to tolerate that type of nonsense by some crackpots in CIE who apparently have nothing better to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> I have had occasion in the past to make complaint, and I do so again, about the apparent indifference on the part of CIE to the development of Dublin suburban train services.  I wish also to voice complaint that the Government have not yet taken the necessary steps to integrate the train services into a new transport plan.  It is simply not good enough that we are unable to get satisfactory answers in this House for the simple reason that no Minister will accept responsibility. The Minister will tell you that he has no responsibility for the provision of suburban train services, that it is a matter for CIE.  The Minister for Local Government will not answer any questions about integrating train services with road services because, he will say, that is not a matter for him but a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>We have not got in the new Dublin city plan any attention paid to the part which suburban train services could play in the transport of people and goods from the outskirts of the city into the city.  This is a terrible dereliction of duty on the part of the Government. One of the best ways of transporting people from the suburbs to work is by way of train services and no adequate attention has been given to this by Dublin Corporation, by the Department of Local Government, by the Department of Industry and Commerce or by the Department of Transport and Power because, apparently, train services are nobody's baby.</P>
    <P>From the national point of view, the amenity point of view, from the point of view of good town planning, there would be a great deal to be said for building new towns, new cities, 30, 40, 50, 60 miles away from Dublin rather than the grafting of new housing estates to the city which is already there because every new housing estate that you create, particularly when you create it away from a railway, is only creating additional traffic problems in the centre of Dublin and nobody is more acutely aware of that than CIE, but, notwithstanding that, no thought has been given&mdash;or if thought has been given, certainly no work has been <Col N="196" /> applied to translate that thought into action&mdash;to the provision for our city of integrated development so that train services would be used to transport people from their homes to their place of employment.  Indeed, the reverse has been the trend.  We had the calamitous decision not so many years ago to close down the Harcourt Street-Bray railway line.  No sooner did that occur than you had an immense increase in housing development all along that line, to such an extent that if only CIE had held on for a few years, the Harcourt Street-Bray railway line could have been an extremely profitable source of revenue to them.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting thing, which I think deserves mention, that in September last on a Saturday afternoon, I wished to bring a group of children from Dublin to Bray.  I found that CIE were operating no train services from Dublin to Bray after 2 o'clock on a Saturday until the following Monday morning.  From a city the size of Dublin with over a half a million people, there is no train service to the south-east coast, to Bray, from 2 o'clock on Saturday until the following Monday. As an alternative, we were offered a train service from the same station northwards to Howth.  Howth is not Bray.  Perhaps CIE are not aware of that but it would help if they became aware of it.  There is a clear obligation on our society&mdash;I am not going to say on CIE&mdash;but on our society, to maintain out of a city the size of Dublin over the weekend adequate train services to resorts such as Bray and to the south-east coast so that people can get out of the city if they wish to do it.</P>
    <P>It struck me that if this was the way CIE were operating their suburban line to Bray, it would not be long before we would be asked to close down all the stations on the Bray line, with the exception, perhaps, of Dún Laoghaire. If you do not make train services available for the seven days of the week to those who want them it is almost certain that they will turn over to alternative forms of transport, buses or cars.</P>
    <P>Dublin is experiencing the same difficulties as various other cities where the convenience and privacy of the <Col N="197" /> private motor car tends to draw people away from public transport.  There are many cases in which people feel that there is no point in having their own transport because the streets and roads become so blocked that it is better to use public transport.  Things are not that bad in Dublin as yet but it may become as bad or worse, if CIE and all the other Departments do not tackle now this problem so that they will be able to apply the remedy before the disease becomes too rampant.  At the present time nothing is being done which is likely to be of any benefit.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what has happened in regard to the Dublin-Belfast railway line.  About 12 months ago, it was mentioned that the Northern Government would approve a single track between Goraghwood and Belfast and we pleaded with the Minister to see that did not happen.  The Minister's attitude at the time was that if it did happen, it would not be such a dreadful thing because more traffic was passing through Dublin to Belfast on the roads than there was on the railway. The Minister seemed to take a defeatist approach to the whole matter and seemed to feel that there was no point in trying to encourage people to use the railway.  Apparently the Minister's attitude is that there is no point in maintaining the efficiency of the railway because large numbers are using the roads.  That is a negative approach and my attitude is that we have a social obligation to ensure that the Dublin-Belfast line is maintained at the peak of efficiency.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted that if the track is singled north of the Border, the train times will have to be adjusted. If that is so, the adjustment will take place not to suit the travelling public but to ensure that there will be no collision on the single-track section and the travelling public will be given a service not suited to their needs.  The public will receive from CIE on this section of the railway a service which will discourage them from using it and which will encourage them to use the roads.  That, in turn, will impose on our society the additional cost of having to provide a major roadway between Dublin and Belfast.  This whole attitude <Col N="198" /> of the Minister indicates a lack of enterprise in his approach to this particular problem.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to use his good offices and to ask Bord Fáilte to use theirs in order to improve the hotel situation in the south-west of Dublin, a portion of the city in which there is no hotel, good, bad or indifferent.  That constituency, as the Minister knows, stretches from Rathgar in the east to Inchicore and Drimnagh in the west and in all that section there is not a single hotel.  It is interesting to note that in the part of the city run the trunk-roads from Cork, Cashel, Limerick and all Munster.  They run in along the Naas Road and down the dual carriageway.</P>
    <P>Applications have been made to the planning authority for permission to erect hotels within the bounds of the city in that sector but these applications have been turned down on the ground that portion of the development sites is reserved for industrial estates and another portion for residential purposes. Indeed, one of the industrial estates which is called President Kennedy Drive has been so sited and built that one would not know it was an industrial estate if one did not see the names of the various firms.  The mere fact that this is an industrial estate area creates a need for hotel and catering accommodation in that sector of the city.  I am sure Deputy Fitzpatrick agrees with me in this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is outside the city boundary.  It is a most welcome development but it is outside the city boundary, and inside the city in that sector you have not a motel, a hotel, an inn or any kind of eating place.  I hope the Minister will not take the line that he has no responsibility in this matter.  These two problems are integrated, the problem of catering for people <i>in situ</i> and the problem of catering for people in motion.  The Departments of Transport and Power and of Local Government have a dual responsibility in this and the sooner <Col N="199" /> they get together to deal with these problems the sooner they will be solved.</P>
      <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to what many people consider an abuse.  At the moment any hotel owner can apply for various improvement grants, and these grants are available. We, in Fine Gael, consider it appropriate that they should be available and, when we are in power, we will encourage and initiate improvements in these grant facilities.  It is, however, fair to submit that it is not proper that people who get these grants should be able to make vast fortunes out of them. That has happened.  I have in mind a particular hotel&mdash;I shall not mention it because it would not be fair&mdash;which was owned by a person who had other interests in the tourist and travel world.  This is a very well-known hotel west of the Shannon.  The gentleman in question was, perhaps, more <i>au fait</i> than most with the facilities available. He applied for grants and loans.  No doubt he put up a project which, on its merits, deserved consideration.  He got the grants and loans.  He improved the premises.  No sooner had he done so than he sold the hotel, lock, stock and barrel, to foreigners.  The hotel has passed out of Irish hands into the hands of foreign interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be argued, of course, that the hotel is still in Ireland.  It cannot be shifted.  It will be operated for the advantage of Irish people and tourists who come here.  I suppose most of the staff will continue to be Irish.  The hotel is now bigger and better.  Is it right that we should operate a system which allows people to apply to the Exchequer for taxpayers' money to improve an Irish hotel, which, when it is improved, is sold and, in the process of selling, the owner makes a vast personal profit out of capital made available to him by the taxpayers?  It would be perfectly reasonable, I think, to require that people who receive such grants should be obliged to retain ownership for a certain period afterwards. Those who obtain repair and improvement grants for private houses are sometimes required by local authorities to remain in ownership for <Col N="200" /> some time afterwards.  They are certainly restricted from making a profit out of the taxpayers' and ratepayers' money.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Minister that he should take another look at this particular situation.  It is unhealthy; it is unsavoury. It creates a considerable amount of public anxiety.  It can, perhaps, be justified on the ground that the amenity is still there, but it is undesirable that the taxpayers' money should be freely used to make a personal profit.  That would appear to be the main aim of some.  They operate hotels for some years.  They then get a grant to improve the hotels and, no sooner are the improvements carried out, than they sell at an enhanced figure, a figure far greater than they would have got, had they not had the use of taxpayers' money to improve the hotels.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us why it is that supplies of Irish anthracite are so unsatisfactory.  In a situation in which we have disappointment expressed at the closure of Irish coalmines and where we have a wish on the part of anthracite users to use Irish anthracite, why is it that Irish anthracite is proving unsatisfactory?  Those who are fortunate to have central heating have operated that central heating on Irish anthracite for many years. They are now obliged to move away from Irish to Welsh anthracite.  They have told me that they have found Irish anthracite in recent times to be both dirty and wet, inclined to clog their boiler grates and stoves.  It is extraordinary that this should be a recent development.  Is it that the producers are getting careless or are we running out of the better quality anthracite?  Suffice to say that many former users of Irish anthracite have now gone over to Welsh anthracite, or to oil-fired central heating.  If there are supplies of Irish anthracite still left, it would be desirable that we should use it.  If the Minister's technical advisers can give any assistance to producers of Irish anthracite to help them produce a better quality, then that advice ought to be given.  Otherwise the situation may well be that we will have a further deterioration in <Col N="201" /> the amount of Irish anthracite and coal produced.  The Minister has given a figure of 188,000 tons.  The figure will decline further if we do not improve the quality.</P>
    <P>The Minister has informed us that about 50 per cent of our energy comes from oil.  That is a rather frightening figure to anyone who recalls the difficulties in which we were placed because of shortage of oil during the last World War.  We have been extremely lucky in that we did not suffer a shortage of oil supplies during the more recent crisis in the Middle East.  Britain and other European countries had their oil supplies cut.  We had no cuts.  I suspect one of the reasons we did not have cuts was that we sacrificed principle to expediency.  The statements of our Minister for External Affairs were certainly not in keeping with the views of the majority of the Irish people in relation to the unfortunate conflict between Israel and her Arab neighbours. While we were certainly glad we were able to maintain our fuel supplies of oil, we could certainly find no enjoyment in the sacrifice of principle to expediency.  Neither could we find any enjoyment in appearing to favour the Arabs as against Israel simply because it suited our own convenience to have uninterrupted supplies of oil from Kuwait, or elsewhere.  Notwithstanding the Machiavellian activities of the Minister for External Affairs, it may well be that at some future date we may have our supplies cut.  One can readily see the serious consequences to our economy should that happen; 50 per cent of our energy comes from oil and we would be at the mercy of an unstable section of the world, to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>We are abundantly aware of the tremendous activity in the North Sea in the search for oil and natural gas supplies.  We are aware of the success crowning these activities.  We are a little concerned that our Minister for Transport and Power is not sufficiently active in this regard.  He has given some facilities to foreign concerns which expressed some interest, but as far as I know, while rights have been <Col N="202" /> given to explore our coastal waters for sources of oil and gas, these rights have not yet been exercised.  I urge the Minister now to bring pressure to bear upon those who have these rights.</P>

      <P>Glory be, it is extremely difficult to get responsibility borne by the Minister for Transport and Power. Surely the Minister has a specific ressponsibility for the provision of power? Surely the Minister's responsibility does not arise simply in relation to the transport of energy or power as soon as it reaches our shores?  If the Minister has any function it is surely to think ahead about the needs of the future and to find ways of filling those needs.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate that mining, as such, to a large extent has in the past been administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce, this is so fundamental a matter that it is not sufficient to pass the buck.  If we asked questions in this matter of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, we should find no answer from him but reference to the Minister for Transport and Power.  Would both of these Ministers get together on this vital subject to see to it that action is taken in relation to the exploration of our off-shore power possibilities?  We have little enough in the country.  If we could find something in the Irish Sea, in St. George's Channel or in the adjoining waters, we should use it and the sooner we tap it the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps so.  Last year, I had the privilege, with others, of representing Ireland at an international conference of the Interparliamentary Union.  The topic for consideration during that week was the power parliament should exercise over State-sponsored bodies.  It is proper that I should inform this House that the collective nations of the world were <Col N="203" /> amazed at the virtual lack of control the Parliament of Ireland had over children conceived in Parliament, over children created by this Parliament. The Irish record on the creation of State-sponsored bodies is extremely good.  We have probably created far more State companies than many equivalent states.  We certainly have created far more than many so-called socialist states.  However, we have rendered ourselves in this House and in the Seanad powerless so far as supervising these concerns goes.  We, in Fine Gael, have said for several years that we consider this to be a bad thing.</P>
      <P>One of the unfortunate results of this is that the Parliamentary Question must be resorted to in order to try to get some information, in order to try to get some influence brought to bear upon State-sponsored companies.  Let it be acknowledged here that sometimes it is not the happiest way of making an impression.  There are many cases in which the full information will not be given by a Minister in reply to a Parliamentary Question simply because the public interest may not best be served by the disclosure of that information in the House in the full heat and excitement of our rather colourful and excitable Question Time.  I think it is a sufficient responsibility on Members of this House to treat information in relation to State-sponsored companies in a responsible way.  The best way of getting that information is, in some cases, not by way of Parliamentary Question but by way of Select Committees of this House or by way of a Standing Committee of this House such as the Public Accounts Committee over which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has presided so excellently for some years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members familiar with the operations of the Public Accounts Committee know the immense value of the work done by that Committee.  We know it is done not in any spirit of Party acrimony but in a spirit of communal goodwill towards the institutions which have been supervised.  The sooner we create a similar Standing Committee here, the sooner we shall get away from the kind of carping criticism which has <Col N="204" /> to be voiced here from time to time as the only outlet available for the making of statements of criticism.</P>
    <P>I know that the present Minister for Transport and Power has set his mind against any supervisory activity on the part of Members of this House.  The Minister takes the line that these bodies have been created and that we have given them power to operate.  To leave them unfettered and uncontrolled is one thing but to be ignorant of their activities is another thing.  I referred to them as children conceived by this Parliament.  It is the very negation of parental responsibility to be ignorant of what your children are doing.  That is what we have been doing in the past and the sooner we learn more about the activities of these State-sponsored bodies the better.  To have an annual report from the Minister for Transport and Power is not sufficient. We need to know a great deal more than we can ever learn by way of Parliamentary Question or debate on the annual Estimate for the Department.</P>
    <P>Take the 7 per cent increase in ESB charges.  Is it not laughable that a State-sponsored body can propose an increase of 7 per cent in the cost of supplying electricity and that the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have not got, at the time of receiving the notice, any information to justify the increase?  Is it not laughable that such an announcement is made to Members of the Dáil and the Seanad without any information to enable them to assess whether or not it is reasonable to increase electricity charges by 7 per cent?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>That is not the question. The question is whether or not it is right that an institution created by the State should leave the people who created it in ignorance of what it is doing or the need for what it wishes to do.  That is exactly what has happened and that is totally undesirable. As other Deputies have said, if you oblige private suppliers of goods and services to submit their applications for prior examination, if you oblige people who have only their labour and the sweat of their brow, to submit their applications for higher wages to independent examination, surely the least we can do is to impose an obligation on the ESB, Bord na Móna, CIE, to submit all applications for independent assessment prior to implementing them?</P>
      <P>What happened in relation to the ESB charges was that after the event, the Minister for Industry and Commerce came along and said, in effect: &ldquo;I think we had better submit this to public inquiry to see if it is justified&rdquo;, but that was the wrong way to do it. The thing was to know what was happening.  Indeed, I think it is fair to say that, if the Government and Members of this House and of the Seanad had been kept properly informed, the need for a 7 per cent increase could never have arisen.  There must have been considerable procastination before the 7 per cent increase was imposed all at the one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make an appeal in relation to another matter affecting transport, that is, the provision of free travel for old age pensioners.  I know that to a large extent this is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare but the Minister for Transport and Power is concerned in the administration of the scheme and that is what I wish to deal with.  We have been informed that the spouses of contributory pensioners may apply to the Department of Social Welfare to get a permit which will enable them to travel, apart from pension holders, without the production of the pension book.  I would appeal to the Minister to use his good offices with his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, <Col N="206" /> to ensure that many of these old people, many of whom are well-nigh incapable of writing a letter to send away for these permits, will have these permits sent to them by the Minister for Social Welfare right away.  He must know them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing it in this way, that at the moment it is the agents of the Minister CIE, who are charging old people on buses when they need not be charged, if only they had these permits.  I will direct it to the Minister's attention in this way. In the meanwhile I would ask that the employees of CIE be instructed not to enforce this thing too rigidly and to allow these old folks to travel even if they have not got the travel permit.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that I have to complain once again about the unfair activities of the ESB in relation to the provision of favourable financial loans and hire purchase facilities for selected people. The hardware trade is going through a particularly difficult period.  For years, they were the sole vendors of soap, soap powders and the like, but that has been taken from them by the supermarkets.  There are several other commodities which at one time you got exclusively in the hardware shop but which are now available in almost every other supermarket or store.  The result has been to confine the hardware shop to what you might call dry goods, machinery and electrical equipment. What has been happening for some time past is that the ESB have been offering very favourable finances to a limited number of exclusive electrical contractors and refusing to make the same financial accommodation available to hardware merchants.  The result has been that people have tended to go to the electrical contractor favoured by the ESB, to the detriment of the hardware merchants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People might wonder how this could arise.  It arises in this way.  First of all, hire purchase facilities are offered by the ESB at interest rates which are lower than can be offered by any other <Col N="207" /> hire purchase concern.  The principal reason is that the ESB are able to obtain money on the public market and have a Government guarantee but other hire purchase firms have to compete on the ordinary commercial bonds and they must offer a high rate of interest.  The ESB, which is a gilt-edged security, a gilt-edged investment, can offer more attractive hire purchase terms at a lower rate of interest.</P>
    <P>That is not the most effective advantage which ESB hire purchase contracts have from the point of view of the seller, or the dealer, or from the point of view of the financier.  It is this: the ordinary hire purchase finance company can only resort to the goods if the hirer defaults and if the goods are not there, or if they are not worth taking back, the company must go through the ordinary processes of the law to get judgment for the debt and then perhaps through the enforcement of the machinery of the district court for an instalment order, or ultimately a committal order if the debt is not paid.  All of these processes increase tremendously the overheads of the ordinary commercial hire purchase concerns but this is the only financial facility available to the hardware traders as distinct from the favoured few who can get ESB facilities.</P>
    <P>The ESB, on the other hand, can use any payments which they receive from customers to hire purchase accounts, in the first instance, and this is what they do.  If a customer is in arrear, if a customer is unable to pay the full account, the ESB in the first instance use any money received by them towards payment of the hire purchase instalments.  That puts the customer in trouble as regards electricity supply because the customer is then in arrear with payment of electricity charges for electricity supply and the ESB disconnects the supply.  That is the main weapon the ESB have and the greatest advantage they have in relation to hire purchase.  That gives them far greater security for any advances they may make because they can disconnect the electricity supply.  It is a far better weapon than any available to any other hire purchase concern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> This is why I plead with the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that if the ESB are going to make hire purchase facilities available for the purchase of electrical equipment, they should be available to all suppliers of electrical equipment indiscriminately; not just to the exclusive electrical contractor but to all hardware merchants.  This is unfair trading. It would not be proper for me to open up a discussion at the moment on the Fair Trade Commission but it is no answer to my criticism to say: &ldquo;Go to the Fair Trade Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not saying anything that is not unknown when I say that there is serious complaint about the Fair Trade Commission and that probably there will be substantial changes in the Commission, or part of it.  I hope there will be.  In the meantime, the Fair Trade Commission say that they do not regard this as unfair.  That is irrelevant.  It has given unfair preference to certain favoured contractors, a preference which is not available to the general hardware trade.  Without the goodwill of the hardware trade in general, the ESB in the long run will be the losers.</P>
    <P>The strange thing is that the ESB have made some of these hire purchase facilities and finances available to some fly-by-night merchants who go around knocking on doors selling people second and third fridges when they already have one.  Some members might be amazed that that should occur but it occurs for this reason.  The first fridge is &ldquo;hocked&rdquo; or sold and the second fridge is &ldquo;hocked&rdquo; or sold, and the person takes on a third.  This is done not for the purpose of having a fridge but for the purpose of having an article which they can resell.  It may well be criminal to sell goods which are subject to hire purchase contracts but unfortunately this has occurred. The weird situation arises that ESB finance is made available to oil that kind of unsavoury transaction and it is refused to reputable hardware merchants in the city and, I suspect, throughout the land.  I would urge the Minister to ensure that steps will be taken to make the ESB finances available <Col N="209" /> for the purchase of all electrical equipment.</P>
    <P>May I make a plea in regard to electrical equipment?  I hope I will not be silenced on the ground that this is the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and not the Minister for Transport and Power.  I wish to refer to electric plugs and plug sockets.  We have a multitude of designs in this country, but the extraordinary thing is that, as the number of designs increases, the quality appears to decrease.  Some of the best on the market are of Irish manufacture, but the ESB have specified in some housing schemes plugs and sockets which are not manufactured here, which are extremely light and which, with average use, are certain to break at least once in 12 months, imposing serious costs on householders.  This type is also one of the dearest on the market.  The situation operates in Dublin that the dearest plugs and sockets are to be found in Corporation houses because the ESB require them.  Therefore, when breakages occur, the people with means smaller than other sections are required to replace with the most expensive type of plug.</P>
    <P>I know this is a complex problem which is not peculiar to this country, but efforts are being made elsewhere to have a uniform plug and socket.  I would urge the Department, with the ESB, to enter into these discussions and to ensure we would have in our time a uniform and satisfactory type of plug, socket and bulb holder.  Certainly the present situation is unfair to electricity users.</P>
    <P>That is one aspect of it.  The other aspect is this.  As a result of the many defective plugs and sockets on the market, there are people using unsafe electrical equipment which is likely to cause serious injury or perhaps endanger life.  There is an obligation on the ESB to clear up the mess existing in relation to plugs and sockets.  As a matter of law, the ESB have no responsibility for the behaviour of electricity, once they bring it to the meter.  If it causes an explosion after that, the ESB have no responsibility.  But that is simply not good enough.  We need to have a greater appreciation on the <Col N="210" /> part of the ESB of their responsibility in this regard.  We would hope therefore that the day is not too far distant when we will have a uniform satisfactory type of plug, socket and bulb holder.</P>
    <P>I would also like to make another plea to the Minister to use his good offices with the ESB to ensure that their salesmanship in relation to electrical equipment does not go ahead of the electricity supply.  It is a very common experience in Dublin to find the supply unsatisfactory and below the requirements of the neighbourhood. The result is that many people who put in 100 watt or 150 watt bulbs get an output equivalent only to 50 watts or 75 watts.  It is a very frequent experience in some suburbs to find in the winter at certain times of the evening, that the television screen is unsatisfactory because the electric power in the area is below what it is supposed to be. The result is that people are obliged to put boosters and other expensive equipment on their sets.  Invariably when complaint is made to the ESB, the reason is given that it is because of an increase in the use of electrical equipment in the area and that the substations provided are not sufficient to meet the demand.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the ESB are primarily responsible for the increased demand.  They spend hundreds of thousands annually on the promotion of increased sales of electrical equipment. If they do this, they have a clear obligation to anticipate the increased demand and provide for it.  It may be said that it is difficult to identify any area where sales of equipment will increase demand because it is spread over large areas.  That certainly does not apply down the country, where local demand is created by local campaigns. It does not apply in an area like Ballyfermot where the ESB set up a local office some years ago and embarked on an immense local campaign supported by door-to-door salesmen for the sale of electrical equipment.  The result was an immense boost to the amount of electrical equipment used, fridges, irons, televisions, heaters and what have you.  Ever since, the ESB have been unable to catch up with the <Col N="211" /> increased demand they themselves created.</P>
    <P>This is far less than fair.  We are told by the ESB, as though it were sufficient justification, that people are not paying for electricity if they do not get it, because the meter will not go around at the same rate if the supply is not up to standard.  I have not got sufficient technical knowledge to know whether they are right or not in that; but it is no answer.  The people want electricity.  If they have a 100 watt bulb, they want to get an output of 100 watts from it.  If they have equipment, they want to be sure it will work satisfactorily.  There is a clear obligation on the ESB to anticipate demand and provide for it.</P>
    <P>I join with several Deputies who complained about unsatisfactory signposting. I have had occasion to spend three very happy holidays in Wexford, but I am appalled by the grossly unsatisfactory signposting there.  Signposting is primarily for the benefit of strangers.  I would urge the county managers and tourist officials to go around with their eyes open, to pause at every crossroads they come to and to consider whether a stranger would know where the roads were leading to. On the south coast in Wexford there are two very fine bays&mdash;Blackwall is one of them and I cannot remember the other at the moment&mdash;where thousands of people would love to rest and swim.  But there is no signpost at all to give the stranger any indication where these two beautiful strands are.</P>
    <P>In Wexford this summer I noticed that seven cars out of every ten bore foreign registrations.  With the car ferry between Rosslare and Fishguard, you have cars arriving in Rosslare by the hundred every day.  Many of them, as I say, will be from another shore.  It is not satisfactory, to say the least, that such people will leave Wexford and go elsewhere when they have some very fine strands within a few miles of where they disembark.  Those foolish enough to assume that the strands they see on their maps might be signposted will spend many a weary hour trying to find out where they are.  It is extraordinary <Col N="212" /> that the natives in some of these places appear to be as ignorant as to the location of their amenities as strangers, or perhaps I should say they are not helpful, because familiarity does not open the eyes of people. Sometimes the native might well know how to get to a particular place, but he is the worst possible guide, because he knows out of a kind of natural sense, without even thinking, but the stranger has to look out for landmarks and the landmarks are not always available to the minds of the local people.  Therefore we cannot spend too much money in improving the signposting of our country in general and, as I say, of County Wexford in particular, and I would hope there would be a vast improvement in County Wexford in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The position is bad enough as it stands, but with the new ferry between Continental Europe and Rosslare, it will become even more difficult in the future.  If there is a need there already, the need will be very much greater in the not too distant future when cars will be coming through from France, Germany and Italy to the Irish shores. These people will expect that the fine strands of County Wexford and other points of local interest and of beauty will be identified to them with sign-posts, and our old, casual, sloppy ways simply will not do.  People who will come that distance will come to Ireland for the miles and miles of beaches with nobody on them which have been advertised.  Presumably when they were being advertised, nobody said one of the reasons nobody is on them is that it rains so much. However, the beautiful strands that are displayed in our advertising material will invite people here to come and see them and it would be a tragic thing if they were to pass by many of them without knowing they are there.  That is what I am sure will happen in County Wexford and other places unless the roads are better signposted.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that the main roads and the roads off them are fairly well signposted; you can certainly get off the main roads to other places, but it is once you go to these very remote places that you need <Col N="213" /> the signposting more than on the main roads.  At least on the main road, there is a chance that there will be some other motorist, pedestrian or cyclist coming along within a matter of minutes, but when you go on to the outlying areas, it becomes more and more difficult to get assistance from local guides.</P>
    <P>The Minister, most unfairly, in his statement sought to blame workers for some of the losses of CIE and other companies in recent times.  He blamed them on strikes.  I wish to remind the Minister and the House that many so-called strikes in recent times have not been strikes; they have been lock-outs. The two cases which the Minister identified as strikes in his speech were not strikes and do not let us confuse the word &ldquo;strike&rdquo;.  A strike is a withholding of labour, and these interruptions in CIE were due to the company locking men out.  The result was the losses which I think the Minister said were over £600,000, and another result was untold hardship on tens of thousands of people who were obliged to walk rather than use public transport.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that the people who were responsible for locking out the workers of CIE should be dismissed.  The management of CIE who are responsible, on the Minister's own admission, for a loss of £600,000, should be dismissed.  That is the taxpayers' money they threw away.  It is no answer to say that the lock-out occurred because the management would not allow the men to say at what hours they would present themselves for work or allow some of the workers to say they would not work on one day a week.  It would have been far better to operate transport services on six days out of seven than not to operate them at all.</P>
    <P>The decision to lock them out, the decision to withdraw the transport service completely from the people was a decision of the Board of CIE, entirely supported by the Minister for Transport and Power.  Not only should the management of CIE go but the Minister should go, too.  He has confessed here to being responsible for the loss of <Col N="214" /> over £600,000.  It is quite clear from the figures quoted by the Minister that if these services were operated on six days a week there would not have been any more than £100,000 lost on the one day.  It is a tremendous admission of responsibility here for costing the tax-payer that vast sum of money, not only that but also many painful feet and many hours of hardship which were avoidable if only there had been some degree of sanity and some proper industrial relations in CIE.</P>
    <P>I want to commend the provision of farmhouse holidays.  This has been a wonderful idea.  We have had too much interest in grade A accommodation and too little interest in the kind of accommodation that ordinary people want. The people who will bring their cars here from the Continent or from Britain to Ireland will not be looking for grade A accommodation.  They will be people who will be staying a night here or two or three nights there, and the kind of accommodation which these people are looking for is homely, pleasant accommodation, the kind they will be able to get in farmhouses.</P>
    <P>If I may go back to County Wexford again.  There is a great interest in providing this type of accommodation there.  One cannot travel any distance without seeing a bed and breakfast sign outside.  I saw two such houses which were not completed by the contractors but still had the bed and breakfast sign outside.  I was talking to some of these people and they said they had not a bed vacant at any time.  That is the kind of accommodation that gets money spent here, and I think that was said by other speakers.  The people who will be coming here will be spreading the money around because they will stop here and there for a few nights. They will want their bed and breakfast and will then go to the local shops for their provisions.  They cook their meals by the roadside or go into hotels and restaurants on the way.  There is a very small capital investment involved in this kind of accommodation on the part of the State.  It is the kind of sensible family approach which will provide new wealth for our people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> There is the danger that we would have thought that such improvements as have occurred in our holiday traffic are due to Bord Fáilte or to the Minister for Transport and Power.  I am not decrying their efforts.  What they have done has been good and we need more tourist promotion.  It is interesting to note that in the average of increased tourism in Europe in the past five years, we are second from the bottom.  The major part of what we have managed to get is simply evidence of the general development of tourism in the world.  There are far more people travelling further than ever before.  We all know that from our own experience. There are more people from Ireland going abroad than ever went before. The horizons of the world are disappearing because we can see over them, and Ireland could not fail to soak up some of this increased tourism. The fact that we have such emphasises immediately the physical obligations on us to provide the facilities so that we can take the tourists when they come.  Anything done in that regard is good but I think we have no reason to feel smug about what we have achieved.  We need to do a great deal more if we are to do no more than come up to the average of increased tourism in Europe.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the credit, indeed, for such increase as we have had must go to Aer Lingus and it would be only proper that we should voice our unqualified praise of all that Aer Lingus is doing, not only in relation to promotion of traffic for itself but also for the improvement of the image of Ireland abroad.  It must, however, cause us considerable concern that the ownership of Aer Lingus is moving away from Irish hands into the hands of foreigners.  The Government have told Aer Lingus that they will not allow Aer Lingus to seek money on the Irish market.  We know that Aer Lingus is thought very highly of by the Irish people.  We know that Aer Lingus is a success.  We know also that there is more capital available in this country than we are using.  We know that we have hundreds of millions of our money invested abroad because of lack of opportunity to use it here.  It <Col N="216" /> is indefensible to prevent Aer Lingus from getting money on the Irish money market.  The money is there and Aer Lingus should be given the opportunity of getting it.</P>
    <P>What is happening at the moment is that Aer Lingus is being forced to go to New York, Zurich and elsewhere to get money for the purchase of new planes.  Nominally, of course, the money will be borrowed by Aer Lingus and Aer Lingus will be indebted to the people who lend the money but the people who lend the money will have a lien on the planes.  That will be their security and until such time as Aer Lingus pays every penny or every cent of what is borrowed, these planes will remain the property of whoever lends the money.  That is very bad.  But, Aer Lingus will not borrow the money on charity.  That will not do.  Those who lend the money will only lend it because they are satisfied that Aer Lingus is a paying proposition.  They will be satisfied that Aer Lingus is a solvent company.  They will be satisfied that Aer Lingus not only can borrow the money but can repay it with substantial interest.</P>
    <P>That means that the enterprise of Ireland, the skill of the men in Aer Lingus which has gone into the building up of Aer Lingus, which is operating Aer Lingus, will be making money, not for Ireland, but for the foreigners who lend the money to Aer Lingus.  That is clearly bad.  This is bad economics.  We will not have the benefit of the interest which would be earned by this capital investment.  Instead, we are allowing somebody else to invest their money in Ireland so that we can pay them back their money with interest and the interest, of course, will represent the brains, brawn and skill of Irish people using their money.  Admittedly, if they lend their money, these people are entitled to their profit, their interest, but we say it is wrong that we should oblige a company like Aer Lingus to stay off the Irish money market, to keep away, to seek their money elsewhere.  No doubt, the argument for this is that Aer Lingus, if they came on the market, would get the money and by getting the money here at home would, perhaps, undermine a <Col N="217" /> national loan or the ESB or somebody else in looking for money for other projects here.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, we in Fine Gael are satisfied that there is sufficient money available in this country to finance all these things and more and that when there is a worthwhile investment such as an investment in Aer Lingus then it is on the Irish money market that Aer Lingus should be looking for that money.  That is where they want to look for the money.  That is where they should be allowed to look for it.  I would hope for a change of heart on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Mullen of the Labour Party was not quite right when he was dealing with the leasing of Irish planes during the winter months to South America and other foreign countries.  Our planes do certainly go abroad in the winter months.  It is a good thing that they do because they are very costly items and it is only by using a plane to its full capacity that you will be able to repay what you borrowed to buy it and build up sufficient money to replace it.  But, as I understand it, Aer Lingus is sending its planes abroad but with the planes Aer Lingus also sends Irish pilots, Irish crews and Irish maintenance staff to look after the planes while they are flying in foreign countries.  This is an excellent operation and Aer Lingus should be congratulated on their enterprise in this regard.  It is essential.  In fact, it is the only proper use of this equipment.  As I say, it is not only the equipment but also the staff.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen expressed a fear, which it would be proper now to quash, that the planes might be overused. There is no risk whatsoever in this regard.  As I understand it, and I am perfectly satisfied about it, the manufacturers of these planes have a very rigid programme and Aer Lingus not only sticks to the programme of examination and stripping down recommended by the manufacturers but, in fact, exceeds the safety precautions specified by the manufacturers of these planes.  Not only are the planes properly maintained when they are away from our own shores but <Col N="218" /> when they come back they are stripped down and re-built from the ground up. It would not be proper that there should be any notion as a result of anything said here that Aer Lingus is taking risks with its planes during the off-season period.  Far from it.  The planes are maintained in the peak of condition and perhaps all the better for being kept in use and, certainly, the crews are all the better for being used.</P>
    <P>The fact that I have not referred to other matters that the Minister has referred to is not to be taken as showing lack of concern for them but rather the consciousness that many of my colleagues have other matters which they wish to discuss on this very important Estimate.  One of the most important Estimates that come before this Dáil is the Estimate for Transport and Power.  It affects us intimately every moment of the day and it is on that account, as said earlier, that I make no apology for dealing with some minute matters which may seem beneath the sophisticated intelligence of the Minister.  This is the only opportunity we get to deal with the day-to-day operations and we can only hope that whatever we say on this occasion will percolate through to the right quarters and be considered and bring about benefit as a result.</P>

      <P>On 14th June last I asked the Minister a question which showed that at that time I had some apprehension about the future of transatlantic liner traffic in Cork Harbour. The Parliamentary Secretary replied to me.  While his answer was not unduly optimistic, it indicated to me that there was a certain amount of complacency about the future of transatlantic liner traffic in Cork Harbour.  This, of course, was completely in the teeth of certain references which had been made about a fortnight before here in Dublin at the meeting of the Seamen's Union where the future of the transatlantic liner traffic was gravely in doubt.  That is about six months ago, or a little less, and I would like the Minister at this stage, if at all possible, to state his views now on the future of transatlantic liner traffic in the Port of Cork having regard to the fact that in <Col N="219" /> the short interval between the date of my question and now, the Cunard Line have removed three of the liners which were using the Port of Cork.</P>
      <P>This is a grave matter for all those who are interested in the future of the Port of Cork.  The liner traffic is a major industry, giving much employment, and if it is to disappear, the Minister should be required to take full cognisance of the effects which its disappearance will have, not alone in the immediate environs of the Port but further up the river.  What will happen to the tender service if the liner traffic is so cut down that it has to be operated at a loss?  Will the Central Fund come to the aid of the Cork Harbour Commissioners in this eventuality? What will happen to those employed on the tenders and to the many other people employed in servicing the liners?  I would ask the Minister to deal with these questions now when his Estimate is before the House.  This is the one opportunity we have to hear his views on these matters.</P>
      <P>I would ask him to take this matter seriously and to make himself acquainted with the dilemma in which the Port of Cork will find itself if the liner traffic ceases.  We all know that over the past number of years, many millions of pounds have been poured into Shannon to keep the transatlantic air link going.  I have no objection to that but I feel that Cobh has been by-passed and overlooked by the tourist authorities and by the Minister's Department.  Very many people do not know that a transatlantic liner link exists between America and Ireland.  I can understand that because it would be for the benefit of the country that travellers should be deflected to Irish planes.  However, there is quite a volume of people who prefer to use the older method of transatlantic travel, and if the transatlantic link with Cobh is to continue, Bord Fáilte should pay more attention to publicising the fact that it is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the occasion on which I referred to this matter by way of question, the Parliamentary Secretary was quite complacent. <Col N="220" /> On that occasion, on 14th June, at column 443 of volume 229, the Parliamentary Secretary, having informed the House that about 67 liner calls were expected in Cobh this year, went on to say:</P>
    <P>In addition, there are proposals for a terminal to cater for a new passenger-car ferry service to a Continental port. </P>
    <P>I understood from this answer by the Parliamentary Secretary that these proposals were genuine and that a car ferry service would be put into operation. So did everybody else in Cork, including the Cork Harbour Commissioners. This is the time for the Minister to explain in the fullest possible detail what has happened to the proposal for a Continental ferry service to Cork Harbour, why it was deflected from Cork and ended up in Rosslare with almost indecent haste.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if, in our efforts to attract tourists here, we are in danger of turning this island of ours into a vast Blackpool.  We seem to be inclined to denude our country of something that other countries have not got, the unspoiled beauty of its scenery and the generosity and kindness of its people. There is a danger that this country will end up like the other tourist countries and woe to our tourist traffic if that should happen.  If that does happen, tourists will not come here; they will go to other countries where they can get the same thing with less travel and at less cost.  I would emphasise the importance of maintaining that certain something which was given to us by God and by nature and which we are in grave danger of destroying.</P>
    <P>I have heard many Americans complain that our hotels are so like their hotels at home.  They like the central heating but not the rest.  They expect to find something more Irish in our hotels.  We are also pricing ourselves out of the tourist trade.  The Minister said that there were some complaints and that there were some black sheep but I would say that there are black sheep all over the country who are mulcting the tourists shamefully and shamelessly.  I have had complaints regarding this from tourist after tourist <Col N="221" /> from across the Channel who told me that they could have gone to Spain or to Italy at the same price or at less than it cost them to come here.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what the Minister had to say about oil pollution at Whiddy Island.  I am glad to see that he and his Department are fully alive to the dangers involved in bringing Gulf Oil into Whiddy, but I would like some further details.  On 9th November, the Minister said that he had gone most carefully into all aspects of the anti-pollution measures and that he was satisfied that every possible step had been taken to eliminate insofar as was humanly possible the risk of pollution at Bantry.  Could the Minister explain further what he means by &ldquo;every possible step&rdquo;.  We all remember the effect of the wrecking of the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> and at Whiddy, we will be dealin with three <i>Torrey Canyons</i> rolled into one from the point of view of size, capacity and everything else.  The whole west and south-west coast of Ireland must live continually under the shadow of the danger inherent in attracting such large vessels with such dangerous cargoes to our shores.  I often wonder if we had had the <i>Torry Canyon</i> disaster before we entered into these negotiations with the Gulf Oil people, would we really have thought the risk worthwhile?</P>
    <P>There is not much point in crying over spilt milk, but we should worry about spilt oil.  It is all very well to say we are investigating the question of legal liability for damage done in the event of a disaster similar to that which overtook the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> but no money could ever recompense for the damage which would be done in the event of a disaster at Whiddy Island.  Our coastline would be destroyed for years, and years, and years.</P>
    <P>In this age in which we seem to think more about tourists than we do about the mere native, it is good to remember that the coastline of our country in the south and south-west provides for the ordinary man and woman amenities which he and she cannot get anywhere else.  It is not much good talking to these people <Col N="222" /> afterwards and saying: &ldquo;We will try to compensate you in some way,&rdquo; because, obviously, no scheme of dealing with liability would take into consideration at all the loss which these people would suffer by way of amenity.  Not alone that, but any such disaster would affect in a grave way our fishing industry, our tourist industry and the general amenities available to those who swim, or sail, or carry our the kind of aquatic pastimes which they enjoy simply because the good God gave us a clean ocean.  I would ask the Minister to be more precise, when he comes to reply, in relation to the details and the manner in which this matter is being approached.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that, since the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> case, there has been a great deal of research and development in the field of anti-pollution measures and he expressed his concern &mdash;I appreciate it&mdash;to ensure that we have available to us the most up-to-date techniques for tackling the problem, should we ever find ourselves faced with it.  Could the Minister give us any idea of what precisely the expenditure involved in this is likely to be?  It is due to us, I think, that we should get some figures.</P>
    <P>I should be glad, too, if the Minister would give some more details as to the discussions or findings of the Inter-Governmental Marine Consultative Organisation in relation to the highly important issue of the liability of the shipping owner to meet the cost of pollution generally.  It is very important that some bond should be given before any damage is done.  I should be glad to know if the Minister intends that shipping owners involved in this type of trade should deposit a bond so that their liabilities could be met subsequently in the same way as a business man acting as a commission agent for a company or a young man in insurance gives a bond to meet any subsequent damage he may cause his company.</P>
    <P>Last week I took up with the Minister something which is quite familiar to him because he has been in communication with the aggrieved party over a long period, the aggrieved party being the Cork Gas Consumers Company. <Col N="223" /> Last week I asked the Minister a question in regard to the manner in which the ESB, which is a State-sponsored and State-owned body enjoying certain prerequisites which no other business organisation enjoys, was entering into competition with other private enterprise concerns.  I asked him if he was aware that the Cork Gas Consumers Company issued a public statement criticising the ESB for offering appliances free, or at a reduced rate, to purchasers of electric cookers; and, if so, if he would comment on this statement.  The Minister did not think this was a bit unfair and he said at the end of his reply, that he was satisfied that, as in other countries, a healthy competition between gas and electricity helps to maintain efficiency in both services and reacts to the benefit of consumers.</P>
    <P>I would applaud to the utmost a healthy competition, but is there a fair and healthy competition in the case of an organisation like the Cork Gas Consumers Company and the ESB?  There is not.  The ESB have at their disposal large sums of State money which the Cork Gas Consumers Company have not.  Above all, the ESB enjoy an amenity which has been a cause of complete mystification to me and many others for a long number of years.  One can understand why in their growing pains years, the ESB were not made liable for rates on generating plant and stations.  Why this should survive to the present day is something I do not understand.  It is a complete anachronism that an organisation like the ESB can come along and erect a generating station on the side of the River Lee and not pay one brass farthing in rates in respect of that station.  Is that fair competition?  If the Minister thinks it is, then I should like him to explain why it is the ESB are given this amenity but it is denied to the Cork Gas Consumers Company.</P>
    <P>Again, today, I ask the Minister if he is aware that advertising and other promotional methods currently employed by the ESB are contrary to past ministerial undertakings that private enterprise need fear no competition from State-owned undertakings; and <Col N="224" /> whether he proposes to exercise appropriate corrective control in the interests of public policy.  The Minister did not answer the question.  He simply said he did not accept that the press advertising and promotional methods in any way contravened public policy.  Could the Minister explain to the House now why the ESB are allowed to enter into this competition, which is undoubtedly unfair in its nature?  The Minister is aware of one specific occasion on which the ESB advertised certain of their appliances unfairly by comparison with gas appliances and the Cork Gas Consumers Company were able to prove to the Minister and the ESB that what appeared as an advertisement from this State-sponsored body was not true.  I was sorry to learn from the Minister, as a result of a question I asked today, that the ESB have agreed to reduce the price of electric cookers to builders who purchase such cookers from the Board for installation in new houses.  I regard the Minister's answer as unsatisfactory. The ESB are quite obviously entering into unfair competition with an organisation established in Cork long before the ESB ever came there, both in relation to the offering of discounts to builders and in relation to the matter to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Whilst we are on the ESB, I should like to revert to something to which I have referred in the past.  It is something which disturbs some of the apprehensive sections of the community in the city I represent.  I want to refer to the presence, a few miles outside the city, of an extensive dam erected by the ESB.  On occasions, I have asked if the Minister could give some idea to the House and to the citizens of Cork of the precautions taken to ensure that damage will not occur by a cracking or an outright destruction of this dam.  It is all very well to say that such a thing will not happen.  I am sure the citizens of the town of Fréjus in the south of France would have said exactly the same thing the night before the dam there collapsed with such calamitous results to the town.  Is there a warning system for <Col N="225" /> the city?  I should be glad of details about ESB investigation of the fabric of the dam from time to time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan spoke about CIE bus stops.  I would draw attention to the manner in which CIE move bus stops on city services.  One might say that they have the right to do this and, to a certain extent, that is correct.  On the other hand, when a set of circumstances have grown up around a bus stop, I think CIE have a certain moral obligation in respect of the set of circumstances they have assisted to set up.</P>
    <P>People in the city of Cork purchased shops which were near bus stops because, commercially, it was a very good proposition.  Having paid exorbitant prices for these premises, they were not in occupation of them very long when CIE shifted the bus stop further up the same street.  Nobody yet knows why it was done.  We were informed it was CIE policy to set bus stops for city services in the widest portion of thoroughfares.  In the case I have in mind&mdash;there are many such cases&mdash;the bus stop was moved from the wider part of the Grand Parade to the narrower part of the Grand Parade.  It reduced the business of one man to practically nothing and it enormously boosted the business of the person outside whose shop it was resited. Therein lies the whole danger of the system about which I am talking. I am not alleging it happened on this occasion but there is always the danger that, for purposes other than the convenience of passengers&mdash;indeed, in the case of which I speak, the convenience of passengers seems not to have been served one way or the other&mdash;for the purpose, for instance, of boosting the business of some person, somebody in CIE would contrive to have a bus stop moved.  The indiscriminate movement of bus stops in Cork city has not alone affected shops of the nature I have described but has changed the whole business complex of streets.  If you move a bus stop from the end of one street junction to the beginning of another, it is bound to affect business.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to keep the House much longer.  I would impress on the Minister the equity of the claims of <Col N="226" /> CIE pensioners.  They are not very numerous.  They are very old.  They are quite depressed.  There has been an undue delay in dealing with their claims under the Transport Acts.  I shall be glad if the Minister, when he is replying to this debate, has some good news for these people who might well be classed as amongst the least of our brethren.  They have little money; they have little to look forward to.  The last days of their life should, in equity and law, be made happier by an announcement in this House by the Minister that he has made plans for the rest of their future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been so much reference on this Estimate to CIE, Bord na Móna, ESB, and so on, that I shall omit referring to them and confine myself to a few of the problems we face in North Mayo and in the west of Ireland generally.  Tourism plays a very important part in the economy of the west of Ireland and tourist traffic there has grown in recent years.  We feel, however, that Bord Fáilte are not giving the same attention, publicity and propaganda to Mayo as is given to some other parts of the country.  That is the view of hoteliers and owners of guest houses and other interests in the west of Ireland.  I agree with that view. I have some experience to justify my belief.  Prior to my last entry into this House, it was my job for a couple of years to travel through the province of Connacht to do business with hoteliers and that was the criticism one heard voiced.  I appeal to the Minister to get in touch with Bord Fáilte in regard to this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a particular problem in the province of Connacht.  Thousands of people there are leaving the land.  The holdings are small and the people are obliged to go to Britain.  Anything that would supplement the incomes of these smallholders would be of immense benefit.  A number of people share in prosperity at the present time, for example, in Achill where the farmer's holiday scheme has been progressing reasonably well, but not to the extent which I should like to see.  There are many other places in County Mayo besides Achill, places such as Pontoon, <Col N="227" /> Foxford, which is near my own home town, Ballina, with Loch Conn quite convenient to it, Lough Cullin and other lakes where there is coarse fishing and salmon and trout fishing and shooting.  A considerable amount of development could be achieved there if we got the necessary publicity and the necessary facilities.</P>
    <P>At column 2219 of the Official Report, Volume 230, No. 14, the Minister had this to say:</P>
    <P>In the twelve western counties, grants of up to 35 per cent of the total construction cost of new hotels are being provided; in other remote areas the grant will continue to be limited to 25 per cent of the total construction costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister developed the point that certain moneys are being made available to help people to provide accommodation for tourists.  It should be borne in mind that it was quite impossible for the majority of people to get any money from the banks in the past couple of years because of the credit squeeze.  If one succeeded in getting money, it was a very small amount indeed, unless you were very credit-worthy. In the main, people were not able to avail of the benefits which would flow from this rather generous offer of assistance in regard to providing guesthouse and hotel accommodation. If the Minister could increase the grants, it would be appreciated in the West where it would be a great help.  Anything that would help to supplement the meagre incomes of smallholders would be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to remember that we have a special problem in the West.  The Minister is aware of the activities of that great priest in Donegal, Father McDyer, who is trying to get small farmers to engage in vegetable growing and so forth.  He has also &ldquo;plugged&rdquo; this farmhouse holiday idea in my part of the country and in my parish, and some people are now availing of it, but this limitation of capital is one of the great problems in regard to providing facilities and amenities in these farmhouses.  The Minister should try to devise some way <Col N="228" /> of giving us special consideration in that part of the country.  People are doing their best to retain their smallholdings but they are having an uphill fight.</P>
    <P>In regard to Bord na Móna, we feel that we should have a briquette factory in North Mayo, in the Erris region. There is a vast area of bog stretching from Crossmolina to Belmullet and people in that part feel that the bog should be developed for the manufacture of peat briquettes.  In our three county institutions, the county hospital, the mental hospital and the district hospital, we are now using peat briquettes which are brought in from Edenderry or somewhere in the midlands. We think it unfair that Bord na Móna should have turned us down so far in regard to this proposal for a briquette factory.  They argue that it could not be justified on economic grounds.  If we are to think in terms of economics so far as some parts of the west are concerned, I am afraid we will never get anywhere.  Many schemes have to be subsidised&mdash;CIE have to be subsidised&mdash;and I see no reason why Bord na Móna could not run this factory economically, or at least break fairly even with it.  It would provide employment in the area. The sale of briquettes in my county has gone up by leaps and bounds.</P>
    <P>We have had a lot of criticism of CIE, some of it justified and some of it what I would describe as exaggeration. I have had a lot of dealings with CIE as they carried a lot of goods for me and one criticism I had of the company was in regard to the danger of strikes, particularly when perishable goods were involved.  That was the one fear we had in regard to commodities like eggs or fowl going by rail, the danger that there might be a strike and the goods might become rotten and rendered useless.  Down through the years, the uncertainty of the labour position in CIE seems to have been a factor which lost a lot of business to the company.  Today nearly all the big companies in Dublin, Cork, and Galway transport their own goods.  I was forced into that position.  As a small private businessman, I felt I could not take the risk involved.  That <Col N="229" /> was over 20 years ago but since then, many have followed in my footsteps and have taken their business from CIE because they felt the risk was too great.</P>
    <P>I know people who were put out of business, because during a time of strikes, their goods went to rotten in the CIE sheds.  When people hear of these things, they are not inclined to take the risk.  I would ask the Minister to use his good offices, through the Minister for Labour, to see that these strikes will not occur, particularly when the tourist reason is in full swing, because then they have very serious effects on the economy and cause a lot of inconvenience. If these strikes could be avoided, it would be a good thing for the company.</P>
    <P>The fact that we must subsidise CIE is a topic which is a hardy annual.  The bill is growing every year and it is likely to grow further with the introduction of school transport.  This is a very welcome provision and it has proved a great boon to young children in the country.  Now one sees children being brought to and from school in wet weather and arriving at their destination quite dry.  Parents welcome the introduction of this scheme very much. If we are to have things like this, we must pay for them as CIE cannot put on services and not have the money to pay for them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I appeal again to the Minister to ensure that we get more tourist publicity for the West and I again renew my appeal for a briquette factory somewhere in the Erris region as it would be a great boon to the area.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> May I be permitted, Sir, to say how pleased I am to have the opportunity of addressing you as Leas-Cheann Comhairle of this House and to congratulate you on your election?  I am convinced that election will give universal satisfaction to all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate has been debated for some time and many points have been covered.  I feel, however, I would be lacking in my duty if I did not refer to one aspect of the Minister's Department about which I feel very strongly. It is rural electrification, with particular <Col N="230" /> reference to the special charges which have been made and are being made to people who either reside in isolated pockets or whose forebears failed to connect with the ESB network.  I appeal earnestly and sincerely to the Minister to decide at once to give these people a supply of current.  I have experience in my own constituency, as I am sure every other rural Deputy has, of people applying for a supply being asked to pay a special bi-monthly charge of up to £5 or £6 instead of 15/-, £1 or 30/-.  That is tantamount to saying to these people: &ldquo;We will not give you a supply of electric current.&rdquo; It seems to be penalising them.  Many of them are refused on the excuse that when the area was canvassed some years ago, those households refused to accept a supply.  The ESB seem to forget that when these households were canvassed originally, the head of the household was perhaps an elderly person who had not come to accept electric light and electric appliances as a way of life.  They seem to overlook that in these houses now there are young married couples bringing up families and that these people want electric light and all the other amenities electricity can provide.</P>
    <P>These people are being asked to pay a special charge of perhaps £30 a year. The Minister, or anybody in touch with these people, knows they cannot afford such a charge.  To ask them to pay it is tantamount to refusing them a supply and to classifying them in the eyes of their neighbours as second- or third-class citizens.  It is a cause of frustration to teenagers living in these households.  I am convinced it is the cause of many of these young people deciding there is no future for them in this country, and if they are to have these amenities, the only place they can earn enough to enjoy them is in the cities of Great Britain.  I do not think I am exaggerating or being far-fetched when I say that is so.  These young people find themselves condemned to live in houses without electric light and from 4.30 in the evening, to move through farmyards in darkness. At the same time, they see their neighbours on the main roads and in the towns enjoying all the facilities <Col N="231" /> electricity can provide.  They are bound to become frustrated and to feel they are being classed as inferior to their neighbours or other people in the localities.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Estimate that £2 million is being provided under this heading, an increase of £705,000.  I wonder how much it would take to do the decent thing and give these people a supply at a reasonable charge?  I do not think it would take all that much, and it should be done.  I know the Minister and the ESB will state that these people can get grants of £10 per household for bottled gas; but it is obvious from the Minister's Estimate that they are not interested in bottled gas and that this grant is not being availed of.  In the Estimate last year, a sum of £2,000 was provided and £2,000 has been provided this year.  If my mathematics are correct, that will give only about 200 grants over the entire country.  I wonder how many people are availing of these grants?  I would say they are few and far between.</P>
    <P>When you look at an Estimate that amounts to £8,932,000, I do not think it is asking too much of the Minister and the Government to meet these people.  They are people being neglected in more ways than one.  They have to pay rates on their houses, and some of them on their lands, although their means of access to these households is deplorable and although they may live on lanes serving five or six people.  I know the Minister is not responsible for the condition of these lanes, and I am not charging him under that heading.  What I am saying is that taking that into account, and taking into account that these people are not provided with what is now not a luxury but an ordinary bare necessary of life, electric current, it is difficult to see how they can be expected to reside there at all.  If the Government have decided they are not going to do anything for these people, that they are going to let them live with their water-logged lanes, dimly lit households and dark farmyards, that is all right, but I do not think it is good enough.</P>
    <P>Recently, the rural electrification <Col N="232" /> section of the ESB celebrated their 21st birthday.  We would like to congratulate them on that joyous event.  But, now that it has come of age, they should do the big thing and clean up this small pocket of very deserving people&mdash;the people in isolated pockets who have not got electric light and who are being treated in a vindictive manner, the people whose aged fathers in the country refused current a few years ago, and are being told now: &ldquo;You would not take it when you were getting it and you will have to wait until such time as we get around to it again.&rdquo;  I do not think that is fair, and I am convinced that not one solitary Member of this House would object to voting whatever extra money would be necessary to do what I request should be done.</P>
    <P>I could go on indefinitely on those lines.  I do not think it necessary to elaborate the case any further.  It must be conceded that the people who want electric light and are compelled to live without it or to accept it on terms they cannot afford have a grievance.  Nobody can deny that and, as I have said already, I do not think any Member of this House would begrudge the extra money that is necessary.  I am glad to see from the Minister's speech that he is having further inquiries made into this with a view to doing something about it.  He does not hold out any immediate hope or give any definite promise, but if he has the approval of all sides of the House and of all rural Deputies for providing the money, it should be an encouragement to him and should arm him, so to speak, to get on with the job.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that this complaint which I am making is a cause of people leaving rural Ireland, and of young people leaving Ireland.  We should approach the problem with that in mind and we should not be niggardly about providing the wants of these people.  I know other Deputies have made the plea I am making now, and I am making it in the constant hope that by continually hammering at this point, we shall get the ESB and the Minister to come around to our way of thinking and do what we ask.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> The other points I want to make are a few miscellaneous items I have jotted down.  There is the question of CIE pensions.  A State-sponsored body that requires people to retire at 65 years of age and gives them the pensions that CIE pensioners are getting is showing a bad example.  I do not know how these people can be expected, after 40 years, to live on a pension as low as £1 a week.  While the old age pension amounts to 57/6d a week, these people are given a pension as low as £1.  Contributory pensions, of course, are much more.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> They are very badly off, and it is a reflection on CIE and the Department of Transport and Power and its Minister that they are not treated better.</P>
      <P>I know that the CIE losses come to £2? million, or about £390,000 more than the annual subsidy.  I wonder is that the total loss incurred by CIE, if we approach that loss on an economic basis, if we approach it on the basis of the amount it would take to run a private concern.  I understand that CIE road transport enjoys a very generous concession in not having to pay excise duty on diesel.  I understand it pays none, but if it pays any at all, it is certainly at a very reduced rate. I understand that the diesel used in CIE buses&mdash;I intend to put down a question about this&mdash;costs much less than the diesel purchased by the competitors of CIE operating under private enterprise.  If what I am saying is not correct, I am sure the Minister will clarify the position when he is replying, but my information is that that is so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I shall probe that further later on.  I was of the opinion that CIE buses and coaches enjoyed a concession.  As I say, I intend to probe that further, but perhaps when the Minister is replying, he would clarify the position for me and I might not have to do anything further about it.  The Minister says that CIE had a record year for coach tours. The Minister knows that in some respects, at any rate, CIE cannot stand up to private enterprise in the provision of coach tours.  I know of one case where a subsidiary of the Minister's Department was prepared to employ a private coach to operate these tours because the private individual was providing a better coach than CIE could provide, was giving a better service, but through the instrumentality of the Minister's Department, he was prohibited from supplying a coach and CIE took over.</P>
      <P>One point about Aer Lingus was brought to my attention, that, while, for example, some planes flying Irish people out of Dublin on a Sunday morning to Continental centres, supply Irish Sunday newspapers to the travellers, although, I suppose, the travellers could quite easily get them in Dublin, the same plane coming back often does not have a supply of Irish Sunday newspapers on board although it is bringing back a flight of Irish people who have been out of the country for, say, two weeks who would like very much to have an Irish Sunday newspaper to read on the way back.  That is not a very serious complaint but if it is brought to the attention of those concerned, something might be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the supply of papers is distributed on the way out as, indeed, is the supply of Irish whiskey, <i>et cetera.</i> I have been told that a situation can arise where there is not a supply of Irish whiskey available for service to <Col N="235" /> the passengers for consumption on the way home.  Again, these are only small points, not very serious, but this is the time to deal with them.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister feels very strongly that he is doing a very good job on the question of tourists and the provision of hotels.  I, like other Deputies who have spoken in the debate, feel that we are providing too many high price hotels, too many hotels that provide for people in the higher income group.  It is conceded by all sides of this House that the main body of our tourists trade comes from the working people of Great Britain. I do not know the percentage of our tourist trade that is drawn from that section but it must be very high.  More should be done to encourage the more reasonable price hotels and guesthouses. A complaint I hear from people who seek to avail of the grants and other facilities provided by Bord Fáilte is that if you bring them on your house, you have to do far too much.  I am not advocating that standards should be reduced to an unreasonable level but I do think that standards should not be unnecessarily high and should not be prohibitively high.  That is the complaint I hear from people who are thinking of reconstructing or making additions to small hotels and guesthouses that if you apply to Bord Fáilte, you are asked to do far too much.</P>
    <P>These are all the points I wish to make and I do not want to detain the House any longer.  What I got up to speak about was this question of rural electrification in which I am passionately interested.  If this debate went on for the next week and if every one of the 144 Deputies made the same case and hammered at it and if as a result something was done for these people, the time of the House would not have been wasted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, repetition is no harm at times.  For a number of years on the Estimate for Transport and Power, I have said that it would be much more beneficial for this country to look to the east instead of to the <Col N="236" /> west.  The tourist potential for this country must come from Great Britain. I find from the Estimate that we are spending over a quarter of a million pounds in North America on advertising, publicity and office equipment.  I wonder does the return we get justify that expenditure?  Let me say at this stage that we always welcome Americans to this country but are they the tourist potential that we would expect? My experience of Americans is that they take in Ireland on a European tour.  They see Killarney, but some things at the dutyfree shop at Shannon, possibly spend a night or two in luxury hotels in Dublin, but after that are of no financial or economic value to the country.  Whereas, when a tourist from Britain comes to Ireland, he spends his entire holiday were and spends what he has budgeted for during the year on his holiday.  We know exactly what he is worth to us.</P>
      <P>I see that last year we spent in Britain the sum of £204,000 odd on advertising&mdash;£20,000 less than we have spent in America.  We should cut out all this codology about tourists from the United States of America.  We have appointed six new managers to Bord Fáilte in addition to ten we have already at home and eight abroad. What benefit are we getting from this tourist publicity drive in the United States?  I fail to see it.  I fail to see it making any impact in my county which is a tourist county with the exception of emigrants who return for an annual holiday with us.  We see none of these American plutocrats who are entertained in the various luxury hotels in Dublin.  In Donegal, Mayo and other counties, with the exception, possibly, of Kerry, they are of no tourist benefit to us at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see a breakdown of the £65 million approximately which we are alleged to procure from tourism.  I notice that it is alleged that a sum of £12.1 million is derived from tourists visiting relatives. Where does this figure come from? Take the Border counties&mdash;Louth, Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Leitrim, and the adjacent county of Sligo.  The visitors coming here travel via Belfast across the land frontier posts.  No particulars are taken from them as to what <Col N="237" /> they are doing here, whether they are visitors or whether they have come to visit relatives.  Still, we are able according to the Minister, to break down the income to £12.1 million.</P>
    <P>Take Donegal.  Many of our visitors come from the Six Counties.  Many come from England, Scotland and Wales.  We fail to distinguish, and I defy Bord Fáilte to distinguish between the incomes we derive from any of these visitors.  I cannot see how Bord Fáilte or anyone else can say that such and such a figure is derived from tourists visiting relatives.</P>
    <P>There are tourists who come here on business.  Where do these tourists come from?  Do they come from Derry, across the Border, to have their annual nightcap in Buncrana or do they come over for the weekends via Belfast?  What method have we of breaking down the figure so as to show £12.1 million to be derived from tourists visiting relatives?  The figures may be calculable in the city of Dublin, where we have a land frontier such as we have.  Then there is: &ldquo;Tourists other than those stated above: £2,000,000.&rdquo;  Where do these figures come from?  Is it mere guesswork?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the Deputy that on a previous occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know, if a visitor arrived at my native village of Burtonport, or at my town of Dungloe, and spent a five pound note, what method we have of knowing whether that visitor came from Britain to visit some relative or whether he came as a tourist?  I do not know how the Minister can ascertain that, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte appear to do nothing now but to appoint additional managers, both at home and abroad. I would like to know what is the proportion of expenditure as compared with returns from tourists brought here as a result of these promotional tours organised by Bord Fáilte.  I understand that in this country we have increased our hotel accommodation by only 20 per cent in the past five years and I also understand that <Col N="238" /> since the end of the war, we have increased the number of our places of accommodation by only 22,000.  In contrast to that, in Italy, in one year, over 35,000 places of accommodation have been registered.  There is also the question of the amount of money spent by Bord Fáilte in advertising by higher grade media and in a particular year. I think it would be much more useful if that money were paid over a number of years.</P>
    <P>We are spending a considerable amount on luxury hotels and these luxury hotels are being subsidised by the State.  At the same time, we are spending a considerable amount on training boys and girls in hotel management but we are training them for export because there is no future for them in this country.  I think it would be a good thing if Bord Fáilte built reasonable-sized hotels and handed them over to these fully trained managers telling them that the hotel would be theirs if they paid off the capital expenditure with a reasonable rate of interest over a certain number of years.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was Minister for Fisheries, he had considerable experience of handing over boats valued at £20,000 and £25,000 to owner-buyers on the payment of a deposit of £500. The owner was required to pay the balance out of his earnings over a certain number of years.  I would suggest that the Minister should have hotels built to special specifications and then hand them over to fully trained managers, on the condition that they paid the interest and some of the capital every year.  Such a scheme has been worked successfully by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and it should be possible to have a similar one operated successfully by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Another objection I have to Bord Fáilte arises from their attitude to small hotels.  I know many small guesthouses which, through personal supervision and management, have acquired quite a reputation because of home cooking and other such amenities. These people feel that they could add a few more rooms to the guesthouse but immediately they approach Bord Fáilte for a grant or loan, plans are <Col N="239" /> provided for them and they are requested to build more rooms than they need.  These are people who are capable of managing small guesthouses and they now find themselves in occupation of many-roomed guesthouses in the management of which they have no training.</P>
    <P>It is bad for their business.  The personal touch has gone.  They are no longer able to do the home baking.  It would be better if the Minister could provide these small guesthouses with the money to build the number of rooms they require and no more.  If they feel they can cater for only two, three or four additional rooms, let them build these instead of compelling them to build eight, nine or ten additional rooms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The limit is five rooms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister is saying but I am speaking from experience.  If you are the owner of a guesthouse with five or six rooms and you want to increase that number and you apply to Bord Fáilte for a grant to do so and submit your plans, you will be told by Bord Fáilte that it is better and more economic to build ten bedrooms and that the interest-free loan will be there for you to do so.  These guesthouses have acquired a reputation, not only for food but for comfort, but if they are put into the glass houses in which Bord Fáilte specialises, they are going to loose the individuality of which they are so proud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking from experience.  Again, may I complain that, when Bord Fáilte make an interest-free loan available to a hotelier or guesthouse proprietor, there is delay in paying the interest?  I know many hoteliers who have taken advantage of these interest-free loans.  They have gone to their bankers and presuaded them to advance them the money to build additions to their hotels or guesthouses, on the understanding that Bord Fáilte will pay the interest on the loans.  It is most embarrassing for these people to receive curt letters from their bank managers saying Bord Fáilte have not yet paid the interest and will they please to something about it.  I have at least four such letters.  That creates a very bad impression.  After all, Bord Fáilte are a Government body, financed by the State.  People ask what is wrong: Bord Fáilte have not got the money.  Where is the treasurer, the Government?  It is most embarrassing for the customers of the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a prospective hotel owner anxious to build a 20-bedrooms hotel. He was told by Bord Fáilte that he should procure the help of a consultant architect and he was advised that it would be much cheaper for him to build a hotel costing £120,000 instead of a hotel costing £25,000 or £30,000. The bigger the better: that appears to be the policy of Bord Fáilte.  Provide money for luxury hotels at the expense of hotels catering for the middle classes.  Not only are these luxury hotels provided but they are so incapable of making a livelihood, particularly <Col N="241" /> the luxury hotels built by Bord Fáilte, that Bord Fáilte have now gone into competition with local shopkeepers, drapers, antique dealers and other genuine business people.  Bord Fáilte are competing in these hotels against the ratepayers of the areas in which these hotels are situated.  I know the Minister can tell me that CIE hotels made a profit last year.  Is that really true?  Did they make a profit?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>I know for a fact that the CIE hotel in my county closes down during the winter.  The hotel is leased to the vocational education committee.  The cost of running that hotel is one of the reasons why we are pricing ourselves out of the tourist trade.  There is no doubt whatever about that.  We have now become the laughing stock of Europe because of the prices we are charging in our luxury hotels.  Remember, if you set a bad example high up, there is a danger that those lower down will copy it.  I am afraid, genuinely afraid, that our hotels are pricing themselves out of the tourist trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Then what is the Minister talking about?  Why is he getting so irritable?  I am stating now that we are pricing ourselves out of the tourist trade.  Go into any town and the first thing you will be told is that the bed and breakfast houses are doing the hotels considerable harm.  Why?  Because the charges for bed and breakfast in the hotels are beyond the reach of the ordinary middleclass tourist whom we would like to attract from Britain and the Six Counties.  That is one of our troubles and until we realise in the situation will not improve.  We must not do the ostrich, sticking our heads in the sand and saying we do not know what is happening.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already pointed out that there has been a fall in tourist income this year.  The income will continue to fall until we rectify the present situation.  There is no doubt about that.  When one invites tourists, the first thing one should ask oneself is what have we to give them.  Unfortunately, God did not give us the sunshine he has given to other European countries.  We cannot advertise perpetual sunshine, although some of the literature published by Bord Fáilte would seem to be trying to create that impression.  But we have other attractions which could be advertised instead of spending money on painting a non-existent Utopia.</P>
      <P>Strange as it may seem, unlike most Deputies, I have considerable respect and regard for CIE.  I had an opportunity this year of inspecting their headquarters at Inchicore.  I was very favourably impressed with the workmanlike fashion in which they are doing their business there.  They have the most modern and up-to-date methods at the clerical, mechanical and professional levels.  I know that a subsidy of approximately £2 million is required for CIE this year.  I wonder is that subsidy genuine?  Have they run at a loss of £2 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand CIE carry their own superannuation.  It costs them approximately £250,000.  In the ordinary courses, that would be payable by the Department of Social Welfare and it <Col N="243" /> should be charged up to that Department. I believe the loss as to £250,000 is fictional.  Furthermore, I understand CIE pay a considerable sum by way of interest on loan charges.  These loans should be written off.  That was done in one instance.  Taking into account these loans charges and the £250,000 superannuation, the loss of £2 million is not really a genuine figure.</P>
    <P>Might I appeal to the Minister to approach CIE for much better co-operation with the Northern Transport Authority?  Donegal is very isolated. We have not got as much as one mile of rail service.  What is worse, we have not got a mile of rail service to any terminus on the Border.  To cater for Donegal, and the North-West generally, there is an express bus service running twice daily from Donegal to Dublin and, thanks to representations made in this House, a luxury coach is now placed at the disposal of passengers. This bus leaves Letterkenny and passes through the town of Strabane, on its way to Dublin.  Within 15 minutes of its departure, another bus, run by the Northern Transport Authority, arrives in the Strabane and travels on to Dublin.  The same thing applies in late evening.  We have two services running within a quarter of an hour of each other to the city of Dublin.  With a little co-operation and liaison between the two authorities it would be possible to run four buses, spread out over the day, to cater for the people of the northwest generally, including Derry, travelling to the southern capital.</P>
    <P>It would be quite possible, say, to have the CIE bus leave at 9 a.m. via Strabane with the local connection from Derry to meet it.  Again, in the early afternoon, there could be a bus from Derry which could run via Strabane with connection from Letterkenny to meet it.  It could be the same on the return.  Spread out these services instead of having them run in duplicate within 15 minutes of each other. The Minister should look into this matter.  He would facilitate the people of Donegal.  Most of our students in the northwest are pupils at colleges in <Col N="244" /> Dublin.  They travel fairly often and this would facilitate them.</P>
    <P>May I bring to the Minister's notice the fact that the traditional means of transport for migrants, visitors and tourists generally between the north-west and Scotland was what was known as the Galsgow-Derry boat?  For some time, this boat has been taken off by the Burns and Laird Line.  We, in the Donegal County Council spend many hours talking a lot of nonsense about approaching various parties regarding opening up harbours in our county to bring across these visitors.  With a little co-operation and gentle persuasion I think the Minister could persuade his counterpart in the North and probably his counterpart in Britain that it would be in the interests of tourists generally, and in the interests of travel generally, that the Derry boat be restored and brought back into service and thus facilitate the people of Donegal.  I do not propose to say anything on travel by means of air at this stage but I shall say a few words later.</P>
    <P>On the question of CIE, some years ago representations were made in this House to free the transport of agricultural produce, including cattle, from the necessity of a road merchandise licence.  May I make an appeal to include fresh fish?  Fresh fish is a perishable commodity which requires urgent and immediate transport.  No person can tell when there will be a surplus catch of fresh fish.  No person can tell when there will be a lacuna period.  No person can possibly expect any transport company to keep, standing in reserve, transport for a period when fresh fish might be caught in abundance.  There would be no necessity for that if we were to classify fresh fish with agricultural produce and allow private hauliers to partake in the transport of it to the Dublin markets and to various markets throughout the State.  Not only would we facilitate and speed up the transport of fresh fish but, in that way, we should be able to get fresh fish into towns throughout the State which must now depend on redistribution from the city of Dublin. I appeal to the Minister to do all he possible can.  I do not think it will affect the financial position of CIE <Col N="245" /> very much if he can possibly free the transportation of fresh fish and permit it to be transported by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I have very little to say with regard to Bord na Móna except that I can never understand why they cannot get into full production.  Bord na Móna give a considerable amount of useful employment.  Certainly I should not like to see that employment curtailed. I should like to see it enlarged.  As a result of the cost of labour and of the dwindling population in rural Ireland, many private dwellers are unable to cut, save and procure their own fuel on the turf bogs.  They are anxious to procure their fuel supply from Bord na Móna.  It may be that the weather has curtailed production&mdash;I do not know&mdash; but, for the past number of years, we are on a ration quota from Bord na Móna.  If it is at all possible, I appeal to Bord na Móna to speed up and increase production and, in that way, to increase their own economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan made a plea to the Minister with regard to the extension of rural electrification to what might be described as uneconomic pockets throughout the State.  People living in isolated pockets, unserviced by rural electrification, find it most difficult to remain in these places.  The very fact that they have not got services from the ESB means that they find difficulty in procuring the amenities of life to encourage them to remain there.  Even at a loss to the State and to the ESB, I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices and his influence with the ESB for a supply to these isolated pockets.  May I quote an example?  I remember when the inter-Party Government were in office and when the late Deputy William Norton was Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; there was no Minister for Transport and Power at that time.  We have a rugged island off the coast of Donegal, Aranmore Island.  The population was beginning to dwindle there. It is approximately six miles off the mainland.  We all knew it would be uneconomic to supply Aranmore Island with electricity.  I remember approaching the late Deputy William Norton and asking him to use his good offices with <Col N="246" /> the board of the ESB to try to retain these people on this isolated outpost of western civilisation.  As a result of the efforts and the exhortations of the late Deputy William Norton, Aranmore Island was supplied with electricity. Much to the amazement of the then Government and the board of the ESB, 99 per cent of the householders on the islands accepted electricity.  At the moment, I think we have actually stemmed or very nearly reached the point of stemming emigration, as distinct from migration, from that island.</P>
    <P>Today, I appeal to the Minister for Transport and Power to do likewise, to make representations to the board of the ESB and to do whatever he possibly can to give people in isolated pockets the amenities which their neighbours in more accessible areas in the State enjoy.  I know it will be said that they will be given subsidised bottled gas but we must remember that we are living in the late Twentieth Century.  We must remember that most rural dwellers now have bottled gas, television and wireless.  They are practically a must now if we are to get people to remain in these isolated rural areas.  It will only be by means of electricity that we can get then to remain. That is another reason why every effort should be made to speed up rural electrification.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to criticise Aer Lingus but all too often one tries to book with Aer Lingus for a particular flight and one is told &ldquo;You must stand by because there is a waiting list and the flight is booked out.&rdquo; Eventually you are permitted to board it and you find that the plane is not half full.  A more serious effort should be made to ensure that bookings are genuine and that it should not be sufficient for a person to ring up and book on two or three different flights without opting for a particular one, thereby failing to give the casual traveller, who may have to travel on urgent business, an opportunity of obtaining a seat.  If necessary, Aer Lingus should insist on a deposit when a flight is booked and thereby ensure that bookings will be genuine. I do not think there is anything further I wish to say except to point out that <Col N="247" /> while we welcome expenditure we detest wastefulness and we believe that a considerable amount of money is being wasted by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to protest as emphatically as I can about the failure of the Minister and of CIE to improve the rotten Dublin bus services with which my constituents and the people of the city are inflicted.  They become worse every year.  At this time of the year, from November to December, and coming into the harsh weather of January and February, it is pathetic and sickening to see lengthy queues of people enduring the rigors of our harsh climate without shelter from the elements. CIE has made no effort whatever adequately to cope with the need for bus shelters in Dublin.  At present they are engaging in a fantastic and inexplicable campaign on Telefís Éireann in regard to the need for a traffic plan in Dublin city.  Why one State body under the Minister's control has to pay considerable sums in advertising fees to another State body to propagate the need for a traffic plan in Dublin is something which for the life of me I cannot understand.  It seems to be completely irrational and illogical. If there is a need for a traffic plan in Dublin this most surely is a matter for the Corporation, the Gardai and the Minister for Local Government. The man-in-the-street can do absolutely nothing about it.  I fail to see the need for expensive and wasteful propaganda of this type to convince the people of Dublin that the bus services are adequate and that the traffic moves slowly through the city.  The whole thing is laughable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only significant development that I have seen in regard to Dublin bus services in the past year have been the new destination boards with place-names in Irish.  This is making a laughingstock of CIE and of the Irish language.  This propaganda effort for the Irish revival is completely out of place.  The translations in some cases which they have used are completely at variance with what the minority of the people have been familiar and the majority are completely at sixes and <Col N="248" /> sevens where these Irish name places on the Dublin buses are concerned.</P>
    <P>Speaking here last week, Deputy Liam Cosgrave protested as a Deputy for the Dún Laoghaire area about the CIE plan to build a large hotel in Dún Laoghaire.  He pointed out that for several years past Bord Fáilte have withheld grants from Dún Laoghaire hoteliers who were contemplating expansion of their hotels on the grounds that Dún Laoghaire was adequately supplied with hotels and that their bed occupancy was low.  There is growing public concern about the range of activities and the accountability of the State companies and many different opinions have been expressed about them.</P>
    <P>One fact in regard to the State companies about which there is well-nigh general agreement is that it is undesirable that they should compete with private enterprise.  I should like to ask the Minister how would he feel if he was an hotel keeper in Dún Laoghaire and he had this State company coming in to take the bread and butter from his mouth?  That is what it amounts to. That is the form of competition which private enterprise hoteliers in Dún Laoghaire are about to face.  That is a gravely wrong state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Twelve or 15 years ago we had the Fáilte hotels and they were closed down by Bord Fáilte because they were not a success.  There was general rejoicing that these hotels were closed down for they were losing money.  I suspect that the CIE hotels are making a far from adequate profit from the capital employed in Ostlanna Iompair Éireann.  I am somewhat in the dark here.  I protested many times before about the form of account published by CIE each year and which for all its glossy colour and sophisticated appearance is far from as informative as it should be.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat in the dark in respect of Ostlanna Iompair Éireann.  It operates not only seven luxury hotels but dining-cars and refreshment rooms. I am quite unable to see from the accounts circulated whether or not the hotels make more or less than the profit figure shown, £156,000, and how this figure is affected by the operation of <Col N="249" /> the dining-cars, etc.  That is a simple item of information which ought to be made clear to us.  Taking the facts as they appear to me on the face of the accounts and taking it that Ostlanna Iompair Éireann has made on its hotel operation an operating profit of about £156,000, I want to say to the Minister that that is a miserable return for the capital employed.  If I were chairman of the board of Ostlanna Iompair Éireann and if it were a private enterprise, I would be inclined to say to my directors and shareholders: &ldquo;Look, let us wind up, go out of business and put our capital into Government stock where we will get a better return.&rdquo; What is the capital employed in these seven luxury hotels?  It is well over £1 million.  The premises alone have a balance sheet value in excess of £1 million, while their real value is probably substantially in excess.  If those seven hotels were in the hands of private enterprise hoteliers inspired by the profit motive, who would run their hotels efficiently on that account, they would realise a profit very substantially in excess of the profit shown by Ostlanna Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>These are seven luxury hotels charging high tariffs and not short of clientele.  As Deputy O'Donnell pointed out, they are competing with private shopkeepers in the sale of souvenirs, tweeds, antiques and everything you could possibly think of.  Now this State giant is about to extend its competition with private enterprise in, of all places, Dún Laoghaire, which has at least 20 or more private enterprise hotels.  I suggest that in no business more than the hotel business, which gives personal service to the individual, is the profit motive more valuable as an incentive to progress and good business. Hotels cannot be run by bureaucrats because of the very nature of the personal service they provide.  The working proprietor of his own hotel is the type of hotelkeeper who should be encouraged by State policy.  As Deputy O'Donnell has just said, if the Minister would emulate his own precedent in respect of fishing-boats in Bord Iascaigh Mhara by passing these hotels over to private people trained in their business and concerned to make a <Col N="250" /> profit, he would be doing a good day's work.</P>
    <P>It is significant that this development appears to be a complete reversal of the policy set down 12 or 15 years ago when the Fáilte hotels, as we then knew them, were closed or disposed of.  It is one thing perhaps for CIE to continue to run hotels which were the property of the railway companies for many years. But when they wish to extend their uneconomic operations in this field, it is time for us to protest, and to protest very strongly, indeed, when it is manifest they are about to compete unfairly with private enterprise.  How much capital is going into this development programme for new hotels by CIE? The Minister will probably say he is not providing the capital, that CIE are finding it through private channels.  I can only assume that means they are to find it from the commercial banks or maybe the investment banks which take an interest in the hotel industry. But, wherever it is coming from, it is scarce capital.  If it is to come from the banking system as a whole, probably with the Minister's guarantee, the banks could find far more socially desirable and useful economic outlets for this capital.  There is one principle which can be applied in all of the State companies.  Extension, expansion and further investment in them can be well justified in those cases where it is socially desirable, even if it is not economically desirable.  I cannot see that criterion being validly upheld in respect of another State-owned hotel in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>I think I have made my protest on that point.  I have not much else to say except this.  As I said at the outset, the majority of the State companies are within the scope of the present Minister's responsibility.  The Minister is aware that the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am a member, has unanimously recommended that the public accountability of these State companies should come within the range of surveillance of a committee of this House.  Members of this House on all sides are not satisfied about the accountability of the State companies. We are not satisfied about the degree of control exercised over them.  A <Col N="251" /> Deputy here last week very properly saw fit to protest about a recent high appointment made in a State company. I recall several years ago I had occasion to protest about the contract&mdash;I mention this purely as a case in point &mdash;for the building of the Telefís Éireann studios, which was not put out to public tender.  This House in its wisdom in the past has seen fit to lay down a rigid code of conduct for the handling of public moneys by Civil Service Departments.</P>
    <P>One of the earliest Acts of the Irish State when it was set up was to establish the Appointments Commission to ensure that such appointments to the Civil Service would be free from patronage, and subsequently that principle was extended to the local authorities through the Local Appointments Commission. It is an established principle in the Civil Service that contracts are put out to public tender.  This is a very desirable safeguard where public moneys are being handled.  If the board of Arthur Guiness or of any other company, in its wisdom, wishes to give a contract for a building job to a certain builder or to invite two or three builders privately to tender, that is their affair, but it is a bad principle where State moneys are concerned. We do not want to have bureaucrats dispensing private patronage at the public expense either in the form of contracts, jobs or what have you.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a code of conduct to be set for these State companies, a code of conduct, perhaps, based, where appointments are concerned, on the principles of the Appointments Commission, and based, where contracts or purchases are concerned, on the local authorities joint purchasing system.  No local authority, in the wisdom of the members of its council or its finance committee, will promote one of its own officers to the job of county manager or MOH.  It has to go through the normal channels. It is time to extend the activities of the Appointments Commissioners to the State company.  Certainly it is a very large problem and it is a problem about which a growing number of <Col N="252" /> people are becoming more concerned, including members of the Minister's side of the House.  We recall that a few years ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce, then Deputy Colley, waxed very eloquent on this subject.</P>
    <P>As I said before, the Public Accounts Committee unanimously has expressed its view that the State companies ought to be made accountable to Parliament.  However, until such time as that broad question is dealt with there is a growing feeling that a code of conduct ought to be devised and devised speedily in respect of appointments, contracts and purchasing policy, to ensure that the principles which have been sacrosanct in the State service in the past, the principles of integrity in the handling of public moneys and making State appointments, are adhered to in this very significant field of economic activity, namely, the State company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Before making my contribution to the debate on this Estimate, may I take this opportunity of congratulating you, Sir, on your new appointment, and of wishing you the full measure of strength, integrity and fixity of purpose to deal with the pressures that we shall all make upon you.</P>
      <P>This could be and should be an exciting and scintillating debate in so far as the discussion on the Estimate involves a vast area of our State activity: ships, railways, aeroplanes, hotels, electricity and bog development. All of that affects the lives of each and every one of us whether we live in city, town or in the heart of the country.  However, we are precluded from taking part in a debate such as this in the exciting manner which the debate should afford because we are denied the information that we so often require of the day-to-day administration of the various companies for whose general policy the Minister for Transport is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary question has always been recognised, not alone in this House but in Houses of much longer standing, as the great, powerful instrument in the hands of a Deputy <Col N="253" /> representing his people when seeking information from a particular Minister or in relation to a particular Department. A practice appears to have grown up here, grown up very steadily, and to have taken very firm root, that the day-to-day administration&mdash;an extremely handy phrase&mdash;is not to be questioned through the medium of the Parliamentary question.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that, on this occasion as on former occasions, he has sent around a summary of the work of his Department prior to this debate in order to assist us.  It does assist us but not to the same degree to which, in my respectful submission, we are entitled.  It is all very well to say that the reports of the various boards under the aegis of this Department are issued annually and are to be found in the Library as well as being distributed free of charge to each Deputy of the House.  It is all very well to say that the information we seek to obtain through the Parliamentary question is contained in these reports.  It is not.  It is not contained in the manner in which we want it, nor can we ascertain it from the technical clothing it wears in these reports.</P>
    <P>All of us in this House are not actuaries, accountants or experts introducing balance sheets and so on.  We simply do not understand them, and those of us who have to deal with such things in the course of our own work often find it the most difficult part of it and we have to get experts in accountancy and kindred activities to help us.  The reports are beautifully printed.  They are colourful in cover and extremely glamorous in diagrammatic effect.  However, all of this in my view does not convey to the average Deputy here &mdash; and that includes all of us, probably, except the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary who have a full understanding of these things, being close to them every day during the year &mdash; nor does it convey to the average person in the country who has not got the qualifications of which I speak, the full meaning of these reports of the companies' activities or how the money is expended; nor does it show whether the money expended has been well expended or whether the <Col N="254" /> return has been worth the financial effort which was put into it.  These are matters on which we must take stock very soon.  The Public Accounts Committee has asked that State bodies and their activities be subject to closer scrutiny.</P>
    <P>While I say all this, it does not mean for one minute that I think that any of the officers employed in any of these boards are dealing in any improper way with the funds of their board.  All I want to get rid of &mdash; and I am sure all the people who think along the same lines as I am thinking want to get rid of it &mdash; is the suspicion that necessarily attaches itself to secrecy.  If we ask a question here and we cannot get the answer, people who read that in the newspapers or who hear about it ask themselves: &ldquo;Why do they not answer?  They must be hiding something,&rdquo; when it must be perfectly clear both to the questioner and to the Minister that nothing is being hidden and the desire is to give the public the information to which they are reasonably entitled.  If that were done it would restore public confidence in full in all these boards and would quickly restore the power of the Parliamentary question in this House.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Estimate for Transport and Power covers many activities of State, particularly those carried out through the medium of various State bodies.  Taking Córas Iompair Éireann first, it appears to me that to the extent of at least £2 million this is a social service and if that be so there are areas which should be made to benefit from it, those far flung western areas of whose decay we speak all too frequently but too infrequently do anything about.  Córas Iompair Éireann, both on rail and road, should give low freightage charges, if not complete abolition of freightage charges, for certain agricultural commodities that have to reach these distant parts.  This plea has been made before by other people.  I have made it myself.  It does not appear to find favour with the powers that be in CIE.</P>
    <P>By and large, CIE are running a good service, particularly on main lines. There is an excellent service to Cork, <Col N="255" /> Limerick, Galway and to the North. These are main lines.  In other respects, particularly as regards freight, there is too considerable a delay in delivery, whether the delay occurs at the despatch end or not I am not sure, but I hear a lot of complaints in that regard.  Of course, there are times when complaints are not well-founded and are made impetuously but complaints are so common that there must be something to them.</P>
    <P>I had an experience of taking a case out of the boot of my car on the east coast of Donegal and leaving it down while somebody was getting something out of another case and I was getting petrol.  I got the petrol, paid for it, closed the boot and forgot about the case I had left beside the petrol pump. Later that evening when I reached Enniscrone in Sligo I missed the bag and through the good offices of the police whom I contacted by telephone the bag was discovered that night and put in the hands of CIE the next day, properly labelled.  It reached Enniscrone 13 days later.  That is one example of personal experience.  I was too annoyed to bother inquiring as to the cause of the delay and it is not very likely that I would be told what the cause was or what the point of failure was.  I have heard several other examples of a similar nature.</P>
    <P>The passenger trains are comfortable and heated, in fact, at times probably over-heated and it is almost dangerous to come out of the great heat.  The food for the short journeys involved is very good and very well cooked.  I do not think that in any hotel or guesthouse there is anything to equal the ordinary fry, as we know it, of bacon, egg and sausage served in the dining cars of CIE trains.  That may be their speciality.  If it is, it is a good thing that they have one.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of Ostlanna Iompair Éireann, that is, the hotel section of Córas Iompair Éireann.  It is notorious that these hotels are luxury hotels, designed, heated, equipped and furnished to cater for people of more than average income.  I was appalled recently to read that this subsidiary of <Col N="256" /> CIE had in mind to open what they call a more moderately charging hotel or motel which would charge something around 40/- to 45/- for bed and breakfast.  A charge of 40/- to 45/-for bed and breakfast is not moderate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell you how lucky I was.  The motel was of excellent design, with a wonderful diningroom, a magnificent table, beautiful bedrooms all with baths or showers.  The charge was ten guilders, including tax and service.  That represents in our money £1&mdash;20/-.  The rooms in that motel were as comfortable as any of the rooms in the Great Southern Hotels in this country, even those highly-priced at 75/- or 77/6 for bed and breakfast.  You will not get visitors that way.  People want to sleep cheap and, if they do, they will eat dear.  We have good food to give them and could charge them for it.  Provided they are not being exorbitantly charged at both ends of the scale, in sleeping and eating, everything will be all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was appalled at the proposed siting of these hotels or motels or whatever they are going to call them.  One is proposed for Dún Laoghaire.  Anyone can tell the Minister that in Dún <Col N="257" /> Laoghaire where, I am sure, the Minister has hotelier friends, as I have, last season there was extreme difficulty in going over half the number of available bed nights.  Yet CIE proposes to spend in this busy tourist area founded on private enterprise, a large sum of money in building a motel.  It is outrageous that that should be done with the apparently unlimited resources of a State company&mdash;unlimited because they do not appear to care whether they go into debt or not; it will be recouped by somebody or other but will not be associated with the headaches associated with private enterprise.</P>
    <P>The next one is to be at Rosslare.  I do not know whether Deputy Corish welcomes this or not in his constituency but from what I saw in Rosslare last summer and all around Rosslare, the people providing farmhouse accommodation and bed and breakfast accommodation and the hotels in nearby Wexford were presented a great challenge and doing their best within the limits of their capital to meet that challenge.  What is going to happen to all the people who have put in extra bedrooms and made other provision in the vicinity of Rosslare to accommodate people coming off the boats at awkward hours?  Unless they come off at awkward hours, either late at night or early in the morning, they are not going to stay in Rosslare. They will spread out to Wexford or even further afield.  Up to now the people there have been perfectly capable of dealing with this overflow and they have extended their business through their own efforts.</P>
    <P>We move on to the next place where CIE propose to build a motel, the town of Killarney, where they already have a luxury hotel.  But there are in Killarney people other than the luxury hotel owners, the people who are operating the smaller hotels and they are entitled to live and enjoy the fruits of a lifetime's work put into these businesses by themselves, their parents and in many cases their grandparents. These are not the type of people which a State sponsored body should be allowed to put out of business or with whom it should engage in competition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> I apologise for interfering in the affairs of Kerry but from what I know of it a motel such as the one proposed by CIE for Killarney would be much better if it was sited in Dingle, Ventry or across the hill in Castlegregory.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that we should forget about building up Killarney. That has been done already but we should move further west and give the people there a chance to do something to keep themselves in their own country.  If one of these motels was situated further west it would give employment in the fertile spots along the coast.  Then we move to another centre where there is no shortage of hotels, guesthouses, boarding-houses or any other type of accommodation. That is the city of Galway which is now being crowded with tourists more than any other centre in the west.  Why should CIE not move further out? Some time ago they had faith enough in the west to purchase a hotel in Ballynahinch and why not let them now move out to Connemara, to Roundstone or Clifden and build their motel there so as to bring in a little life further out to the west?</P>
    <P>I have now dealt with Dún Laoghaire, Rosslare, Killarney and Galway.  If it is not found feasible to build the proposed motels in Dingle and Connemara I am sure that Deputy Calleary and myself would be perfectly agreeable to have one of them built in north Mayo or even south Mayo where there are vast expanses of quiet beaches and a great shortage of hotels. There should be much more examination of local circumstances before there is any decision to build these motels in areas where they are least likely to fail.  So much of CIE has already failed, so much of our State bodies have failed, so much of the money poured into industry has been a failure that there would be nothing wrong if the money was put into Kerry, Mayo, Connemara or Donegal even if projects failed.</P>
    <P>As far as the ESB is concerned I do not think that anybody has anything to grouse about.  Their average charges are fair and reasonable and their technicians skilled and competent.  One only has to experience a black-out of <Col N="259" /> light and power to discover how quickly it can be put right by people who must have had to do a considerable amount of examination over a wide district before they found the source of the trouble.  I think these people are great.  No word of praise could be too much for these people who look after our heating and lighting. They are people of great integrity. These technicians visit households where the householder does not know even how to change a fuse.  The householder is at the mercy of the technician who leaves himself and his family in no danger whatever in the shortest possible time.  That is true of every household into which these technicians go and they cannot be too highly praised.  I would like the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to bring these remarks home to the board of the ESB so that they can be proud of their technicians.  The only thing that is wrong is that they are not getting enough of them.  There are not enough young people going into that line of country with the result that a very heavy load is falling on the existing staff.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna may have a good year or a bad year.  That is due to the climate.  I would not be alarmed by a loss in one year if such losses are not consistent over the years.  In my part of the country where Bord na Móna operate in conjunction with the ESB, they are doing a very good job.</P>
    <P>I do not think I can say anything critical about Aer Lingus, except in relation to its charges.  The fares are a bit stiff, particularly when world airlines&mdash;be they transatlantic, trans-Pacific, or long-haul&mdash;are operating in competition and bringing down fares. The fares from here to Britain and to Europe recently went up considerably as a result of executive action in Aer Lingus.  That may be necessary, or it may not, but there is a tendency, I think, on the part of those bodies to try to make the present pay for not alone the present and the past but for a long period ahead as well.  I do not think we owe that much to posterity, if I may put it that way.  I do not think we should load ourselves to such a <Col N="260" /> degree.  I see no reason why we should not make posterity carry a little of the load because, by that time, we shall have made a very worthwhile contribution towards easing the position of posterity.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus booking staffs are extremely helpful.  The girls who operate the ground reception are very good.  As I have said before, I do not know why girls are so anxious to join Aer Lingus and work so hard up in the air, serving meals and drinks, and doing a really tremendous job in a very short time.  I see the Parliamentary Secretary looking curiously at me. Surely, if we can have discussions here on four, five, six and seven letter words, we can discuss Aer Lingus hostesses? I took advantage of the Parliamentary Secretary's smile to say that.</P>

Their ferry services, and so on, are very good.  I hope they will go from success to success and that it will not cost us too much.</P>
      <P>I come now to Bord Fáilte.  Bord Fáilte is an extraordinary body.  It is probably, at times, the most competent of them all.  We hear a great deal of talk about the Director-General and about appointments to high places in Bord Fáilte.  I do not believe there is any other person, at whatever salary and this, of course, is a closely guarded secret, who would do the work with such a sense of dedication as the present Director-General, and that is true whether he is here in Ireland, in Australia&mdash;from which I have heard excellent accounts of his work&mdash;or in Athens, which he visited recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the regional people, I am not so sure.  I do not know how they are selected.  On the flimsiest of examinations they would appear to have no qualifications at all for this kind of work.  I know people in the higher echelon of Bord Fáilte who could not be regarded by any measure as successes in their own businesses, <Col N="261" /> yet they draw princely salaries as officers of various kinds in Bord Fáilte. I do not suggest all of them are like that.  What I am suggesting is that some are not fit for their jobs.  They were never qualified for them.  They never did any apprenticeship to either tourism or management.  Indeed, if they were to be examined on management and their knowledge of tourism, they would fall down very badly.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here to political appointments.  I shall not say anything as to whether or not appointments are political, but I will point out a specific case in which suspicion was bred.  That suspicion was bred because certain Ministers, once they get a little bit of information, are extremely anxious to be the first with it so that it will appear that it was through their good offices success was achieved.  There is an anxiety on the part not only of Ministers but also of Deputies to be the first with the news, whether it be appointments in Bord Fáilte, CIE, Bord na Móna, Irish Shipping, or even a question of an old age pension.</P>

      <P>Not really: you can be a potential.  This anxiety to rush with the news, whether it be important or relatively unimportant, whether it be an appointment or an old age pension, is denigrating the status of membership of this House.  When Ministers engage in it it is infinitely worse.  What can one expect then but that the average man will be fraught with suspicion when he sees things that give him an opportunity of saying: &ldquo;Two and two make four&rdquo; when, in fact, it is only a case of two and one making three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This could be and should be, as I said earlier, an exciting debate. Through lack of information on everyday affairs we are not able to make the contribution we should make, particularly <Col N="262" /> having regard to the wide area of activity involved.  If I may come back to Bord Fáilte for a moment, the smaller hotel is worthy of greater help.  Will the Minister, for goodness sake, see to it that somebody stops making regulations about two rooms, three rooms and four rooms, about how many feet this way and that way and up the other way, about what the cubic content is to be for this, that and the other?  Will somebody stop that as quickly as possible as otherwise people who are anxious to help in this national effort will be so fed up they will give up entirely and make no contribution at all?  All in all, things appear to be going reasonably well, as far as we know; perhaps, if we knew it all, we might not be inclined to think that.</P>
    <P>May I finish by making an appeal, an appeal which has been made by everybody who has spoken up to now? Will the Minister get rid of a chronic irritation in certain parts of the country?  I refer to the special service charge.  I know those responsible will produce figures about sinking funds, debt and long-term policies, the cost of poles and so on.  Those who now suffer because of lack of light and power are the people who held out in worse times; they held out in wild and remote areas in order to eke out a living for themselves and their children and hold what they could from those who were trying to take it from them. An Irish Government should give them now, without special charge, light and power as a reward for their efforts in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene at this stage to deal specifically with the subject matter of the debate in so far as it concerns Bord na Móna, the Electricity Supply Board and harbour development.  It is a reasonably pleasant time to intervene because, in general, in regard to ESB and Bord na Móna, Deputy Lindsay had not very much criticism to offer.  He was quite lavish in his praise of ESB employees and asked that we convey his compliments to the ESB for the manner in which they conduct their <Col N="263" /> business and the manner in which the technicians look after the supply throughout the State.  Naturally, it is a pleasure for me to promise to do so. Of course, Deputy Lindsay finished very much on the lines of the views expressed by a great number of Deputies during the debate by saying that something should be done about the special service charges.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that this matter is engaging our attention, with a view to seeing if there is anything we can possibly do to help further to bring electricity to the remaining 15 per cent of the people who have not got supply. This matter is being examined very carefully and very comprehensively. Everything possible will be done to see that the people in question will be given the opportunity of obtaining the electricity supply they so badly need at the cheapest possible cost.</P>
      <P>There are quite a number of people in isolated places and the cost of supplying electricity to them would be quite enormous and uneconomic from the ESB point of view.  We must look as objectively as possible at this matter. I have visited the west of Ireland in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and I noted the number of areas and the number of houses occupied by people of more than middle age.  The capital cost of supplying electricity to such homes would run to £200 or £300 each.  It is easy to visualise the supply of electricity to such a house only to find five or ten years later that the house is closed down and there is nobody there to make use of the electricity which cost so much to instal.  Such matters must be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy of West Cork said that, looking at it from the point of view of a rural Deputy, the people who already had electricity in the more populous areas would have no serious objection to paying an increased overall charge per unit of electricity if the benefits of electricity are supplied to the remaining 15 per cent.  I have heard such a case made by various rural Deputies.  It was an idea to which I <Col N="264" /> subscribed myself.  However, having experienced the general objection we had recently to the 7 per cent increase in the overall electricity charge, I do not think we could possibly expect that the 85 per cent would be willing to absorb a further increase in order that electricity would be supplied to the remaining 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the cost of electricity.  Any increase in cost receives wide publicity.  Increases in the cost of other commodities have far outstripped electricity increases.  In Ireland, electricity is cheaper than in most European countries and the favourable level of the Board's charges is not fully appreciated.  The 7 per cent increase last year was the first increase since 1960.  It was fully investigated by the Prices Advisory body who recommended a substitution of 5 per cent, but also suggested that the Board pass on the 2½ per cent turnover tax.  Prior to the publication of the report, the Board decided not to pass on the turnover tax.  In these circumstances, and in view of the increase in oil prices because of the Middle East crisis, the 7 per cent was allowed to stand.  The Prices Advisory Body investigation covered a much wider field than the question of prices.  Aspects of the Board's technical efficiency and its practices in handling large sums of money were also investigated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy complained that the ESB are not doing the job as economically as possible.  The report of the Prices Advisory Body proved that, as a whole, the ESB came through this investigation of their costs on the one hand, and the efficiency with which they were operating on the other, with flying colours.  The ESB is a non-profit making body.  The statute under which it was established requires it, taking one year with another, to break even&mdash;no more and no less than that.  It is not to be compared with an ordinary employer who is in business for profit.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the special service charge and to the fact that this matter is being investigated.  That, in general, covers the two major points raised during the debate in connection with the ESB.  There was the general <Col N="265" /> view of the House that the ESB in itself was doing its job well and doing it efficiently.  The overall consensus of opinion expressed, and expressed particularly by Deputies from rural areas, was in regard to the need for the provision of further assistance towards the extension of electricity supplies to the remaining 15 per cent, which was something that required early and urgent attention.</P>
    <P>Quite a good deal of criticism was expressed about the Minister's reluctance to answer questions dealing with the day-to-day administration of State bodies.  It does appear from the content of the debate that the annual Estimate does give Deputies a full opportunity of dealing with policy matters, which is the real function of the House in this regard.  I was amused last evening listening to Deputy Flanagan on his hobby-horse of attacking the Minister for not replying to Parliamentary Questions and not giving him sufficient information in regard to State bodies.</P>
    <P>When his attention was drawn to the fact&mdash;a fact in relation to which he paid tribute to the Minister&mdash;that the Minister had issued a 55-page informative brochure a week before the Estimate was discussed&mdash;the Deputy confessed he had not bothered to read it and did not propose to do so.  This in itself is a pretty clear indication of the fact that you have Deputies who are anxious to criticise for the sake of criticising, who ask questions not for the sake of hearing the answers but mainly so that they will have an opportunity of complaining that the Minister will not give the information and will not interfere with the day-to-day administration of the State bodies that come under the aegis of the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>I was quite surprised to hear Deputy Collins of West Cork attacking Bord na Móna last evening and saying that another look should be taken at the activities of Bord na Móna, that the Minister and the Department should examine the position to see if the continuance of this Board's activities was justified.  He suggested that Bord na Móna was exploiting the ESB and claimed that if the ESB were to cease <Col N="266" /> taking peat from Bord na Móna they would be in a position to supply current at a cheaper rate.  This was a rather surprising approach from Deputy Collins and it was not referred to by Deputy Flanagan who spoke immediately after him.  I want to let the House know that from my point of view there is no question of any curtailment in the activities of Bord na Móna.  While I am in the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power I look forward to using my best endeavours to expand to the fullest possible extent the activities of Bord na Móna. On more than one front Bord na Móna are serving a useful purpose in the provision of native fuel in many parts of the country where that service is greatly needed and very much appreciated.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Flanagan talking about the fact that the aspect of the Offaly end of his constituency had changed remarkably over the years since the formation of Bord na Móna. This is a development which a reasonably short time ago extended into the second part of his constituency, with the development of moss peat in the vicinity of Portlaoighise.  The suggestion that we should study the economics of the production of electricity and weigh up whether the ESB should or should not take supplies of peat from Bord na Móna, or should give up taking supplies of peat from Bord na Móna and change over to oil, is too ridiculous to be considered seriously.  I would certainly like to reassure the House that while I am Parliamentary Secretary every effort will be made to expand rather than take from the activities of the Board.  Deputy Tully referred to this and he did say that there was a curtailment at present in the activities of Bord na Móna.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did refer to Bord na Móna losses and related them to the number of workers employed. He then deduced a figure of £821 as the investment per worker in Bord na Móna.  This is rather fallacious.  The capital of the Board at 31st March last was approximately £25 million.  The all the year round staff of the Board in that year was 4,062, but the number in the peak level was 6,792.  The highest number ever employed by the Board at peak was less than 7,500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Tully did mention that peat was being supplied to the ESB at a loss.  This is not the case.  The economic price is worked out and negoiated by Bord na Móna and the ESB at the beginning of the season and the figure does cover Bord na Móna in relation to production.  The fact that they are in a position to sell to the ESB is one of the attractions, from their point of view.  There is no question of the fuel being sold to the ESB at half price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has information in that respect, I would be glad to get it from him.  My information is that the economic price is negotiated at the beginning of the season and that price is paid by the ESB to Bord na Móna.  The price is worked out on the basis of the targets to be achieved. In a year when Bord na Móna do not achieve the targets and their costs remain quite high, the price actually paid may not reach the economic price worked out at the beginning of the year.  But any suggestion that they negotiate an uneconomic price or that they are getting only half the price of their product is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see.  Deputy Cosgrave commented on the shortage of peat briquettes, as did another Deputy today.  At present there is no shortage.  Production has been good and there is quite a substantial stockpile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two reasons for this.  Early in 1966, when briquettes were in short supply due to the effects of the bad weather, the people turned to other methods of heating.  Now Bord na Móna find themselves with the problem of trying to coax their customers back.  So far, it has proved a bit difficult.  They have engaged in an expensive advertising campaign, which is paying off.  Current sales are slow because the weather has not been cold enough.  If we have a harsh winter, we can expect sales to increase.  From the Board's point of view, if the summer is wet, it is bad for them; and if the winter is cold, it is good for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> Reference was also made to briquette prices and it was claimed that briquettes had priced themselves out of the market.  I do not accept this because we have now available an adequate supply of loose briquettes. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, following a full investigation, agreed in October, 1966, to an increase of 2d per bale on baled briquettes, bringing the price per ton to 146/8d. At that time loose briquettes were off the market.  This winter they are again available at £6 per ton.  It is true this price represents an increase of 20/- per ton on the price in 1965 when they were last available, but it is 26/8d per ton less than the cost of baled briquettes.  The public can therefore buy the same quality article cheaper, except that it is loose rather than baled.</P>
    <P>I should again make it quite clear that Bord na Móna is not in itself a social service.  It must be made to become a viable economic organisation. It has many problems, particularly in regard to the weather, which it is necessary to overcome.  But the work of the Board is of enormous benefit to the community in the creation of employment and new skills.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the question of giving seasonal bog workers employment on afforestation when the turf season is over.  It has been said on many occasions previously that this is not an ideal solution.  Cutaway bog is not available for afforestation to any significant extent.  Furthermore, forestry work requires a time schedule of its own which will not fit in with the Bord na Móna operation.  It is the aim of the Board to make as many jobs as possible permanent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons asked how the agreement on co-operation with Northern Ireland on electricity supply will affect the turf stations.  One of the problems of inter-connection is to co-ordinate all the generating plants on the basis of economic merit consistent with security of supply.  For security and other reasons, it is Government policy to give priority, as far as practicable, to native fuels.  Consequently, the ESB have always made the maximum <Col N="270" /> use of turf-fired stations.  In considering inter-connection, it is necessary to examine the extent, if any, to which joint operation might militate against the Government policy of priority for generation from native fuels.  I can assure the House that no decision will be taken on this until the matter has been very fully examined, initially by the ESB and later by my Department and myself.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Treacy and Deputy Ryan to the supply of anthracite.  Deputy Treacy referred to the position of the Irish anthracite industry and to the present imports of anthracite.  This is one of the difficulties we have had here over a number of years, the necessity for the importation of a certain type of anthracite in order to ensure that the demand is maintained.  We have had this problem that Irish supplies in themselves were not capable of filling the anthracite requirements of the State.  On the other hand, there are complaints, such as that made by Deputy Ryan today, speaking as a representative of a Dublin constituency, about the quality of the fuel.  He has said that due to the difficulty of securing Irish anthracite of the better quality, people have had to turn over to Welsh anthracite.</P>
    <P>I should like to make this very clear for the benefit of potential anthracite consumers in the city, that there is no shortage of good quality Irish anthracite. If any Deputy hears a complaint of this nature, especially a city Deputy, I should be glad if he would communicate directly with me, because I can assure Deputies there is no question of a scarcity or a hold up of Irish anthracite; in fact the Irish mines are beginning to stock pile at a time when normally the demand should be rising. I would here also appeal to the Dublin coal merchants to co-operate as much as they possibly can with the Irish mines, to work in close harmony with them.  On the one hand, there is the producer and, on the other hand, there is the merchant, and it is necessary from the balance of payments point of view and from the point of view of the preservation of an ancient Irish industry, that every effort should be made to assist Irish mines, and some <Col N="271" /> Irish mines are again in the throes of development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy said we were allowing the importation of foreign anthracite to the detriment of the Irish mine. Before I became Parliamentary Secretary to this Department, I was in contact with the Minister in this regard, and at all stages he has worked in the greatest interest of the Irish mine with a view to its protection and he has been most successful up to now in this regard.  I can only hope that the increased production that we shall have coming from the Irish mines over the next period commencing as from now will be able to be consumed on the home market.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan also expressed his worry about the statement of the Minister's opening speech that 50 per cent of our energy is at present coming from oil and that this is a feature which will be developing even further. Along with Deputy Gibbons, Deputy Ryan expressed the fear that if we had a recurrence of a &ldquo;Suez&rdquo;, or, actually, a recurrence of a world war situation, we would find ourselves over-dependent on this outside commodity which would be hard to get.  This is a situation which is affecting and would affect all European countries, but the fact is that at present 32 per cent of our requirements are made from native resources between turf, which makes up over 26 per cent, electricity, 4 per cent, and home-produced coal, 2 per cent.  Making up a total of 32 per cent.  These native resources totalling 32 per cent would naturally go a long way towards meeting the basic requirements of the State, and there is also a possibility that the development of nuclear energy will affect the situation.  This is, peculiarly enough, one of the further advantages of the Whiddy Island development to which Deputy Barrett referred.  This in itself gives us a further opportunity to stockpile.</P>
    <P>Those are the only remarks I should like to make on this subject in relation to Bord na Móna and the ESB. I want to thank the House for its overall constructive criticism and constructive observations on both of those <Col N="272" /> boards.  I do hope that Deputies as a whole will endeavour to be as constructive in their criticism as they can. The failure of the Minister and myself to answer questions and to give too many details on the day-to-day administration of our boards is not something that can be quibbled at.  In this annual review every effort is made to deal with all of the points raised, and I think the Minister has always been quite frank and open with any information on policy matters and on general matters from which the House can usefully learn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to say anything but for the fact that some of the remarks being made reminded me of many of the grievances that are brought before me in my constituency. The greatest problem we have throughout the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim and, I might say, throughout the west of Ireland, is this question of the special service charge.  People who cannot afford to pay anything but a reasonable sum are asked to pay £4, or up to £6 for service, due to the fact that they are not within the limits fixed by the ESB for this scheme.  Seeing that the ESB has been such a success and that so many people have already come within the scheme, I often wonder why the Board could not be a bit lenient with those people who were unfortunate enought not to be able to qualify.  Early on, people were reluctant to avail of it, and in some rural areas, many people were delighted to get it afterwards.  Fifty per cent of the whole country is a very high percentage in the west of Ireland because people there live in out of the way places, so it is hard to plan.  It is different when you are planning for the better counties.  Even at this stage the ESB might consider it.  I know that once the ESB decide on something, they will not make a change.  I compliment them on that. There is no such thing as saying: &ldquo;Right; we will consider it.&rdquo;  Once they decide on something, that is that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have talked a lot about saving the West and keeping the people in rural Ireland.  There are many small farmers who will have to leave their homes because their families <Col N="273" /> have moved away and they are left without any supply of electricity.  They feel very despondent at having no hope of getting electricity.  With the present cost of living, they could not possibly attempt to pay the extra money demanded of them.  Many of them are quite convenient to the supply and they do not understand why they cannot get it.  They do not understand that transformers have to be erected and expensive equipment supplied. They say that they are right beside the line going to their neighbour.  I ask the Minister to stretch a point with a view to making things easier for those people.  It is not their fault that they live outside the limit but for that reason they are the victims.  There are a few who could not possibly be linked up to the supply but in the case of many others, with a little bit of goodwill and a little expense to the tax-payers, the whole thing could be ironed out.</P>
    <P>The ESB must be a good paying proposition.  The ESB employees are doing a really good job.  They are interested in their work.  They all have very good jobs.  We find fine young men who would otherwise be in England earning good money and giving a good account of themselves in the ESB.  We must compliment the Minister on that also.  I would ask him to re-examine the position in the west of Ireland where there are still many people without electricity.  This would encourage people to stay in the West. There are centres in some towns that are without supply.  We bring this to the notice of the county council occasionally. I hope this will be put in order before long.</P>
    <P>Many meetings are held in connection with the tourist industry by town development committees and other organised bodies.  Every encouragement is given to the tourists to go out into the rural areas and into the small villages and to avail of bed and breakfast accommodation in those areas so far as possible.  The people in these areas are advised to provide bed and breakfast accommodation.  I am a member of a committee and I was at a few meetings.  I was asked to make inquiries on their behalf about the bed <Col N="274" /> and breakfast business and the grants. It was not as simple as it appeared. People have to have so many rooms, independent of the family.  Water and sewerage must be laid on before the place can be registered.  This sort of thing prevents people from going into this business.  Some of them have fine homes and could use one room or two rooms for tourists without being put to this expense.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the grants could be given a little more generously.  I have this information and knowledge from my own village.  People decided that they would go into this business, but then they thought that after they had gone to that expense, the tourists might not come.  That is the way they looked at it.  Tourism is a great industry&mdash;over £80 million.  That is certainly worth looking after having regard to the uncertainty of agriculture, with a few bad years, strikes in the bacon factories and many other set-backs.  Now the foot and mouth disease is affecting our fairs again.  There is also the cost of feeding stuffs.  Many people are getting discouraged with the result that they do not go into the tourist business.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna were mentioned early on.  I wonder could Bord na Móna work in some other counties on smaller tracts of bog.  I saw the results of their work in the Parliamentary Secretary's county on my way to Limerick and no doubt they have done great work.  If they could work on smaller tracts of bog in some of the other counties, as well as providing fuel they would be providing employment.  I am sure the Minister keeps an eye on this.  I am sure he knows the amount of bog that is available.  It would be of great value to the country in general if this industry could be developed.</P>

      <P>It has been an interesting debate and I was very gratified to hear a great deal of praise bestowed upon all the companies over which I have general supervision, and whose general policies are subject to my direction and that of the Government. In fact there was so much general praise that when certain Deputies appeared to question the entire <Col N="275" /> basis of policy of a body such as Bord Fáilte or a body such as CIE I felt rather inclined to ignore it because I think that if the whole basis of policy were to be questioned in respect of any State body the Party concerned should have a united view about it even though it is quite obvious that members of the opposite Parties can say anything they like&mdash;maybe that is a good thing, it is a matter for themselves&mdash;but if there was to be some major criticism in regard to a particular activity there ought to be a good number of them expressing the same view.  Therefore I shall not in my reply define the entire basis of the CIE operation or define the entire statistical basis on which Bord Fáilte operates because Deputy O'Donnell knows very well that most of his colleagues were praising Bord Fáilte and their criticism was of a purely constructive kind, making various suggestions for improvement or modification of BFE policy.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should say, nevertheless, in relation to that matter that the Central Statistics Office provides the figure for income which we receive from various categories of tourists and it is done on the basis of sampling. Admittedly, as published in the report of Bord Fáilte, the sampling method is not very accurate in regard to people who cross the border between the Six and the Twenty-Six counties for their holidays.  In respect of other forms of travel it is reasonably accurate.  People are asked to fill up forms saying for what purpose they are coming here from abroad, how much they are going to spend, where they are going and so forth.  We can rely in a general way on the total amount of money received here from genuine tourists in the sense of people who are not coming here on business or people returning home on holidays.  Of that Deputy Pa O'Donnell can be assured.</P>

    <P>I should like, first of all, to deal with some general matters.  The old hobby-horse was raised that Parliamentary Questions relating to day to day matters are not permitted by the Ceann Comhairle.  They are not permitted because in the Act setting up the body it is quite clearly stated that <Col N="276" /> the Minister has a right to obtain information from time to time but there are limitations in regard to the interference with a purely commercial body.  The House knows perfectly well that if Deputies were permitted to ask questions like: &ldquo;How often did the bus from Terenure to O'Connell Street leave late in the last two weeks?&rdquo; and that is the kind of question that would be asked, the number would multiply to the point where the whole exercise would become ridiculous.  Moreover, it would mean that there would be great political pressure groups operating on all sides on these State companies. That kind of question is not permitted in other democratic countries and for a very good reason.</P>
    <P>Having said that, at the same time I have made it perfectly clear ever since 1959 that there are a great many occasions when minor complaints can be considered in the context of general State company operation, when all the sort of matters relating to the operation of companies can come before the House and there can be very free exchange between the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and the members of the Dáil.  I have said many times that on the Estimate for my Department whatever rules existed in regard to day to day discussion I felt quite sure that the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would permit a very wide degree of discussion.  I have answered innumerable and detailed questions in the last five years whenever I have got the opportunity.  Sometimes my speech in reply has taken nearly one and a half hours to deliver.  This is an occasion when I can sense the feeling of the House about all sorts of detailed matters and can make a great many replies to satisfy Deputies who have doubts about this State company or the other State company. May I remind Deputies also that opportunities for discussion arise in connection with all Bills providing for fresh capital or any other changes in the statutory operation of the companies; that there is discussion on the Estimate itself and that the reports provided by the State companies are fairly elaborate.  The report of Bord <Col N="277" /> Fáilte, for example, is extremely detailed in every respect and in the case of the other companies the Deputies can ascertain the financial position, they can ascertain the capital position and I fail to see that these reports do not give Deputies a great deal of information about the financial operations of the companies concerned.</P>
    <P>Again a great many parliamentary questions that are considered by the Ceann Comhairle to be in accordance with the provisions of the statute governing the company concerned are in fact answered at all times.  The companies themselves answer a great many questions.  Every Deputy knows that if he goes to the area manager of any one of the areas of CIE that the area manager will in a general way give him a reasonable answer in regard to a complaint.  The same holds good for the other State companies. Obviously State companies where they are competing with other outside bodies, competitive bodies such as Aer Lingus with BEA, that a great many matters in relation to the contracts and the price of things they buy are very secret and cannot be revealed.  In order to get materials or equipment at the lowest price it is very important that all rules with regard to secrecy in connection with contracts should be observed.</P>
    <P>Another way in which contact is kept between Deputies and the State companies is the questions they write and ask me that I do not answer in the House.  I do my best to answer them and I have written a great many letters in the course of the past six years on matters about which they were puzzled.</P>
    <P>Finally, so far as the Oireachtas is concerned, I am responsible to the Members of this House and I have given on page 5 of the notes prepared for Deputies a full list of the methods, both administrative and statutory by which I maintain contact with the State companies and by means of which I give them their general policy directions. If Deputies would like to read again page 5 of the notes, they will see that there is continuous contact with all of the State companies and when complaints or observations that come to us which are of a day to day <Col N="278" /> character begin to come in numbers and you get a series of complaints on a particular facet of the different companies' operation or a number of people question as to whether a particular facet of operation should be amended then it ceases to be a day to day matter in the literal sense and either my officers discuss the matter with the State companies or I discuss such matters with the chairman or managing directors of the Board. Therefore I think that Deputies should be reasonably satisfied with the liaison between them and myself on the occasion of discussion in the House or with the State companies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne implied that there was not at this moment a code of conduct governing those activities of the State companies where they should observe the greatest discretion.  I want to make it clear that there is a code of conduct at present.  They have to present their financial reports in a way which satisfies me and eventually satisfies the Oireachtas.  All their accounts are audited in the normal way according to the Companies Acts.  When they purchase goods or services over and above a certain value, tenders are invited for the goods and services.  In the vast majority of cases, permanent appointments are made through public advertisements.  There are certain exceptions to this which I shall deal with later but not very many.</P>
    <P>In the case of CIE, under the relevant legislation, they are obliged to advertise vacancies for all permanent positions, but I can assure the House that they should not feel disquieted by suggestions made by Deputy Byrne, no doubt with all sincerity.  There is a general code of conduct, based on the fact, as the Deputy said, that they receive a good part of their capital from the people of the country through Bills passed by the Oireachtas, that they are responsible to the Oireachtas and that they are therefore in a very special position and should, in spite of being a commercial company, take the greatest care that no one should suggest that there was any kind of corruption in connection with their administration.  I hope I have made that matter very clear to the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> Deputy Cosgrave, in the course of his speech, which consisted of some constructive criticism and questions, and some other Deputies, spoke as though one could think in rather a loose way that since there was an element of social service in all those State companies to some degree or other, we should consider that the social service element was something of immense importance.  I follow the traditions initiated by my predecessor, Deputy Seán Lemass, who always felt that if there is a social service element in the operation of State companies, it should be clearly defined, that if there has to be a subvention, it should be clearly determined, and that if there has to be a subvention then after that the operation must be profitable and must be run in the most efficient manner possible.  The only alternative to that would be that the State companies would be slackly run, the cost would be excessive and the staff would have no feeling of pride in their operation.  Having said that, I want to make it clear to Deputies who said that the social service element should be included in the activities of this State company, that there is a social service element in these operations.</P>
    <P>In the case of the ESB, the House is informed that there is a loss in the rural electricity consumption account, that the urban areas pay for the loss on the transmission and consumption of rurally consumed electricity.  That is known.  All the figures are published. It is not uncommon in other businesses for sales in large towns to compensate for losses in remote towns and rural areas.  There is nothing unusual in that. Again, as Deputies know, there is a specific grant for rural electrification, 75 per cent or £75, whichever is the lesser per dwelling, and other capital subsidies for the specific lines, the electricity connections that are made within the rural electrification areas. Those are two specific types of subsidy and the Board must pay its way after making allowance for those subsidies, one of which is purely an internal one, as between rural consumers and the other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> In the case of CIE, one would imagine that there was no element of social service within CIE.  The bus services, as the House knows, make a small but diminishing profit after all expenses are paid, but within the bus service area, there are a great many bus services that lose money.  A huge proportion of buses operating in the West run at a loss.  Between 30 and 40 bus services in Dublin lose money. Then there are very profitable services, services densely occupied going long distances.  There are services that are very profitable and it is because of them that the fares can be retained as they are in the remote rural areas.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from this subsidy which pays for the loss on the railways and the subvention to keep the railways going, there is some subsidisation within the rail and freight services. Certain of the freight services are highly profitable, where traffic is dense and a very small proportion of the rail services is profitable.  That enables the rail services in less profitable areas to be carried on after allowing for the subvention.  I merely mention that because some people think there is no element of subsidy within CIE.  Undoubtedly there is, even apart from the £2 million subvention voted by this House every year.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, it is very essential as I have said, if there is an area of subsidy, that it should be clearly known to the Members of the House.  For the sake of keeping the cost of the services down, for the sake of being able to see they are spread through the community to the maximum degree, it is absolutely essential that this State company should operate efficiently, that they should set an example of high productivity to all companies; otherwise they could become stagnant.  I think I have the general support of Members of the House on all sides in regard to that general principle.</P>
    <P>After having spoken in a general way about the operation of the State companies, I will deal with the various questions that were raised in relation to each separate State company in order that all Deputies can feel that I have done my best to answer their <Col N="281" /> questions.  Deputy Corry asked a question about the overhaul of the B &amp; I vessels.  The answer is that the <i>Munster,</i> the <i>Leinster</i> and the <i>Innisfallen</i> are usually overhauled in Belfast, where they were built, so they are overhauled in Ireland.  The Harland and Wolff Company stocks spares for those ships.  The answer is that it is more economical to send them there.  The Cork ship repair services are usually asked to quote for repairs to the other ships.  The Liffey Dockyard in Dublin also carry out repairs to the B &amp; I ships, so they do, if they can, provide employment in Ireland as a whole.</P>
    <P>In the case of Irish Shipping, the same question was asked.  It is not always possible to repair the Irish Shipping boats here because they travel all over the world, but whereever <Col N="282" /> possible, they go through their major refits in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett seeks assurance that the International Maritime Convention will ensure that liability of shipowners caused through oil spoilage will be adequately covered.  He was referring to the <i>Torrey Canyon.</i> IMCO is now deliberating on all those matters, not only on the liability but also on the whole question of what new regulations should be implemented or are necessary in order to avoid such a disaster as took place in the case of the <i>Torrey Canyon.</i></P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 16th November, 1967.</P>
