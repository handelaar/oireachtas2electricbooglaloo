      <P>When speaking last night, I was dealing with a number of miscellaneous matters not related directly to any State company.  Deputy Barrett raised the question of the possibility of oil spillage at Whiddy. We have been in constant contact with the Gulf Oil Company and also had the experience of the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> disaster: we sent officials of the Department to Cornwall to observe effects there and we have had talks with experts in this field.  Every step will be taken by the Gulf Oil Company to prevent the undesirable effects of oil spillage.</P>
      <P>For example, no flexible hose will be used.  Instead, solid steel apparatus will be used, which is a considerable technical advance.  Overall automatic control of the pumping will be effected by a skilled operator in a control tower.  There will be a boom available to encircle completely any accidental spillage and there will be also permanently established at Whiddy four tugs with a high-power detergent operating apparatus.  The cost of all this will be borne by the Gulf Oil Corporation.  I wanted to make it clear that we are examining the matter in very great detail and to tell the House that the Gulf Oil Company are co-operating fully with the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett raised the question of liner traffic at Cork.  Of course, the future of liner traffic at Cobh in this respect depends entirely on the decisions of the shipping companies.  As the Deputy knows, the Cunard Line decided to sell all their liners except the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> and this will probably mean a reduction in calls at Cork. The Holland-America Line, as far as I know, will maintain their calls at Cork. The future of regular passenger liner services across the Atlantic is impossible to define at the moment.  One hears plans for very inexpensive liner services based on self-service cafeteria and bars.  One hears many tentative plans for a type of traffic which declined during one period and appeared to be stabilised again but it would be difficult to hazard a guess of what lies in the future.  Perhaps in such days as these, when air traffic is so <Col N="286" /> frequent, many people may wish to relax during sea journeys.  However, it would be impossible for me to say what the future holds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett asked a question in relation to the possibility of a ferry terminal at Cobh.  It was found impossible to get adequate space at Cobh but the B &amp; I decided to integrate their Cork operations, for economic reasons, in a new terminal at Tivoli and it is expected the ferry will carry cars, passengers, containers and livestock in the most economic fashion.  B &amp; I plan to run a new car ferry ship, which will also have passenger facilities, between Cork and Swansea and there will be road services between Swansea and London.  The Swansea port authorities are preparing the port terminal. The distance by road will be a great deal shorter and the road facilities better than on the longer route to Fishguard.</P>
    <P>There were vague comments on the position of Irish Shipping.  I indicated in the course of my opening statement that Irish Shipping faced very low freight rates at different periods, followed by slight rises.  As a shipping company, they carry the maximum Irish freight that is possible and economic.  For example, they recently made a very satisfactory contract to carry fertilisers for an Irish company but they must also engage in tramp operations as in the case of other cargo liner companies.  The shipping service has been subject to examination in the matters of management and cost and I think we can have every confidence that Irish Shipping are meeting the challenges which have to be faced by all cargo liner companies.  I have every confidence in the company and the board.  Repairs to Irish Shipping liners are carried out in Ireland, when possible, as I have told Deputies in reply to Parliamentary Questions.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to matters concerning aviation and one Deputy questioned the desirability of proposed hotel development near Dublin Airport. I consider this as being absolutely essential in the future, having regard to the expansion in air travel at Dublin Airport.  Dublin Airport is situated close to a main arterial road and <Col N="287" /> market research makes it quite clear that we need this hotel development in the area.  I have no fear whatever that it will result in unfair competition with existing Dublin hotels.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen and others asked for information about the leasing of aircraft by Aer Lingus and Aerlínte. Air transport in this country is subject to steep peaks and steep valleys.  As I have stated on previous occasions, part of the story of Aer Lingus is the success achieved in spite of having a very low average fare paid by passengers on their European routes, particularly the British ones, and in spite of the fact that the transatlantic route is the shortest intercontinental portion of any major air carrier.  There is a greater valley period during the winter than is the case with other intercontinental air carriers.  The two Irish companies have to achieve a balance in their accounts in spite of these two adverse factors and it is very good business if Aerlínte can succeed in leasing aircraft during valley periods.  The Irish aircraft companies have been pioneering in this business at times when they have no use for their aircraft.  The directors of the board are quite satisfied that the financial return is worthwhile.  I do not need to add that the terms of the leasing are naturally highly confidential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to say if the money received in this way represents a very high proportion of the companies' income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The operational profit made from leasing is only an element in the total profit made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a remarkable statement because the manager of Aerlínte made an entirely contrary statement some months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>He said it is an element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>How much of an element?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say right off but it is an element in the profit made by the air companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> Another Deputy asked the question whether the lenders of money to the airline could ever secure control of the airline.  The air companies borrow in the open market and pay interest and it does not give the lenders any ownership whatever of the airline.  I do not think I need to give the figures in detail as they have already been given in the notes but the proportion of State capital in the case of the air companies to the amount they have borrowed from commercial sources is still so large that no one need have any doubt on this score even if, in fact, the money borrowed from abroad constituted equity capital, giving the lenders some rights at shareholders' meetings but, in fact, none of it is equity capital.  So, no one need have any doubt about the independence of the air companies in so far as their foreign lenders are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The ratio will be changed completely by 1971 when, in fact, the greater part of the capital will be obtained from other sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There, again, that would be a matter for Government decision should there be any chance of foreign control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It has already been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been necessary to make a decision yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already published the fact that he is not going to finance air services to the same extent he has been doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I said was that in examining the whole position, I hoped that whatever capital was required by the air companies would be remunerated.  That does not preclude the air companies from remunerating State capital.  If the Deputy looks at my speeches he will see that they will have to remunerate their capital in one form or another in future unless circumstances change completely and dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance made a statement earlier this year which does not hold with that. <Col N="289" /> However, this is not the time.  I will take it up by way of question with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at the moment is that it is not necessary for the State to finance capital to the air companies in the near future.  That is what the Minister for Finance referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The air companies have been informed that in future they must find their capital other than from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Seventeen million pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so but that position, again, could change if it was essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A question was asked about capital for the Jumbo Jets. The two Jumbo Jets will cost £20 million and the company will provide £5 million for deprecation fund for the aircraft after delivery in 1971.</P>
      <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell asked whether it was essential to provide facilities for Jumbo Jets in Dublin and Shannon. The answer is, we are quite satisfied that it is essential to provide these facilities.</P>
      <P>The question was asked whether the decision of the air company to standardise on Boeing planes was a wise one in view of the possible difficulty of disposing of the Viscount and BAC One-Eleven fleet.  As far as I know, there will not be any difficulty in disposing of these planes unless market conditions should change dramatically.</P>
      <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell also asked in regard to Shannon Repair Services now being taken over by Aer Lingus, whether the management staff looked for business, as he had heard rumours that they did not.  As far as I know, every effort is being made by Aer Lingus to provide business for this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked about the possibility of a Shannon/Birmingham air service. <Col N="290" /> One of the difficulties is that Birmingham is less than 80 miles from Manchester and there is a scheduled service from Dublin to Manchester, started in 1965 by Aer Lingus, and the company was concentrating on making this service a viable operation.  At the moment it is not considered economic to run this service.  The matter will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe asked a question about the desirability of having a service charge at the self-service snack counter at Dublin Airport.  I do not particularly like the idea.  It is true that the cost of what is provided there is moderate.  I do not particularly like the principle.  I will take it up with the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister takes the matter up and decides to take out the service charge, will he ensure that the workers are sufficiently compensated? The service charge is for staff?</P>

      <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell, unlike most of his colleagues, seems to have some fundamental criticism about Bord Fáilte.  As I indicated yesterday, I do not think I can do anything about this.  There was a great deal of mostly useful, constructive criticism by other Deputies of his Party and there was no suggestion that Bord Fáilte was not operating on a sound basis, that is to say, a basis which reflected the results of intelligent market research.  So, I do not think I need to go into the observations made by Deputy P. O'Donnell.  I see no point in doing so.  I indicated yesterday that if there had been some kind of committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="291" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It happened. in the Opposition Party&mdash;which there practically never is&mdash;which could make some fundamental decisions as to what they wanted specifically to attack in regard to the operation of the State companies and if that had been included, I would take it seriously but Deputy O'Donnell's suggestion was that the whole of the Central Statistics Office calculations on the proportion of genuine tourists and of those returning to their families was questionable and, therefore, he implied that the whole of the Bord Fáilte promotional work was of a doubtful character.  I do not propose to go into that because his remarks would have to be supplemented by a great many others in the Opposition for me to take up the time of the House with comments of that description.</P>
      <P>I stated yesterday that the vast majority of appointments to staffs of State companies were filled as a result of advertisements.  I made that clear. I also stated that there was a code of conduct for State companies, contrary to Deputy Byrne's suggestion that there would appear to be complete indifference to the responsibility of a State company both to the Oireachtas and to the Minister.  I made that clear. But, in regard to this accusation that there was some political influence in the appointment of the North American manager by Bord Fáilte, I utterly and completely deny it.  I have permitted or encouraged no political influence whatever in these appointments since I have been in charge of these State companies. The idea that a man of the eminence of the person appointed would require some kind of political label in order to secure his appointment is just too ridiculous for words.  Everybody who knows the man knows that it could not be true.  It is a slander on both Bord Fáilte, which consists of people who have received the very highest commendation by the Members of this House, and on the Director-General, to suggest that I, or any other Minister, could call up Mr. Brendan O'Regan and say to him: &ldquo;You will appoint Mr. So-and-So because he is a member of Taca&rdquo;.  The idea is just ludicrous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are exceptional occasions in regard to appointments at absolutely top level.  I do not think there would be many such occasions on which it is not considered desirable to advertise.  That is the case partly because this is a very small country and partly because one may want someone so eminent and so well known that the mere fact of that person applying through a public advertisement might cause difficulties for himself and for others.  Everybody who has experience of the business world knows what I mean.  This applies particularly, I would say, in the world of promotion in public relations.  I would very much deprecate any action by any State company following the example of this particular appointment of making many in the same way.  State companies are not all obliged by the Dáil, as is CIE, to advertise all their positions and I would regard it as most undesirable should there suddenly be a flow of appointments not made through public advertisement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, I must admit, having been in business and concerned with sales, particularly speciality sales, whenever the Government were out of Office, that I can conceive of circumstances, particularly in the case of Bord Fáilte, in which, in <Col N="293" /> relation to this kind of appointment, it is occasionally desirable, without any reflection on the Board's integrity, to make an appointment in the way this appointment was made.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this unfortunate individual has been the subject of comment in the Dáil, I shall have to go further and say very definitely that, had some second-rate individual been appointed, of whom nobody had heard, then Bord Fáilte would, I think, be on the mat in the Dáil.  Had some rather second-rate person been appointed, then one could presumably say that there must be something peculiar about the appointment.  But the eminence of the individual takes away, I think, any suggestion that there was corruption on the part of the Board.  As I said, I will not dictate to the boards how far they should depart from the principle of advertising every position.  I will leave that to their commonsense.  The practice up to now, taken as a whole, shows that where there have been exceptions they have been unusual and have been, no doubt, rightly conceived.  If the present practice of advertising positions, and not advertising positions when the occasion warrants, continues in roughly the same proportions, I shall have no objection.</P>

      <P>Deputy Treacy made various observations about the position in regard to hotels.  I think he exaggerated when he said that the great majority of people who come here on holidays are apparently people of very modest incomes.  From the market research done by Bord Fáilte, that is not true; they consist of people of a variety of incomes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy also referred, quite rightly, to the need to ensure that encouragement was given to the provision of proper conditions for staff. Bord Fáilte some years ago gave grants for staff accommodation.  I hope hotel proprietors all over the country will take advantage of these grants because I am perfectly certain they will get better productivity, efficiency and courtesy from a contented staff.  Indeed, conditions are improving so far as staff are concerned, partly because of the need for staff and the fact that they cannot be so easily attracted to the hotel trade and partly because the general attitude towards conditions for staff in the hotel world has been improving so far as managers and directors thereof are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Treacy discussed whether or not the pattern of hotel development was proceeding in the right way.  As the Deputy knows, the motoring tourist has altered the picture considerably and Bord Fáilte have to take account of this.  There were various criticisms made of overcharging in hotels by Deputy Treacy, Deputy Tully and Deputy P. O'Donnell.  Complaints of overcharging, if made to Bord Fáilte, are fully investigated; if proved, refunds are insisted upon.  I have already made that clear.  It is very unlikely that a hotel would survive for long if it got a bad reputation for overcharging. There is now more competition between hotels and guesthouses.  The growth in guesthouse accommodation, <Col N="295" /> very good accommodation, and supplementary accommodation is already providing competition and I do not think Deputies need fear that hotel prices could go up to such an extent through a monopoly position that we would have to examine into them.  It is a highly competitive business.  Hotels must publish their charges in the hotel guide and tourists are encouraged to consult the guide.  The prices in the high season are indicated as well as the prices throughout the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>I repeat that I rely to a considerable extent on the <i>Financial Times</i> analysis of holiday costs.  As far as I know, this is a journal with a very high reputation and I do not believe it would publish a list of comparative costs of a food basket, an evening out, bed and breakfast in a non-A class hotel in 20 countries and that the figures published would be inaccurate.  I just do not believe that.  I have faith in the way that newspaper is run and, in that analysis, it showed there was nothing excessive as a whole in prices here. There may be exceptions.  Obviously there are black sheep in every community, but we can, I think, take it for granted there is no excessive charging here as compared with abroad.  I myself have looked at a number of hotel guide books.  When I go abroad on international conferences, I get the local guide and I cannot find anything excessive in our hotel charges.</P>

      <P>The Minister does agree there is a difference in the standard of living in the different countries and the cost of living has a bearing.  It is a different thing altogether for someone here travelling around the country; there is no point in telling him what the prices are in France.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies questioned the level of grants offered by Bord Fáilte for hotel accommodation. They are geared to the economics of the operation.  The higher grants are given only in remote areas or where there are economic difficulties in establishing a hotel.  The lower grants outside the west are quite adequate. I do not think Deputy Treacy, for example, need fear that there will not be hotel development in his constituency simply because, in some areas, the promoters would not get the same grants for establishing a new hotel as would be given in respect of Clifden, for example, or between Clifden and Galway, or for extending their premises in such an area.  A great deal depends on the situation of the hotel.  There are hotels which are obviously obliged to close down from November to April because there is no business. There are others, even in rural districts, which have a commercial business during the winter and are able to take advantage of the extension of the season to the maximum degree.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons referred to the desirability of better signposting.  Every year, Bord Fáilte spend money on signposting.  I think signposting is improving.  I trust the regional tourist boards will do what we see around the Malin Head peninsula and Kerry. A certain number of ring signposting has been done to encourage motorists to go over a circular route where there is beautiful scenery.  I trust that kind of signposting will develop in time.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies commented on farmhouse grants.  I hope the use of the grants will develop in the next few years.  As far as I know, the thousand beds in the farmhouses that were ready in the past season were very well filled. Once the minimum of comfort and accommodation requirements are met, I think tourists are very happy to go amongst the farming people in the countryside.  They like the personal atmosphere and enjoy the family life a great deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully asked for some aid for restaurants in holiday resort areas.  I <Col N="297" /> am afraid we have not reached that dizzy level of aid.  In certain areas, there is quite a need for restaurants, particularly during the summer season. Having given staff accommodation grants, farmhouse grants, increased grants for hotels, resort development grants, I am afraid I simply could not find funds for a separate system of grants for restaurants alone.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I always consider everything.  The Deputy knows that there is competition.  Development grants will always be with us.  Deputy Collins referred to the need for moderate-priced accommodation.  We need more hotels with a bedroom rate of between 35/- and 45/- per night.  There has been a big increase in guesthouse and supplementary accommodation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay said guesthouse owners were plagued by regulations.  I have asked Bord Fáilte to examine every element involved in providing a grant for a guesthouse.  Now, there are grants for farmhouses as well.  These regulations exist with a view to the future.  The standards of accommodation are improving every year.  What a person going to a guesthouse desires in the way of accommodation will be different in, say, 15 years from now. If there is to be some basic addition to accommodation there must be standards of minimum size of rooms, the size of staircase, and so on.  I do not believe Bord Fáilte are too strict in administering the regulations or that the standards are excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy P. O'Donnell and a number of other Deputies, I have already indicated that we reduced the maximum requirements as to the number of rooms in a guesthouse from ten to five if a grant is to be provided.  A <Col N="298" /> registered guesthouse need have only five bedrooms for guests in order to qualify for a grant and for registration but the same limitation does not apply in the case of a farmhouse which can obtain a grant if it provides a smaller number of bedrooms.  We now have a very flexible system.  Farmhouse and supplementary accommodation grants do not require a minimum of beds whereas the registered guesthouse does. That is a reasonable position.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat that there has been a very great increase in low-priced accommodation.  According to OECD, there has been an increase between 1965 and 1966 of 15 per cent in the more modest type of accommodation, which is virtually a record for the OECD countries.  In 1963, for B, C and D class hotels and guesthouses, and supplementary accommodation, there were 16,690 beds.  In 1967, there are now 22,420 beds.  That is a very satisfactory increase.  It should answer the excessive propaganda that Bord Fáilte are interested only in luxury hotels.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy from West Cork spoke of the necessity of developing that area for tourism.  I trust he will continue to take an interest in Ivernia Regional Tourist Board whose market research on this subject is very interesting and should stimulate people to offer accommodation to tourists and to take part in resort development and every activity of that kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore referred to the bill posting menace.  This is subject to the local planning authorities who, I trust, will take a sound and right attitude to it.  It would be quite impossible to eliminate all bill posting but, equally, it could be controlled so as not to affect amenity areas.</P>
    <P>He referred to the necessity for developing angling.  Bord Fáilte and the Inland Fisheries Trust are working very actively in this regard and I have not had any serious complaints about what they are doing.  I hope they will continue with their very excellent work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to hotel grants given by Bord Fáilte and to the consequent <Col N="299" /> sale of the hotels.  At the moment, applicants must agree to keep premises registered with the Board for a period of ten years, or otherwise the grant becomes repayable.  There is no bar to selling but the premises must be kept registered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy O'Hara raised the question of Bord Fáilte publicity in Mayo.  If he reads &ldquo;Guide to Ireland&rdquo;, he will find included in it all the beauty spots of the country.  There are many other commercial guides which are excellent. There are five or six, all of which include County Mayo and, if the Deputy goes to any bookshop, he will see them on sale.  They are, apparently, bought by tourists on their arrival here. He should know that the Regional Tourist Boards have as one of their primary duties the obligation of publishing local guides.  First of all, they have to get going with their information services, then they have to publish guides and then seek supplementary accommodation and pass it on to Bord Fáilte for inspection.  I have seen some of these local guides myself and a good deal of local effort has gone into them.  If private individuals followed the splendid example given by Father Egan regarding Ballintubber area, I am sure there would be even more publicity for their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next I come to C.I.E.  Some Deputies seem to question the accounts of CIE and the meaning of the £2 million subsidy.  I should have thought it was clear enough.  The accounts are published in full and it is possible for anybody with an understanding of accountancy to see the varied success of CIE in regard to their difficult services. Generally speaking, with the exception of the small steamer services and the docks, the only losing service <Col N="300" /> is the railway company.  One can say the subsidy of £2 million a year is given to maintain the railway.  As I have often indicated to the House before, if only the railway was 300 miles long instead of 160 the financial problem would be much less.  It is a little bit too long to close and much too short to have any chance of making a profit or of having a minimal loss.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>There are only about 700 miles of CIE lines that are profitable and which pay their way.  As I have already indicated, whereas about six years ago there were three railway companies in Europe making a profit there is now no railway company in Europe making a profit, although the deficit in regard to one of them would be minimal. This is due to increased costs and to the tremendous competition of private transport.  The deficit in the case of CIE is a considerable burden on the taxpayer.  It is the equivalent of 4d per gallon on petrol.  It is a lot to pay.  It is exceeded as a percentage of revenue by some railway companies in Europe and it is less in others.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties of CIE is the fact that they have no transit traffic which a great many railway companies in Europe have.  They have no very heavy continuous traffic and unlike, say, the Swedish traffic, there is no very large industrial centre in one part of the country sending goods and materials to another very large industrial centre in another part.  The main industrial centre here is Dublin, as it is in the case of Copenhagen and Brussels, and therein lies another difficulty making it impossible for CIE to make the railways pay.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies still refer to the closing of the railway lines.  I do not need to go into that all over again. Deputy M.P. Murphy referred to the closing of the West Cork line.  I need not keep the House by going into the details of the history of that line and the fact that the average number of passengers per train at Cork station was 36, a bus load, and the average amount of goods was ten tons, a lorry load, or two small lorry loads.  That was the position.  It was not a railway: <Col N="301" /> it was a tramway running along lines stopping too frequently with the kind of traffic that could be offered.  There has since been an improvement in various sectors of the West Cork area in regard to the amount of goods and the number of passengers carried by CIE.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy quite rightly raised the question of whether the fares are cheap enough on CIE.  Whenever I speak to the Board I say to them: &ldquo;Do try some more experiments with cheap fares.&rdquo;  In fact, the range of cheap fares has expanded over the past three years, between weekend fares and cheap excursion fares of various kinds and then all the schoolchildren tours and so on.  I think they are going to try another experiment, but I do not know if they have already started it, with family fares.  I have emphasised the need for examining experiments in cheap fares and they are going as far as possible in that.  CIE are making a big effort.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy suggested that Dublin city bus fares were expensive.  They are not expensive compared with any other similar route in England or anywhere else.  The profits have gone down and the profit made per bus passenger journey is absolutely meagre, something between one-seventh to one-ninth of a penny per passenger journey.  He also complained about provincial fares. At certain fare ranges and certain distances they are comparable and I know CIE are trying an experiment with weekend provincial cheap fares on their buses which I hope will be successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You can travel 30 miles on a bus in England for 2/6d. You will not get that far here for 2/6d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think that is true.  Deputy Byrne speaks in an exaggerated way about CIE bus services in Dublin.  There have been numerous re-routings and the provision of additional services in the past few years.  I do not think I need repeat all the steps taken by CIE to get over the difficulty of bunching&mdash;centralised control of traffic, the use of radio cars and the experiment going to be undertaken <Col N="302" /> with television are some of them. But I want to make it clear to the House that CIE have done their best by their own personal inspection, and there is no other way of trying to improve the city bus services than by data processing information received personally from a sufficiently high proportion of the people of Dublin to make it authentic.  I do not see what else they can do.  This method is accepted in the modern world of market research.  CIE have interviewed 227,000 passengers out of a total of 718,000 passengers on where they were going, where they came from and what kind of bus service they use.  The results show that, taking it by and large no major change is required in the bus pattern in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>A Deputy suggested that there ought to be a circular service.  The consultant is testing the possibility of such a service, which would run around the North and South Circular Roads and cross the Liffey at Butt Bridge and Islandbridge.  The assessor of this data processing said that the case for the circular service appears to be weak. But it has been mentioned so often as a possibility it is essential that the matter be finally resolved on a scientific basis.  Then he goes on to refer to the whole of the examination and to state that it is unlikely that any radical changes in our existing routes would be recommended.  He does indicate, of course, that if there were some change in the character of the road structure in Dublin, obviously they would have to look again at the data processing analysis that has taken place.</P>
      <P>I do not see what more one can do. It is a great credit to the management of CIE and particularly the Dublin bus manager that, having made numerous changes himself, when these people were interviewed it was found there was no need to make any marked change in the pattern of service.  There is also the final fact that only 11 per cent of the passengers have to transfer to a second route to complete their journey.  The number is only seven per cent at peak periods.  That indicates, too, the fact that the pattern of services was correctly predicted and carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> Deputy Mullen referred in passing, without very much criticism, to the licences issued to the operators of motor coach tours originating abroad. In order to qualify for the licences given by my Department tours must be of a duration of not less than four nights stay in the State and confined to persons normally resident outside Ireland who have made advance reservations. As far as I know, the issue of these licences has done no harm to CIE.  We issued 91 licences, in fact, and I hope we will issue more.  It has not harmed CIE.  On the contrary, they have begun to operate tours in Britain, not at present with their own coaches but they could apparently use their own, since conditions of operation there are very much the same as here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the delay by the standing arbitrator in deciding redundancy compensation claims.  I have already dealt with this in reply to a Question from the Deputy and pointed out that these people can now apply to the Circuit Court and this should not be subject to any great delay.  Any case previously referred to the standing arbitrator not determined within three months of the passing of the Act could be referred to the Circuit Court.  From what I have seen of the remaining cases, in most cases the plaintiff concerned has already been paid some capital sum or is already receiving some form of annuity.  Therefore, there is hardly anyone left deprived completely of some form of redundancy pay or compensation.  Only marginal cases are left.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully made reference to certain CIE bus-train links which are defective.  I would be glad if the Deputy would write me again about this.  I will take it up.  Some of the explanations I have had from CIE are inadequate, I think, and I will tackle CIE once again, if the Deputy will write me.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully also referred to the fact that the rail service to Bettystown station and the number of stops there appeared to be limited. If he will write to me about that I will take it up again with CIE.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons asked questions about CIE containers.  These are being developed, especially for rail, for use in the export trade, by CIE, in conjunction with the shipping companies and British Railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Lindsay referred to the announced decision of CIE to build a hotel at Dún Laoghaire.  Traffic developments and the enormous growth in car ferry traffic, including the introduction of a new car ferry by British Rail next year, are one of the reasons why they have made this decision.  A changing pattern in tourism, whereby more and more holiday makers are turning to inclusive tours, is another reason.  It is imperative to promote facilities for inclusive tours in this country if we are to maintain our tourist growth.  Block booking for this is essential.  It has been found that the inclusive tour business has been severely restricted by the inability of the promoters to effect block bookings. CIE are not subsidised in any form, directly or indirectly.  They are a particularly suitable agency for providing accommodation for this <Col N="305" /> particular kind of business because of their long experience in the hotel trade and the extensive promotional work undertaken to capture inclusive tours and motoring holiday visitors.  The traffic generated will be largely new and will not be the same traffic as now goes to Dún Laoghaire.  This must be so if tourism is to expand.  In every port area there are varying types of traffic, through traffic, purely transitory traffic and people who come there wanting to spend a holiday in the area. In this I am referring to ports which are also resorts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne spoke as though he were not a member of the &ldquo;Just Society&rdquo; element in Fine Gael.  He really did speak in the most conservative way, as though he had virtually a horror of all State enterprise, wanted nothing but private enterprise and suspected that all State enterprise was in some way doubtful and not to be encouraged, particularly where it competed effectively with private enterprise on a profitable basis.  I want to say this to Deputy Byrne, that we are going to need a great many hotel bedrooms in this country in the next five years, and my attitude to this is that if private enterprise cannot provide them and if I am convinced by Bord Fáilte that the provision of hotels by CIE is justified and that it will take nobody's living or employment away, I am perfectly prepared to ask CIE to fill any gaps that remain in the provision of hotels, particularly in the B class, the field of the 35/- to 45/- a night bedroom, which is no longer an expensive charge in the European world.  Deputy Lindsay referred to a motel he found in the Netherlands where he got bed and breakfast for, I think, 20/- or 25/-. There is a new motel, for example, in the Limerick area where similar facilities can be obtained.</P>
    <P>Various people asked why should CIE start a motel in Killarney.  Killarney is bursting at the seams with people.  People have found it impossible to get accommodation in the peak season in Killarney, and it is an excellent place to expand.  Hotel accommodation is required at growth points, and there is nothing we can do about <Col N="306" /> that.  As time goes by, there will be more guesthouses and hotels in the remote areas, and indeed they are growing and expanding, but in every country of the world there are certain growth points for tourism where people want to go.  There are people who prefer to stay in Galway city or Salthill and to go out each day into the country and to picnic or take lunch in a small hotel.  However, there are other people who will grow in numbers and who really want to go to isolated areas where there is absolute peace and tranquillity. There will be a demand for both types of accommodation, and, in reply to Deputy Lindsay and others, let me say there are very high grants for isolated hotels with a short season. Deputy Lindsay, in rather extravagant mood, suggested that as CIE rail services lost and as there was a social service element in CIE, that company might as well put their motels in places where they are almost certainly going to fail financially.  I fail to follow Deputy Lindsay's argument.</P>
    <P>There have been various questions in regard to the CIE monopoly position in relation to road freight.  There are 1,000 merchandise licences and I think, roughly, an equal number of CIE lorries.  We have been examining the whole question of the laws under which both carriers operate, and we have made many amendments in the regulations in regard to freight transport and agricultural produce.  We have had no complaints from any of the livestock people, having made substantial changes in the arrangements for moving livestock.  We shall be making some other changes in the future, not of a major kind, not changing the general principle which I think has been found satisfactory to everybody.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore said something about housing and slums, about the concept of Dublin as a museum and the priority of eliminating slums.  I want to speak very strongly on this subject.  Deputy Moore, perhaps, did not expand what he had to say sufficiently, but there is nothing which need prevent the elimination of the slum problem and at the same time the maintaining of the best of our 18th century architecture in Dublin. What the best of it is and the limitation on it is not a matter for me to decide, but there is no reason why we should not preserve the greatest of our 18th century architecture and there is no reason why we should not maintain the harmony of houses in certain other areas, as indicated so clearly in the very interesting report prepared by An Taisce which, I understand, is being largely adopted by Dublin Corporation. I understand that they have adopted, in general, the ideas of An Taisce in regard to the preservation of the beauties of Dublin, and I hope they will stick to that.  There is no reason why that could not be done while at the same time ensuring that the housing problem will be solved.  I think everybody in the Dáil agrees with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have shown their interest in the preservation of 18th century architecture by spending, over the course of about 15 years, nearly £500,000 on the rehabilitation of the very great buildings in the city: the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham and Dublin Castle.  They have shown their interest in preserving historic monuments, and there would be many other instances I could give of work done by the Board of Works to preserve ancient buildings.  When one considers the total cost over a period of 30 years of ensuring that the best of 18th <Col N="308" /> century Dublin will be preserved, in relation to the total cost of rehousing all the people of Dublin, it will be seen that by State contributions, by Dublin Corporation contribution and a contribution from the people themselves voluntarily, we shall be able to afford it over the next 30 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen quite rightly raised the question, in a slightly exaggerated form, of the operation of CERT, and as to whether the people trained by the CERT training organisation would be employed full-time.  It is intended that those who come from CERT should be employed full-time.  Indeed, we need more recruitment to staff adequately the projected increase in hotel accommodation in the future.  There is liaison between CERT and Bord Fáilte, and one of the directors of Bord Fáilte is a director of CERT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The best way to get recruits is to see that those who are trained are adequately paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Then again in connection with liaison of one kind or another, a member of Bord Fáilte is a director of each of the regional tourist organisations, so there is liaison in that regard, too.  Deputy Mullen knows there is no country in the world where tourism exists and where there is not some element of non-permanent employment. We have not the luck of having two full seasons such as the Austrians have, with ski-ing in the winter, and the summer season as well.  Yet even there, there is a rise and fall in the numbers employed. What we are looking for is the largest degree of permanent employment.  At the same time, we are aware of the fact that there will be temporary employees in some of the summer hotels. Indeed in many rural areas it works very successfully.  Although we want to see the people employed all the year round, there is excellent employment given to the sons and daughters of people on farms, and in that way it helps to raise the farm income.  There are other people who are employed on a retainer basis during winter or who go abroad during winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> Deputy Corry referred to the cost of beet haulage.  It is accepted that hauliers' charges for beet transport are lower than CIE charges.  This arises because of the inescapable higher costs which CIE incur through pension costs, overtime rates and so on.  The system under which CIE plate private lorries is designed to reduce capital investment by CIE in transport equipment which would be used for only part of the year, while at the same time giving a higher level of utilisation to private lorries.  This policy is clearly in the national interest.  I have had very little complaint on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore referred to the character of the CIE buses.  So far as I know there have been 176 new buses of one kind or another.  I think those are the ones that have been constructed in a recent period.  The character of the buses is improving as the years go by. Every effort is made to clean the buses but I have myself noticed that there are dirty CIE buses.  There is a regular programme for cleaning.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked for the major improvements that resulted from the Report of the Tavistock Institute on Human Relations after their discussions with CIE.  I am glad to tell the House&mdash;I have already stated this on another occasion&mdash;that the moment this committee started making inquiries, CIE secured a lot of interesting information.  Improvements were undertaken long before the report was actually published.  I have always encouraged all the State companies to take all the advice they can on personnel management in order that there will be contentment of staff and satisfaction in work.</P>
    <P>Action was taken by CIE including the following things: schedules were altered and the capacity and scheduled times were increased during peak hours; special measures were taken to reduce the number of mechanical failures in buses; new centralised paying-in offices were provided where the conductors' cash is mechanically counted; improved pensions were awarded and improved sick pay; the driving school was expanded and the number of conductors trained as <Col N="310" /> drivers was trebled since 1963-64. There were various improvements in work, pay, and so on, but I need not go into those.  They were part of a long term operation.  Better uniforms were provided and improved staff facilities which I have seen myself were provided.  They are excellent.  Those were provided in the Summerhill, Ringsend and Clontarf garages.  New administrative and recreation centres were built in Conyngham Road and work is almost completed on a similar installation at Donnybrook.  Showers, lockers, canteens and games rooms are provided in the new buildings.</P>
    <P>The busmen have been brought into closer contact with the management through the decentralisation of the management of the Dublin city services. This was planned in 1964-65 and came into operation in November, 1966, when seven districts were established each with a district manager and each, with the exception of the central district, containing a bus depot and a garage.  This undoubtedly is one of the most important suggestions recommended by the Tavistock inquiry during the course of the examination, in order to make the busman feel he was in touch with people of whose existence he was aware and that his ideas and routine inquiries and complaints were not lost in the vast central complex at Kingsbridge.  A very valuable change was made.</P>

      <P>I think this was done by CIE to encourage more public interest in the necessity for a sort of comprehensive examination of all the traffic needs in Dublin and going far beyond the establishment of clearways. This is something in which the Gardaí, Dublin Corporation and CIE were involved.  I am not sure that it was very effective.  In fact the campaign is over.  I was not particularly keen on it, to be quite frank.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan tried to foist on to CIE the responsibility for measures taken to change the bus stops. He went on about this at great length. The Gardaí, the Department of Local Government and the Corporation deal with measures to alleviate traffic problems. The Commissioner of the Gardaí initiates such action as he thinks necessary to facilitate the traffic flow and reduce congestion.  CIE are consulted but there is no good in Deputy Ryan giving the impression to the public that CIE alter the bus stops and are mainly responsible for altering the bus stops.  Nothing of the kind happens.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Ryan also, there are some Sunday summer services by CIE to Bray.  The future use of the railways is visualised but the plan is really only an outline.  An Foras Forbartha is proceeding with proposals for a transportation survey which will identify the role of public transport including the railways in the Dublin and other areas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan made allegations about wrong destinations on buses.  I have noticed this myself and I am asking to have it inquired into.  Deputy Ryan is right.  I have seen some absolutely crazy numbers on my own bus route.</P>

      <P>I should like to have the particulars.  A number of Deputies on both sides of the House raised the question of CIE pension levels.  I am referring now to pre-April, 1963, pensioners. I have also indicated in reply to questions that the pension plus the contributory old age pension in the case of one particular group of pensioners amounts to £6 7s a week for a married man and £4 2s in the case of an unmarried man.  I have decided to ask CIE to examine this whole position again, particularly now that the Transport Act is expiring and in the ambit of rates and fares levels and the general economic position.  I hope to be able to make a statement later.  It is true to say that the number of pensioners is diminishing.  They have been fortified with contributory old age pensions and unemployment benefit&mdash;I am speaking of 1963 pensioners&mdash;and the others, I think, are not badly looked after at all.  I shall examine it again.  I think the Deputies will be satisfied with that statement.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay said that he lost a bag and it was not returned to him for 13 days.  Did he contact the CIE area manager?  Did he contact anybody?  We always get trivial complaints of one kind or another in regard to the State companies but I have had very few complaints of this kind.  I hope he contacted the area manager and asked him to investigate the circumstances of his bag taking 13 days to go from Donegal to Enniscrone.  It is most unusual. About 85 per cent of all CIE freight traffic is delivered within 24 hours.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy <Col N="313" /> Moore, my Department is not responsible for any defects that have arisen through the provision of clearways in the centre of the city.  It is a matter for either the Minister for Justice in the case of taxis or the Dublin Corporation or the other authorities in connection with the position of shops or vans or any other type of transport.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon made reference to the action taken by customs staffs in certain areas.  I have not had many complaints about this.  Deputy Dillon asked for full particulars of State investment in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I gave that to him.  It is £9.4 million.  He also implied that he would like to know how far it was considered to be an economic operation in the sense of how many people were employed for the money invested.  I have never done a complete study of this; it is very difficult to do.  The Shannon Free Airport Development Company did one which included all the housing and all the receipts received for everything amounted to about £1,500 per employee.  That is not excessive by any means in relation to the amount that is frequently invested to employ one person.  I can assure the House on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not including loans in the amount.  The total amount which has been advanced is over £19 million and the number of people employed is 3,344, 1,900 of whom are men and the rest girls.  You can prove anything statistically and I think the Minister's figures could be read in a different way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>Deputy Treacy again raised the question of industrial relations in the Shannon Free Airport Development Estate.  I do not propose <Col N="314" /> to speak on this matter because I do not think I could do any good by saying anything except to say that the wage levels there are not low.  They are, in some cases, higher than those in the district.  I hope that industrial relations will continue to be satisfactory and if there are any difficulties there at the moment that they will be solved satisfactorily.  Let nobody imagine that the wage levels are depressed because that is simply not true. One has to take into account the apprenticeship element at Shannon because it is so new.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different matter and the Deputy knows it would not be much use for anybody to start intervening in regard to that or saying anything about it.  I hope it will be settled satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell had a curious sort of double think about the Shannon Industrial Estate and whether it was desirable or not.  In one sentence he seemed to favour it and in the next he was questioning its future, <i>et cetera.</i> I do not want to misquote Deputy T. O'Donnell.  I think he does really approve of the Shannon Industrial Estate.  In answer to him, it is going to be allowed to grow to a total of 6,000 people living in the area and then the position will be re-examined.  The Shannon Industrial Estate and Shannon Airport employ people from all over County Clare, County Limerick, from Ennis town and from Limerick city as he knows well.  It employs a variety of people from around the countryside. I think there are some eight more industrial and commercial establishments promised at Shannon.</P>
      <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell is wrong about the air freight.  On the whole the industrial estate companies at Shannon do make use of air freight to a satisfactory degree.  They provide half of the total air freight at the airport and the air freight has been increased at the estate by 37 per cent from 1965 to 1966.</P>

All this is a question of priorities.  Assuming that Galway and Waterford operate successfully there will be many other centres.  There is the Monaghan centre and Sligo and Castlebar.

      <P>I want to say something else.  This is a comment which has not been made at all recently and there may be people who will disagree with me.  The value of a customs free area is absolutely limited.  It was interesting to have a customs free area in the Shannon area.  There are some customs free areas elsewhere but in the modern world, where customs procedures <Col N="317" /> can be speeded up, I know for a fact that there are certain areas in Europe that are not customs free areas and where there are factories and the movement of goods in and out of the factories is just as quick as it would be anywhere else.  Once you have a factory and assuming in the ordinary way that the people who direct factories are honest and are not smugglers, and once the customs officials know what is coming to that factory and going out of it, the paper work can be very small indeed.  The idea that a miracle can be achieved overnight by surrounding an area in Ireland with a customs free boundary is just not realistic.</P>

      <P>This year I have only the one Vote to present to the House, that for Public Works and Buildings.  The Estimate exceeds £9 million for the first time and is more than £900,000 higher than last year's.</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, the Special Employment Schemes Office ceased to exist as a separate entity on 31st March, 1967.</P>
      <P>The first three subheads cover the administrative expenses of the Office of Public Works and I have no special comment to make unless any Deputy wants further information.</P>
      <P>Subhead D provides the funds for acquisition of sites for new Garda stations and other public buildings.  It includes provision this year for the purchase of about 57 acres on the northern side of the Hill of Tara.  The purpose is to secure full State control and ensure easier access to the whole of this famous national monument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I pass to Subhead E, I think I might digress and report to the Dáil on the work of the Office of Public Works in the past ten years.  Planning for the future need not dispense us from the duty of giving an account of our stewardship in the past and a period of a decade is a suitable one to review on an occasion like this.  I have been <Col N="319" /> invited by one distinguished Deputy to tell the story of the Board of Works and perhaps this instalment will help to give a composite picture of activities that sometimes appear to be of relatively small importance.</P>
    <P>One hears betimes references to the dilatory methods of the Board of Works in what are expected to be serious commentaries on current affairs addressed to the general public, although I must express my gratitude for the many appreciative letters and comments which have reached us, sometimes from unexpected quarters. With some verifiable facts before them, Deputies and the public will be able to see better the true position.</P>
    <P>The activities of my Office fall into a few main categories.  The architectural and engineering services are the major ones.  The national monuments service is the largest and best know of a number of other lesser activities.</P>
    <P>In the ten years to 31st March, 1967, £30 million has been spent by the Board of Works on architectural works. This included £2 million for furniture for new buildings.  The bulk of the £30 million was spent on primary schools.  They absorbed more than £19 million.  There is evidence that they would have cost a great deal more for no greater output were it not for the efficient organisation we have built up to deal with the design, contractual arrangements and the supervision of the construction of these schools.  The balance, £11 million, was spent principally on building works for the Departments of Justice, Finance, Agriculture and Fisheries, and Posts and Telegraphs.  These are the chief Departments but there is no Department which has not been served.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has no reason to be ashamed of its record in school building.  The total number of primary schools is 4,600.  In the ten years with which I am dealing, 842 primary schools were built.  That gives an average of three new schools every fortnight.  That is not all: in addition, 552 other schools were extended or improved.  In other words, nearly one <Col N="320" /> in every three schools standing today was either built or modernised since 1957.  Expenditure averaged almost £2,000,000 a year; the total was £19,200,000.</P>
    <P>These statistics might be supplemented by an indication of what has been accomplished in a couple of counties.  Donegal and Waterford are at opposite ends of the country and are dissimilar in many ways.  There are about 90 national schools in Waterford; Donegal, with a more widely scattered population has more than 300, the majority having comparatively small enrolments.  In the ten years, 51 Donegal schools were replaced and 42 were substantially improved.  In Waterford, 22 new schools were built and 18 improved or enlarged.  Modern conditions for almost 12,000 pupils, more than a third of the total, were provided in the two counties.  These figures relate only to permanent pupil places.  Many other pupils have been accommodated in the fine prefabricated classrooms which were provided rapidly to meet urgent needs.</P>
    <P>Other counties show similar results. In Cavan, 31 schools were replaced or improved; in Roscommon, the total was 58; in Tipperary, 81.</P>
    <P>Our small research section has managed to achieve radical improvements in the design of schools and of school furniture.  The modern classroom is a self-contained unit; each has independent toilet and cloakroom and direct access from outside.  No class interrupts another on its way in or out.  It is centrally heated, insulated and sound-proofed and colourfully decorated.  The furniture consists of light tables and chairs which can readily be stacked or re-arranged to permit more freedom and variety of activity.</P>
    <P>A fine example of the latest school design is St. Paul's Infants' School at Athlone.  It has ten classrooms with an assembly hall, a library and teachers' rooms.  Everything possible has been done in the planning and construction of this school to make the introduction to school-life attractive and comfortable for the 400 infant pupils.  The rooms are bright, airy and gaily-coloured.  The assembly hall has been planned with no fixed <Col N="321" /> stage; instead there are moveable timber units which can be assembled into any required position so that the hall can be used for diverse purposes. Drill displays, choral practice, concerts and other activities requiring a stage can all be held there, suitably arranged. The attractive playground equipment must appeal to the pupils.  They have among other things a climbing frame, and imaginative use has been made of concrete to form tunnels and giant mushrooms.  So much for schools.</P>
    <P>Works of a capital nature for the Department of Justice cost £3 million in the ten year period.  A planned programme of Garda station building was initiated, 63 new Garda stations were built and 20 others were greatly improved, the majority in the second half of the decade.  The new Divisional Headquarters at Crumlin is one of the biggest Garda stations in the country&mdash; it cost about £59,000.</P>
    <P>For the Department of Finance, which I need not remind Deputies includes the Revenue Commissioners, a variety of works was completed at a cost of £1.8 million.  Substantial new Government offices have been built at Tralee and Wexford; the Cross Block at Dublin Castle has been completely rebuilt and faithfully reproduced; the central heating station which heats this House has been completely renewed enabling turf to replace coal; major improvements to the mail boat pier at Dún Laoghaire have been carried out and the temporary car ferry terminal was built there strictly on time.  The collaboration of our architects and engineers in this project seems to have given a result which reassured those who had misgivings about the aesthetic aspects of the project.  I am told there will be protests when the traffic moves away from the temporary terminal, which has become a tourist amenity, to the permanent terminal now being rapidly brought to completion.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1.3 million was expended on buildings for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  Many of the works carried out were of the first importance and Deputies may already be familiar with some of them which were extensively covered in issues of <Col N="322" />&ldquo;Oibre&rdquo;, our occasional public relations journal.  I will mention a few.</P>
    <P>Two important new agricultural colleges were erected, at Athenry and Clonakilty, at a cost of £220,000.  A pig progeny testing station was completed at the Munster Institute in Cork. At Abbotstown, County Dublin, a research unit was erected for research and experiment in the field of artificial insemination.  At Abbotstown, too, a new veterinary field station and a foundation stock farm have been built. Residences were provided there for the Director of the Veterinary Research Laboratory and for the farm manager. An experimental animals farm yard with accommodation for animals is now going up.</P>
    <P>A soil survey and testing laboratory was completed at Johnstown Castle, County Wexford, now administered by An Foras Talúntais.  New buildings and a laboratory were provided at Backweston Farm, County Kildare, for developing and propagating new strains of cereals and root crops.</P>
    <P>Extensive alterations and additions have been made to the Veterinary College, Ballsbridge, Dublin.  Among a number of other services carried out for the same Department was the setting up of a laboratory and other facilities at Abbotstown for studying fish disease.</P>
    <P>Besides the sum of £1.3 million charged against this Vote for services for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs a further £1 million was spent on the erection of 200 new telephone exchanges, including the one at Dame Court, Dublin, which was completed last year and cost £180,000.  Nine new post offices were erected and 18 others substantially improved.  Nine other new buildings were designed and completed for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs including the Dublin Central Sorting Office at the rear of Connolly Station, recently opened, which cost over £800,000, and district sorting offices and telephone exchanges at Coolock-Raheny and Finglas.  I hope I have given a fair picture to Deputies of the architectural achievements and I will now cast a look at the engineering activities of my Office.</P>
    <P>The main engineering service is <Col N="323" /> drainage.  It would be an easy job to give a lot of facts and figures about drainage without conveying any real picture of the work and problems involved in getting a scheme under way. Firstly, I might say a few words about the work and problems involved in getting a drainage scheme going.</P>
    <P>The Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, provides for the carrying out of arterial drainage works on the basis of comprehensive schemes for entire catchment areas.  The more important catchments have been classified into 28 major and 30 minor categories.</P>
    <P>Before any drainage scheme can be prepared, a detailed engineering and valuation survey of the catchment area is needed.  The engineering survey of an average major catchment may involve from three to four years of painstaking detailed work in the catchment. For example, in the Boyne catchment about fifteen hundred miles of rivers. streams and channels had to be investigated in detail.  Levels, longitudinal and cross sectional measurements were taken at close intervals throughout the network of watercourses.  Almost 5,000 bridges ranging from small field structures to large public road or railway bridges, as well as 150 weirs and 50 water supply intakes, were examined. All farms or other properties on the channel banks were studied in order to see how they might be affected by the scheme.</P>
    <P>In a valuation survey, a thorough search of the catchment area is made with a view to ascertaining particulars of all lands capable of improvement by arterial drainage.  An estimate is made of the probable increase in land value which will follow drainage works.  This is important as the cost of work must bear a reasonable relationship to the benefit it brings.  The Boyne valuation survey disclosed that about 112,000 acres of agricultural land and 26,000 acres of bog could be improved by drainage but that the cost of improving about one sixth of the damaged agricultural land would be uneconomic.</P>
    <P>The design work on the Boyne involved detailed study of the rainfall, run-off and other hydrometric data <Col N="324" /> collected continuously since 1940; the working out of gradients and cross sections and the solution of problems of water rights and water supplies, sewage disposal systems, bridges, etc.</P>
    <P>When a scheme has been prepared and approved by the Commissioners of Public Works requirements of the 1945 Act fall to be complied with.  A copy of the scheme must be sent for exhibition to the council of every county affected.  Three months must be given to the county councils to submit observations. Only when all observations from the councils and from other interested parties have been considered and necessary amendments made to the scheme following consultation with other Government Departments may the scheme be submitted to the Minister for Finance for confirmation.  It must be shown to be economically sound.</P>
    <P>I have given this outline of the steps leading up to the actual work stage of a drainage scheme so that Deputies will see why so much time elapses between the decision to survey a catchment and the beginning of the work on the river.  The construction works introduce additional problems.  Recruiting, organising and supervising a large and scattered labour force of many classes of workers and negotiating with landowners are not the easiest of these problems.  I feel I should add here a tribute to the engineers and to the men on the schemes for the fact that there has never been any serious trade dispute resulting in the loss of earnings or disruption of work.</P>
    <P>During the past ten years expenditure on construction works totalled £8½ million, surveys cost £200,000 and the purchase and maintenance of plant and machinery cost a little more than £3½ million&mdash;about £12 million in all. Two hundred and ninety thousand acres of land and 88,000 acres of bog have benefited from drainage schemes already carried out, and, in addition, 23,000 acres of land have been protected by embankments against flooding. An average of 1,200 men a year has been employed on construction works and 145 on maintenance of completed works.  About 100 men are employed <Col N="325" /> in the Central Engineering Workshop in Dublin on the maintenance and overhaul of machinery and plant.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works is responsible for a wide variety of marine works, ranging from Dún Laoghaire harbour and the two State harbours at Howth and Dunmore East, which are administered, maintained and developed by the Commissioners, to the investigation and improvement of many small slips and landing places along the Atlantic seaboard.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire harbour is the main passenger port in the county, handling threequarters of a million passengers annually, largely in the summer months.  During the ten years being reviewed, extensive improvements have been carried out.  Marine structures over a century old have been completely modernised at a cost of about £400,000; extensive building works, aimed at reducing delays and discomfort for passengers during the peak travel periods, are well advanced; more than £300,000 has been spent to date.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the scale the Office of Public Works examine proposals for improvements to relatively small landing places of purely local interest, sponsored by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Some 180 proposals were investigated in detail; of these 65 were found to be technically feasible and justified on economic grounds. More than £200,000 has been spent on works by direct labour on these projects by the Office of Public Works.  A number of larger schemes, not warranting the description of major fishery harbours but of more than local utility have also been investigated and works averaging about £30,000 per annum have been executed.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works act as technical advisers to the Harbours Section of the Department of Transport and Power, examining proposals prepared by consultants and submitted by local harbour authorities, discussing details with those consultants, advising on the placing of contracts and subsequently <Col N="326" /> providing general technical supervision of works in progress,</P>
    <P>Responsibility for national monuments was first placed on the Commissioners of Public Works under the Church Disestablishment Act of 1869. In 1880 the ruins of more than 130 churches, other ecclesiastical buildings and structures such as high crosses were vested in them.  Later enactments empowered the Commissioners to become either owners or guardians of other national monuments and the number in their care has steadily increased. The Commissioners now care for about 800 monuments, ranging in antiquity during a period of not less than fifty centuries.  The year 1969 will mark the first centenary of the transfer to the Commissioners of Public Works of responsibility for the national monuments service and I am considering how this occasion can be suitably marked.</P>
    <P>The National Monuments Branch of the Office has an increasing volume of work in the past decade.  As it might be tedious to recite details, I shall mention but a few.  The large Elizabethan manor-house added in 1565 to the original Ormonde Castle at Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, dating from 1309, has been put into a sound state of preservation.  The floors, roof and windows are retained and the 16th century fireplaces and plasterwork are excellent examples of their kind.  The monastic sites at Clonmacnoise and Mellifont have been cleaned up, tidied, and given improved presentation.  A popular attraction at Clonmacnoise is the outdoor museum which displays a fine collection of early Christian grave-slabs.  Archaeological investigations were carried out at both Clonmacnoise and Mellifont.</P>
    <P>The National Monuments Acts assign the duty of preservation rather than the privilege of restoration, to the Commissioners of Public Works. These restrictions have not been considered to prevent the Commissioners from co-operating in a number of important restoration works of national monuments, the expenditure, in excess of what was justified by the needs of preservation, being provided from outside sources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> Bunratty Castle, Co. Clare, a large tower-house dating from 1460, has been fully restored and now plays an important part in the tourist business. The castle houses an important collection of medieval furniture, pictures, tapestries and stained glass. Rothe House, Kilkenny, an Elizabethan merchant's house, has been fully restored and now houses the Museum of the Kilkenny Archaeological Society as well as Bord Fáilte's tourist office.  Ballintubber Abbey, County Mayo, celebrated its 750th anniversary in 1966.  The occasion will be remembered by Deputies without any prompting from me.  The abbey church has been in continuous use since its foundation in 1216 by Cathal O'Connor, King of Connacht. The work of restoration and the extensive archaeological excavation which accompanied it drew widespread public attention and commendation.</P>
    <P>The repair of the home of Daniel O'Connell, &ldquo;The Liberator&rdquo;, at Derrynane, County Kerry, was completed and the house was opened to the public in August last.  I am glad of this opportunity to express publicly my appreciation of the public-spirited men who initiated and contributed so much of their money and energies to this project.</P>
    <P>In 1965, the second stage of the archaeological survey of Ireland was begun.  Work is already well under way in County Louth, a rich archaeological region.  It is a fundamental project which will take many years to complete.  At least it has been started and it will be continued, without intermission, until it has been completed.</P>
    <P>During the ten years I am reviewing, 27 monuments were taken into full State care&mdash;13 by means of vesting and 14 by guardianship deeds.  The protection of the National Monuments Acts was extended to 137 other monuments; 118 were statutorily listed as monuments and 19 were the subject of preservation orders.  Expenditure on works in the ten years was £376,000.</P>
    <P>The Office, apart from the work of <Col N="328" /> the National Monuments Branch, has done much to preserve the fabric of some fine old State buildings.  Very extensive work has been done at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, which, when the works are finished, will be opened to the public as a showpiece of 17th century architecture and as a folk museum.  Defective stonework at the Four Courts and the National Library has been replaced and the life of these and other public buildings has been prolonged.</P>
    <P>I shall now return to the proposals for 1967-68.  Primary schools as usual get the lion's share of the provision under Subhead E.  A sum of £3,000,000 is made available for erection and improvement of schools.  Several large central schools are being planned which, as I mentioned last year, will have such amenities as general purpose rooms and fitted kitchens which could not be provided in smaller schools.  We continue to erect small schools where the Minister for Education requires them and improve existing schools by installing central heating, electric lighting and modern sanitation.</P>
    <P>There are some other interesting items covered by Subhead E.  The works at Leinster House are nearly completed.  The new kitchen and diningrooms have been handed over and are now in full use.  The adaptation of the former restaurant area to provide refreshment rooms and a Press diningroom is in progress.</P>
    <P>Work on the reconstruction of the drawingroom block of the State Apartments, Dublin Castle, is well advanced. External work is virtually completed and the services and finishes are now being attended to.  The whole is expected to be finished early in 1968.</P>
    <P>Work at the Kennedy Memorial Park, County Wexford, is being carried out on behalf of the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands and also for the Department of Agriculture. The administrative building for the Forestry Division is in course of construction and work has begun on the provision of roads and a water supply.  The funds for the Department of Lands part of the project are being provided from the Vote for Forestry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> The £300,000 contract for the extension to the National Gallery is progressing satisfactorily.  The entire cost is being met from voted moneys and not a penny of the Shaw Bequest Funds will be involved.  At the Public Record Office a two-storey addition is being provided for the Land Registry; this is now moving rapidly towards completion.</P>
    <P>The statue of Rebert Emmet, which was presented to the nation last year by a group of Irish-Americans, has been erected at St. Stephen's Green West, opposite the house where Emmet lived.  A memorial to Roger Casement in Glasnevin Cementery is planned.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for commencing work on the new Stamping Branch at Dublin Castle for the Revenue Commissioners. The need for better accommodation for this Branch has long been recognised.</P>
    <P>Another project, which it is hoped will be started this year, is the building of a new detention centre at Finglas to replace the present place of detention at Marlboro House, Glasnevin.</P>
    <P>A sum of £320,550 is included for architectural projects for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>Additional facilities for the vaterinary college are to be provided at Abbotstown farm and the research laboratory there is to be extended.  A veterinary laboratory has been erected at Sligo and similar laboratories are proposed for Limerick, Cork, Athlone and Kilkenny, with dairy produce laboratories at Cork and Limerick. Contracts have been placed for the erection of the veterinary laboratory at Limerick and for the laboratories at Cork and tenders have been received for the buildings at Athlone.  Avondale House, County Wicklow, is being adapted as a forestry training and conference centre.  A new dormitory block is being built near the house. The work is nearing completion.</P>
    <P>A further sum of £215,000 is provided for the erection of new Garda Stations and Married Quarters for gardaí and for improvement of existing stations.  All the stations will be planned and erected by the Office of Public Works and the married quarters <Col N="330" /> by that Office and by the National Building Agency Ltd.</P>
    <P>The extension of the garage and workshop, accommodation at the Garda Depot, Phoenix Park, is now almost completed.</P>
    <P>A sum of £190,000 is required for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Four large new warehouses are being built at St. John's Road, Dublin, to provide 50,000 square feet of storage space.  In addition the scheme will provide 8,000 square feet of office space, a canteen and workshop and a large amount of paved open storage and service roadways.  The open storage and three of the warehouses are complete.  Other main items are: new post office and engineering headquarters at Carlow and new post offices at Claremorris and Macroom.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works erects the buildings for this telephone service. Works under this heading will cost this year about £300,000 which will be met from the Telephone Capital Account.</P>
    <P>On the engineering side, £280,000 is provided for work on the permanent car ferry terminal at Dún Laoghaire. The new pier is expected to be completed and the erection of buildings commenced this year.  The terminal will be in operation for the 1969 tourist season.</P>
    <P>£225,000 is required for the continuance of works on the major fishery harbours at Dunmore East, Killybegs, and Castletownbere.  The scheme at Dunmore East has progressed satisfactorily and is now more than half completed.  Dredging has been completed at Killybegs and works for the provision of berthage facilities at the &ldquo;Black Rock&rdquo; site are going ahead well.  Dredging has been virtually completed at Castleownbere and some minor works and reclamation carried out.  Work on the main quay construction has commenced.  Additional legal powers to enable property difficulties here and at other sites to be solved are being sought by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The provision for &ldquo;Works of Economic Development&rdquo; includes expenditure on harbour improvement schemes at Kilmore Quay, County <Col N="331" /> Wexford, Skerries, County Dublin and Reen, County Cork and some dredging at Howth Harbour.</P>
    <P>The F Subheads provide for the cost of the upkeep of State premises and property and for rents where payable.</P>
    <P>Subhead F. 1 covers the maintenance of public properties including as well as some 2,400 buildings in Ireland, embassies abroad, four parks and the three State harbours.  The total provision is £1,100,000.</P>
    <P>There are about 400 public buildings in Dublin, such as Dublin Castle, GPO, Four Courts, Custom House, Government Buildings, Iveagh House, and 2,000 others throughout the country.  They include 700 garda stations, 300 primary schools maintained by the Commissioners, 150 post offices, and such buildings as agricultural colleges and schools, meteorological stations, and employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>A central building maintenance workshop was set up in 1964 as a step towards the reorganisation of the labour force of 400 employed on maintenance in the Dublin area.  Over 300 of these workmen are at present employed through contractors.  Whether that arrangement is now outmoded and should be replaced by direct employment is at present being considered.</P>
    <P>There are four parks under the control of the Commissioners&mdash;the Phoenix Park and St. Stephen's Green, Dublin, the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park, Killarney, County Kerry, and Garnish Island near Glengariff, County Cork.</P>
    <P>Plans for the further development of the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park are being prepared.  I take the opportunity of commending the initiative of the committee which has set up and is extending a folk museum scheme in Muckross House in the Park.</P>
    <P>Much urban development has occurred around the Phoenix Park and more is in sight.  These developments are bound to have some effect on the park and arrangements have been made to consult with the city and county planning authority on short- and longterm requirements.  Car-parking facilities <Col N="332" /> are being provided for the ever growing number of motorists visiting the park during the summer months.</P>
    <P>In St. Stephen's Green, a plot has been ploughed, levelled and resown and portion of it set aside for golf &ldquo;putting&rdquo; courses.  Some playground facilities have been provided for children. The mound site of the former plant houses on the west side has been developed and has been assigned to the memorial to W.B. Yeats, presented by a memorial committee.  Five hundred rose bushes, a gift from the Society of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, Portland, Oregon, United States of America, were planted in early spring this year.</P>
    <P>The gardens at Garnish Island are widely known and never fail to attract admiration.  During the year ended 31st March, 1967, there were 47,000 visitors.</P>
    <P>In passing, I might add that the Shannon Navigation, which is maintained by the Commissioners, is becoming increasingly popular with tourists for boating and pleasure cruises. Formerly the tolls were almost entirely collected from commercial users.  They have disappeared and the Shannon is mainly used now for recreational purposes. I am glad to say that since 1961 the tolls have more than trebled.</P>
    <P>Subhead F.3&mdash;Rents, Rates, etc.&mdash; shows a substantial increase for 1967-68.  The increase is again attributable, in the main, to the need to rent office accommodation in Dublin for the staffs of Government Departments.  As I explained, when introducing the Estimate last year, many State servants have been, and many still are, working in unhealthy and congested conditions in sub-standard buildings which were never designed for use as offices; some Departments were and even still some are dispersed in numbers of different buildings.  The capital that the State would have to find for the provision of its own buildings is required for other vital services.  To alleviate the accommodation problem for staffs it has been necessary to extend the renting of space in office blocks constructed by private enterprise.  Space has been rented in the new office block at 72-76 St. Stephen's Green for the staff of the Department <Col N="333" /> of Justice together with certain Branches of the Department of Finance including the Paymaster General's Office and the Estate Duty Office and also for the headquarters staff of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>The next group of subheads is the G group which deal with arterial drainage about which I have spoken generally already.</P>
    <P>The provision for G.1&mdash;Surveys shows a significant increase this year from £22,000 to £50,000.  This increase, I am glad to say, is to enable the detailed survey of the Shannon catchment to be resumed.  It was intended to commence the survey in 1965 but owing to the financial stringency which then arose, the Shannon survey like other desirable undertakings had to be postponed. As I have said before, it was the Government's intention that the investigation should be resumed as soon as circumstances would permit.  The provision now made is an earnest of that intention and I hope to make further provision in subsequent years. This is the beginning of an enormous undertaking, one of the biggest single engineering projects ever undertaken in this country, and it will severely tax the resources of the State to see it through.</P>
    <P>I said when introducing last year's Estimate that no new intermediate or embankment schemes would be surveyed for the present so that resources could be concentrated on the major and minor listed catchments.  The immediate result was an acceleration in the preparation of the Boyne and Maigue.</P>
    <P>The Boyne scheme will be on exhibition shortly and I hope the Maigue will follow soon.  As the preparatory work on these schemes finishes, technical and other staff will be freed to accelerate the other schemes in preparation, namely, the Corrib-Mask, the Erne, the Suir, the Mulkear, the Boyle, the Owenmore, the Bonet, the Dunkellin and the Lavally.  A scheme for a small border river, the Kilcoe, County Leitrim, has been prepared in consultation with the Northern Authorities and will be on exhibition shortly.  The joint survey of another border river, the Finn (Counties <Col N="334" /> Cavan and Monaghan) which commenced in 1966, was continued this year.</P>
    <P>The provision for G.2&mdash;Construction Works, although £70,000 higher than last year, is in effect the same, as the increase is only just sufficient to provide for the last round of wages increases.</P>
    <P>Works are in progress this year on four major schemes, the Inny, the Moy, the Deel and the Corrib-Headford, and on one minor scheme, the Killimor-Coppagh. The Corrib-Headford scheme has just begun.  It will take about four years to complete and will give employment to 200 men at the peak of the works.  It will benefit about 14,000 acres of land.  The Moy has still three or four years to run but the Inny, Deel and Killimor-Cappagh are much further advanced.  Work on them will begin to taper off towards the end of this year or early next year.  By then work on the Boyne and, I hope, the Maigue will have started.</P>
    <P>The provision for Embankments is not very different from last year's. Work continues at the Shannon and at Blanket Nook, County Donegal. The latter will be completed this year. The Shannon embankments are being dealt with in sections.  Three have been completed and another, the Maigue section, will be completed this year. Work has started on a further section stretching from Ringmoylan to Foynes; this will cost about £135,000 for the protection of about 1,300 acres of land. It ought to be finished within two years.</P>
    <P>The additional minor schemes provision shows a small increase on last year.  Two schemes, the Abbey in County Donegal and the Brickley in County Waterford, which were started in 1964 and 1965 respectively, will finish and work on the Cloonburn, County Donegal, which commenced last March, will be continued.  Another small scheme, the Knockcroghery, County Roscommon, has commenced. Eight other minor schemes are at various stages; some have been held up by the restriction of capital.  One of these small schemes, for the Burnfoot and Skeoge Rivers in County Donegal, has been on exhibition; it is <Col N="335" /> of unusual interest inasmuch as it will relieve conditions on the other side of the Border in the vicinity of Derry city.</P>
    <P>The provision for maintenance of completed drainage schemes under G.5 has increased from £150,000 to £179,000.  This Subhead will continue to grow as schemes are completed. This year it provided for the maintenance of 21 schemes.  I can assure Deputies that the expenditure is kept at reasonable levels.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of arterial drainage, I would like to make a few general remarks.  Since I became Parliamentary Secretary, I have received each year deputations and representations from many areas in the country. Each deputation made a good substantial cases for its own proposals.  To my regret I cannot meet all these requests as soon as I would have liked and I have had to explain that arterial drainage works can be undertaken only in accordance with the established priority lists.  They were drawn up following the passing of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, and have been accepted and upheld by all Parties and Governments.  The completion of the arterial drainage programme will take many years and many areas of the country, including my own, may have to wait longer than they might wish before the benefits of arterial drainage reach them.</P>
    <P>The £5,000 in Subhead I is required to meet the cost of maintaining the completed coast protection works at Rosslare Strand, County Wexford.</P>
    <P>Forty-two proposals for coast protection works have been received from county councils.  Preliminary examinations have been completed and reports furnished on six of these.  Owing to shortage of funds we have had to defer further consideration of proposals.  The procedure prescribed by the Coast Protection Act is protracted and I do not think that any works will commence this year.  I hope to be able to make a bigger provision next year so that construction work may begin then.</P>
    <P>Subhead J is a new subhead of the Vote.  It provides for certain schemes <Col N="336" /> formerly administered and financed by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  They comprise marine works sponsored by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The provision has been increased by £5,000 over 1966-67.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be pleased to see that there is a two-thirds increase in the provision for National Monuments.  We have succeeded in recruiting a second assistant inspector and a very full programme has been put forward.  Conservation works will be in hands at: Tintern Abbey, County Wexford; Kilcooley Abbey and Cahir Castle, County Tipperary; Kells Friary, County Kilkenny; Athenry Friary and Aughnanure Castle, County Galway; Urlaur Abbey, County Mayo; Bunratty Castle, County Clare; Liscarroll Castle, County Cork, and the Casino, Marino, Dublin.  Works in conjunction with An Bord Fáilte are proposed at Mellifont Abbey, County Louth, Works at Ballintober Abbey, County Mayo and Derrynane Abbey have been completed and those at Muckross Abbey, County Kerry, will not take much more time.  Archaeological investigations at Newgrange under Professor O'Kelly of University College, Cork, and at Knowth under Dr. Eogan of University College, Dublin, have been exciting a good deal of public interest. Other archaeological investigations are in progress at High Street, Dublin; Coomatloukane, County Kerry; Shalwy, County Donegal; Granardkille and Ardagh, County Longford; Rathcoffey, County Kildare, and Kilmagoura, County Cork. £100,000 is our estimate of what we can usefully spend this year.  I hope to have a still bigger provision for 1968-69.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> At the outset, I should like to put on record my deep appreciation of the services given to me by the staff of the Office of Public Works.  Any time I have had occasion to visit those offices or to contact them by telephone, I have received the utmost courtesy and help.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is very well documented but it is a drab and dreary report.  Undeserved credit is claimed for many things.  Voluntary associations have frequently given the lead to the Office of Public Works. They have played a major part in promoting the restoration of many of our national showpieces.  It is only of late that the Office of Public Works have entered into the picture.  That may be due to the fact that money has been scarce.</P>
    <P>Either the Department of Education or the Office of Public Works should interest themselves more deeply in this matter so that showpieces such as Derrynane, Muckross Abbey and other places and monuments of national interest will become generally known to our people.  When the home of Daniel O'Connell at Derrynane is completed, it would be a good idea if tapes were made giving a full history of the subject so that the visitor, by the mere pressing of a button, will be able to listen to an authentic commentary. Sometimes a local person has a very good knowledge of the history of a place or a person or a thing, but sometimes certain facts may inadvertently be omitted.</P>
    <P>I noticed the extensive use of tape recorders during a recent visit to the eastern States of America when I visited some of the national monuments there.  It is not a very expensive arrangement.  One of the most interesting evenings I spent there was on a visit to the battlefield at Gettysburg. The battlefield is reproduced very imaginatively.  Use is made of statues in stone to help to give a vivid impression of what took place there. At certain spots, during a tour of the battlefield itself, one could insert a nickle or a dime in a machine and <Col N="338" /> listen to a commentary on what happened when the two great American armies met.  Whether it be the responsibility of the Department of Education or of the Office of Public Works to provide for such commentaries I do not know but it would be the responsibility of the Office of Public Works to instal the equipment.  I think it would be a good idea to do so in the case of all our national monuments. The American visitor to this country is as hungry for details of Irish history as any Irish person and this system would be exceedingly useful and reliable.</P>
    <P>In passing, I might say that there is a bus tour which takes people around Gettysburg and the bus stops at certain places and one can put on earphones and listen even to the noise of guns, which adds to the atmosphere of the surroundings.  That appears to be the pattern in all the national monuments or showpieces I visited in America.  In Philadelphia, one can visit the home of Betsy Ross who is credited with the design of the first Stars and Stripes.  It is a very humble home and is preserved as it was during her lifetime at, I understand, very little expense.  Everything is plain and simple but well documented and, again, the tape-recording medium is installed, and similarly at Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington.  The tape-recording medium is so simple that one wonders why it has not been used extensively for this purpose in this country.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I must now say that I believe the major responsibility of the Office of Public Works is drainage. Like all rural Deputies, this is my prime concern.  There is a continuing demand among the rural community for it.  I regret to say that no great progress has been made in this direction. We heard talk about extra office accommodation for civil servants, and so on, and, towards the end of his speech, the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the draining of more rivers. This is but the pattern of speeches made by his predecessors in office. Admittedly, the Parliamentary Secretary promises more money but then it takes more money each year to do this <Col N="339" /> work.  With new engineering techniques, modern mechanical means and ideas to do this type of work, more work should be resulting from the money being spent.  While the increase appears in the financial columns in actual fact in terms of work less is being done and less money is being paid for this type of work.</P>
    <P>Drainage is a most important aspect of our economy.  The agricultural community depends to a great degree on the Office of Public Works, hoping that they will drain their local river so that the farmers in that area can apply to the Land Reclamation Office to have field drains laid.  In many cases such farmers, when they apply for field drains, are told that the level of the river is too high and no grant can be paid in their case.  This is a pathetic situation.  We talk about spending millions of pounds on the Shannon but in many of these small rivers minor adjustments to the water level would mean that small farmers could utilise many acres more to produce grass for livestock or to produce more crops, but as it is their land goes sour because they cannot have it drained, through no fault of their own.  Therefore, the agricultural community is not in a position to produce the maximum amount which an acre of land in such localities would be capable of producing.</P>
    <P>In some of these cases when the engineers arrive, they have with them grandiose schemes which were produced on their drawing boards, schemes such as we would like to see implemented, but very often banks do not have to be made or much work carried out; all that is required is the removing of rocks which cause small waterfalls from the river bed.  If the river level were lowered, then at a later stage the Office of Public Works, when they had more money to spend, could return and complete the plans which the engineers had on the occasion of their first visit.</P>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me that a case in point is the Cloone Burn in County Donegal on which he says work will continue. Work is continuing at a very slow pace.  I do not know whether this is because it is Government policy or <Col N="340" /> because of lack of finance.  There are many unemployed people in the Lagan area in Donegal who are willing and able to work.  There are men who have had experience with the Office of Public Works in this type of work, when they were employed on the Deale and Swilly and the Swilly estuary.  Because it did not suit them to move out of the county with the Office of Public Works at the time, they had no alternative but to remain at home.  As I say, some are unemployed and are available for work, but it appears that it is the policy of the Office of Public Works to employ as few as possible and to keep the job going on the Cloone at a very slow pace.</P>
    <P>I am dissatisfied because I feel that the Cloone Burn provides great scope for the removal of rocks from the river bed and that if these rocks were taken away at the waterfalls, no cleaning would be required and the water level would drop sufficiently to alleviate most of the flooding in the region. Farmers who have been plagued by flooding for the past 25 to 30 years could then apply to the Land Reclamation Office to have their lands properly drained so that they could put them into full production.</P>
    <P>This opinion is shared by many farmers who are affected by flooding and I would recommend to the Parliamentary Secretary that in certain areas where work cannot be commenced because of the lack of finance, temporary measures should be taken by the Office to have rocks removed so that flooding will be alleviated in some small way.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that he paid a visit to Belfast and spoke with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture with a view to co-operating with him regarding cross-Border drainage. I do not know whether it was the function of our Parliamentary Secretary to go to Belfast to talk on such terms or whether it would have been more in keeping for the Parliamentary Secretary in Belfast to visit Dublin, but if anybody has to be forced to co-operate in cross-Border drainage, it must be the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Gibbons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> On a number of occasions, I have raised the question of the River Finn where it divides Donegal and Tyrone. Four years ago, the Northern authorities completed the embankment on the river and it is with envy that the Donegal farmers look across this narrow stretch and see the Tyrone farmers with their land in full production. They can sow grain crops, in the full knowledge that at harvest time the land will not be flooded, but the farmers along the Finn valley on this side have not got that guarantee.  On many occasions I have seen oats, wheat, barley or potatoes laying in two or three feet of water.  Hard-working farmers, the fathers of boys with whom I have grown up, who have given the best years of their lives to agriculture, who work from dawn to dusk to earn a living, suffer losses because the Office of Public Works, because of their list of priorities, cannot spend money on the River Finn.</P>
    <P>We have the ludicrous position of the Parliamentary Secretary telling us that this time last year he visited his opposite number in Northern Ireland to ask him to co-operate with the OPW in order to carry out these works.  If the Parliamentary Secretary had mentioned to me that he was interested in such co-operation, I could have saved him his journey to Belfast.  All he had to do was come up to Donegal, go to the bridge at Lifford and look to his left.  Then he would have realised that the Northern authorities did not need to be invited or forced to co-operate with the OPW.  Lest perhaps Deputies here not familiar with the position should go away with the idea that someone on the Northern side is dragging his feet in relation to drainage and that the whitehaired boy is the junior Minister in charge of the OPW &mdash;perhaps I should not have said &ldquo;whitehaired&rdquo; but the Parliamentary Secretary knows what I mean.</P>

      <P>Deputy Coughlan is talking about a peroxide blonde.  Lest Deputies might get the impression that the Parliamentary Secretary had to go out of his way to persuade these people to co-operate, I want to say that is not a fact.  The Parliamentary Secretary talks about the Burnfoot or Skeoge river 20 miles further north and tells us that this drainage is going to benefit a number of farmers adjacent to the city of Derry.  This is of little comfort to those affected by the flooding of this river.  The Parliamentary Secretary should not avail of this occasion to boast that he has so lived up to his responsibilities on the Donegal side of the Border that he is now in a position to make himself responsible for the draining of lands adjacent to the city of Derry on the other side of the Border.</P>
      <P>Not sufficient money is being spent on drainage in rural Ireland.  One of the finest investments a government could make would be to borrow more money and spend it on drainage. Before I became a Member of this House and in my first year as a member of a local authority, I was approached by people who were agitating for the cleaning of the Cloone Burn river.  Six years ago I spoke with officials of the OPW on this subject. These people affected were so frustrated because they could get no guarantee the river would be cleaned that they were prepared to borrow money from the bank and have the work done themselves, provided the OPW would come along at a later stage and pay the loan charges.  These farmers were prepared to pay the interest rates each year and carry out the operation according to the plans and specifications of the OPW.  If reasonable and sound-thinking men are driven to the point of doing the work themselves and are convinced that it is a sound investment, it should not take a lot of effort by me to persuade the Parliamentary Secretary to think afresh and to borrow substantially more money to spend on drainage in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the faults with increased arterial drainage is that as the work <Col N="343" /> is concluded, the maintenance becomes the responsibility of the local authority. This adds substantially to the rates.  As the rates in the counties on the western seaboard are high enough already, another look should be taken at this system of financing.  If the drainage in the first instance is the responsibility of the OPW and the money for it comes from the national Exchequer, so also should the maintenance become the responsibility of the national Exchequer.  It is unfair that in counties such as Donegal, Mayo, Clare, Limerick and Kerry, where drainage is a major problem, once drainage work is carried out, the OPW surcharges the local authority each year afterwards so they can carry out maintnance.  It is a bad system of financing.  The Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to have it further examined and perhaps altered to make it the responsibility of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>When drainage is taking place, one of the things that most concerns the local farmers is the distribution of spoil.  I know this is a hardy annual and that virtually every Deputy speaking in this debate in former years has made reference to it.  We know the difficulties engineers and foremen have in arranging that spoil will not interfere with the land of local farmers.  But in many cases, if there were closer co-operation between the local authorities and the OPW officials, rock blasted from river beds which is now causing a nuisance on the lands of local farmers could be used in road mending and for filling up dangerous places such as quarry holes and pitheads.  The Parliamentary Secretary might take this up with the Department of Local Government and, well in advance of the time when this rock formation must be interfered with, and before it is excavated, the local authority could organise itself to have it removed at a nominal cost.  There is not much point in spending money on the drainage of land if the Office of Public Works is to destroy many other acres in the course of the manoeuvres.</P>
    <P>Sometimes innocent people suffer in this regard I know of one case in <Col N="344" /> Donegal where a local farmer who had land along the Deale River was not at all badly affected by the flooding of this river.  When the Office of Public Works came along to drain it, they were, in effect, passing along his land and helping to alleviate the flooding in the upper regions of the burn.  However, the disposal was made on this man's land and he was at a disadvantage. It would have been better for him personally if the Office of Public Works had left the river alone.  Again I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take a note of that and see if some more satisfactory method can be arrived at.</P>
    <P>I believe that when the Office of Public Works recruit labourers and semi-skilled men, having employed them and trained them in the type of work which they wish them to carry out, it is a very bad policy to allow these people to leave the labour force when work is completed in that locality.  I have spoken to many men who have been very satisfied with the working conditions of the Office of Public Works; indeed they were sorry they had to part company, in many cases simply because it was a matter of leaving home.  Some of these men are married and have grown families and, therefore, for domestic reasons they could not continue with this work. In many other cases, the simple explanation was that they could not find housing accommodation if they moved with the Office of Public Works to the next job.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, when speaking on this debate, I pointed out that one of the first functions of the Office of Public Works when they arrived to start major operations on a scheme was to erect office accommodation. This office accommodation is of a prefabricated nature and it does not require a lot of energy and expense to have it erected; when they move from the area, they offer it for public sale or dismantle it and take it to the next job.  Here is a point that is really worth considering.  This prefabricated office accommodation can be erected for £600 or £700, and with very slight modification, could be made into a small home.  Therefore, when the Office <Col N="345" /> of Public Works wish to take with them members of the staff who might be confronted with this problem of no living accommodation being provided at the next job, this prefabricated structure could be made available. This would enable the Office of Public Works to take with them to the next job an experienced member of the working organisation who knew what was required and how to go about it. In this manner the workers would be given an opportunity of making an effort which would give 100 per cent results.</P>
    <P>I understand that very few problems would be involved here, that sewerage and water facilities would be available, and the Office of Public Works would be taking no financial risk.  It would be a good investment, and if at any stage when the work was completed they did not wish to dismantle the prefabricated building to take it with them to serve the same purpose at another site, they could offer it for sale and, I understand, make a profit.  This is something that would be very much appreciated by the rank and file, the field men, so to speak, of the working force.</P>
    <P>I was tempted to mention the promise of the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to the drainage of the Shannon during the Roscommon by-election, but that has become such a joke that any words of mine would probably take the fun out of it.  Before I leave drainage, might I ask him to bring to the attention of his engineers that on the left bank of the estuary of the river Swilly I understand there is only one disposal sluice gate.  I have gone there with two local farmers who have pointed out to me that the Office of Public Works have nearly tried to make the water run up hill to suit their plan as originally drafted.  One local farmer pointed out to me that if another gate were installed further downstream, great benefit would come. This is a point I neglected to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary, and I am using this opportunity of doing so.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Parliamentary Secretary has stated that no coast protection work whatsoever will be carried out in this financial year. <Col N="346" /> I am glad he is honest enough to admit that it is because there is no finance available to implement the scheme. Coast protection is a very major issue in rural Ireland, and particularly in the western seaboard counties.  As a rural Deputy representing the northern county of Donegal, may I express my utter disappointment at the Government's failure?</P>
    <P>One of the first schemes that was brought to my notice under this particular heading was river Roe in Moville and Fahan in Buncrana.  When I first became familiar with this, due entirely to the information given to me locally, I brought it to the notice of the former Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Malley.  I also raised the matter in this House by way of Parliamentary Question and I pleaded with the Fianna Fáil controlled council in Donegal to ask the Office of Public Works to carry out urgent repairs at the river Roe, Moville.  I was frustrated by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party at local level who informed me that is was a matter of time before it would be done, that the Parliamentary Secretary had legislation before the House, and that as soon as that Coast Protection Bill was introduced it would be just a formality to have repairs carried out to the river Roe, Moville.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of those Members of the House and, indeed, for the benefit of those who are not in the House, let me say that there are a number of houses in which people are forced to live and at certain times tidal waters from Lough Foyle&mdash;salt water&mdash;floods the river Roe and the homes of these people to a depth of two or three feet. people's lives are involved.  I was invited to go and examine the situation there personally.  The conditions were appalling.  I immediately sent a telegram to the Parliamentary Secretary asking him to have it examined without delay with a view to having repairs carried out.  At a later stage, I was informed that this would be done as soon as the Coast Protection Bill was passed by the House and that as soon as the Parliamentary Secretary had power to spend the money he would spend it.  Incidentally that was in 1961. Now, six years later, we are told that <Col N="347" /> no money will be spent on coast protection and to repair the damage done by coast erosion.</P>
    <P>I suspect that one of the reasons why this has been kept on the long finger is political manoeuvring.  In December last year before this Vote came before the House, I had prepared some notes dealing with this problem.  Unfortunately I was not here to speak during that debate and I thought I had missed the boat.  I thought that the information which Donegal County Council gave to me on 9th June, 1966, would have been implemented by the time I would have an opportunity to speak on this Vote again.  I forgot that the Government do not always live up to their promises.</P>
    <P>The report given to me by the Secretary of Donegal County Council on that date I mentioned deals with Moville coast protection.  At great length the county secretary explained that the Office of Public Works asked them to toe the line and have a scheme prepared and sent on to them.  Without reading the contents of the letter, may I quote this: &ldquo;Their recommendation was adopted by the Council on 20th March, 1966.  The appropriate document was sealed on 25th April, 1966.&rdquo;  In other words on 25th April, 1966, because of a general request by the Office of Public Works to have this expedited, Donegal County Council gave top priority to having a scheme prepared, and it was sent to the Department, with the full approval of the county council, signed, sealed and delivered on 25th April, 1966.</P>
    <P>Now, almost 18 months later, the Parliamentary Secretary tells us apologetically that no money will be spent in this financial year on coast protection.  That is a scandal.  If legislation was introduced four years ago to deal with this problem, it is a crying shame that virtually no money has been spent on actual work other than the preparation of schemes.  It would be interesting to know how much money was spent on paper work.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will endeavour to do something to allay the fears in the minds of people who <Col N="348" /> because of the failure of another State Department to provide homes for them, have to live in these conditions, and that he will have some Christian charity and do everything in his power to have the Moville scheme attended to without further delay.  I might mention that at a meeting of Donegal County Council in 1962, Deputy Cunningham said that work on the river Roe scheme would be completed before 1964.  When we refer to the local press, <i>The Derry Journal,</i> we see that Deputy Cunningham made a statement in 1954, ten years prior to that, that the job would be done under a different Act.</P>
    <P>Had the present Government not taken away the powers of the local authorities, this would have been the case.  Deputy Cunningham supported the abolition of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  This prevented the local authorities from doing this kind of work.  When he discovered that the local authority had not the power to carry out this work, he told us that the former Parliamentary Secretary was bringing in legislation to enable the local authority to do it.  Now the Parliamentary Secretary who is in the saddle tells us he has no money to do it.  It is a vicious circle.  While that is happening people are living in dread beside the river Roe.</P>
    <P>Let me also say that I believe the financing of the coast protection scheme is wrong.  The western seaboard is open to the wild Atlantic and because of that, and for many other reasons, it is subject to more erosion than the eastern seaboard.  I am taking into consideration the fact that for various reasons the western seaboards pay much more in the £ in rates than the eastern seaboards and, because of that, coast erosion should be a national responsibility, I feel it is unfair that 20 per cent of the amount of the scheme should be charged to the local authority.  The grant should be 100 per cent or, if not 100 per cent, certainly nothing lower than 95 per cent.  In other words, if the local authorities are to be saddled with any responsibility whatsoever, there possibly could be an argument put forward by the Office of Public Works <Col N="349" /> or the Department of Finance that they will have to pay some small contribution because of that.  However, this should be the only argument for the Department of Finance to put forward in claiming a contribution from the local authority.</P>
    <P>The coast protection schemes can be described as being similar to arterial and major drainage which are a national charge and I cannot see why the Parliamentary Secretary who was then in charge should say that 20 per cent should be the responsibility of the local authority.  I do not think there is any sound reason behind it, other than that the national Exchequer would not have to get increased money through the Budget and that the rates would automatically increase in counties and that these local county councils would be blamed more than the Government would be blamed for the increase in expenditure.</P>
    <P>We have many other schemes under the Office of Public Works whereby they borrow money for different projects. I cannot understand why this particular scheme should not be 100 per cent the responsibility, financially speaking, of the Office of Public Works.  As a rural Deputy and as the spokesman of the Fine Gael Party on this subject, let me put on record that if it is ever my responsibility in office to have these things attended to, I will agitate and use as much influence as I can within the framework of the Fine Gael Party to have this made a national charge and not the responsibility of the local authority.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that it is proposed to rent more offices to accommodate more civil servants in the city.  When one remembers the speeches of the former Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party when he said that, if he got into office, he would reduce the number of civil servants then implied, it is hard to reconcile them with the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary is now saddled with the responsibility of providing more office accommodation for the different Departments of State.  If it were the case that more benefits were being given, I would probably say a few <Col N="350" /> words in favour of it.  I cannot understand why more office accommodation is necessary and I certainly cannot understand why the Parliamentary Secretary of the Office of Public Works&mdash; I do not know who is responsible but the Parliamentary Secretary must accept responsibility here in the House &mdash;agrees to pay 17/4d per square foot for office accommodation.  This seems a very small amount but when one realises that a five-roomed office is approximately 1,200 square feet, it works out at a figure of £1,050 per year rent.  In other words, if one wishes to get smart instead of fighting for a seat in the Seanad, all he has to do is find himself £2,500 or £3,000, invest it in property which the Office of Public Works might want and he has himself for life a return the same as the allowance which a member of the Seanad has for representing the public.  It is fantastic that the Office of Public Works should pay 17/4d and I understand this is the average figure; that in many cases a much lower rent is paid for older accommodation and a much higher rent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In about three years and he will still have the premises.  I do not know who has codded whom but I think it is one of the most scandalous situations in the country where you have foreigners coming in here, particularly in the city of Dublin, and building office accommodation with wall-to-wall carpeting, central heating and, I suppose, air conditioning and the Office of Public Works paying them, or being responsible for the <Col N="351" /> payment to them, of, in some cases, 28/- per square foot and on the average over the whole city, 17/4d. It does not need an expert in economics to point out to the average Deputy that the simple solution to all this is for the Office of Public Works or the Government to borrow the money and for the Office of Public Works to build and rent to different Departments concerned.  It could be merely a book transaction with very few profiteers who in many cases are not even citizens of the country benefiting to the extent of an investment which will give them a full return inside about three years&mdash;definitely in four years&mdash;and with their capital investment still intact.</P>
      <P>It is hard to find the reasoning behind this when one wanders through one's constituency and talks with men in public service, men whose responsibility it is to keep law and order in this country, members of the Garda Síochána.  I have been invited into a Garda station in Donegal where four young men of the Force were obliged to sleep in a room which had white-washed walls, which had no furniture other than the beds they slept in, not even a chair to sit down on.  Pegs were driven into the wall for their clothes. They had their clothes on clothes hangers inside plastic bags.  This was the type of wardrobe accommodation they had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the responsibility perhaps of the Department of Justice to provide the money but if the engineers in the Office of Public Works are prepared to recommend to the Parliamentary Secretary and he in turn recommends to the Minister for Finance that accommodation is substandard in the City of Dublin for civil servants, I feel it is wrong that members of our police force should be allowed to live in such accommodation.  You do not have to be an engineer to know that it is completely unfit for human habitation.  I also submit that, when the amount of money being spent in the renting of premises is so high&mdash;indeed, in many cases the accommodation being used, <Col N="352" /> while it may not have been ideal, was reasonable&mdash;it is unreasonable that schoolchildren should have to tolerate conditions that would cause a blush in darkest Africa.  There are no sanitary facilities whatsoever in some of those schools.  We will come to that in a few minutes.</P>
    <P>One of the most appalling situations that has come to my notice in the past two weeks is that revealed by a speech by the Chairman of the Labour Party when speaking in Limerick or Cork. There was an extract from a speech made by Mr. Barry Desmond, Chairman of the Labour Party printed in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 9th November where he said:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's recent status symbols showed their frightening indifference to the contrasts of wealth and poverty &ldquo;in our so-called Republic&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He was referring to bathroom suites and he said:</P>
    <P>Contrast the Board of Works installation of an elaborate shell-pink bathroom suite in Mr. Lynch's office in Government Buildings and the duck-egg blue version for Mr. Haughey, with the unsanitary and inadequate facilities in any of our county homes where our old people live out the remainder of their days while the rest of the community could not care less.</P>
    <P>If this is true, and I have no reason to believe other than what has been stated by the Chairman of the Labour Party during the Cork by-election, which was printed by the <i>Irish Independent</i> on November 9th, this cries out to heaven in vengeance.  If members of our police force are allowed to live in conditions which are appalling, if schoolchildren are asked to use schools which are substandard and without sanitation, if people, as I know has been the case recently in County Donegal, must tolerate inhuman conditions in our county homes and if civil servants move from conditions which may not have been ideal to better conditions to the tune of 27/-a foot&mdash;I refer of course to the senior civil servants&mdash;and if the Taoiseach is provided with a shell-pink bathroom <Col N="353" /> suite and the Minister for Finance has a duck-egg blue suite, then this House should examine its conscience.  It is a scandalous situation and demonstrates beyond doubt that the Government have lost touch with the needs of the general public.</P>
    <P>This is a statement which, as I said, has been made by a very responsible man, whom I do not know personally, but it has not been contradicted by any member of the Government.  I challenge the Parliamentary Secretary, whose direct responsibility it is to this House, either to confirm or deny that what Mr. Barry Desmond said is true.</P>
    <P>When we speak about the renting of premises, we also speak about the building of premises.  I am not satisfied that the present effort being made by the Office of Public Works is good enough to improve the substandard conditions of our Garda barracks, the homes of our gardaí or our national schools.  I feel a better effort is needed to have this problem solved.  I hope that in the coming financial year the Parliamentary Secretary will make an endeavour to have more homes built for members of our police force and more schools built for our schoolchildren.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon speaking on this Estimate last year or the year before mentioned that some consideration should be given to the National Building Agency taking over the building of farm buildings.  Arguments can be put forward in support of this and indeed arguments can be put forward against it.  Consideration should be given to the possibility of asking the National Building Agency to carry out the work in co-operation with the farm buildings scheme.  I mean by that that, if a local farmer applies to the Department of Agriculture and is lucky enough to get a grant to erect a farm building&mdash;he may not have the knowledge or knowhow and he might well like to have a contractor complete the deed for him&mdash; if this service were available, it might be to the benefit of the farming community.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note, regarding the position of schools, that two years ago <Col N="354" /> when this debate took place, both Deputy Dillon, Deputy P. O'Donnell and I mentioned the movement of our rural population and said that it was not advisable any more to replace substandard schools and that serious thought should be given to the provision of a central parish school, with special transport to bring the children in from the outlying districts who up till then attended the local school.  This has now come to pass and during the two recent by-elections, the Government Party took full credit for this service.  Let me quote to illustrate what I mean by the Government implementing or copying many of the points of the Fine Gael policy.  Let me quote to illustrate how the Government were thinking then in relation to the centralisation of schools.  I quote from volume 216, column 521 of the Official Report. The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Gibbons, was replying to points raised by Deputy Dillon and myself, particularly this point, and he said:</P>
    <P>it is no harm to say in passing that my personal opinion is that this is an idea well worth considering....</P>
    <P>It just goes to show that less than two years ago the Government had not made up their minds that the centralisation of schools was something that had to come for the benefit of our children.  However, there is one difference between the Government and the Fine Gael Party.  We asked that it should be done with the co-operation and full consent of the school managers and in consultation with the parents.</P>
    <P>In relation to schools, let me say that one of the things with which I am not disappointed is that in some cases recently officials of the Office of Public Works listed old schools with a view to having repairs carried out.  However, the situation developed at a later stage that these schools were closed down.  I do not know how much money it costs to have an inspector visit the schools and have his report listed and, indeed, in many cases perhaps pay a second or third visit.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have fallen down badly on this particular <Col N="355" /> point.  The particular trend of development in the locality would be quite obvious to people in the locality concerned. In a particular case&mdash;I hesitate to mention a name&mdash;it was obvious to me that a particular school would close, but in spite of that, the policy of the Government did not seem to get as far as the Office of Public Works.  I charge the Parliamentary Secretary with not doing his job and bringing it to their attention.  Such inspections should have ceased and it should have been made known to the managers and the parents that no further money was to be collected or any other effort made on their behalf to maintain the schools, that in all probability the school would close, as indeed has been the case.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Parliamentary Secretary does not use this opportunity to tell us to what extent the aerial survey has progressed since last year.  Perhaps when he is replying he might let us have this information. I understand that this time last year he had commenced an aerial survey in County Louth and that he proposed to do it systematically county by county. I may not have heard this particular point in his speech and I fail to locate it in the copy which was circulated. Perhaps, in replying, the Parliamentary Secretary will bring us up to date on it.</P>
    <P>On our national monuments, let me be crude in saying that again I am not satisfied that voluntary associations receive the right recognition from the Office of Public Works.  There should be a co-ordinating body to act as a link between the Office of Public Works and these voluntary associations throughout the country.  In many cases, as I mentioned earlier, there are pieces of real historical value, indeed completely unnoticed in many cases by the man who actually owns the land, which are discovered by members of voluntary associations.</P>
    <P>When a move is being made locally to have these sites restored for the benefit of the nation it is not until later that the Office of Public Works take an active interest in <Col N="356" /> this.  Derrynane is an example and there is also Kilmainham Jail and Ballintubber Abbey.  The people concerned with the development of those projects must be highly congratulated for their initiative and their efforts. I believe that if the Parliamentary Secretary would communicate with those people and invite them to give their views to a link committee between his Office and them, at local level, an even better effort would be forthcoming from these local committees. This is my personal opinion but, indeed, it is an opinion widely held by those who are interested in this type of work.</P>
    <P>To conclude on national monuments, I am very disappointed that the Parliamentary Secretary does not use this association to state Government policy in relation to the transfer of national monuments from different parts of the country to Dublin.  I have a very open mind on it, but I feel it is the responsibility of the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the people what Government policy is in relation to this controversial matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me conclude by saying that of all the things over which the Parliamentary Secretary has control he is lucky in not having to defend the rural improvement schemes on this particular Vote.  He is lucky that that has been passed over to a more able bluffer than Deputy J. Gibbons. It is not now his responsibility.  However, as he mentioned it in his opening speech, let me say that as far as the rural improvement schemes office is concerned, virtually nothing has happened in relation to Donegal in the past two years.  When I raised this in the House &mdash; and indeed he replied similarly to other Deputies&mdash;he simply said that his Office had been inundated with applications to have grants allocated for different types of work and that the flood was so great that he had to stop the acceptance of further applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The true position must have been that there was not any money for this <Col N="357" /> type of work, these rural improvement schemes.  If the Parliamentary Secretary says that is not the case, how does he explain that virtually no work has been done in the past two years?  If work has been done, it certainly has not been in Donegal and we hear from week to week Deputies from many parts of the country, by way of Parliamentary Question, expressing the same complaint in respect of their constituencies.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will inform the House how much money was spent on these schemes in the years 1964, 1965 and 1966.</P>

Now that the matter has been passed over to the Department of Local Government, it is not his responsibility, but he brought it into the debate and I am therefore in order in asking him for the information.

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our job to explode the Office of Public Works, or the work they have been doing.  I was glad to see that the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the fact that it is proposed to make provision in this year's Estimate for the purchase of 57 acres of the northern portion of the <Col N="358" /> Tara estate.  I hope he will say what has happened since that money was made available&mdash;what it is proposed to do with that portion of the farm when it is taken over.  Will it be let for grazing?  Will the Office of Public Works erect buildings on it?  For many years Tara has been a mound which looks good from the air.  However, those who have come to see the ancient seat of the High Kings of Ireland have been disappointed because Tara looks just like any other hill. Some signposts have been put up showing the banqueting Hall and the Mound of Hostages but it does not look like a site of national importance.</P>
      <P>In view of the many thousands of people who come from abroad&mdash;those who come here from across the water, from Europe and from America seem to be more interested in it than the Irish people&mdash;perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us if it is proposed to do anything with Tara, anything other than buying it and letting it go for grazing, leaving it as it was. Has he any proposal to erect the small museum on which a local committee were working in conjunction with Meath County Council?  The bald statement that provision has been made in the Estimate to buy Tara is not sufficient.  The Parliamentary Secretary should give us more details.</P>
      <P>Before we adjourn the debate for questions, I should like to say something on the point raised by Deputy Harte on the rural improvement schemes.  The Parliamentary Secretary has said these schemes are now a matter for the Minister for Local Government, but during the year under review, they were a matter for the Parliamentary Secretary's Office and they are still being operated, if that is the correct word, by that Office. The Labour Party have no objection to the transfer of these schemes to the local authorities.  We believe in decentralisation of authority, which will be welcomed, but we are watching carefully how the work will be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, in my area we have been told the schemes are to be transferred, with effect from April next, if Meath County Council agree to operate them.  If they do not, I assume County <Col N="359" /> Meath will be wiped out completely in regard to the schemes, because the Parliamentary Secretary's Office are to close down their office there.  It is suggested that the same sum as last year will be made available, something like £3,000 or £4,000, and that the average cost of each will be between £400 and £500.  I wonder how many of these schemes the Parliamentary Secretary thinks can be done on that basis, particularly in view of the backlog accumulated during a considerable period affecting the entire country.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that the county councils, if they take over the schemes, should also agree to take over the backlog as prepared by the Office. If the Office were making the money available immediately, one could understand why something like that would be suggested, but to say now that the county councils will be given the job of carrying out the schemes is a bit ridiculous.  Local applicants, I assume, will be told that, but the amount of money is so small that it will be years before anything substantial can be done&mdash;at least ten or 12 years.  This is most unfair and the Parliamentary Secretary might reconsider the allocation of moneys and make a reasonable amount available with the lists of schemes.  If the list is long, the amount of money should be sizeable.  It is the amount of work to be done, not the amount of money the Office gave out last year, or the year before, that counts.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on one other aspect of the schemes.  For many years the employees on these schemes have been in the main people who have been employees of local authorities, taken, perhaps, from the local labour exchange, and the gangers or foremen have been local authority employees seconded to the jobs and carrying their pension rights with them.  All local authority employees now are on a five-day week and recently many of them had it reduced to 42½ hours.  Still, the Office of Public Works employees in rural Ireland work a 5½ day week.  It does not make sense in view of the fact that all other employees of that Office are working a <Col N="360" /> five-day week.  It seems the people in the country, in the mud, must work the extra few hours in order to bring the average hours worked up to 45.</P>
    <P>This was brought to the notice of the Office of Public Works recently and the officer concerned said the Office had not gone into it yet. Reference was made to the 45-hour week and to the fact that nine hours had to be worked during part of the year to make the average.  The average week now is 42½ hours and there is no reason why this should not be applied in this case.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary, before he hands this work over in the next week or two, will bring these workers into line with local authority employees.</P>

      <P>When notifying health authorities of the amount of the supplementary grants which would be payable to them from my Department's Vote in respect of the current financial year I made to them the reasonable suggestion that matters should be so arranged that the rate for health to be levied by each of the contributing bodies should be maintained as near as possible to the rate for the previous year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the arterial drainage of the Boyne.  He is not quite as definite as he was a few months ago about the actual starting date.  May I assume drainage may not start in February, 1968, as was originally stated?  Perhaps if he has the information, he will give it when he comes to reply.</P>
      <P>The drainage of the Boyne has been talked about for not quite such a long period, perhaps, as the Shannon, but for quite a long period nevertheless. As the Parliamentary Secretary points out, it will affect a considerable area of land in Meath and neighbouring counties.  He said in his introductory statement that about 112,000 acres of agricultural land and 26,000 acres of bog could be improved by drainage but the cost of improving about one-sixth of the damaged agricultural land would be uneconomic.  This, of course, was not the type of exercise carried out by the Office of Public Works when they were doing earlier drainage because those of us who travel around the country have little difficulty in pointing out large tracts of land along lengths of rivers which were drained, with very little improvement to most of the land concerned.  We assume that the only thing that could have brought this situation about was the death of a Deputy; thanks be to God, none of us had to die in Meath to get the Boyne started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> I should like a good deal more information from the Parliamentary Secretary on this whole matter.  He refers to a number of bridges, <i>et cetera</i>, which have to be dealt with and how expensive these things can be.  He referred also to water supplies, sewage disposal systems, <i>et cetera.</i> While I know the Board of Works have been very careful when dealing with bridges in ensuring that they are replaced reasonably satisfactorily, there is a big problem in relation to water supplies and sewage disposal.  Taking water first, it is not unknown, when a scheme is carried out over a wide area, to have the water supply systems to private houses, groups and even villages so badly affected as to become unusable.  That is a very serious loss to those concerned.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us if his Office is responsible and, if not, who is?</P>
    <P>With regard to sewage disposal, this is a matter which would come up more relevantly under a different heading but, since the Parliamentary Secretary has referred to it, could he tell me now if there is any possibility of having a treated system of sewage disposal?  It is just too bad that sizeable towns, to say nothing of individual houses and villages, are allowed to put untreated sewage into waters subsequently used by others, and sometimes for domestic purposes.  There is a typical example of this in Drogheda.  The sewage comes into the river and people bathe and fish further down.  Surely there should be some more hygienic way of dealing with sewage?  Industrial waste also goes into these rivers.  Everybody is aware of the damage industrial waste has done to fish life.  In some cases fish life has been completely wiped out. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary may be able to tell us what will happen there.</P>
    <P>There is the problem then of those who will be put out of employment as a result of the drainage of the Boyne. In Mornington at the mouth of the Boyne, there is a community of fishermen. As I have mentioned on innumerable occasions, they live entirely by fishing.  From 12th February to 12th <Col N="370" /> August, they fish salmon and from October to the following February they pick mussels.  It is a hard life but they seem to do reasonably well, and some do very well.  When drainage starts, these will be put out of business.  It will be useless to try to net salmon while the river is being cleaned because of the mud and debris being carried down.  In any case, the fish will not come into the mouth of the Boyne while it is polluted with this mud and debris.  Is it proposed to do anything by way of compensating the fishermen for the loss they will suffer?</P>
    <P>Similarly, mussels are a very delicate type of fish.  They will be killed very quickly.  If mud is carried down over the mussel beds the beds will be wiped out and the entire industry will cease. There is no point in arguing that these people will get employment on drainage work.  Some of them will, but only some.  There is no point in saying they will get employment in the proposed fish meal factory.  There are roughly 40 families involved; the men, women and children all engage in mussel fishing and the men and children engage in salmon fishing.  This is a very important matter for them and, if something is not done, the entire community could be wiped out.  They may become scattered all over the world.  The younger men in Mornington usually go to sea for a spell.  They get their mates' tickets and then they settle down in Mornington at fishing. Some go as pilots to the Drogheda Harbour Commissioners.  In the main, they live entirely off the river.  I should be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell me in as much detail as possible what is proposed for these people.  I do not want him to tell me the Boyne Board of Conservators will look after their interests.  I will not accept that.  Neither do I want to be told that the fishing interests on the river will look after the interests of these people because, again, neither I nor those concerned will be prepared to accept that.</P>
    <P>A number of angling clubs will also be affected.  It is too bad&mdash;I say this as an angler myself&mdash;that they should be discommoded, that they will not be able to fish and have their relaxation <Col N="371" /> but it is not the loss of their livelihood whereas it is a loss for the Mornington fishermen.  Similarily, up the river, there are a few stretches set by reasonably wealthy people to more wealthy people for a day's salmon fishing for as much as £5 and sometimes more. Again, while it will be a loss to them and a source of annoyance and disappointment to the people who usually fish there, they are not in the same category as the fishermen at Mornington.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that, from Navan down to Drogheda the Boyne should not be cleaned in the normal way, that it would be sufficient to clean out the islands, shape the banks and attend to any serious defect that requires attention.  Possibly this may be a solution.  There appears to be a drop of 210 feet from the weir at Navan to the bar at Drogheda.  This is something that has to be considered and explained to the people concerned. While the fishing interests are very anxious that it should be dealt with in this way, the amount of land flooded by the Boyne, the Blackwater and all the tributaries is so great that whatever is done should be a decent job. I know the entire area from one end to the other, for various reasons, and I should be very anxious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The women have votes as well as the men.  The question of spoil comes up.  What will be done with the spoil on the Boyne? The most unsightly thing that one can see is a heap of spoil along the bank of a river.  It is very annoying to have to look at it but it is even more annoying <Col N="372" /> to a small farmer who finds what he considers an unreasonable amount of spoil piled up on his land.  When the Dee was done some years ago, the people doing the job decided, for some extraordinary reason, to deposit most of the spoil of one length of the river on a small portion of land attached to the house of a man who had only one acre&mdash;and that spoil lay there for years. It was rather a stupid thing to do and it made the man mad.</P>
      <P>Spoil disposal will have to be tackled.  We are now in the conveyor-belt age.  We have quite an amount of waste land, quarries, bogholes, and so on, that could possibly be filled with spoil from a river rather than leaving it on a bank.  A member of my county council suggested that the canal between Navan and Drogheda might be filled in with spoil.  I am not taking sides on this because I do not know the technicalities.  Will the draining of the Boyne have the effect of draining the canal which runs alongside? If so, the proper thing would be to fill it up and possibly a road could be made on it.  If the canal is to be re-opened as a beauty spot, it will need a lot more attention than it is now getting.</P>
      <P>The Boyne should be drained to the best possible advantage.  I mentioned that land has been flooded.  There is also the question of houses.  A lot of flooding has occurred in Navan and Trim, particularly, over the years. There has been the suggestion that the cleaning of the Boyne is likely to flood Drogheda.  Such stupid comments are made by people who do not know the facts.  The sea is at Drogheda and a lot of water will have to flow into it before it will come back on the land, that is, except at high tide.  I want the drainage to be such that at no time will there be any question of a back-flow of water into the houses at Trim or Navan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of maintenance costs arises.  At present, the maintenance costs for these jobs are passed on to the local authority.  I do not expect miracles but could the Parliamentary Secretary say what the maintenance of the Boyne is likely to cost and what <Col N="373" /> allocation will be made to Meath County Council?  Numerous figures have been mentioned such as 9/6d in the £ down to 4/- in the £ on the rates.  This would be very serious if it were true.  The Parliamentary Secretary should clarify the position as soon as possible.  If it will be in the region of 4/- in the £, upwards, the Government will have to subsidise heavily maintenance costs for rivers.  I would also suggest that the local authority should carry out the maintenance.  That would guarantee that whatever money is allocated will be spent in the local authority area.  Disappointment has been expressed that, when we pay a fairly substantial sum for the maintenance of rivers running through our area, very little of the money seems to be spent in our area.  No doubt there is a reason for that but if the work could be passed on to the local authority it would improve the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte spoke of the conditions of employment of people in the Office of Public Works.  The Parliamentary Secretary bragged that there had been no major industrial dispute on the job.  We are all glad of that.  It is not because of ideal conditions or excellent wages that no industrial dispute has occurred.  People working on the job complain that shelters are not provided, no matter how bad the weather.  The Forestry Division, Bord na Móna and some local authorities have found it possible to provide portable shelters.  It should not be beyond the ability of the Office of Public Works to do likewise.</P>
    <P>The question of hours of work arises.  Why should Government Departments, particularly the Office of Public Works, insist on their men working for a few hours on Saturday, to make up their week, when all local authority employees in the area and all officials of the Office of Public Works&mdash;except the people of whom I speak&mdash;are on a five-day week? Surely what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander?  If it is possible for everybody else to work a five-day week it is ridiculous to ask men working with the Office of Public Works on arterial drainage to travel 15 to 20 <Col N="374" /> miles in order to put in a few hours work on Saturday.  One man pointed out to me that he was travelling so far that the amount he was getting for working on Saturday would not pay for the petrol for his car.  If he did not go to work, the job would not be there for him on Monday morning.  It is ridiculous that this situation should continue.</P>
    <P>The position of the Office of Public Works up to now, like the Department of Lands, was that they would not agree with the agreement we had with local authorities, that men should work longer hours in summer so that the average 45-hour week could be worked.  The majority of local authorities are now working an average of 42½ hours a week.  There is no necessity to work longer than nine hours at any period of the year in order to make up the number of hours and surely there should no longer be any reason why the Office of Public Works would not put these men on a five-day week of 42½ hours.  They work very hard and they have to work in very bad conditions.  The conditions of employment of the Office of Public Works are perhaps the worst in any rural employment.  I am not blaming the Office of Public Works for that. There is no point in saying that these men do not have to get wet or that they should not have to go to the bottom of a muddy river.  The job cannot be done unless they are prepared to do that.  As long as it is recognised that they are doing it, some appreciation should be shown and they should not have to be Cinderellas of employment.  It should not be said that everybody else in the Office of Public Works can work a five-day week but that these men must still turn up on Saturday mornings during winter because they are what they are.</P>
    <P>It is of interest to note that a number of industrial employers adopted a five-day week because it did not pay them to operate machinery for the few hours on Saturday.  They felt it was good economics to try to have it worked on five days.  I would recommend to the Parliamentary Secretary, who is a reasonable man and is familiar with conditions, as he comes from <Col N="375" /> the country, that this matter should be looked into.  There is another complaint which I will just mention in passing because I have already brought it to the notice of the Office by way of a trade union complaint.  While a bonus system is operating which yields a certain amount of money to certain employees, there are areas in which the bonus system does not operate at all.  The people in these areas rightly say that they are at a loss at least of the average amount which those on the bonus scheme are getting. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary might do something about that.  The thing that annoys me as a trade union official is that if I send in a complaint to a Department, I get back an acknowledgement and then several weeks later, I receive a letter putting up an argument which cannot hold water, and if I reply and ask for a conference to discuss the matter, then I find that either the typist must have sprained her wrist or something else happened because it is extremely difficult to get a further reply for months.  These matters should be dealt with in a different way. There is no point in Ministers or Departments preaching the need for good labour relations to everybody else when they themselves do not appear to recognise that their employees are also entitled to good labour relations.</P>
    <P>In regard to the scheme, would it be possible to have a copy of this scheme or a copy of the portions affecting particular areas made available to members of local authorities?  Whether one is a member of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Labour or an Independent, as a local authority member, one will be expected to know what exactly is happening. The only way this will be possible is to get a copy of the scheme relating to the portion of the area they represent. Some years ago, I had the experience of trying to explain to an irate old farmer how a drain on his land was pegged and was not done and a drain on a neighbour's farm was not pegged and was done.  If I had been fortunate enough to have had a copy of the map for the area, it would have been easy enough to show him either that it was <Col N="376" /> not intended to do it or that he had been diddled.  I was never sure which.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked him did he not know that the Government never did anything right.  The Board of Works have been doing arterial drainage work by direct labour and the Parliamentary Secretary has paid tribute to these workers.  They are doing a good job.  The time has come, however, in regard to other work carried out by the Board of Works to revert to direct labour.  I do not know whether the story is true or not but there is a story that a lot of work done under the Board of Works is done by what are described by the Parliamentary Secretary as contractors but who more appropriately might be described as agents.  They are paid commission for the number of men they make available for employment.  In some peculiar way, they are supposed to be contractors for the job, but yet the work is almost completely carried out by direct labour, except for this peculiar twist.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain that.  If the Chair will excuse me, I am referring particularly to one place where we see huge notices on which the contractor's name is given as &ldquo;Stone&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Schools have been referred to and while it appears from the statement that quite a number of schools have been renovated and a number of new one built, we still have a long way to go.  I have a question down for next week, which I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be answering.  I thought I would catch him before this Estimate came up for debate.  The question is in regard to the number of schools in each county which have been declared unfit, which need repair or replacement. I think the number will be fairly sizeable. However, schools are being erected and we are very proud of our modern schools, but if the rate of erection or repair, particularly in regard to sanitary accommodation, can be accelerated, everybody will be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to refer to Leinster House where quite a substantial amount of work has been done.  I note <Col N="377" /> that it is proposed to have a press diningroom.  It is proposed to convert the old diningroom into a press diningroom. Could the Parliamentary Secretary say if a change has been made here?  I understood originally that the press were to continue dining in the Members' diningroom, with Deputies and Senators, and when was the decision made to change it?  I should also like to inquire what is the position about the erection of some kind of canteen for members of the staff?  It is all right saying that the staff can dine in a special dining hall that has been prepared for them but I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of their rates of pay.  Many of them do not find it possible to dine there.  It is ridiculous to suggest they should be able to pay the prices they are asked. This has nothing to do with the Parliamentary Secretary except the provision of accommodation.</P>
    <P>If it is true a number of them find it impossible out of their present wages to pay something over £1 per day for two meals, surely some type of cafeteria should be made available to them? Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider something on those lines? There is no point saying they have this accommodation if they cannot afford to use it.  The alternative is to give them a decent rate of wages which would include an allowance for meals.</P>
    <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary be able to say when it is hoped to have the remainder of the work done on the old accommodation which was to be converted for staff use?  My recollection is that at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges several months ago, we understood instructions had been given to renovate and redecorate certain portions of the House, which formerly had been used by Deputies, for the purpose of accommodating staff.  Nothing must have been done.  The Labour Party occupy one room on the fourth floor and the other side of the corridor is occupied by members of the staff.  It is still hard for me, as Party Whip, to explain to some of my people how four of them have to use one small room while across the corridor one official, perhaps <Col N="378" /> a junior official, has twice as big a room for himself.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary say when he thinks this job will be completed so that the staff can move into their own accommodation and leave for Deputies the accommodation that was supposed to be for them?</P>
    <P>Reference was made to coast protection. It appears that, apart from passing the Act in this House, very little more was done.  I do not know whether that was the original intention. We are accused at times of being good at making laws which appear to suit everybody so long as we do not have to implement them.  This is one law which is of absolutely no use.  I was told some years ago that the reason it was so hard to get work done on this was that only one inspector was allocated to it.  Under the peculiar system, the local authority notified the Department of the necessity to have the work done; an inspector inspected it, said whether or not it would be necessary and what the cost would be; and then the local authority carried out of the work.  This was the routine recommendation.  It appears to have fallen down completely.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would say if that is the position and, if so, let us know.  Otherwise, those of us in the coastal areas will continue to be pressed by people who can show us, even on the flat parts of the east coast, where coast erosion has been literally carrying fields away.  To my own knowledge, and I have been only 25 years in the area, acres have disappeared from flat parts of the coast.  I can imagine what could happen on the wild western coast where the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach attempts to exist.</P>
    <P>With regard to arterial drainage.  I have had a complaint from certain landowners and householders along rivers which are being surveyed.  If a group of men are going to work beside a house, particularly in an isolated area, a recommendation might be made that, out of courtesy, notice of that fact might be given to householders at least a day before.  Some people are rather touchy about these things and it is rather embarrassing.  It has been <Col N="379" /> brought to my notice by a few people, who were carrying on as they usually do, which maybe was not the best way, that they suddenly found a group of spectators, men who were surveying a river and in one case who were doing a certain amount of work beside the house.  I can understand the embarrassment. If it can be avoided by the simple courtesy of telling them beforehand, honour will be done all around.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned that the work at Newgrange and Dowth is being carried on and is yielding satisfactory results. I am also glad he did not succeed in getting a couple of lorries down and carting it into Dublin last week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

      <P>I know, but it went in before the Parliamentary Secretary knew about it.  He would have stopped it if he had known. Although this is a rather backward area&mdash;for a time I doubted the wisdom of putting a tourist office there because I wondered if anybody could get in touch with it&mdash;nevertheless the expenditure of money here would yield excellent results.  Indeed we are lucky to have in Meath, in addition to Tara, places like Newgrange and Dowth. When the job is completed, will adequate protection be put around it to ensure that unauthorised persons will not attempt to do a little bit of excavating of their own for souvenirs and perhaps do irreparable damage to the priceless work of art these tumuli represent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the excellent record of achievement by the Board of Works he has presented to us today.  I am delighted he mentioned the rather sarcastic references made from time to time to the activities of the Board of Works.  They are often called &ldquo;inactivities&rdquo;.  The people living in my part of the country, where at present two drainage schemes are in operation, speak other than sarcastically of the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and the Board on the work <Col N="380" /> done on the Corrib drainage scheme, the Headford drainage scheme and the Killimor-Cappagh drainage scheme. The work is of the highest quality.  The advantages that will accrue from it, and are already accuring to the beneficiaries, cannot be over-emphasised.  I can say with all sincerity that the farmers of my area who have benefited and will benefit are deeply grateful to the Board.  They appreciate the work that has been done to improve their lands and render these lands more capable of development by virtue of the fact that they will be adequately drained and small farmers can avail of the many schemes, particularly the Land Project schemes, that are there for the asking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to the demand made by the workers for a five-day week.  I should like to add my voice to his in appealing to the Parliamentary Secretary to arrange, if at all possible, for a five-day week for these workers, many of whom have to travel long distances to their place of employment. Last Saturday I met a man who told me he had travelled 14 miles to work and 14 miles back in very inclement weather to put in a few hours on a Saturday so as to make up his quota of work.  I think work could be so arranged as to allow people to put in the required number of working hours, per week in a five-day week.  It might eman extra hours per day or a reduction in the number of working hours, but I would ask the Board of Works not to be backward in dealing with this demand that has been made and is being made by workers.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of asking the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some definite information about the commencement date of the Dungkellin scheme.  Time and again over the past few years, my colleagues, Deputy Millar and Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins, have been pestering him with questions here in Dáil Éireann and privately by writing to him, to glean some definite information about the commencement date of this proposed scheme.  There is no area as badly affected in my constituency as the catchment area of this proposed scheme.  West of Craughwell and between Craughwell and the sea <Col N="381" /> there is a vast area of land&mdash;and when I say a vast area, I mean thousands of acres&mdash;flooded for six or seven months of the year.  It is known as the Rahasne Turlough.  This is an area of small farmers for whom drainage work of this type is a must if they are to survive.  We know this scheme is to start within the next year or two, but we want to know will it start immediately after the completion of the Corrib drainage scheme or has it to wait its turn until the Killimor-Cappagh scheme has been finished.  Perhaps he would give us some information on that.</P>
    <P>Reverting again to the Parliamentary Secretary's introductory statement, I am rather surprised at Deputy Tully saying that very little has been done by way of replacing national schools.  If he only went to the trouble of listening to the Parliamentary Secretary explaining what has been done in relation to national schools, he would not make a statement like that.  The Parliamentary Secretary says:</P>
    <P>Nearly one in every three schools standing today was either built or modernised since 1957.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">

      <P>That is a fairly good record.  The Parliamentary Secretary supplemented this statement by giving statistics of what in fact has been done in different parts of the country, in counties as far apart as Donegal and Waterford.  I am aware of the work he has done in my county, and I know that this work of replacing insanitary and unsuitable national schools with <Col N="382" /> new schools, improving existing schools and extending them in many cases, has been going on apace.  Although many schools were in a fair state of repair, the fact that there has been an emphasis recently on the provision of central schools in parishes has added considerably to the work that has been undertaken by the Board.  At present there is in the course of erection in my own town a new national school the design of which is a credit to the Board of Works.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary, when he happened to be in the area some time ago, took the opportunity of visiting this school and making himself familiar with the conditions there.</P>
      <P>I had occasion to ask him recently to give serious consideration to the provision of a tarred or macadamed playground there so as to prevent flooding from a river nearby.  A river which was diverted some short while ago to serve new houses has caused some periodic flooding or made the land marshy.  I trust it will be possible to get a grant for this type of work.  I understand the scheme is running below the estimate of the Board and it might be possible in connection with the new boys' school in Loughrea to make this extra grant available.</P>
      <P>There is one matter which has caused me great amusement in the course of the past few days.  It is this controversy about the removal of ancient monuments to Dublin.  I went to see the Rosc Exhibition, particularly that part of it which is housed next door, and I was agreeably surprised at the excellence of what I saw.  However, I was particularly amused at what I read in the papers about the protests made by well-meaning people who should know better about the removal of the Turoe Stone and other ancient monuments to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is part of the catalogue of the Rosc Exhibition, and it says the following additional items, that is, over and above the Turoe Stone, the Tau Cross and other ancient monuments, will be exhibited in the National Museum: No. 216, Neolithic decorated stone from small burial mound at Newgrange; removed in 1964 by the excalenc <Col N="383" /> vator, Professor M.J. O'Kelly, with the consent of the Commissioners of Public Works: Pocked decoration, painting modern; No. 217, Neolithic decorated stone from roof of passage in main tumulus at Newgrange; removed in 1964 by the excavator, Professor M.J. O'Kelly, with the consent of the Commissioners of Public Works: Pocked decoration, painting modern: Lent by the Commissioners of Public Works; No. 218, Neolithic decorated stone from roof of passage in main tumulus at Newgrange; removed in 1964 by the excavator, Professor M.J. O'Kelly, with the consent of the Commissioners of Public Works: Pocked decoration, painting modern: Lent by the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>What amuses me is that this was the gentleman who removed three exhibits and placed them in the National Museum through the good offices of the Commissioners of Public Works, and he objects to monuments like the Turoe Stone being brought to Dublin and lent to the Rosc exhibition.  He gave &ldquo;who began it&rdquo; to the Minister for Finance for allowing his Parliamentary Secretary to engage in the removal of these ancient monuments to Dublin despite the fact that he had done it himself in 1964.  National monuments like the Turoe Stone, the Tau Cross and these neolithic decorated stones from different parts of the country are the property of the Irish nation, and if they are confined to localities and not lent to an exhibition as well known internationally as the Rosc Exhibition, it is an insult to the Irish nation to deprive our people of seeing these monuments.  I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary, the Office of Public Works and the Minister on the decision they took and on paying no heed to these learned gentlemen who if they see things themselves want no one else to see them, or give that impression.  I am particularly interested in the Turoe Stone and Rath of Feerwore because it is within 150 or 200 yards of where I teach.</P>
    <P>Some of the comments I heard were a source of great amusement to me. A number of worthies around <Col N="384" /> Loughrea were asked by a local paper to comment on this controversy.  So far as I know, there was no controversy except that raised by the paper itself.  I doubt if any of these people who are protesting so loudly and vehemently about the removal of the Turoe Stone could distinguish between that stone and the stone outside Dan Murphy's door.</P>

      <P>According to the newspaper, one of these worthies said the Turoe Stone was standing in the same spot in the same locality for over 2,000 years.  Dr. Joseph Rafferty of the National Museum has written extensively about this and he says:</P>
      <P>The stone now stands on the lawn in front of Turoe House, Loughrea, County Galway, but the tradition that it originally stood beside the ring-fort known locally as the &lsquo;rath of Feerwore&rsquo; appears to be well founded.</P>
      <P>When people talk glibly about this stone having been in the same place for over 2,000 years they are talking through their hats, and when they talk about the interest the people in the locality have in the stone they are also talking through their hats.  I doubt very much if any of these people have taken the trouble to visit this place. My motive in saying this might be a little out of place here because I see it regularly.

      <P>I want to know what the Parliamentary Secretary is doing with regard to the repair and replacement of the Garda barracks in Limerick and the surrounding area.

Indeed it is a sad state of affairs when you get men stationed in Limerick who, up to two years ago, lived in some frugal comfort within the confines of the barracks.

      <P>I now want to take the Parliamentary Secretary to something which is much more remunerative and which I have been discussing with him and his office for a long time.  That is the question of the exhibition of historic buildings, not stones or bits of stone about which we have all the hullabulloo going on at the present time.  As we are talking about these ancient monuments and stones I want to say here that having attended the opening of the RDS exhibition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to say that as far as that opening is concerned on last Sunday afternoon I never saw such a display of Ascot-like snobbery in all my life as I saw that afternoon outside in the RDS grounds.  Indeed they were a damn bad exhibition and a damn bad portrayal of the cultural life of the country and let that go on record.  They were nearer to a gang of hippies and minis tht you would see in any Continental city in Europe.  Put that with your ancient monuments now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to a matter which is much more remunerative and much more attractive and much more presentable as something Irish, something culturally sound and something which belongs to the people, that is, the history and the attachments of my city and county with the past.  It is not once or twice I have brought this to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary and indeed to the notice of his predecessor, who should be much more alive to the fact.  Not alone did he close <Col N="390" /> his two eyes to the matter but he went blindfolded, while he was in that particular office with regard to anything to develop and attract tourists to the historic city and county of Limerick. We have in that city a monument unsurpassed in this country today and it is not mentioned in this document.</P>

This monument has been allowed to go derelict, with weeds growing on the walls and not a penny being spent on its upkeep.  I do not know when the Parliamentary Secretary will get around to it.  It is not included in this document for the next 12 months.  I do not know whether we will have to go and organise a parade from Limerick and sit outside, not the half-door in Loughrea but outside his own office to get something done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that when we had a Minister in Limerick something would be done.  The Parliamentary Secretary looked after anything of historic importance in Kilkenny, small though it be, but he has not done anything to attract tourists to the particular part of the country I refer to.  He has not done anything to <Col N="392" /> attract tourists to the monuments we have in the city and county of Limerick.</P>
      <P>Now, having left the city, I want to refer to Lough Gurr.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows, from travelling all over Europe and seeing some of the ancient places in Europe, together with Deputy Carty, before he leaves the House, the value of those attractive places.  Those are attractive to tourists and visitors but nothing has been done with regard to Limerick to attract tourists.</P>

      <P>I now want to refer to the manner in which drainage operations are carried out.  Deputy Carty smiles because of course something was done outside his half-door.  I would advise Deputy Carty, some day he has very little to do, to take a plane from Dublin Airport to Renmore, to travel by air on his way to Galway, and when he passes over the different counties, he will see what the country is like.  He will see in his own county, and every other county, lakes and water all over the place.  If that is a compliment to the Board of Works for the work done, the Parliamentary Secretary's estimation and mine are poles apart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agitations have been going on for 30 years in my area.  We have had agitations in the City of Limerick going on during all that time.  I have to be parochial on this issue because this is an Estimate which has to be treated parochially.  We cannot treat it outside the scope of our own area. I want to refer the Parliamentary Secretary to a deputation which he received, courteously, as is his manner, two years ago but that is as far as we got.  That agitation has been going on for over 30 years with regard to this particular drainage scheme.  It is not anything like the drainage of the Shannon which we have mentioned in <Col N="393" /> this document today and about which I suppose our great grandchildren, if they have the ill-luck to succeed us here, will hear the same old repetitious statements here in this House.</P>
    <P>I want the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us how much drainage work is to be done on the River Maigue and its tributaries.  One particular tributary which flows into the Maigue causes severe flooding in and around Limerick.  The land there is flooded for at least six months every year for miles around.  The agitation has been going on for well over 30 years.  In fact it has been going on for nearly 40 years but nothing is ever done about it.  I understand we are coming up here next Wednesday, to meet the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J.M. Gibbons Mr. J.M. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.M. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that we will be received in a courteous manner and that we will not go away with one hand as long as the other, as we did in the past.  We were told: &ldquo;You are on the list,&rdquo; but nothing has been done.  These unfortunate people are paying city rates which are very high, which are too high, and are getting no return, good, bad or indifferent.  Other schemes in Limerick were dealt with much more expeditiously&mdash;there may be a reason for it&mdash;in the past.  What was done could by no means be compared with what should have been done two or three miles away.  As I say, there may have been a reason for it, but I hope that when we meet the Parliamentary Secretary next Thursday, he will have some consoling news for those people who are affected.  They are mostly market gardeners and small farmers. They need this relief and they are prepared, as they have done in the past, to put their hands in their pockets and pay in some way for the work that is to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  It is concerned with employment in the Board of Works.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary understands the difference between temporary and permanent employment.  I know of men <Col N="394" /> engaged in the Board of Works for eight to ten years who are still treated as temporary workers.  They are skilled men in their particular line but here they are on a casual basis, having no permanency, and not having the benefit of all that goes with permanency, superannuation, sickness benefits, and so on.  There is not such thing in the Office of Public Works for those workers.  I am sure that the people two or three steps above them are well fortified against the future but it is not fair that a man should have worked eight or ten years with a Department and still be treated as temporary, even though he works the year round and works according to the conditions laid down for his employment. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to get into 1967.  I know he has the ability, the courage and the foresight to see that we are in 1967 and moving into 1968 and the 70s when bigger things will have to be done.  I would ask him to give these people that security of free employment which we are fighting for every day of the week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carty mentioned the difference between the five and six day week. That has its own importance.  It, too, can be got over and a man will be satisfied if he has to work on a Saturday morning, provided he knows he is in permanent employment, that his work will be appreciated and that there is security for him in his job.  I mentioned this to the Parliamentary Secretary and I got the same Civil Service reply: it was a temporary position and that was all there was about it.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary and I know he understands fully the circumstances of these cases.  Supposing those people said: &ldquo;If you were in my shoes, what would you do?&rdquo; That is not the approach in the Civil Service.  They will get the same reply this year as they did last year: &ldquo;We are all OK and to hell with Jack.&rdquo;  I know that is not the Parliamentary Secretary's approach and I want to bring to his notice the fact that he should give these employees a sense of permanency and the feeling that their work is appreciated. He will get a damn sight more out of them than he is getting at the moment, if he does.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> Mention has been made of drainage work done and maintenance costs. These are a charge on the local authorities. All these banks that are repaired are public property and there is a right-of-way for pedestrians, and so on. I believe this should be a national charge and not a local charge on the ratepayers of a particular area.  This is something we have to arrest, this Parkinson's theory in regard to the question of money.  One Department will tell you this, particularly the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Local Government with regard to rates and home assistance, but it is all fired back on the unfortunate people who are paying indirectly for the upkeep of the State.  This should be a national charge which would reduce the impact on the rates.</P>
    <P>If the people who are so vehement about these matters would realise how exactly these things come about and the approaches that have been made by the Department.  I am sure their views would be changed not alone every day of the week but particularly on polling day when they go like blind men into something that has been camouflaged three or four weeks prior to the election.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which the Parliamentary Secretary will understand exactly.  From his travels abroad, he has the experience and he has the sense to understand the value of what I am about to say.  I mention the provision of slips for fishing.  There are other things besides fishing connected with his Department, and I would ask him to direct his attention to the provision of slips at rivers and lakes as a tourist attraction for houseboats and motorboats and the other facilities the tourist wants.  We know with regard to tourism at the present time that the inclination is to get off the roads and on to the rivers and lakes in boats. We in Limerick are ideally situated in that respect.  We have the Upper and Lower Shannon and we have 40 miles down the Shannon, the Upper Shannon to Athlone and on to Leitrim, if people want to go there.</P>
    <P>I would direct the Parliamentary <Col N="396" /> Secretary's attention to Limerick, being adjacent to the Shannon, and suggest that it should be made an attractive area for houseboats and speedboats, as he has seen them abroad.  In the Scandinavian countries, particularly, hundreds and thousands of these boats are lined up, rather like the cars one sees at Croke Park on an All-Ireland football or hurling final day.  Limerick is ideally situated for such development and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have a look at it. We will be sending him our ideas on paper with regard to the development of Limerick in a smaller way, but when they come to him, I would ask him to go that step further and not alone have facilities for the local yachtsmen and the Yacht Club, but also have Limerick developed as a tourist attraction.  I am sure they would pay well, particularly because of the proximity of Shannon Airport. I should like, in conclusion, to pay a tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary for having done the little or nothing he has done for Limerick.</P>

I appeal to him, when we come to him to put our views before him, to include Limerick and its development demands and needs, both city and county.  It has been unseen and untouched in the past. When that has been done, we will get Deputy Corry, life-size, in bronze, and erect him at the mouth of the Shannon in memory and appreciation of all he has done to advance the attractions of our city, and we will include the Parliamentary Secretary in the obituary.  I thank him for all he has not done in the city and county of Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I feel this debate gives the opportunity to deal with local matters of importance <Col N="397" /> as well as national affairs.  That was confirmed by both Deputy Carty, the Parliamentary Secretary, and Deputy Coughlan.  Coming from a constituency such as Roscommon, one must make some comment on the promises that have been made by the Government to the electorate of that constituency at various elections.  I refer to the drainage of the Shannon. When one reads the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, one can see little hope of early work on the Shannon catchment and the catchments of the Shannon tributaries.  In his statement, he said:</P>
      <P>The provision for G.I. Surveys shows a significant increase this year from £22,000 to £50,000.  This increase, I am glad to say, is to enable the detailed survey of the Shannon catchment to be resumed.  It was intended to commence the survey in 1965 but owing to the financial stringency which then arose the Shannon Survey like other desirable undertakings had to be postponed. As I have said before, it was the Government's intention that the investigation should be resumed as soon as circumstances would permit. The provision now made is an earnest of that intention and I hope to make further provision in subsequent years.  This is the beginning of an enormous undertaking, one of the biggest single engineering projects ever undertaken in this country, and it will severely tax the resources of the State to see it through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have only to go back to the by-election in Roscommon four years ago. The then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Malley, arrived in the town of Castlerea and addressed a meeting. He told the electorate that as soon as the by-election was over the drainage of the Shannon would commence.  God knows, that was bad enough, but he went on to tell them the number of people who would be employed on that work during the following few years. That was four years ago but the people are still walking up to their necks in water.  No later than last week their houses were flooded by the Suck, a tributary of the Shannon which affects <Col N="398" /> them very badly.  I accompanied a deputation to the Department with Deputy Lenihan, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Hugh Gibbons, Deputy Mrs. Burke and Senator McQuillan but all we got is what I have just quoted from today's speech.  Therefore, I do not think it is unseemly of me to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give us a date&mdash;I know he is honest and sincere&mdash;when work is expected to commence on the drainage of the Shannon in Roscommon.</P>
    <P>I wish also to refer to the Boyle river. It is a rather minor job, nothing like what is involved in the drainage of the Shannon and its tributaries.  Being a minor catchment area, I do not think the work needed in the Boyle river would embarrass the Government financially.  In the entire constituency which I represent no major work of arterial drainage has been done, though we have been hearing of arterial drainage for many a long year.  It is time some little money was spent in that constituency.</P>
    <P>I admit that a very small scheme has been started at Knockcroghery and I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and his staff.  We hope that now they are in the county they will do some more badly needed work in the near future.  There is yet another badly needed job to be done.  It is the Ballymore Canal, often referred to as the Woodford Canal, which is complicated because of its outlets.  Under the 1937 Drainage Act that canal was excluded from arterial drainage.  There has been a good deal of correspondence between the Board of Works and the Leitrim County Council in an effort to get the canal opened.  The people have been thinking of boating but I suggest some drainage work could be usefully done there at the same time.  There is also the Kilcoole river which connects Leitrim with Northern Ireland.  If that agreement can be made at Kilcoole, it is not unreasonable to ask that a similar agreement be made for the drainage of the Woodford canal.</P>
    <P>The procedure, in 1967, is ridiculous. There is a board appointed every three years by the people who some years ago paid rates for the maintenance of the canal.  Having regard to their limited <Col N="399" /> income, the board does a tremendous amount of work, but I do not think the Office of Public Works can continue to ignore this matter.  The board to which I have referred can make a demand on some limited number of county councils for whatever amount of money they deem necessary for the maintenance of the rivers in that catchment area for the year in question. There is no limit on the amount of money they can collect.  The county councils have no control over that matter.  The Board of Works may have some limited control although I do not think they reserved any control under the 1937 Act.  That is the position today. Something will have to be done about it.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to refer to this matter when he is replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that the cross block at Dublin Castle which was fromerly heated by coal is now being heated by turf.  That is a very interesting statement to me, coming from a constituency in which coal is produced.  A reasonably high-quality coal is produced at Arigna and is used in adjacent counties for heating vocational schools, hospitals and various other institutions.  In connection with the installation of heating systems in counties convenient to Arigna the possibility of using Arigna coal should be examined.  Even in the case of Dublin, in connection with the heating of such places as Dublin Castle, it might be no harm to consider the feasibility of using Arigna coal.  I do not think it is unreasonable to ask that in places within a reasonable distance of the Arigna coalfields the question of the provision of suitable equipment for burning Arigna coal should be considered in connection with the installation of heating systems.</P>
    <P>Coming in to Leinster House, one often wonders as to the repair work that is going on.  The appearance of the main entrance seems to change. One finds the main door closed or an office taken down and the next day the same office put up again.  Somebody should make up his mind and let there be an end to these changes of plan and have the work completed.  I have <Col N="400" /> not a clue as to what is going on in the bar: I am never there.  But if people are changing their minds in relation to the bar, as they seem to be in regard to the main entrance, the expense involved must be considerable.</P>
    <P>Very often one finds that a young contractor who tenders for the building of a school is squeezed out because of the fact that he is not experienced.  I appreciate the problem of the Office of Public Works.  These younger contractors are inclined to think that there is a ring operating.  I do not want anyone to misunderstand me.  I do not mean a political ring.  I mean that tenders of contractors who normally carry out contracts for the Office of Public Works are accepted even though their price may be higher than that of a younger man.  The Parliamentary Secretary should interest himself in this matter.</P>
    <P>Young contractors often experience difficulty in getting bonds but it would be no harm to give these people a living also.  Their contract price may be somewhat lower for many reasons. Being younger, they may be more energetic and their staff or equipment may not be as expensive as in the case of the bigger contractor.  I have in mind a case where a contractor who tendered for the building of a school was not engaged because it was considered that he lacked experience.  I am quite satisfied that this man was experienced and would have been quite capable of carrying out the work.  He has since carried out bigger jobs very successfully.</P>
    <P>There are a great number of schools being reconstructed or replaced&mdash;one out of every three the Parliamentary Secretary said.  A big number of schools remain to be done.  Something should be done about the very bad school buildings.  There are some schools which have neither water nor sanitation.  It is unreasonable to ask teachers and, particularly, children to stay in such schools for the hours that they have to stay there.  There are a number of such schools in my constituency and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see to it that water and sewerage facilities are provided.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Parliamentary <Col N="401" /> Secretary and his staff in the Office of Public Works for the help they have given me.  Any time I write to them or telephone them I find them very helpful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate shows an increase of practically £1 million.  It would be fair to the ordinary Deputy if there were some kind of indication as to how much of the £9 million Estimate is being spent as a kind of relief in Dublin city as against the rest of the country.  I had occasion a few years ago to call attention to this particular matter.  I suggest that three-fourths of this Estimate being spent here in this city in doles to keep Dublin going is a little too much.  It would be far fairer if ordinary Deputies had a list showing where the money is going and the manner in which it is being spent.  The taxpayers are not here to find £5 million for doles for Dublin, and the sooner the Government and those administering the Office of Public Works tumble to that, the better it will be for everybody concerned.</P>
      <P>On the Estimate proper, I should like to congratulate the Board of Works on the classrooms, prefab and otherwise, they are providing around the country.  These are well turned out and are giving satisfaction, as far as I know.  I should like to see a statement on the counties which have been blessed with these classrooms rather than picking out two counties out of the Twenty-Six.  I notice that in Waterford 40 out of the 90 national schools have been dealt with; 100 odd of the 300 schools in Donegal have been dealt with.  I should like to know the number of schools in Cork county which have been dealt with.  We could then see if there is some kind of fair distribution of the money in that particular sector.</P>
      <P>A great part of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech deals with the amount spent on offices in Dublin.  To be quite frank.  I think this is both unjust and unfair.  There are 26 counties in this Republic and there should be a fair distribution of the £9 million involved in this Estimate over those 26 counties.  That £9 million is not meant as a dole for Dublin.  We do not owe that much to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> There is just one other matter to which I wish to refer.  I want to make a comparison.  Under Subhead I, I notice that there is one coast protection work in the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties, that is, Rosslare Strand in Wexford.  Rosslare is getting £5,000. Members of local authorities have expended money on engineers and officials in having examinations carried out and estimates made in relation to coast erosion.  This carrot has been dangled for the past five or six years, but nothing has been done.  There is a coast erosion problem in Youghal.  I attended a few meetings there.  There is £250,000 worth of house property in Youghal, and the people occupying those houses are living in terror every night of the winter, wondering whether their houses will tumble down around their ears during the night.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the protection of those houses is far more important than spending money on Bunratty Castle.  I will find out how much has been spent on the latter later by way of a Parliamentary Question.</P>

Money should be spent on providing safety for our people against the dangers of coast erosion.  Once the thing is eroded it is finished with.  There is no more hope for it.  We cannot bring back the land, the hotels, the houses taken away by coast erosion.  Once coast erosion captures them, they are gone forever.  Money is being spent on various abbeys and friaries and on the Casino at Marino which is now an ancient monument, apparently&mdash;an ancient monument to have money spent on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;yes&mdash;that we have been promised and that some gentlemen were shouting about here from the rooftop from time to time.  I had not time this afternoon to look up the speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor in office, the present Minister for Education, Deputy O'Malley, in which he told us what he intended to do about coast erosion. If I read that out here now, there would be a lot more silence from this side of the House and some red cheeks.</P>
      <P>That is my contribution to this debate.  I think that that £9 million is ill-spent.  I do not think there is any justification for spending £5 million, out of £9 million, in the City of Dublin. That money is collected from the tax-payers of the Twenty-six Counties.  We have too much of this.  Year after year, we have got this dole of the few millions poured into this lump of a dirty city, dirty in every way, nationally and otherwise.  There is no doubt about it. I always say what I think.  For the past 40 years, I have said here what I think and nobody will stop me from doing so.  We have that position.  The money is collected from the sweat and the toil of our people and it is being spent here, and unjustly spent.</P>
      <P>It is time we wakened up to facts. I suggest that when the Parliamentary Secretary comes to introduce the Estimate for his Office here next year he should at least give some consideration to the other counties, including the county of Cork, which have to pay this taxation through the nose for the upkeep of this city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that all Fianna Fáil Deputies do not agree on how the money to be provided under this Estimate will be spent.  It is also a painful pointer to the dictatorial attitude of the Minister for Finance and his Parliamentary Secretary as regards how the money will be spent. I would not altogether agree with Deputy Corry in his remarks about Dublin city, but quite a few of the things he said are true.</P>
      <P>This Estimate is for £9 million odd, £5 million of which will be spent on the City of Dublin in doles.  It is not the duty of any Government to pay any sum of money weekly to any individual or group of individuals.  It is the duty of the Government to provide ways and means for these people to earn a livelihood without having to lose their independence to the Government in office due to the fact that they pay them a weekly sum to remain unemployed.  The result of the recent by-election in Limerick bears out that our people are gradually losing their independence because this Government have failed and are now more than ever failing to provide them with jobs to enable them to attain a decent standard of living for themselves and their families rather than giving them a weekly sum to remain unemployed.</P>
      <P>Approximately three years ago, at the Roscommon by-election, the drainage of the River Shannon was promised. &ldquo;If you elect a Fianna Fáil representative, the Shannon will be drained.&rdquo;  The Fianna Fáil representative was not elected but, even if he had been, the position would be the same as it is today so far as the drainage of the Shannon is concerned.  Part of the area where I live is affected by flooding due to the fact that no effort has been made to drain the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have approached the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance in an effort to get him to settle this or that drainage problem as it affects the people of East Galway.  I asked a question in this House as to when the Suck would be drained.  I do not know what number the Suck is on the order of priority but if the people badly affected by the flooding of the Suck are to have any hope the figure will have to be <Col N="406" /> brought forward quite a lot on the order of priority.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary remembers that I came with a deputation of people from Ballinamorebridge and Newbridge to see what he could do regarding the drainage of the Shivan river.  We made a good case. Not alone does the Shivan river affect Newbridge and Ballinamorebridge but it affects Glenamaddy and many other little villages where there is a great need for employment.  However, the answer we got when we approached the Parliamentary Secretary regarding the drainage of the River Shivan was that it was a tributary of the Suck and that the Suck would have to be drained before the Shivan could be drained and that the Shannon would have to be drained before the Suck could be drained.  That has been my experience for three years and it has been the experience of others for years and years.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary remembers receiving a deputation from people in Roscommon and Leitrim affected by the Suck and the Shannon.  We talked over this problem for some three hours and in the end it became a discussion on what the inter-Party Government did and on what the Fianna Fáil Government were about to do and what they were promising to do all along.  I must say their promises far outlive their achievements.  I remember the view expressed by Senator Jack McQuillan on that occasion.  He said that the people of that area no longer had the drive or incentive to come to the Board of Works to ask them to carry out this drainage.  Even if it were done then, he said, he doubted if the older people would have the determination to continue on and make the land into profitable and productive land.</P>
    <P>The Government have a lot to answer for as far as drainage of the Shannon and west of the Shannon is concerned.  Whatever drainage schemes we have west of the Shannon were, I am glad to say, not started by a Fianna Fáil Government.  If the people west of the Shannon have to wait until their drainage problems are solved by this Government they will have to wait a very long time.  May I remind the Parliamentary Secretary that the Suck <Col N="407" /> affects approximately 20 or 30 farmers in the Ballinasloe area and takes in Caltra, Ahascragh, Ballinamore Bridge, Newbridge, Creggs, Ballygar, Glenamaddy, Glinsk, Ballymoe and many more small towns further into south of Galway.  People from those areas have sent me here as their representative to ask the Government to do something about their drainage problem. I am speaking only on behalf of the people of east Galway but what about the people of Roscommon and Leitrim?</P>
    <P>When Deputy Coughlan was speaking, the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Gibbons, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Carty, who represents the same area as I do, seemed to be making a skit of the point he was putting forward. When a Deputy from this side of the House, or from the Labour benches, talks about something which is not acceptable to the Government, and if they cannot give him a satisfactory answer, they tend to laugh it off.  This is becoming more common every day. Perhaps some of the matters with which I have been dealing may not have been very interesting for Deputies who are present.  I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary has been in conversation with the Minister for Health during most of the time I have been speaking.  I know that there is little hope that the Government or the Board of Works will do what I ask them to do, but if the Parliamentary Secretary listened to some of the things I said, he might learn something. He represents Kilkenny where there is no great drainage problem but the people I represent have not got the same quality land and it is a matter of life and death to them whether there is a wet year or a dry one.</P>
    <P>The Clare-Corrib scheme was in operation some years ago and I think it was in September, 1964, that it was officially finished.  There is one part of that river near Kilbannon, near the factory at Tuam, where there is flooding and I have been requested to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to do something about that flooding.  When the river was being drained there was a small rock cutting near the powerhouse <Col N="408" /> at Kilbannon and I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if there was any chance of having that rock removed. I met about 14 farmers from the area and they showed me the area of land that was under water.  Recently these people approached me again, because after the recent heavy rains the land was a couple of feet under water. Having made representations to the Office of Public Works, I received a reply saying that to remove the rock in question would be uneconomic and that the amount of land that would be drained by its removal would not justify the cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the cost would be but if the Parliamentary Secretary or his engineers looked at this area when it is flooded they might change their minds.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will meet a deputation from the area I will arrange such a deputation.  Possibly what I could not achieve by writing or talking to the Board of Works might be achieved by them. Again, in reference to the River Suck there is there a joint drainage board and every year, particularly in winter, a certain amount of money is spent by the board on the upkeep of the river.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising this matter, I must first go back to what happened in this House when we came in after the last general election and passed the Cork City Boundary Bill.  This resulted in a decision by the arbitrators that £1½ million would have to be paid in compensation by Cork city to the ratepayers of County Cork.  The decision was that this sum would have to be paid at once.  But last year we met the Corporation in this matter and we gave them 15 years to pay, with interest at 6½ per cent in the meantime.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to get agreement between two contributing bodies like health authorities.  In this case, after some difficulty on both sides, we came to the following agreement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork Corporation agree with Cork County Council that, as from the <Col N="409" /> 1st April, 1966, the expenses of Cork Health Authority in any financial year shall be contributed by Cork County Council and Cork Corporation in proportion to the populations of their respective administrative areas in accordance with the recent census of population taken prior to the commencement of the year concerned, as certified by the Director of the Central Statistics Office This agreement is subject to the consent of the Minister for Health. </P>
    <P>That was passed by Cork Corporation on 8th February, 1966, and adopted by Cork County Council on 21st February, 1966.  As required by section 11 (3) of the Health Authorities Act, 1960, the Minister for Health consented to the terms of this agreement on the 5th April, 1966.</P>
    <P>Section 11 (3) states:</P>
    <P>The expenses (other than those under the Public Assistance Act, 1939) of a health authority (other than the Dublin Health Authority) established by this Act shall be contributed, by the local authorities who appoint members of the health authority, in such proportions as those authorities may agree upon with the consent of the Minister or, failing such agreement being made within a period of six months (or such longer period as may be approved of by the Minister) after the day of the establishment of the health authority, in such proportions as may be determined by a person appointed for the purpose by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Agreement was come to between Cork County Council and Cork Corporation as to the basis on which those contributions would be made.  The only way in which this can be varied is as follows.  Subsection 6 (b) of this section states:</P>
    <P>A determination under this section may be varied&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  by agreement between the authorities concerned made with the consent of the Minister ... </P>
    <P>There is no other agreement but the one.</P>
    <P>Today I asked the Minister if he is <Col N="410" /> aware that a circular issued by his Department has been construed by a health authority manager in such a way that it is now proposed to levy £42,000 on the county ratepayers of Cork; and that this seems to contravene section 11 (3) of the Health Authorities Act, 1960; if the construction put on the circular is that intended by his Department; and, if not, if he will make a statement on the matter.  I received the statement which said at the end:</P>
    <P>I understand that this matter was discussed at a meeting of the health authority held on the 13th instant and that the feeling was that the agreement referred to should not be valid.  If this is acceptable to the contributing bodies, that ends the matter.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is not a matter for discussion even between the contributing bodies, because any breach of section 11 of the Health Authorities Act is illegal no matter who carries it out. Therefore, on the advice of the Cork County solicitor I am opposing this matter.  The vote taken on Monday last was 25 votes to 8 in favour of holding to this agreement, honourably made between these two bodies.  I do not mind if the Government come along in the morning and make a contribution to the stealing and robbery enacted in this House in the Cork City Boundary Act.  If they gave a grant in the morning of the whole £1½ million to Cork city, it is none of my business.  But it certainly is my business when this means is used to extract only half the amount of the compensation to be paid each year.  The two committees agreed that they pay £100,000 a year for 15 years and 6½ per cent interest.  I will oppose the action of any Minister of this or any other Government who seeks to contravene that by giving half of it, and expecting £42,300 extra out of the county for the benefit of the city. I can guarantee that, so long as I have the honour to represent that county council as its chairman, nothing of that kind will pass through this House or anywhere else.  I will not remain for five minutes a member of any Government who endeavour by that means to deprive the ratepayers of Cork County of the compensation that is due to them <Col N="411" /> by the robbery of their territory by Cork city and by this House.</P>

      <P>I certainly agree with what Deputy Corry says, that it is a difficult matter to get agreement between two contributory bodies in regard to any matter as complicated as the administration of the health services in a huge area like the city and county of Cork.  For the year 1967-68 the amount involved was £2,616,000 and this was made up of 50 per cent of the normal statutory recoupment, which was £2,295,000, and a supplementary grant of £321,000. Nevertheless, as Deputy Corry says, agreement was reached between Cork Corporation and Cork County Council, and this agreement provided for recognition of the differences in population as between the county and the city.  This was a fair agreement because, due to the increasing population of the city as against the county, the burden would thereby fall to a greater extent on the city than on the county.</P>
      <P>When the estimates meeting was held in Cork in January, 1967, that is, prior to the notification by my Department of the health grant that would be given to them, they adopted an estimate on the assumption that the health grant for 1967-68 would be provided on the same basis as for the previous year, namely, that it would be made in full.  This erroneous assumption resulted in the figure for the health grant for 1967-68 being £71,000 more than the actual amount received by the health authority from my Department. It then fell to the Cork Health Authority to decide how the £71,000 should be apportioned.  They received a circular from me which they appear to have misinterpreted because the circular said, <i>inter alia:</i></P>
      <P>Payment of the grant for 1967-68 of the amount mentioned above is authorised by the Minister on the understanding that it will be applied in such a way as to maintain the health rate to be levied for each of the contributory bodies as near as possible to the rate for the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> The literal interpretation of this, the one adopted by the health authority, would result in Cork County Council having to pay £87,000 more and Cork Corporation obtaining a refund of £16,000.  This was never intended by me and was, in fact, in breach of the agreement of 1966 made between the two parts of the authority.  It arose because, as a result of the previous agreement based on population, the City of Cork was already subsidising the county to some extent.</P>
    <P>When this was brought to the attention of the authority they very properly went back to the terms of the agreement of 1966 and amended these figures so as to oblige Cork Corporation to pay £26,000 and Cork County Council £42,000.  As a result of this amendment, the county council was better off to the extent of £43,000, and the corporation worse off to the extent also of £43,000.  Therefore, Deputy Corry is quite wrong in suggesting that the people of the county of Cork and the council are being asked to bear an additional £43,000.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with him at all that there was anything illegal in the actions that have been taken.  On the contrary, the agreement of 1966 has been properly fulfilled now that the necessary adjustments in favour of the county have been made by the authority and the original allocation has not been proceeded with.  I would remind Deputy Corry that the provisions of the section in question give the Minister only limited powers.  He must, admittedly, consent to the agreement, but where this agreement was concerned there was no difficulty in the then Minister agreeing to it because it favoured the county as against the city, which he thought, in all the circumstances, was fair, provided, of course, that the imbalance did not appear to be unjust.  It did not appear to be unfair and, accordingly, he consented to its terms.  Had I been present, I would not have been able to see any reason why I should not have consented also.  The Minister comes in, admittedly, if there is a request from either one of the authorities concerned to appoint somebody to make a determination. Indeed, it is also provided, <Col N="413" /> although it is not relevant here, that he can do so on his own initiative.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have said that not merely are the people of Cork county not being asked to subsidise the people of the city, but that on the contrary, the agreement of 1966 under which the city already subsidises the county to some extent&mdash;assuming an alteration in the population in the years ahead, namely, a slight growth continuing in the city and a slight decline in the county&mdash;would have the effect more and more of favouring the people of the county as against those in the city.  Had the original interpretation of the circular issued by the Department in February last been put into operation, then the people of the county would have had to find £87,000 instead of £42,000, and the people of the city would have had a refund of £16,000.  As I have said, this appeared to be, and, in fact, was contrary to the terms of the agreement, I think, very properly entered into the previous year.  When this was pointed out, the necessary adjustment was made in favour of the people of the county.</P>
    <P>It will be clear that had this situation obtained last year as in the previous year, namely, that all increases were being met out of central funds, then this question would not arise at all.  Last year the provision in the White Paper and the Government's decision in regard to an expansion of the health services had to be literally applied, and this had the result of increasing the rate to a small extent in practically every county in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, I slightly varied the amount of the additional supplementary grant&mdash;I say &ldquo;additional supplementary grant&rdquo; advisedly because there was already a supplementary grant&mdash;in such a way that the weaker counties like Monaghan, Donegal, Mayo, <i>et cetera,</i> would have a slightly higher percentage of the subvention than the better-off counties.  I do not make any apology to the House for so doing.  Indeed, I was merely implementing one of the proposals in the White Paper in this regard.</P>
    <P>Other than that, the general picture was that the State paid on average <Col N="414" /> 55 per cent all told of the total cost of the health services.  This varied roughly from 53 per cent at the lowest to 58 per cent at the highest.  In Cork, out of the figure of £2.6 million, the State percentage contribution fell this figure short, £71,000, and the confusion arose over the interpretation simultaneously of the terms of the 1966 agreement and the circular which was sent out by my Department.</P>
    <P>What I want to make quite clear is that while the agreement of 1966 had and has the force of law, the circular issued by my Department did not have the force of law, and was merely admonishing the various health authorities to try to so operate their money as to increase the rate evenly in all areas.  What predominated in Cork was the existence of a binding document, the agreement of 1966, which had not been varied and which undoubtedly is valid pursuant to the 1960 Act.  It has been confirmed very recently as being just and fair between the county and the city.</P>
    <P>I hope I have clarified, first, Deputy Corry's mind in regard to what has happened, and secondly, the minds of the people of the county and city of Cork because I should not like the people of Cork county to accept that what Deputy Corry alleges has happened in fact has happened.  As I pointed out, the opposite has happened, and again the city has subsidised the county.  May I say I think that is how it ought to be?  If an agreement were submitted to me or my Department, which in any way reacted unfavourably upon the people of the county and in favour of the city, it would not have my consent.</P>
    <P>The agreement of 1966 appears to me to be fair and just, taking everything into consideration.  I am glad the people of the county were relieved by their colleagues in the city of more than £40,000 in respect of the additional money that had to be found.</P>
