    <Title>Leaders&rsquo; Questions. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ask the Minister for Finance about traffic congestion every morning in Dublin, particularly on the M50, and to refer to a number of related matters.  Yesterday I met a family by the name of Price in Lucan and they are typical of 100,000 families caught in this bind.  The Taoiseach, speaking at the Ard-Fheis last weekend, made the point that people should imagine the changes that are yet to come in transport.  I know that the Government cannot wave a magic wand and sort all this out overnight, but the Price family are commuters &mdash; commuting generally means movement &mdash; and in their case it takes between 25 and 47 minutes to get their three-year old to a cr&egrave;che and a similar time to get from there back on to the main route into Dublin.</P>
        <P>The M50 roundabout is a major contributory factor to rising stress levels, lack of productivity and consternation among hundreds of thousands of commuters, including those coming into the city from outside the greater Dublin area.  The Price family is no exception to this.  Having spent two hours out there and having seen at first hand the chaos and confusion, one can understand that a great number of people in Lucan and in the <Col N="2"/>vicinity of the Ballyowen roundabout have lost a sense of hope that anybody can do anything about this.</P>
        <P>I put forward a number of practical suggestions that could relieve some of that congestion and ease the movement of traffic in the short term.  For instance, the Government is discussing with National Toll Roads the question of raising the toll barriers and the Government will decide on that matter, but surely a mechanism should be put in place so that when traffic backs up as far as the bridge, an arrangement would be made for the toll barriers to be lifted, which would ease the congestion in getting on to the M50 in the first place.  It is obvious that when school term begins, up to 40,000 extra car journeys are made by parents delivering children to and from school.  Perhaps in that area a specific facility for specialist school bus runs would be helpful in relieving that pressure and congestion.  Will the Minister consider that those two suggestions are practical and implementable?  I have a few more besides for him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two aspects to this.  Obviously, the Minister, the NRA, the traffic authorities concerned and the Garda look at any possible practical short-term <Col N="3"/>measures that are realistic and viable.  We all recognise that there is a particular problem but, unfortunately, when problems are highlighted people then suggest that no progress is being made on any front.  As Deputy Kenny will be aware, there is a major investment plan for the upgrading of the M50, which the Minister for Transport is pursuing with the NRA, and we have seen such works being carried out successfully on other major routes such as the Naas Road.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While it is not for me to decry any suggestion that may come from anybody who is dealing with these matters &mdash; I am sure they can be looked at in a practical way by the authorities concerned &mdash; a genuine priority is being accorded to a major investment to increase capacity there.  The suggestion that lifting barriers would deal with existing capacity rather than attract further capacity and cause further gridlock is another issue to which traffic management experts refer.  There is no simple obvious solution to this problem.  Changing the interchanges, widening the motorway and providing more capacity is the genuine solution and of course that takes time.  In the meantime anything that can be done to alleviate what I acknowledge is a difficult situation can be considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not here to decry all the ongoing efforts.  The Price family, for instance, as one of 100,000 families in that area, make the point that each week Catherine Price spends two and a half working days in her car and her husband spends another working day in his car.  Three and a half days over 100,000 families equates to approximately &euro;3 billion in terms of lost productivity, pressure on time etc.</P>
        <P>By the end of this year the Government will have spent &euro;173 million on quality bus corridors, but between 2000 and 2006 Dublin Bus was not given any additional buses.  That is obviously a matter that should be dealt with.  Having spoken to the drivers of Dublin Bus and of Morton&rsquo;s private buses, neither company has been able to get on to the quality bus corridor in that area.  Commuters are being cheated on both fronts.  If they take public or private licensed transport, they still cannot make any movement to get out on to the main road.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister for Finance consider that immediate implementation of Operation Freeflow would be of assistance?  Having garda&iacute; at every relevant junction to keep traffic moving is important.  The M50 is being upgraded but it will not be finished until 2011.  When the Dublin Port tunnel opens it is expected that between 4,000 and 6,000 trucks will emerge on the platform to get on to the M50.  With the work at the new terminal, this will obviously cause further congestion in that area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Perhaps the following would be helpful.  Immediate implementation of Operation Freeflow, allowing an extra 100 private licensed bus <Col N="4"/>operators, another 100 buses in addition to those which have been spoken about by Government, and the immediate establishment of a Dublin transport authority for licensing so that people who want to use public transport or private licensed transport will have that facility.  Having spoken to people at first hand, they will avail of such transport.  The endless frustration and consternation experienced by so many people who just sit in their cars every morning and evening is unnecessary when in the immediate term the Government can take action which would result in an improvement in the situation.</P>
        <P>I realise the Government is providing money for longer-term projects, but these will not bring results over night.  The Government could implement five or six proposals immediately to ease this pressure and I recommend strongly that it does so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Operation Freeflow is being co-ordinated currently and preparations are ongoing.  It will come on stream in the usual way.  The question of how it can be prolonged beyond the normal Christmas period is an issue for the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Transport to consider.</P>
        <P>The bus fleet has increased significantly.  It is incorrect to say capacity has not increased in 2006.  Almost 1,000 bigger and better buses have been brought into service since 1997 and the bus fleet is much more modern, efficient and effective.  Capacity has increased by 40% in that time and, therefore, there has been a substantial renewal and increase in line with commitments under the national development plan.  The subvention provided to Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath has also increased significantly from &euro;8.8 million to &euro;70 million annually, which reflects increased capital investment and capacity.  Under Transport 21, the Government has made a serious commitment to public transport as the best way to deal with the situation.  An investment of up to &euro;500 million is being contemplated in the bus fleet, quite apart from the major extensions of the Luas and the metro, which have proceeded to planning.  The question of investment in public transport being a key to relieving the long-term problem is acknowledged in Transport 21.  It is a central part of the investment framework going forward.</P>
        <P>With regard to the more immediate issue, Operation Freeflow is being co-ordinated and preparations are concluding so that it can be undertaken in the normal way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to ask the Minister for Finance about the electoral register mess.  Will he take a personal interest in the situation that has been created?  Some 600,000 names were removed from the register but the problem is they are not the correct names.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who is responsible for the register, describes these <Col N="5"/>as &ldquo;inadvertent deletions&rdquo;.  An estimated 20% of people on the register should not be on it but, instead, the wrong names have been deleted.  When <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>, in particular, brought this matter to public attention, we asked the Government to use the census process so enumerators would give citizens an electoral register form as well to be collected when they returned for the census form but that was ignored.  We sought amending legislation to permit compliance with the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s view that access to the information stored by utility companies and others should be facilitated but the Minister also pooh-poohed that.  We are back to &ldquo;inadvertent deletions&rdquo; and the attitude is to blame county councils and the citizen.  However, it is the Government&rsquo;s task to maintain the electoral register.  Credit companies have more reliable quality data than the register.</P>
        <P>I suggest a few measures the Government might take urgently.  The first is to extend the deadline to register beyond 25 November.  It is not possible to deal with the scale of inaccuracy between now and 25 November.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time is concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The deadline should be extended so that initiatives can be taken to at least correct some of the damage.  A massive advertising and public awareness campaign is needed and the leaders of political parties need to make a joint appeal to the public in respect of the state of the register.  Additional resources should be provided to local authorities to validate the job that requires to be done.  A helpline, with in-built verification, is needed for those who cannot go on-line to correct inaccuracies.  Anyone whose name has been deleted from the register ought to be notified in writing that he or she has been removed and to tell him or her what he or she can do about it.  The procedures for getting on the supplementary register ought to be made more amenable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time is concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because the only route available to people to get on it is to attend their local Garda station and, in many cases, they will not do that.  The practice varies throughout the country but, in some parts, people will simply not do that.  That process must be simplified.  Measures can still be taken at this stage.  The issue needs to be addressed urgently because remarks such as &ldquo;Sure, only 70% of the people would vote on the best day&rdquo; is not the way to approach this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to give way to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="6"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a cornerstone of the basis on which we should conduct elections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We all take this matter seriously.  It is not a question of being blas&eacute; about it.  We are all aware of the serious problems there were with the accuracy of the register and that has been a feature of the register for a long number of years.  This has been exacerbated by population mobility with hundreds of thousands of people changing their addresses every year.  For example, 90,000 new homes were built last year while thousands of other houses changed hands.  Councils have been slow to remove people from the register.  Names have always been added to the register without the concomitant obligation to delete names.  Failure to remove names on death or to reflect family breakdown and ownership of second homes has complicated what was never a simple issue in the first place.</P>
        <P>Arising from the concern expressed on all sides of the House, the Government instigated a comprehensive and thorough review.  Local authorities completed field work for the most extensive and equitable registration campaign in decades.  A total of 1,500 field workers called on 1.25 million households while extensive publicity campaigns were undertaken.  Suggestions in the media that the draft register would still contain more than 500,000 names that should not be included may have arisen because of the failure to take into account the 8% increase in population when one compares the 2002 census result with the 2007-08 register.  The newspaper did not take that factor into account and, therefore, the difference may not be as great as suggested.  However, whether it is or not, between now and 25 November, we must examine what way political parties and activists can help to make sure voters are registered.  A great deal of activity is going on in that regard.</P>
        <P>Thankfully, the supplementary register system, to which the Deputy referred, is much more flexible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not flexible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Minister to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true.  Deputy Rabbitte asked the question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be working in Laoighis-Offaly but it is not in Dublin West.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Minister to continue without interruption.  The Deputy&rsquo;s party leader had four and a half minutes to speak when he should have had only two.  The Deputies should not take the Minister&rsquo;s time.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="7"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>One could not get on the supplementary register previously when the deadline passed but once 25 November has passed, it will still be possible to get on the register up to 15 days before the next election.  It is not the case that if a person has failed to register by 25 November, he or she will be deprived of a vote and we should not send that message to the public.  A supplementary register system is in place, which is designed to make sure we do not end up in the position that pertained in the old days where, once the white register was published in January or February, that was it.  It is right that there are more flexible arrangements in place for the infirm and the disabled to send postal votes.</P>
        <P>We must continue to promote the idea of people taking on their obligations and ensuring that they are on the register.  We will do everything we can through available systems.  In recent years, the registration of voters has been reformed and the supplementary register system has provided us with a continuous avenue to make the system more accurate than previously.  We want to make it absolutely accurate.</P>
        <P>Inaction in this area was not an option.  People spoke about widespread prospects for fraud, impersonation and so on, an experience in parts of urban Ireland at the last election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about rural Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We have responded with the most comprehensive review of the register in years.  We must continue to work on this matter beyond 25 November and I am sure the Minister will do whatever work he can in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, the Minister is winging it.  I know what the problems are, but what will the Government do to address them?  There is no point telling the House that in the old days, there was no supplementary register.  The Minister is certainly referring to the old days because there has been a supplementary register for as long as I can remember.  There is no point telling people in many parts of the country that they must go to their local Garda stations because the stations in many villages have been closed and urban voters will not queue at Garda stations to check their names or be put on the supplementary register.</P>
        <P>Like every Deputy, I have received dozens of telephone calls, e-mails and so on concerning this matter.  This morning, one of my colleagues in the House contacted me to say that he has been removed from the register.  We have been given all kinds of explanations as to why people who take their voting responsibilities seriously have been removed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>That is ordinary in Dublin North-Central.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="8"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is correct because that type of person will take action to put the situation right, but the great majority of those who have been inadvertently deleted, as the Minister put it, will not put it right and there will be a great deal of anger on polling day when they find that they have been removed from the register.</P>
        <P>Third World countries invite the United Nations to verify that their voting systems are fair, but we are boasting about how wealthy our nation is when we cannot compile the basic electoral register accurately.  Some banks, finance houses and credit companies have records of the citizenry that are more accurate than the electoral register.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>They get the information from the local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>When we paid rates, there was no difficulty in keeping the register accurate and up to date.  Respectfully, I made seven points about what the Government might do.  Unless the Minister&rsquo;s party has a system that is unavailable to the rest of us, which I am sure is not the case, this is a democratic question for our democracy.  The Minister does not seem to take on board the point that the Government must first extend the 25 November deadline.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.  He has gone long over time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If local authorities require more resources, those resources should be made available.  The Government should extend the 25 November deadline because, after that date, one cannot cause one&rsquo;s name to be put on the register until the final register is produced in February, at which time one must go through the rigorous process of attending a Garda station and so on.  This is not a satisfactory situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to give way to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a compelling argument to remove the matter from the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has spoken for all of the seven minutes allotted to this question and I ask that he give way for the Minister to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and to set up an electoral commission to address the issue.  In terms of the immediate situation with which we are confronted, I ask the Minister to address seriously the seven points I raised.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="9"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Many additions and deletions have occurred as a result of extensive field work.  In a number of local authorities, there is a strong correlation between that work and the 2006 census, which estimated how many people at or above 18 years of age will be on the register in 2007 and 2008.  For example, the figure is 100% in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, 101% in County Laois, 99% in north County Tipperary and 100% in south County Tipperary.  There is a strong correlation between the registration pattern and the 2006 census, not the 2002 census.</P>
        <P>Registering every adult will always be difficult, particularly in major urban areas.  For example, the figures for Cork and Dublin are 88% and 80%, respectively.  People have the opportunity to get on the register before the election and we will continue to help in whatever way we can.  If there is excess registration in areas after the local authorities&rsquo; work has been completed, it will reflect the long-standing bias in the system towards putting people on the register and ensuring that their rights to vote are maintained.  Much work has been done to remove people who have died or moved away from the register and we must take account of the significant population movement in recent years.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to table parliamentary questions to the relevant Minister regarding his specific requests, but I do not know whether any of the options is possible and I do not want to say.  Much work has been done and many resources have been devoted to what has been the most comprehensive review ever.  Some people make points about issues in certain areas, but it is a matter for us all to ensure that the register in those areas is as accurate as possible in the time available, which is not limited to 25 November.  I cannot tell the Deputy much more beyond the fact that this campaign has had a view to making the register more accurate.  We must recognise that we are moving from a standing position of an inaccurate register.</P>

	<P>Will the Government draw meaningful conclusions from the drubbing received by American President George Bush and his party in the mid-term elections, which was, above all, a rejection by swelling numbers of ordinary Americans of the unspeakable barbarities unleashed on the Iraqi people by the imperialist invasion of their country?  Hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis, men, women and children, have been slaughtered and maimed and millions have been terrified as a result of the actions of the forces that went there allegedly to liberate them.  Let us not forget the thousands of American soldiers, working class youths in uniform, who have also been slaughtered.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In January 2003, two months before the invasion, the Independent Deputies and this Socialist Party Deputy moved a Private Members&rsquo; motion pointing to the catastrophe that would result from the then imminent invasion of Iraq.  The then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, answered our motion on behalf of the Government.  The Taoiseach and the Government gave credence at all times to the monstrous lies of Bush and Blair that their invasion was about removing weapons of mass destruction and peace when we said it was to remove oil resources and secure imperialist domination of the Middle East.</P>
        <P>The Minister made crucial facilities available to the US war machine at Shannon Airport and continues to do so.  On an annual basis, 250,000 American soldiers are facilitated at Shannon in pursuance of the occupation of Iraq.  He dismissed with contempt 100,000 people who marched in Dublin on 15 February 2003 and defied with contempt the views of the majority of the Irish people who opposed the invasion and the use of Shannon Airport by the US military.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>He allowed the commander-in-chief, President Bush, to parade in Shannon with his troops.  Now that the American people have rejected the bloody carnage that Mr. Bush and his neo-conservative cabal have inflicted on the people of Iraq, will the Irish Government implement the wish of the Irish people and withdraw forthwith its facilitation of, and <i>de facto</i> support for, the Bush war machine at Shannon Airport?</P>

	<P>The only conclusion I can draw at the moment is that they only elected one socialist Deputy.  A Government motion was debated in this Chamber and passed, defeating Deputy Joe Higgins&rsquo;s motion.  The decisions made and explained by Government at the time, which were consistent with our foreign policy traditions, were approved of in this House.  It is not the work of a cabal but a democratic decision of this assembly.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of households which failed or refused to complete a census form in the recent census, though not precisely known at this stage, is believed to be relatively small.</P>
        <P>The Central Statistics Office employed a field force comprising 40 regional supervisors, 400 field supervisors and 4,400 enumerators to carry out the census field operation.  The 4,400 enumerators visited approximately 1.8 million private residences and communal establishments during the course of a nine-week field campaign.  They delivered blank questionnaires to 1.5 million dwellings which were expected to be occupied on census night, 23 April 2006.  Of the remaining 300,000 residences, 275,000 were vacant at the time of the census while in the remaining 25,000 cases the household was either enumerated elsewhere or temporarily absent from the State.</P>
        <P>The vast majority of the population are very supportive of the census and understand the value which the results have in a rapidly changing society.  In a small number of cases householders may have initially refused to complete their census forms.  However, through the intervention of the field supervisors, and in some cases regional supervisors, it was possible to persuade the majority of these householders to comply.  The number of households that refused outright to co-operate with the census was less than 20.  The CSO will consult the Office of the Chief State Solicitor with a view to pursuing cases through the courts.</P>
        <P>Despite the tenacity of the enumerators in making contact with householders during the course of the nine-week field campaign a number of householders may have evaded contact.  Operating under strict guidelines, the enumerators were instructed to impute basic demographic information such as age, sex and nationality for the occupants of these households.  The details were filled in by the enumerators on census forms with the word &ldquo;IMPUTE&rdquo; entered in the county of birth portion of the form to distinguish the census form as one which was constructed.  When all of the census forms are processed it will be possible to derive an exact figure for the extent of this category.  However, preliminary indications are that the number of persons involved is of the order of 6,000.  The relevant population was included in the data published in the preliminary census report last July.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the quality of the work done by the CSO.  The first thing that occurs to me about the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply is to <Col N="14"/>compare it with the response of the Minister for Finance earlier on the question of the electoral register.  The Minister of State said there were 440 enumerators and a certain number of supervisors and others.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>There were 400 field supervisors and 4,400 enumerators. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If almost 5,000 are required to carry out the census it is probably not surprising we have made such a botched job of the electoral register, on which 1,500 people were employed to do essentially the same job in a shorter period.  Will the Minister for Finance, who is still in the House, take that on board?  I do not expect him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We want to have an orderly Question Time.  This is Question Time for the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and to address remarks to another Minister in the House is moving away totally from that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am very sorry a Cheann Comhairle.  I did not mean to refer to the presence of the Minister for Finance.  Let it be deleted from the record.  However, if he is listening outside, he might take&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to stay within the Department addressed in the questions.  I accept the reference to the census, but not to the electoral register.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a constructive point and purely intended as such.  We need to take urgent action on the matter and the answer provided by the Minister of State bears out statistically the truth of that.</P>
        <P>In respect of the one sixth of houses in the jurisdiction that are not habitually occupied, what rule of thumb did the CSO apply?  We had some exchanges previously on the issue of the shortfall &mdash; where enumerators returned time after time to houses and still failed to get people to comply &mdash; and the Minister asked the senior statistician to write to me on it.  He made the point that they were able to persuade the majority of those of the need to comply.  However, in the case of those who did not comply, for whatever reason, have any prosecutions been initiated?</P>
        <P>The letter I received states that in a small number of cases instructions were issued to field staff to provide direct estimates of the age, sex and nationality of individuals whom they knew to be present, but who went out of their way to avoid enumeration.  Is this saying that when enumerators visited a house or an apartment block, they were asked to make a stab at the number of persons they believed to be resident there and that as a result a guesstimate was made of the number of people who sought to evade com<Col N="15"/>pliance?  Is that guesstimate included in the figures from the CSO?  In respect of those who were not persuaded to comply, have prosecutions been or will they be initiated?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>With the Chair&rsquo;s permission I will deal with the question raised by Deputy Rabbitte with regard to a comparison between the census work and the work now being carried out on the electoral register.  The Labour Party has proposed to legislate for using information gathered in the census to update the electoral register.  This would be a fundamental breach of trust by the State.  I explained before that the seal of confidentiality under which census data is collected is a binding contract between the State and the citizen.  An attempt to undermine that trust, as suggested by the Labour Party, could undermine the compilation of the census, not just now but in years to come.  People must be assured that their right of privacy will not be legislated away after the event.  Not only is the proposal unethical, it is not even sensible.  Tourists or temporary workers staying in Ireland on the night of the census would find themselves on the Irish electoral register.  There are serious issues with regard to the confidential nature of the census exercise as compared to the work of compiling the electoral register.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has said there are over 1,500 field workers involved in that process.  I do not wish to reopen that debate, but it is important for me to answer the question.</P>
        <P>With regard to the figure of 6,000 to which I referred, the answer is yes, the enumerators were asked to impute the figures in those cases.  Having returned time after time it was their duty to try to establish, perhaps from neighbours or other channels, figures for who and how many were there.  The figure of 6,000 in the initial figures has been included in the overall figure derived from the work of the census.</P>
        <P>With regard to legal action, the number of households that refused outright to co-operate &mdash; despite the fact the information provided is confidential, some people have a problem co-operating and refuse to do so for their own reasons &mdash; is very small.  I referred to a figure of approximately 20, but the number of households that refused outright to co-operate with the census operation was less than 20.  As a refusal to respond to the census is an offence under the Statistics Act 1993, the CSO will consult with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor with a view to pursuing these cases through the courts.  That process is at an initial stage and no prosecutions have yet been made.  The issue will be followed up and those who refused to comply will be pursued legally.  Fines were set as high as &pound;20,000 in the original Act and can now go to &euro;25,000 on conviction.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="16"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The suggestion put forward by my colleague, Deputy Quinn, was that there would be two separate forms.  I cannot see how two separate forms, handled and sealed separately, could involve any breach of confidentiality.</P>
        <P>What is the anticipated date of publication of the final census report?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>In a previous reply to Deputy McManus I referred to &ldquo;early next year&rdquo;.  That is as near as I can come to providing a definitive date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a bit like the electoral register.  Even the Ceann Comhairle must admit this question is permissible under the rules.  What does &ldquo;early next year&rdquo; mean?</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I would make a guess of either March or April.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister of State find out for us?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the election, I will communicate with the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>We have never seen the advice proffered to suggest the very reliable data we already have in the preliminary report is not a basis for revision of constituencies.  Is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to make that advice available to the House generally?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not normal practice to publish legal advice and the Minister has no plans to do so.  The Deputy knows the position.  Following publication of the CSO preliminary reports, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, sought the advice of the Attorney General on the census results and constituency boundaries.  The Attorney General has advised that constituencies can only be revised on the basis of the final census figures.  The preliminary figures cannot constitutionally be used to revise constituencies.</P>
        <P>The Electoral Act 1997 provides for the establishment of a constituency commission upon the publication of the census report which contains the final figures.  The Act also sets out the considerations to which a commission must have regard in observing the relevant provisions of the Constitution.  The Minister intends to establish such a commission to review and report on D&aacute;il and European constituencies as soon as the relevant census report is published.  Under the Act, the commission will be required to report to the Ceann Comhairle as soon as may be, and in any event within six months of its establishment.  The reports will then be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is the procedure.</P>

        <P>Forms for individuals and households were available in both English and Irish and could be completed in either of the two official languages.  In addition, to facilitate recent immigrants, translations of the census form were provided in 11 foreign languages, including Arabic, Chinese, French, Latvian, Russian, Spanish and so on.  Respondents could study the language version of their choice by completing either the English or Irish language form.  I will raise that matter with the Central Statistics Office.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct that there are many lessons to be learned from this experience.  The Deputy and I have discussed previously the need to use the Internet.  We would all hope by the time of the next census of population that we will be using the Internet, particularly on an exercise of this nature, especially given the problems with gated communities and apartment blocks.  It is clear from my earlier reply, despite the fact that enumerators used mobile phones and calling cards, they still had difficulty gaining access.  Given that modern communications will be freely available next time round, it will be important to use the Internet on that occasion.  That is a given.  I will raise that issue.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="18"/>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly, it is important if there is to be a complete set of figures that everybody fills in the census of population form.  If people did not fill in the form, there will have to be a review as to why they did not do so.  There was much advertising at the time on the need for people to fill in the form in order that services could be planned based on an actual population.  Where is the evidence that the census figures are used for that purpose?  For example, in the areas of health care, education and transport planning in my constituency, there is no evidence that the census of population is used.  A reasonable complaint could be made to the Advertising Standards Authority on that basis.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt the CSO does a good job in compiling the figures.  How is it that the census figures of 2002 could not predict the need for schools in my area or in other areas where there is a rapid population growth?  Perhaps the Minister of State will say how census figures will be used as I do not see the evidence.  I encouraged people to fill in their forms, but I do not see that it has made a difference in that, as stated in the advertisements, services would be planned for people on the basis of where they live.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>We are getting into broader issues.  I would be aware, as would anybody else who was campaigning in the Deputy&rsquo;s by-election, of the massive growth in population in north Kildare.  We all accept that it is crucial work in regard to forward planning.   There are questions in regard to disability on which we will seek detailed information to enable us plan for the tremendous investment that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and others have made in that area.  Our job is to make the investment.</P>
        <P>On planning, we get the maximum amount of statistics and figures to help whoever is in Government at local and national level to do the job properly.  From my experience, there is a massive increase in population in Kildare as well as many foreign workers.  That is evident in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency as well as in mine.  One cannot always plan for that in a detailed way.  Planning is an ongoing process.  I accept there are pressures on schools, but it is up to Governments to move on and to try to provide those facilities.  Whether in Kildare or south Dublin we have to plan for motorways, roads, infrastructure, hospitals and schools.  The massive growth in population and the arrival of immigrants are symptoms of a successful economy.  Sometimes there are elements of success for which we cannot provide instant solutions.  That is what is happening as far as I am concerned.  They are qualities in an economy we would all welcome in any given day.  When we compare ourselves to other economies throughout the EU, we are the envy of many.  While the figures can only do so much, they are crucial for forward planning.</P>

	<P>On the issue of why people do not return census of population forms, perhaps the Minister of State would give consideration to the fact that people do not think it worthwhile to return them.  On the basis of the census, the National Development Plan 2000-2006 was drawn up, on which there is an underspend of &euro;3.7 billion.  This includes an underspend of &euro;500 million on our roads.  When people filled in their census of population form, they would have expected by the time of the second census that the roads, infrastructure and broadband would be in place and that they would have everything they need to make our area competitive in order that people could continue to live there, including their families.  We are into the second census of population where there is now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Since the census has shown a growth of population in my area, including immigrants, as mentioned by the Minister of State, what hope have they got and what hope have we got given that the National Development Plan 2000-2006 is coming to an end at the end of next month?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Can people have any more hope when they return the census of population form that the information gleaned from it will make a difference, given that it has not made a difference so far in view of the underspend of &euro;3.65 billion under the national development plan?</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Part and parcel of the publicity campaign is to underline the importance of this work.  As I said earlier, most people agree that it is important work for whichever Government is in place.  The Deputy represents a part of the country where it is crucial to have proper census figures for future planning, whether for the western corridor or wherever, and Transport 21 bears that out.  The Government is conscious of the need for transport infrastructure in particular.  There is an onus on all of us as public representatives to support this process because it is in the interests of the ordinary citizen.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a straightforward question of how we count the people who are in the country on census night.  If, for example, Limerick residents were in Dublin on the night to support Munster, they were counted in guesthouses and hotels in Dublin.  People on boats and civilian ships in Dublin&rsquo;s harbours and tourists in Ireland for the night were also counted.  However, people who were away from the country were not counted.  The latter may be the people to which Deputy Rabbitte referred.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State saying that, if a census enumerator knocks on a door in An Spid&eacute;al but finds nobody at home, the occupants are simply excluded?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it the Minister of State is not chancing his arm.  Has he established that with the CSO?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said earlier, a process has to be followed in which houses are revisited.  Enumerators were given mobile telephones and calling cards, so it is not a question of knocking once and not finding anybody there.  However, if people are away on holidays, for example, they are not counted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The functions of the Central Statistics Office, as set out in section 10 of the Statistics Act 1993, include the collection, compilation, extraction and dissemination for statistical purposes of information relating to economic, social and general activities and conditions in the State.  The CSO&rsquo;s publications reflect this remit.  In certain instances, where long-term time series cover the period before the foundation of the State, such as long-term population trends, the statistics <Col N="21"/>cover the same area to facilitate comparisons.  The CSO has undertaken a number of initiatives in co-operation with the relevant Departments in Northern Ireland, including the publication of three thematic volumes of Ireland, North and South: A Statistical Profile.  The 2000 edition was published in January 2001, followed by an on-line update in January 2003, while the 2003 report was published in January 2004.  The most recent example of that co-operation was the inclusion of statistical information on Northern Ireland as an appendix to the 2006 edition of the CSO&rsquo;s Statistical Yearbook of Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Central Statistics Office on the quality of its work, particularly with regard to the compilation, preparation and presentation of the Statistical Yearbook of Ireland.  However, has the Minister of State noted this otherwise useful and well-presented publication does not include a section which presents in a crisp and simple form the critical information on the all-Ireland population and a variety of other matters?  One has to take the collective figures on the population of the Twenty-six Counties and then refer to the appendix in order to carry out the necessary calculations.  For the record, the population of Ireland is in excess of 5.95 million people.</P>
        <P>Given that the appendix now covers the Six Counties, will the Minister of State ask the CSO to include a simple tabular profile of the reality of the situation on the island of Ireland when it prepares future editions of the Statistical Yearbook of Ireland?  It would not be an onerous task to do so and it would be of tremendous interest to people.</P>
        <P>Historic information should also be presented.  Has the Minister of State noted that, although partition was imposed in 1921, the publication&rsquo;s historical information dating back to 1841 refers to three provinces and the three Ulster counties, Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, which are part of this State but does not present information on the overall population which censuses conducted between 1841 and 1921 would certainly have revealed?  Does he agree this gives a false picture and will he use his office to appeal to the CSO to take on board my repeated appeals to him in this regard, as well as the views expressed by others?  Does he further agree that the CSO should produce a section dedicated to the all-Ireland presentation of facts and figures pertaining to the people of the island of Ireland in all 32 counties?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the CSO&rsquo;s legal mandate, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will appreciate, the agency does not have jurisdiction to collect statistics from households or businesses in Northern Ireland and would not, therefore, be in a position to compile statistics on Northern Ireland.  However, the Deputy is not suggesting that anyway.  I agree that the maximum level of co-operation in this area is <Col N="22"/>vital to the interests of the island of Ireland and I will convey his views to the CSO.</P>
        <P>As I stated earlier, the agency has undertaken a number of initiatives in co-operation with the relevant Departments in Northern Ireland but we have different ways of collecting information.  With regard to the comparability of statistics when compiling the North-South statistical profile, it is important to note that different concepts are used on either side of the Border to collect information and in the classification system used when publishing tables.  For these reasons, some statistics are not directly comparable between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  The CSO will consider, in consultation with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, NISRA, the publication of a new edition of the North-South statistical profile when the full 2006 census of population results are available.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct that, since the foundation of the State, tables showing long-term time series for the Twenty-six Counties have regularly been included in statistical publications.  The 1926 census, for example, included figures dating back to 1821 in respect of the Twenty-six Counties, which allowed population figures to be presented on a comparative geographical basis.  The main areas for which statistics were compiled prior to the foundation of the State were population, agriculture, births, deaths and marriages.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot really confirm that matter, which would be best addressed to the Taoiseach.  The Attorney General will need to give formal advice on whether a referendum is required for the St. Andrews agreement.  He did not attend Cabinet yesterday.  The matter has not arisen at any Cabinet meetings I have attended since the discussions took place at St. Andrews.  Therefore the question of when it would take place and whether it would be joined with any other proposal would probably be dependent, regarding the children&rsquo;s issue, on trying to build consensus in the House on what that constitutional amendment should entail.  I note some of the proposals from the Joint Committee on Child Protection, under the chairmanship of Deputy Peter Power, have also been published in today&rsquo;s newspapers.  All the work needs to be pulled together by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to ascertain whether the matter can be dealt with consensually on an all-party basis.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, line 15, after &ldquo;oils&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, including oils derived from bio fuels&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We discussed this matter on Committee Stage.  This amendment is necessary and desirable and is indicative of where we need to go in the future.  It says something about the intention of the Bill in particular.  It is intended to be all-embracing and descriptive.  It is a necessary amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not accepting this amendment.  I accept the motivation in putting it down but it would have the opposite effect to the effect the Deputy wants.  My understanding of the intent of the Deputy is that he wants biofuels mentioned in this section because of the increased importance of biofuels, renewable energy sources and so on in the future.  I do not disagree with his view that they will be important.  That is why we have come up with the two schemes in regard to biofuels but the effect of including this amendment in the Bill would be to place a levy on biofuels similar to that on fossil fuels.  That would make biofuels more expensive and for that reason would defeat the purpose of the excise relief scheme on biofuels.</P>
        <P>While I accept the thinking of the Deputy in trying to highlight the importance of biofuels in the future, this Bill is not the way to do it.  It would be more appropriate to a different kind of Bill.  I am sure the Deputy would not want a levy to be put on biofuels because that might have the effect of diminishing any move towards the provision of biofuels in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have thought about this matter since Committee Stage and I believe I was right the first time.  The original intention was as the Minister has indicated, but there is no reason the same cannot apply as does now, where a particular exemption is made.  The description of petroleum products in the Bill includes the following categories of products: &ldquo;(<i>a</i>) motor spirit and <Col N="30"/>aviation fuel (that is to say, jet fuel of the gasoline type and aviation spirit); (<i>b</i>) gas oil, diesel oil and kerosene (including jet fuel of the kerosene type); and (<i>c</i>) fuel oils.&rdquo;  Including biofuels in that section could have reflected a developing area of the industry.  More importantly, there is no reason the Minister cannot put in the exemption regarding excise duty that currently exists.  He could make it wider and more long term, which would be hugely beneficial for the development of the alternative fuels industry.  That would give an excellent opportunity to the Minister to again reaffirm a zero level of excise duty on biofuels, and biofuels would be named specifically in the context thereof.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what the Minister is saying on the inadvisability of placing further levies on biofuels.  Is he satisfied that the Bill makes sufficient reference to biofuels and acknowledges the need to include them in national reserves?  This is the purpose of the Bill.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Department must be aware that there is a proposal for a new private biodiesel facility in Cork Harbour, which is to be in close proximity to the existing oil refinery in Whitegate.  Given that the intent of the Bill is to manage fossil fuel reserves, could it not be amended, even at this late stage, to take account of non-fossil fuel facilities that are likely to be created in the near future and of the need to reserve whatever types of fuel are created therein?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>We are now discovering resources with major potential.  In the past ten years, nine exploration wells were drilled and two proved positive, namely, the Corrib and Dooish fields.  In view of the Langeled pipeline from Norway, is the position on fuel not changing dramatically?  By the industry&rsquo;s own reckoning, there are 10 billion barrels of oil to be discovered and these would be worth &euro;500 billion to &euro;600 billion.  This is an awful lot of money and I therefore ask the Minister to comment on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure whether it would be in order to comment on Deputy Cowley&rsquo;s statement.  I could do so but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is well outside the scope of the amendment before us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in line with what the Minister is saying about exploration potential off our coasts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>We are desperately trying to encourage foreign and native exploration companies to determine whether we have the reserves to which the Deputy referred.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not give them a licence.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="31"/>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the reserves exist and, if so, we will be in a totally different position from the one we are in at present.</P>
        <P>Deputy Durkan should note it makes no sense to add a provision to this Bill so one can exempt another.  The purpose of the Bill is to address the question of oil and petroleum stocks, set up the company to manage them on an ongoing basis and ensure we have the petroleum reserves required to meet our national and international obligations.  The question of moving from excise relief towards having a certain percentage of biofuels in our reserves is not a matter for this Bill but the Government is committed to addressing it, as is evident in our Green Paper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked a specific question on a new development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of at least 50, if not 100, applications for biofuel refineries and for excise relief.  These are being examined by experts and I will receive advice on them.  I will not comment on any individual application as it would not be right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the amendment, I understand what the Minister is saying on the insertion of a reference to biofuels and why it could, in the context of this Bill, be detrimental to their development.  The Minister missed the 2005 biofuels target completely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is that the Minister does not have a further right to reply and the matter the Deputy is raising is not directly related to the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wanted to ask him about our reserves given that we are considering the National Oil Reserves Agency Bill.  What role does the Minister envisage for biofuels?  In this regard, Deputy Boyle referred to a proposal for a development in Cork and we know of another well publicised one in Limerick.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no point in the Deputy continuing if we cannot allow the Minister to reply to him.  We are discussing amendment No. 2&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about biofuels.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="32"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It includes the phrase &ldquo;including oils derived from biofuels&rdquo;.  The Deputy is either for this or against it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am supporting the amendment because the Minister should have included a section on biofuels in the context of our reserves.  On Second Stage, the Minister and I had a lengthy discussion on the period for which reserves should last.  The EU requirement stipulates 90 days and the Minister referred to a period of 108 days.  I contended that it should be at least 120 days.  Biofuels could supplement a reserve that would last for this period.  Given the international requirements, Deputy Durkan is correct to try to introduce this measure into the Bill and I support him in doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I admire the Minister&rsquo;s tenacity in not changing his view.  I have thought about this matter and believe we on this side of the House were not trenchant enough on the last occasion we discussed it.  It is wrong not to mention biofuels.  What is wrong with storing them as part of our reserves?  Why should specific mention not be made of the need to develop and store biofuels, particularly if we are to achieve what is set out in the Green Paper, which I hope will ultimately change colour, and in our proposals of more than a year ago?  The Minister is right that there are approximately 100 applications for the development of various biofuel plants and we should therefore recognise biofuels in the Bill in the context of storage.</P>
        <P>There is no reason compelling the Minister to include excise duty.  The Minister for Finance has already made an exclusion in respect of a certain number of litres of biofuel.  This is in order and can be done at all times.  After all, it is the Minister for Finance who does this in any event at budget time.  I ask the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to think again about the storage provisions so as to encourage the development of biofuels.  Ireland is 90% dependent on imported fuels and the only country in Europe with a huge hill to climb in this regard.  To miss out on an opportunity to include a specific reference to biofuels is deplorable and I ask the Minister to consider what he can do about this.  Including such a reference would improve the Bill considerably and would mean those involved in the production of biofuels would be treated appropriately.  Now is the time to include the reference in the Bill.</P>

        <P FLI="0">These 15 amendments are all related to the same issue, which is to require D&aacute;il approval for changes that may take place from time to time. <Col N="35"/> We discussed this matter last night and on Committee Stage of this Bill a couple of weeks ago.  There is a growing fear that legislation passed in this House hands over responsibility to bodies, groups or agencies for which the Minister is not accountable to the House and in respect of which major changes can take place without the knowledge of the Oireachtas, but simply with the agreement of the Minister.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>I do not distrust the Minister, but it is fundamentally important that when responsibility for day-to-day administration has been handed over to other agencies, the changes that follow should be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  A Minister normally makes an order that is laid before the Houses in the Oireachtas Library.  That is of no consequence at all.  Sometimes it comes before the House as a motion without debate.  This is a sovereign Parliament and it is our duty to be responsible and accountable, while it is the Minister&rsquo;s duty to be accountable to the House.  We cannot do that unless we insert an amendment or series of amendments.</P>
        <P>The Minister made reference in the recent past to recognising the fact that the Oireachtas has a role to play and that it needs to be informed on an ongoing basis.  This protects the Minister because if an issue arises that involves a change, the House will know about it and can debate it if it so desires.  I remember the debate on the telecommunications Bill in 1983.  An undertaking was given to An Post workers that regardless of what happened in the future, all the conditions on salary and pensions pertaining to civil servants would transfer with them to An Post.  However, by statutory instrument, ministerial order or regulation, full responsibility for that particular section was handed over to An Post and the Minister was no longer accountable to the House.</P>
        <P>It must be recognised that we cannot go on like that because it is bad for Parliament, for democracy and for accountability.  It makes us look like fools when we cannot ask a question of the Minister that is directly related to his portfolio without incurring the wrath of the Chair who will tell us that the Minister is not accountable to the House.  We cannot even put down a written question because it will be deemed out of order.</P>
        <P>The time has come when we need to take a stand and ask whether we are serious about parliamentary democracy and accountability.  In the event of a change in authority devolved by the Minister to anybody else, we need to have a means of ensuring the Oireachtas has some knowledge and an opportunity, if it so desires, to agree or to disagree.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a lengthy discussion of these Report Stage amendments, and I made the point they do not all belong together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Correct.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Their being grouped together by the Bills Office or whomever is responsible was incorrect.  A central theme runs through them that all regulators, State agencies and bodies must ultimately be accountable to the people through the Oireachtas.  The Executive must take final responsibility.  Deputy Durkan seeks to change the approach that we have taken in a great deal of legislation in recent years.  We saw it in spectacular form where the Government offloaded what are clearly its key functions to regulators or other agencies.  Then, when difficulties emerge, it can say that they are not its fault but that of the regulator.  For example, it was the regulator who increased gas and electricity prices, and it had nothing to do with the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, or the Government.</P>
        <P>I unfortunately missed the Minister&rsquo;s speech last night, but I made the point in my contribution on escalating energy prices that there is a critical necessity to retain an ultimate role for the people and for us acting on their behalf.  That is Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s interest and what he has tried to achieve in this series of amendments.  As I said to the Minister on Committee Stage, some amendments concern the fundamental, ordinary work of the agency operating as a free-standing body and would hinder day-to-day operations.  That is why I consider it important that I briefly examine each.</P>
        <P>The first refers to the share transfer day.  It makes the point that it should be subject to the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and meets the general thrust of what Deputy Durkan seeks to do.  Amendment No. 17 concerns the objects and functions of the agency, with which amendments Nos. 19 to 25, inclusive, also deal.  Regarding those amendments in particular, I support Deputy Durkan in principle.  He seeks to insert into the fundamental principles and functions of the National Oil Reserves Agency the ultimate requirement that the Minister himself be responsible.  For example, section 8(3) reads as follows.</P>
        <P LI="1">The Agency has power to do anything that appears to it to be requisite, advantageous or incidental to, or appears to it to facilitate (either directly or indirectly) the performance by it of its functions as specified in or under this Act or in its memorandum of association and that is not inconsistent with any enactment for the time being in force, including power&mdash;&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) to acquire, by purchase or otherwise, hold, store, import, export, transport and exchange oil,</P>
        <P FLI="0">Its key functions are outlined there.  Deputy Durkan, in amendment No. 17, seeks to include a requirement that it be referred to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann where there are joint ventures, partnerships or a commercial arrangement with other persons &ldquo;to construct, acquire, maintain and develop in the State&rdquo;.  By seeking to impose that rule, we could be straying into the company&rsquo;s day-to-day operational affairs.</P><Col N="37"/>
<?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P>In amendment No. 19, Deputy Durkan seeks to add the requirement &ldquo;, subject to the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo;.  It is wrong that the amendments were grouped in this way, since it makes it very difficult for us to discuss this properly and discharge our duty as legislators.  Approval would be required &ldquo;to sell, as the Agency thinks fit, oil held by or on behalf of the Agency&rdquo;.  I believe that to be part of the agency&rsquo;s intrinsic work, and perhaps Deputy Durkan might reconsider it, since it is clearly its central business.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 20 concerns property, an area where a requirement of responsibility to Parliament would be advantageous, and Deputy Durkan is right to add it to section 8(3)(<i>i</i>).  We can think, for example, of the difficulties that have arisen regarding the port companies and the sale or otherwise of land.  Deputy Durkan makes the fair point in amendment No. 20 that the agency should perhaps be required to bring major land transfers, purchases and sales before the Minister and the House.  It is &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;, but it could also come before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>That takes us to amendment No. 21, which deals with commercial agreements with a third party or otherwise for the purpose of enabling the agency to perform its functions.  Once again, if that involved extensive changes to those functions, there could be a case for Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s amendment.  Amendment No. 22 seeks to amend a new section dealing with additional functions:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and after consulting with the Agency and any other Minister of the Government who, in the Minister&rsquo;s opinion, is concerned, by order assign to the Agency such additional functions connected with the functions assigned to it by or under this Act as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Again, I feel there is merit in Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s amendment, since we might be discussing the extension of functions.  I have asked the Minister, in a subsequent Labour amendment, to examine the possibility of establishing an exploration agency.  The Minister opened an interesting exploration conference this morning that referred to exciting developments in the oil province.  The Acting Chairman, who hails from County Mayo, alerted me to this, and it was very interesting to hear talk of an exciting oil province, given that the Minister and his predecessor had attended the House for four years and given us the poor mouth, claiming we have no energy resources and that, if we have anything, we will give it all away and let the big boys such as Shell, Statoil and the Americans take whatever we have.</P>
        <P>Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s proposed insertions regarding the powers of the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, throughout the Bill are interesting.  Additional functions might be developed, for example, exploration.  The Minister will admit that our big problem was that the <Col N="38"/>resources available to him when first appointed to the Department were not such as to give him a clear picture of what exactly was happening with hydrocarbon deposits off the Irish coast.  Unfortunately, he did not follow my advice and take the Norwegian route of asking the oil companies to teach us everything that they know and train our people for a few years.  When we knew what they knew, we could issue licences, decide regimes and so on.  I urge the Minister, even before the general election, to frame a new licensing regime.  Amendment No. 22 is very useful, and the Deputy should be commended.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 23 concerns the share capital of the agency and the Minister for Finance.  Again, that might profitably be brought before the Oireachtas.  Amendment No. 24 deals with the issue of shares, and since that relates to the initiation of the company, it may not be as significant.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 25 in the name of Deputy Durkan concerns memoranda and articles of association and seeks to insert &ldquo;and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo;.  Memoranda and articles are so fundamental, as everyone in the House who has been a director will know, that the area should be returned to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I am not sure if Deputy Durkan will call a vote on every amendment, but in this case too the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann could be very useful.</P>
        <P>Many amendments have been grouped together, and since they refer to different things, we might more profitably have discussed them separately.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 28 relates to the board of directors.  Section 14(2) states: &ldquo;The directors (other than the chief executive) shall be appointed by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  The amendment is interesting because in it Deputy Durkan is seeking to return approval for the appointment of directors to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  As I indicated to the Minister, I am of the view that we should follow the example of the Scottish Executive in respect of directors.  The Scottish First Minister, Mr. Jack McConnell, has established an independent board to oversee the appointment of directors.  Members of the public in Scotland who possess the requisite experience, enthusiasm and energy and who want to become directors of state bodies can put themselves forward.  There is not, therefore, an in-crowd comprising people who tend to become directors of everything and another group of individuals who are not considered.  I would prefer if we proceeded along those lines and transferred the appointment of directors into an independent sphere so that it would not be a case of Buggin&rsquo;s turn or jobs for the boys coming into play, or of party hacks being appointed as directors.  However, I understand the spirit of Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 34 relates to the allowances and expenses of members of the board of directors, a matter Deputy Durkan wishes to be <Col N="39"/>brought to the attention of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Minister will recall that a major debate took place when the Minister doubled or trebled the salary of the chairperson of An Post for a number of days&rsquo; work per week.  That matter was not brought to the attention of the House until a parliamentary question was tabled in respect of it.  I again understand the spirit of Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 39 refers to the strategy statement and the period specified by the Minister.  Section 15 states that the strategy statement shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  That is currently the case but it is then the responsibility of Members to inquire about it on the Order of Business.  We are fed up asking questions in that regard.  Yesterday, Deputy Gilmore asked that an important report be laid before the House and, even though the Deputy was clearly within his rights, the Ceann Comhairle tried not to accede to his request.  There is merit in amendment No. 39 because it would ensure that a discussion would take place in respect of the strategy statement.  We are engaged in historic work dealing with this Bill and, consequently, this is one of the most important days in the history of exploration and the management of energy resources in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 44 relates to the power to establish subsidiaries.  I am not sure about this in the context of the operations of State agencies or bodies.  The chief executive and the board of directors of the new agency should be given maximum flexibility in respect of its operation.  In such circumstances, I am obliged to diverge from Deputy Durkan because I do not know whether it is necessary to put that matter before the House.  If we were to operate in this way in respect of the 500 or so State agencies, we would get little other work done.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 45 is similar and relates to the memorandums and articles of association of each subsidiary.  Again, I am of the view that it might be useful to leave the management of the new agency with a free hand to carry out work in this regard on its own.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 48 relates to the directors of subsidiaries and the fact that they may be appointed and removed.  I again diverge from Deputy Durkan in this regard.  I do not agree with this amendment because I would like the chief executive and the board to have operational freedom.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 51 relates to the terms of the chief executive&rsquo;s contract.  Section 19 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">(3) The chief executive holds office for such period and subject to terms and conditions (including terms and conditions relating to remuneration and allowances for expenses) that the directors appointed under section 14(2) may, with the approval of the Minister <Col N="40"/>given with the consent of the Minister for Finance, determine.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am inclined to opt for the board, in operational terms, having rights in this regard.  On each occasion Deputy Durkan saw reference in the Bill to the Ministers for Finance and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, a red light began to flash&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>An alarm sounded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and he chose to include in his amendments the phrase &ldquo;with the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo;.  I applaud him for that and I welcome the spirit in which it was done.  However, I would not like to interfere in the operational freedom of the agency, which we want to be successful and to be in a position to carry out its work on behalf of Ireland and its people.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 53 relates to the functions of the chief executive.  Section 20(7) states: &ldquo;The chief executive shall not hold any other office or position or carry on any business, trade or profession without the consent of the directors.&rdquo;  That provision is clear and I do not see any reason to change it.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 54 to 59, inclusive, relate to the staff and superannuation.  On Committee Stage, I indicated that I would broadly prefer a report to be laid before the Oireachtas but that each action should not require the separate approval of the Houses.  In respect of superannuation, Deputy Durkan may state that difficulties arose in respect of the An Post pensioners.  These individuals were originally civil servants and then became employees of a State agency.  They were informed that, effectively, they had lost their fundamental rights.</P>
        <P>I received an upsetting communication last week from a person who formerly worked with the Dublin Port Company.  The individual in question worked for the port for 45 or 50 years and served Dublin and Ireland very well, but discovered that the normal indexation relating to a State servant&rsquo;s pension is being abandoned in his case.  The man is not receiving any pension increases and he feels bad about it.  He is of the view that this issue, which falls under the remit of the Department of Transport, should be addressed.  Where the operational freedom of the company would be affected, I would prefer if matters were not brought before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>Amendments No. 64 relates to temporary borrowings.  As the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is aware, issues can arise.  His predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, became upset with the ESB when its representatives went to New York to make arrangements for financing and apparently did not inform him of the fact.  Nothing of that sort could happen under the provisions of section 27.  In my view, the matter with which amendment No. 64 deals is covered in the Bill.</P><Col N="41"/>
        <P>I reiterate that it is confusing to be obliged to deal with approximately 25 amendments that relate to different aspects of the new agency&rsquo;s operations.  Unfortunately, the relevant authorities have pulled a stroke in grouping these amendments together and thereby preventing us from engaging in an adequate discussion on each one.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 68 in my name relates to section 31, which deals with the provision information to the Oireachtas on the performance of its functions by the new agency.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">(1) Whenever required to do so by the Committee of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann established under the Standing Orders of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to examine and report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the appropriation accounts and reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the chief executive shall give evidence to that Committee on all matters pertaining to the expenditure of the Agency and any of its subsidiaries.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I wanted to add there that the agency must provide for the Committee of Public Accounts an annual account of the levy and all its revenue raising activities.  I stated on Committee Stage that I am not sure whether the roundabout reference there to the Committee of Public Accounts is necessary because that committee, of which three of us here were former members, is a constitutional committee.  That 12-member committee is specified in the Constitution and it has a constitutional remit.  It would be reasonable that all aspects of the levy which will fund NORA must also be invigilated by the Committee of Public Accounts with the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P>While the 0.4% levy is relatively small, it is still an important revenue raising device of Government and the fundamental revenue raising system of this company.  It would be fair to add this third section and clarify that all aspects of the levy will be open to scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Minister and the Minister for Finance have roles in the development of this, but it is important that it be specified in the legislation.</P>
        <P>Reviewing all those amendments, first and foremost I am sympathetic towards the general principle that Deputy Durkan outlined.  It is important and valid.  Everybody in this House is deeply frustrated about the regulators, and how we will ensure that they are properly responsible will be a topic of discussion coming up to the general election and is in the interests of the Government and any future Government.</P>
        <P>For example, the other day the Minister issued a statement on his Department&rsquo;s website that the sea-fisheries protection agency will be established in January in Clonakilty.  He seemed to refer to it, rightly so given the legislation, as being the regulator and I presume it will have a significant role in all assessment of fish stocks and negotiations about fishing and, in particular, in evaluating how those stocks are exploited and sus<Col N="42"/>tained.  It may well be the case in the future that the Minister, in accordance with the legislation, will have little influence.  There has been much discussion about whether there should be a super regulator to look after the regulators.  Of course the super regulator should be us.  That is our function and we are correct to retain that function.</P>
        <P>I support the spirit of Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s amendments, which would clearly establish the role of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as the ultimate guardian of the people&rsquo;s rights in the management and development of this company.  Where these amendments go into the day-to-day operational matters, as I stated on Committee Stage, I would be inclined to let the statutorily established NORA carry out its functions, as all the great semi-State bodies have done, and have reasonable freedom.  I would not support them in that case.  I strongly recommend the Labour amendment on the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 35 amendments grouped together.  Deputy Durkan went to the trouble of tabling most of them and it is correct that we should debate them all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept any of these amendments.  As Deputy Broughan stated, I can understand the spirit in which the amendments were tabled.  If, as he also pointed out, we were to accept any or all of these amendments, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s time would be spent trying to make commercial decisions for NORA.  I do not know why we would single out NORA as the only agency where this should occur but if we go down this route of corporate governance, the logic would be that we should do the same for An Post, the ESB, RTE etc.  If we go down that route, we will end up spending most of our time here, with no significant expertise in the day-to-day running of such organisations, trying to make commercial decisions for them.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 3 relates to the D&aacute;il deciding on the NORA share transfer day.  The D&aacute;il is deciding in the Bill that there will be a company and a share transfer.  The D&aacute;il need not then be the body that decides when that will occur and it is better to leave it to the company to decide to finalise a proper share transfer day.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 17 and 19 to 21, inclusive, relate to commercial decisions for the company.  It would be ridiculous, either in this Chamber or in committee, to oblige a company to come and be second-guessed by people like ourselves who would not necessarily know, and should not be expected to know, the details of NORA&rsquo;s commercial contracts, joint ventures, approving the sale of oil or property, or commercial agreements.  The company employs a chief executive and will have a board, and legal, financial and other advisers, for all these matters.  If we were to decide to take over and start making decisions on those matters, apart altogether from our lack of expertise, can the Deputies imagine the amount of time that would be involved?  I am sure every <Col N="43"/>Member of this House would be capable of reading all the legal, accountancy and other advice and eventually making a decision on it, but it does not make much sense that we would go down that route.</P>
        <P>There would be a validity in general terms to amendment No. 22, which would ensure that the D&aacute;il would approve the assignment of any additional functions to NORA, if the legislation allowed the company to take on functions other than the core function of stockholding, but this is circumscribed in the legislation.  The legislation makes it clear that the sole function of NORA is stockholding.  In this case the assignment of additional functions to NORA is prescribed in the Bill and can only relate to stockholding.  There is no need for such D&aacute;il approval.  NORA cannot go down the route of oil exploration, as perhaps Deputy Broughan suggested.  If we decide to go down that route at some stage, that will be a matter for separate legislation.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 24 and 25 relate to commercial matters also.  These are internal matters for NORA, not ones with which we should become involved.  As Deputy Broughan appeared to agree, it would be unnecessary interference in the day-to-day running of a semi-State company which we are establishing.</P>
        <P>Previously, we discussed amendment No. 28 which relates to approving board appointments.  There is nothing to stop anybody in this country submitting a CV to any Minister and stating that he or she is interested in membership of a board or boards.  It happens, although not too often.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister advertise them?</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I do not advertise them because the existing companies and boards are listed in various publications.  If they have such interest, there is absolutely nothing to prevent them from writing to the Minister to ask to be considered for membership of a board.  I have done that once or twice &mdash; no more than that &mdash; in my ten or 12 years in the House on the basis of a curriculum vitae I received.  I often take formal and informal recommendations from civil servants who know people and from both Opposition and Government Members.  If somebody wants to be considered for appointment to a board, there is nothing to stop him or her.  I do not believe in setting up a bureaucracy for such appointments.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I do not make an apology, nor would any other Member, for a Minister with responsibility for a particular agency seeking to make sure people appointed to its board know what he or she wants and requires from the company and its board and appointing somebody on that basis.  There is nothing wrong with it.  The notion of independence in appointments to State boards is a nonsense.  A <Col N="44"/>Minister must appoint a board to act on his behalf as shareholder.  If I appoint a board that does not necessarily subscribe to a Government view of where the company should go, it will only cause difficulties, as happened in the past.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 34, 39, 44, 45, 48, 51, 53 to 59, inclusive, and 64 refer to day-to-day operational matters, which need to be looked after by the agency, not the Oireachtas.  The issues raised are addressed in the Bill.  For example, amendment No. 58 deals with superannuation schemes.  The Bill provides that approved schemes be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and we have our own procedures after that to deal with them, which is correct.  It is not up to the D&aacute;il to approve such a scheme or to approve a pension for an employee to which he or she is entitled, which is suggested by amendment No. 59.</P><Col N="45"/>
        <P>The Houses should not get involved in temporary borrowings because that is an internal matter for the company.  Deputy Broughan tabled amendment No. 68, which is valid.  Its intent is to make sure the collection and expenditure of the levy and revenue generating activities of NORA are reportable to, and investigable by, the Committee of Public Accounts but that is covered by the legislation.  It provides that NORA must prepare annual accounts, which should include details of revenue earned and expenditure.  The format of the accounts must be in accordance with company law and the Minister has a right to make additional requirements.  All this is subject to scrutiny by the PAC and the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>The Deputies are correct that a number of the amendments do not make sense from a commercial point of view and, perhaps, they could have been grouped together.  Others do not make sense from the point of view of the internal workings of the agency, as  Deputy Broughan stated.  The remainder are covered by the Bill and I do not propose to accept any amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason the amendments were tabled is because a number of us served on the PAC for a long time and there were countless instances where various directions were given and powers devolved by Ministers to State board appointees, which the House approved, and the people proceeded, correctly, in their own way.  However, not all decisions were proofed to the extent they should have been and the PAC was only able to examine the accounts after the event.  Given the development of modern technology on a daily basis and the lessons learned from those experiences, the time has come to insert a provision in legislation to ensure the Houses of the Oireachtas are also informed about such decisions.</P>
        <P>The approval of the Minister is required and I can well understand why Ministers who have served in Government for a long time feel that is sufficient.  There is a tendency, as Ministers are driven everywhere in State cars and do not know what it is like to drive themselves, to become detached from reality and, as a result, to hand over control lock, stock and barrel to an agency.</P>
        <P>The Minister asked why such a provision should apply to NORA.  Why not NORA?  This agency should be accountable, given that there could be a serious reliance on it in the event of fuel crisis in the future.  Why not interpose here and now?  The Minister also asked why the Houses of the Oireachtas should give approval if Members do not have the expertise in this area.  Perhaps we have not but the Minister also has no such expertise nor has the Minister for Finance.  We cannot keep up to speed with the machinations of the commercial world all the time.  The <Col N="46"/>Minister conceded that in one case, a referral to the Houses would be necessary.</P>
        <P>I am speaking about the principle.  Deputy Broughan is correct in that I tabled this raft of amendments because the approval of the Ministers for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Finance were sought, but the approval of the Houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>That is the reason for the amendments, namely, poachers turn into gamekeepers and <i>vice versa</i>.  In my time as a Deputy, there have been countless instances of changes or appointments where it would have been useful to include some reference to the D&aacute;il or to allow the D&aacute;il the discretion to opt in or opt out of the approval process.</P>
        <P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s statement on board appointments.  I do not expect the Houses to always decide the composition of the board because the Minister needs a board to carry out the agency&rsquo;s day-to-day work, but what is to stop people from elevating themselves to positions where they would experience conflicts of interest, for example, of which the Minister might not know?  There have been countless instances of Ministers needing to inquire in the House about someone&rsquo;s bona fides and being answered by one of his or her colleagues.</P><Col N="47"/>
        <P>The thrust of our amendments is to recognise the Oireachtas for what it is, namely, the Houses of Parliament to which Ministers are accountable.  While the Ministers for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Finance may approve matters, as is the case in respect of most of these amendments, they also represent the Government and their activities can only be examined by the Committee of Public Accounts after the event.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Given current developments whereby more power is devolved to agencies outside the House and in respect of which Ministers do not want to or have no willingness or liability to report to the Houses, this bad situation must be changed.  It is bad for democracy and the Parliament and it is dangerous for Ministers and the administration of State and semi-State bodies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Upon examining this tranche of amendments, I agree with the Minister that it is important not to intrude on the independent workings of the company and to allow it to carry out its functions.  It would be unfair to invigilate more in respect of NORA than other companies and would make life unworkable.</P>
        <P>The spirit of Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s amendments is important because he is seeking to have the House take ultimate accountability.  In some ways, the spirit is best expressed in amendment No. 39, which relates to the strategy statement and what NORA will do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It relates to policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement.  If we were to examine the matter of exploration more seriously, we would search for a vehicle other than NORA, but the only option open to the Opposition benches is to try to develop that idea through this Bill.</P>
        <P>Regarding the company&rsquo;s strategy statement, there was an example yesterday of a report lying in the Oireachtas Library for 21 days and we were not sure that it was there.  Another spectacular example involved statutory instruments devolving a chunk of the Minister&rsquo;s Department, including a part that was not meant to be taken.  The House had not sanctioned the Minister&rsquo;s transferral of small harbours to the Department of Transport.</P>
        <P>That situation owed to our tortuous problems with the structure of the Department from day one, namely, it is two and a half Departments in a bag and everything is trying to get out to do important national jobs.  Other Departments administer a single company or State body, such as the Department of Defence.  For example, many people have no earthly clue about what the <Col N="48"/>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, does in his so-called Craggy Island Department.</P>

	<P>He does nothing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>What that Department does is a mystery to everyone in the House and the media.</P>
        <P>There will be a restructuring of the Government.  While communications, broadcasting and so on would comprise a massive Department, energy, the subject of today&rsquo;s business must also comprise a large Department.  Marine matters should be pulled together in a separate Department because they relate to a more significant territory than other areas administered by Departments.</P>
        <P>We miss a great deal because measures are not brought before the House for approval.  Instead of wasting whatever time is not spent on legislation, we should spend it on invigilating strategy statements.  Will the Minister accept amendment No. 39, which best expresses this wish?</P>
        <P>I will not withdraw amendment No. 68.  When we were members of the Committee of Public Accounts, we invigilated expenditure.  This matter relates to revenue and is an interesting aspect of revenue-raising and taxation.  Deputy Durkan and I spent four or five years examining accounts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;<?oasys _is0p2- ?>&ldquo;Standards in Public Office Commission&ldquo; means the commission established by section 21 of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 (as amended by the Standards in Public Office Act 2001);&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Having examined the Bill, the amendment is relevant and useful.  I mean no disrespect to people on the boards of bodies or agencies.  It never does any harm to apply the same principles as apply to public representatives.  As time goes by, more and more responsibility is handed over to agencies and other bodies, or quangos, as the late former Minister, Brian Lenihan, used to call them.  I do <Col N="49"/>not think he was being complimentary in using that word and he had a deep-rooted suspicion of all such bodies.  Being the parliamentarian he was, he felt it was never any harm to rigorously apply the same rules to us humble public representatives.  We have our faults and do not always achieve the highest standards we would like, but that is the way things are.  That is life and it is a true reflection of humanity.</P>
        <P>It would do no harm to interpose the amendment as suggested.  The Minister is not in an accommodating mood.  It must be because of the football match last week &mdash; was it Australian rules football?  The Minister should not be negative as we do not seek to trap him.  In fact, he might one day find himself on this side of the House feeling lucky that he accepted certain amendments.</P>
        <P>I propose the amendment and await the Minister and other Members&rsquo; responses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sympathetic to the spirit of Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s amendment relating to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  Given the high standards imposed on parliamentarians relating to personal financial probity, it is reasonable that similar standards apply across the State sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputies are mixing up two separate matters by grouping amendments Nos. 4 and 65 together.  Amendment No. 4 is not consistent with the standard corporate governance requirements imposed on similar bodies.  If accepted, it would result in the form of the NORA annual accounts requiring to be approved by the Standards in Public Office Commission, which would not be welcomed by that body, apart from the fact that NORA would then be treated differently from every other semi-State company.  </P>
        <P>If the intent of the amendment was for the people involved in NORA to meet the same ethical standards as other people in public office, then that is catered for elsewhere in the Bill.  I assure the Deputies that various public service ethical requirements have to be met in this case.  The amendment relates specifically to the accounts but the Bill contains comprehensive controls over the form of the accounts, as is the case with all semi-State companies.  Provisions in the Bill require that the form of NORA&rsquo;s annual accounts meet the requirements of the Companies Acts.  In addition, they have to be approved by the Minister and the Minister for Finance and be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Committee of Public Accounts also has a role.</P>
        <P>We are all at one in the belief that the highest possible standards must apply and that people involved in NORA must comply with the same ethical obligations as everybody else in the public <Col N="50"/>service, but that is catered for and this amendment would not in any way assist it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That may be the case.  I do not intend to detain the House all day on the subject but the amendment was prompted by experiences we have had with bodies or agencies to whom responsibilities have been devolved by the House.  For example, after a person serves on a board such as NORA, he or she could make available vital and sensitive information to other bodies, groups or agencies.  I will not mention specific cases but we all know about people who held public jobs and moved into the private sector, having in their possession information which could be useful in the pursuit of their careers.  </P>
        <P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s statement that adequate provisions are made elsewhere, albeit using different words, and I do not suggest anything untoward will happen.  However, where a person operates in a particular capacity and moves on somewhere else armed with certain information, the standard provisions should apply as to how he or she is permitted to use that information.  As the Minister knows, there has been more than one case in the public arena where people with useful information have been able to use it, not necessarily in the public interest.  I merely suggest it to be helpful to the Minister and his administration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I repeat that I am broadly sympathetic with the point of view articulated by Deputy Durkan.  Is the Minister saying this point is sufficiently covered by section 14(10) of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 as it relates to the director appointed?  That is the thrust of what Deputy Durkan is seeking to achieve.  As he stated, there have been isolated cases where people have been alleged to have made information known outside a company.  It is important the highest standards of probity apply and there is merit in the amendment seeking to ensure they do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am saying this is covered by section 14.  It is also covered in section 24, which deals with cases, which both Deputies cited, relating to unauthorised disclosure of information by directors or a CEO.  I do not disagree with the point generally but it is not a debate for this Bill specifically.  Rather, it should be the subject of a wider debate on people who are in specified positions for a certain length of time, including Ministers, senior civil servants and local authority officials.  There should be a lapse in time before such people can work in a private sector position where their duties are related to their former public duties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s admission that there is a need for a wider debate.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>  the amount his Department received in motor tax receipts in the years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and the estimated total to date in 2006; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[36887/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Motor tax receipts for the years in question are as follows: 2002, &euro;581 million; 2003, &euro;681 million; 2004, &euro;747 million; 2005, &euro;802 million; and 2006, &euro;764 million to the end of October.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a significant amount of money collected by the Department.  However, the Department has informed the Minister that one in ten people evades paying this tax.  In 2005 the estimated amount uncollected, which should have been used for rural roads, was &euro;40 million.  It is at least the same amount this year.  The Minister has failed in his duty to bring in a proper strategy to collect the tax and those paying are subsidising those who are not.  The Minister knows this but has done nothing about it.</P>
        <P>In England it is estimated that 80% of untaxed motor cars are also uninsured.  There is, therefore, a serious issue with regard to lack of enforcement of the law by the Minister and his lack of commitment towards changing the situation.  What new schemes has he prepared or what action does he intend to take?  Garda prosecutions were down last year when there were 4,000 fewer drivers prosecuted for evading tax than the previous year.  Neither the Minister nor the Government are doing their job in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I could retort that the Deputy is not doing his job as leading Opposition spokesman in this area very well.  Assertions made across the House are not the same as facts.</P>
        <P>The facts of the situation are that motor tax compliance surveys are undertaken on a periodic basis.  The Deputy is misreading a freedom of information request reply received by him some time ago.  The most recent survey, carried out in 2001, indicated an evasion level of 4.6%.  The Deputy&rsquo;s assertion that one in ten motorists is <Col N="52"/>guilty of evasion is not correct.  We had an Adjournment debate on this issue on 26 October at which the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not turn up for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;suggested one in ten motorists were guilty of tax evasion.  The figure quoted refers to the percentage of vehicle owners, based on returns to my Department, who did not respond to reminder notices.  Non response to a reminder notice is not the same as not taxing one&rsquo;s car.  Various issues are involved.  Reminder notices are issued to vehicle owners who fail to renew their tax when initially due.  Many of these people will have sold or scrapped their vehicles, many will have paid by the time they receive the reminder and many cars may be temporarily not in use.  The suggestion there is an overall rate of 10% persistent tax evasion is nonsense and has no basis in fact or in any of the analyses carried out over a number of years.</P>
        <P>I take this matter seriously.  The Deputy has made this particular assertion on several occasions but, sadly, repetition of an error on his part does not make the error any closer to the truth.  The assertion is wrong.  The figures we have are of the order of 4.6%.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked what has been done since the 2001 survey was carried out.  The national vehicle driver file computer system, NVDF, arrangements were introduced in 2002.  This system has made the collection of motor tax more cost effective and efficient.  Also, in conjunction with local motor tax offices, follow up action has taken place with regard to under declarations of weight.  This was an issue the Deputy rightly highlighted.  The NVDF analysis indicates that an additional &euro;1 million has been raised through that.  A measure was also introduced to facilitate earlier taxing following change in ownership and this has been working effectively.  There are also arrangements to issue motor tax renewal reminder notices earlier to facilitate earlier taxing because if people get notices late they may pass the due date before paying and be in arrears.</P>
        <P>We have also taken action with regard to non use.  The incidence of non use was quite high where, for example, people said they did not use the car for three months.  This issue could well result in an amendment to motor tax legislation being introduced to require continuous registration.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also doing some testing on camera equipment to automatically read number plates.</P>
        <P>There is not 10% non-compliance.  If that was the case, it would be a serious matter.  The figure the Deputy has is incorrect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure is from the Minister&rsquo;s office.  It comes from his note to the Taoiseach this time last year.  He informed the Taoiseach <Col N="53"/>that one in ten drivers evaded their car tax and that this amounted to &euro;40 million uncollected.  He went on to say car tax would not increase and the reason for that was that he was going to change the system.  However, he has not changed it.  The reality is that garda&iacute; are apprehending fewer people despite the fact the number of drivers has risen to over 2.13 million.  Garda&iacute; have caught fewer evaders than they did the year before last.</P>
        <P>One of the most important and salient points illustrating the Minister is failing in his duty of care is that one of the reasons a significant number of people do not tax their cars is that they have not passed the NCT test.  In other words their cars are not fit and should not be on the road.  The reality is that these dangerous vehicles are not lying in some garage but are driven around untaxed by people who are uninsured.  The Minister&rsquo;s lack of application in this regard is disgraceful.</P>
        <P>The money the Minister is not collecting could be spent by local government and used to put our regional and country roads in good order.  The Minister&rsquo;s report said it would cost &euro;50 million per year to bring these roads to the proper standards.  He only provided &euro;31 million for that last year.  Therefore, he is not doing his job.  The area is an absolute shambles.</P>

        <Quest>  his views on the recent reports that Ireland will overshoot its Kyoto target by approximately<?oasys _jy ?><Col N="54"/>16%; his plans to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions; when he will publish the revised climate change strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[36888/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>References in a recent EEA report to a potential shortfall of 16% on the Kyoto target failed to take account of a number of key measures in Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for complying with the Kyoto Protocol.  This arises from the methodology the EEA applied.  It did not take into account the EU emissions trading scheme, which was praised in the recent Stern report and which will account for 3 million tonnes, sequestration of carbon from forests nor any purchases of appropriate credits through international trading mechanisms.</P>
        <P>On the basis of these policies and measures already agreed, Ireland is now positioned to reduce carbon emissions by 14.6 million tonnes, bringing us within 0.6 million tonnes of our Kyoto target for the 2008-12 period.  Further measures to close the remaining gap of 0.6 million tonnes will be decided in the coming months.</P>
        <P>In total, reductions of 15.2 million tonnes per annum, on average, will be achieved over the indicative period through existing measures throughout the economy, which will achieve a reduction of 8 million tonnes per annum, and a further series of measures which will bridge that  0.6 million tonnes gap; participation by Irish companies in the EU emissions trading scheme, which will contribute 3 million tonnes, and the purchase of up to 3.6 million carbon allowances in each of the years for the indicative period.</P>
        <P>Based on the recent review and a public consultation which followed its publication, I am preparing a revised climate change strategy.  This will also be informed, <i>inter alia</i>, by the range of new measures identified in the Green Paper on Energy published last month, which were not involved in the EEA calculations.  These include the greener homes renewable energy grants for households and the commercial bio-heat scheme which together will deliver an approximate 200,000 tonne reduction in emissions; new ambitious targets for renewable energy use of 15% by 2010 and 30% by 2020 and, therefore, a tonnage saving; more than doubling the use of biofuels by 2010 from 2% to 5.75%, which again will have a carbon saving; the establishment of a task force on bio-energy to develop an integrated national policy in this area; an action plan on energy efficiency to reduce energy consumption 20% by 2020, but again that is not in the EEA calculation; and other grants, for example, for combined heat and power.</P>
    
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>Increasing the use of combined heat and power to 350 MW by 2010 with grants for 30% of the <Col N="55"/>installation costs; and a commitment to co-firing peat-fired power stations with 30% biomass by 2015.</P>
        <P>The additional reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that will be achieved through these measures will be sufficient for Ireland to reach our Kyoto Protocol target based on current projections.</P>
  </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister think anybody but himself is right on matters relating to the environment?  All the Opposition spokespersons are wrong and now the European Environment Agency is wrong.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Not really.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Frankly, he lectures everybody, and everybody else is wrong but himself.  I want to ask about the areas for which he is responsible and they are not that complicated.  The Minister promised that he would publish a revised climate change strategy by the end of 2006.  When will the revised climate change strategy be published?  Will he tell the House the total tonnage of greenhouse gas emissions at the time the current climate change strategy was published and what it is now, in other words, leaving aside the issue of emissions trading?  By how much, if anything, have greenhouse gas emissions in the State been reduced since publication of the climate change strategy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Lest I be accused of lecturing, I was pointing out that the EEA has a calculation methodology which does not take into account the 3 millions tonnes which I mentioned under the EU emissions trading scheme.  It is quite legitimate to point out that is the case because that is part of the 11 million tonnes saving that has already been identified.  It does not take into account the 3.6 million tonnes, the second figure I mentioned, which was identified as far back as 2004 for purchase under the scheme, which again was recognised by Stern.</P>

        <Quest>  the number of submissions received in response to the recent public consultation on climate change policy; if they will be published on his Department&rsquo;s website, as was the stated intention; the number of submissions that called for a law to make annual yearly reductions in emissions mandatory; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[36913/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has put in place a range of measures which, collectively, will deliver an average 14.6 million tonne reduction in greenhouse gas emissions during the period 2008 to 2012, over which our compliance with the Kyoto Protocol will be assessed.  That is the point I was making to Deputy Gilmore but he was not listening.  Measures which will give a total of 8 million tonnes include strengthening energy <Col N="58"/>requirements in the building regulations, accounting for 300,000 tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> per year; changes in transport, which I have mentioned; excise relief in last year&rsquo;s budget will produce a saving of 250,000 tonnes; the Common Agricultural Policy will take 2.4 million tonnes; and the Government&rsquo;s forestry programme will contribute to the removal of 2 million tonnes.  Participation in the EU trading scheme will contribute a further 3 million which will take us up to the 11 million tonnes figure.  The balance of 3.6 million tonnes which is recognised in the Irish 14.6 million tonnes suppression target is from the purchase of credits and it may not be necessary to do that.</P>
        <P>A review of the national climate change strategy has taken place to assess progress and to identify additional measures. I recently launched a report on the review, entitled Ireland&rsquo;s Pathway to Kyoto Compliance to provide a basis for the public consultation.</P>
        <P>Specifically on the consultation a total of 322 submissions were received by my Department to date.  As analysis of these submissions is still being completed, it would not yet be appropriate to comment on them individually until that is complete.  The submissions will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website in due course.  The responses to this open consultation will inform the preparation of a revised national climate change strategy, which I intend to publish before the end of the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know what was in the water in Citywest last weekend but I think it went to the Minister&rsquo;s head given his commentary about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Fluoride.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It was possibly the fluoride on which we are also awaiting action.  It is rather like the climate change strategy, we might be waiting for a while.  Will the Minister clarify the specific number of submissions received?  He said he received 322 submissions.  I know of one NGO which stated that the number submitted through it to the Minister was towards 500.  Will he clarify the number of paper submissions and the number of electronic submissions he has received on this issue?  He stated that they will be published.  When will they be published?  Has the Minister any intention to make annual yearly reductions in emissions mandatory?  Future generations will judge him by the action he took on climate change.  The compelling evidence is that the actions of the Government and of the Minister&rsquo;s Department have been increasing climate change emissions rather than reducing them.  We cannot continue to build motorways as if the oil will last forever.  We cannot continue with building regulations which make us look appalling in comparison to other European countries and a dedication to urban sprawl, led by the Minister, which is increasing long distance commuting times by car. <Col N="59"/> What action is the Minister taking and will he be able to tell future generations he did the right thing on climate change?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to Deputy Cuffe&rsquo;s question on whether there were multiple responses, one NGO had people send the same response several hundred times.  That counts as one response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Minister say 700 submissions count as one response?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The same submission was sent several hundred times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The submissions were sent by different individuals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>A submission with the same wording was sent by different individuals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That implies several hundred different submissions were sent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s statement is somewhat foolhardy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is being economical with the truth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>If the same circular letter is sent 500 times &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>In any other forum, they would be seen as multiple submissions but the Minister has a way with the truth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s second question, I think we will reach our target.  We have already identified 14.6 million tonnes of savings out of a target of almost 15.3 million tonnes, as well as a series of measures which were not calculated as part of the 14.6 million tonnes but will take us beyond the target.  The bioheat programme could allow for reductions of 160,000 tonnes, a figure which did not form part of the earlier calculation.  A further reduction of 300,000 tonnes could be made through the increased use of renewables in electricity production.  As I mentioned earlier, we aim to more than double the proportion of renewable resources used, an increase which Deputy Cuffe correctly supported on the basis that it is the best option and because it saves tonnage.  An additional reduction of 20,000 tonnes which will be made from the green homes scheme was not included in the 14.6 million or mentioned in the EEA report.  An extraordinary 250,000 tonnes will be cut through the conversion of anaerobically digested waste into energy.  A range of other measures mentioned in the Green Paper which have not yet been calcu<Col N="60"/>lated will bring us beyond the target of 15.2 million tonnes.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore wrongly suggested, in his charming way, that Ireland stands alone on this issue.  The Irish economy has grown by 150%, whereas greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 23%.  It would be much nicer if the increase in emissions was only 13% but we are working towards that figure.  Seven of the EU 15 have wider gaps to bridge than Ireland.  Austria&rsquo;s gap stands at 29%, Denmark at 19%, Finland at<?oasys _jy ?>14%, Italy at 19%, Luxembourg at 28%, Portugal at 14% and Spain at 33%.  We will meet our responsibilities on emissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is using the same logic as a prisoner in the dock pointing out other individuals in the court who have committed worse crimes.  He is putting an emphasis on buying our way out of the Kyoto agreement.  Will he confirm, however, that he agrees buying our way out is not the best way of addressing the problem?</P>
        <P>What percentage of submissions argued for the establishment of mandatory annual targets for emissions?  I ask the Minister to determine the number of individuals who made such an argument, rather than referring collectively to several hundred different submissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have that information to hand but I will revert to the Deputy with it.  The submissions will be published in due course.  I do not agree with the hypothesis that Ireland, uniquely, should establish a legal mandatory limit.</P>
        <P>Of course it would be better if we did not have to buy carbon credits but, whether a tonne of carbon is produced in Dublin or New Delhi, the same problem arises for the atmosphere.  The mechanism we are establishing for carbon trading is specifically mentioned in the Stern report as being one of the solutions to the problem.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2005, for the 11th successive year, a record output of some 81,000 new homes was achieved and this figure is set to further increase this year.  Data on house loans issued in 2005 indicate that 45% of new loans were taken by first-time buyers.  A significant number of mortgages for those new homes were manageable or affordable.</P><Col N="61"/>
        <P>The Government has sought to supplement the market through a range of different responses directed at those who cannot meet their own housing needs.  In this regard, affordable housing measures are aimed at facilitating the purchase of homes by individuals at less than market value.  During the first six months of this year, more than 1,100 affordable houses have been provided through various affordable housing schemes.  These houses are additional to the 7,300 affordable homes which were supplied over the previous three years.</P>
        <P>Income limits, maximum loan amounts and subsidy levels have also been substantially increased.  The income eligibility limits for shared ownership, affordable housing and local authority house purchase loans now stand at &euro;100,000 for a dual income household and &euro;40,000 for a single income household.  My Department is currently examining the various affordable housing schemes in order to simplify and streamline arrangements.  Last year, the Government established the affordable homes partnership to co-ordinate and add impetus to the delivery of affordable housing in the greater Dublin area, where affordability pressures are greatest.  The partnership has made considerable progress, particularly in terms of advancing land exchange projects.  The conclusion of three such exchanges has allowed for the early delivery of some 500 affordable homes.  Other measures being undertaken include the development of additional affordable housing on private lands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for providing me with information I did not seek.  I question his claim that 11,000 affordable houses were provided in the first six months of this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure I gave was 1,100 houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I would also challenge a claim of 1,100 houses because, according to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government&rsquo;s housing statistics bulletin, a mere 616 of the 43,899 new units completed in the first six months of 2006 comprised social or affordable housing.  While I am aware that some of the new units were one-off houses or in developments of fewer than four units, affordable houses formed less than 1.5% of the total number of house completions, rather than 20%.  Can the Minister of State indicate how many of the units completed in the first six months of this year were in developments of four or more houses, so that we can establish the number of affordable and social housing being lost due to changes in the Government&rsquo;s policy wrought by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002?  We have already debated this issue in the context of a Private Members&rsquo; Bill which was opposed by <Col N="62"/>the Minister of State, and it is clear that the policy is not working.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McCormack specifically asked about affordable houses, of which some 1,100 have been provided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Were they provided in the first six months of this year?</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, there are four different schemes, namely the shared ownership scheme, the 1999 affordable housing scheme, the Part V scheme and the affordable housing initiative. </P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>That was not my question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is.  The Deputy may have meant to ask about Part V, but he asked for the number of affordable houses, which is 1,100.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I want to know about shared ownership, not affordable houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year, for the full year there were 2,900.  Those figures can be broken down if the Deputy wishes.  Unfortunately, one of the ploys used is to consider the four different schemes and only refer to figure of output for one of them.  In the first six months for affordable houses under Part V, which is one of our schemes, there were 367 units.  I do not have the output for social housing, because the Deputy&rsquo;s question was not about that.  If he is telling me it was 616 and that was up to 20%, it would indicate that approximately 3,000 of the 44,000 were eligible for Part V.  As we discussed the matter last week and in other places, we know that approximately a quarter of house production is made up of one-off houses in the country.  Another significant proportion is taken up by old planning permissions, granted prior to the coming into force of Part V.  Many more of them are small developments under four and some are on land that is not zoned in towns and villages where Part V does not apply.  Working from the 616 figure, approximately 3,000 of the 44,000 at this stage were eligible for Part V.  As the old planning permissions die out in the coming years, obviously the figure will be much higher.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State not accept that developers are giving money in lieu as they are allowed to do under the amended Act of 2002 or are giving land elsewhere?  It takes considerably longer for local authorities to convert that money or land to houses.  In addition <Col N="63"/>to getting 20% of a development, the houses are available immediately as the builder will get the development completed as soon as possible to get his houses on the market.  The Minister of State must accept that the objective of providing social and affordable housing under part V has failed since the introduction of the 2002 Act.  What new policies does the Minister of State intend to implement to deliver more affordable housing in communities where it is needed, rather than telling us about the present policy which is proving to be unsuccessful as builders are simply getting out of their commitments to give 20% of the housing as they are giving money or land instead, which may only turn into housing in the long term?</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy said, since 2002, cash represents one method by which a developer can fulfil his legal obligations under Part V.  As we discussed last week, up to the end of June &euro;38 million was contributed in that way.  I made it clear last week and do so again today that without these cash payments 12% or 14% would be added to the output.  It is not a case of cash representing half of the business so to speak.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not.  If there was no cash it would add approximately 12% to 14% to the number of units delivered.  If it were 616, taking the Deputy&rsquo;s figure for the first six months, it would increase by that amount, which is not radically different.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On other measures, the big initiative will be the affordable homes partnership that we launched a number of months ago.  There are calls for lands and I expect announcements very soon.  That partnership has been working with private developers to bring forward land that was previously not zoned or lands whose zoning has been amended.  There will be announcements covering the greater Dublin area in the coming weeks and months.</P>

        <Quest>  the number of elderly people and people in receipt of social welfare estimated to be living in homes with above average levels of radon; if he will reconsider his refusal to introduce a scheme of grants to assist in remediation works to the homes of elderly people and those in receipt of social welfare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>During the 1990s, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland carried out a nationwide survey of radon gas in domestic dwellings.  The survey involved the measurement of radon in approximately 11,000 houses nationwide.  Based on the results of this survey, the RPII estimated that approximately 7% of the national housing stock, 91,000 houses, have radon concentration levels in excess of the national reference level of 200 bq/m3.  This is the reference level adopted by Government for houses and is the level above which it is recommended that radon remediation works should be considered.</P>
        <P>The RPII survey is the only one of its kind to have taken place in the country.  The nature of the survey does not make it possible to estimate the number of occupants and their age cohort.  As stated in reply to previous questions, increasing public awareness of radon is considered to be a more effective approach than the provision of State financial assistance to householders for radon testing of their homes or for radon remediation works.  Such schemes are not operated by the majority of EU member states and could require very significant public expenditure and administrative resources.</P>
        <P>The testing of houses for radon is a relatively straightforward, non-invasive and inexpensive process, costing about &euro;50 per house.  Furthermore, in many cases, relatively straightforward and inexpensive remediation measures, such as improved ventilation, can be effective in reducing radon concentration levels.</P>
        <P>The Government, through the RPII, has, for many years, committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to highlighting public awareness of radon and the risks associated with it.  In this connection, I refer to the reply to Question No. 607 of 1 November 2006 in which I outlined the numerous initiatives undertaken by the RPII and my Department.</P>
        <P>As part of the audit of the condition of the local authority housing stock, which is due to commence next year, I intend that appropriate arrangements will be made to survey the radon concentration levels in those houses.  As part of their duties the landlord councils will be expected to take the necessary remedial steps.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  The contradictory advice coming from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government never ceases to amaze me.  One section of the Department advises householders to insulate their houses to keep the heat in and the Minister has told us to open the windows to let the radon gas out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not quite the same thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure which advice one should take.  Is it better to be warm and dead or cold and alive?  Some 91,000 homes have death-<Col N="65"/>dealing levels of radon gas.  Some 300 people die from the effects of radon gas, based on the RPII figures.  I was involved directly with that agency in the first stages of having the surveys carried out and the Minister&rsquo;s constituency colleague, Deputy Jacob, completed the job.  I am sure the Minister will be aware that the former Labour and Fianna F&aacute;il Government decided on the advice of the RPII that a remediation grant scheme should be introduced, but the Minister has turned his face against that and has taken some new advice.  He should consider some special cases.  He has said he will consider council houses, which is a welcome positive step.  I ask the Minister to consider those who cannot afford to carry out the remediation works, including old age pensioners and those on social welfare.  We should at least have a limited scheme for those who cannot afford to carry out the works themselves.  The alternative is literally to condemn these people to death in houses with high levels of radon gas.  The test could be carried out before awarding the grant to ensure it is needed.</P>

	<P>Ventilation does not simply mean leaving windows and doors open.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The last Minister told people to open their windows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>While I appreciate the humour, it is not necessarily counter to the advice on insulation.  We will leave that to one side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister will remove that advice for future reference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>To the extent that anybody advises people to leave their windows or doors open, I will remove that advice.  Discussion on the introduction of a radon gas remedial works grant scheme took place in 1997 and I believe it was announced that such a scheme would be introduced.  Again, it was to be subject to moneys being found in the then relevant Departments and as the Deputy knows, that did not happen.  The issue was reviewed in 2001, as the Deputy mentioned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The response of other countries to this issue has been, to put it mildly, chequered.  The funding is much better spent in advising people to have their homes tested because the changes that are needed are relatively small and inexpensive.</P>
        <P>On a previous occasion the Deputy has mentioned people in social housing and the responsibilities of councils.  That point is well made and it is the reason I am incorporating that in the review.  A cost benefit analysis was commissioned by the Danish Government some years ago of existing houses in Denmark by way of a scheme to grant assistance.  It concluded that such investment would not be justified and that the alternative means of reducing the number of lung cancer deaths, which is the key statistic, reducing <Col N="66"/>smoking, was much better.  I do not like using the term &ldquo;cost benefit analysis&rdquo; when talking about human life but that is the way the analysis on those particular schemes tends to be conducted.  The Deputy can be assured there will not be contradictory advice on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister not agree it is extraordinary that the number of people dying from the effects of radon gas is almost the same as the number killed on our roads?  We spend huge amounts of money, energy, time and public attention on deaths on our roads and ignore the fact that 300 people die from something that is unnecessary and avoidable.  Those deaths could be avoided for very little cost.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact the Minister is including social housing in a programme of retrofitting.  Will he look again at the works that are done because the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has found that some of the new houses that were supposed to be fitted with radon gas exclusion measures are allowing the gas into houses because they were not fitted properly?  Even where houses were retrofitted some houses were still found to have gas levels.  Obviously the methods used are not as effective as the RPII hoped or perhaps they are not being fitted as well as the RPII hoped.  If there was some type of an examination at the fitting stage to that particular part of the house, whether retrofitted or otherwise, it would be of benefit.  If a grant scheme was in place it would provide an opportunity to examine the fitting of these measures by the State in the interests of the citizens.</P>
        <P>In reviewing the matter, will the Minister examine the situation of people outside the social housing arena who are not in a position to spend &euro;10,000 or &euro;12,000 to have the house retrofitted where they can demonstrate there is a case for some assistance either through the health board or some other system?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I will think about the Deputy&rsquo;s last point, although I am not making a promise on it.  I am aware this is an issue in which he has taken a particular interest.</P>
        <P>The other point the Deputy made is good.  Part C of the Building Regulations 1997 and the technical guidance document provide the basis on which buildings should be dealt with.  We do not have statistics on it but the Deputy may have anecdotal evidence that I have heard as well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>  his plans to increase motor taxation for 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[36502/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am currently examining the feasibility of more closely aligning motor taxation with rated CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions particularly for the private car category which accounts for nearly 80% of the national vehicle fleet.  No decisions have yet been made on the specific changes that may emerge from this exercise; current motor tax rates have remained unchanged since 2004.  However, I will be ensuring that overall motor tax buoyancy levels are sustained as an appropriate ongoing source of funding for local authorities.  Current motor tax receipts up to the end of October this year show an increase of 10% compared with last year &mdash; Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd has rejoined us &mdash; against a background of a 6% increase in the national vehicle fleet, suggesting there has been significant improvements in collection.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has indicated he will be using motor taxation as a tool to deal with greenhouse gas emissions.  I welcome that, as I believe will other Members.  It appears from the record that motor taxation has increased steadily, by approximately &euro;100 million per year.  It is almost exactly that amount since 2002.  Is it the Minister&rsquo;s intention to increase that amount considerably in view of the need to deal with the problem of greenhouse gas emissions or will he leave it steady as she goes, so to speak, at another &euro;100 million?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to anticipate any changes of a fiscal nature that might be made, and motor taxation in general is of a fiscal nature, but the Deputy is correct.  The national vehicle fleet including cars, vans etc. on our roads has increased steadily and as I said when Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd was not listening&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the collection rate for motor tax has improved significantly.  It is up 10% while the vehicle fleet grew only 6% last year.</P>
        <P>This could be done in a way that is revenue neutral or in a way that is not revenue neutral.  The general point I am making is that it would be a good idea to move to charging a tax, which more directly reflects the emissions from the pipe of a vehicle.  That is the general direction but I ask the Deputy not to ask me to anticipate any <Col N="68"/>changes of a fiscal nature because, unfortunately, I will not be in a position to answer him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments.  Green taxes are constructive and those based on CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions would meet the needs.  I am concerned that the Minister did not include HGVs in his comments because they do many more journeys than the average motor car.  I do not have the emissions figures to hand but I believe that a significant number of HGVs are over six years old and therefore would be very high polluters.  The Minister ought to tax cars and HGVs that are older and therefore have very high emissions.  He should not shrink from that responsibility.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 42 together.</P>
        <P>My Department provides capital funding through local authorities to approved housing bodies which provide accommodation in accordance with the terms of my Department&rsquo;s schemes for voluntary and co-operative housing.</P>
        <P>Funding is no longer a constraint on progress as far as implementation of the voluntary and co-operative housing programmes are concerned.  In February of this year, I substantially increased the capital grant maxima for new projects.  In 2006, my Department provided a record &euro;243 million in funding for the sector.</P>
        <P>There are currently four projects with 48 units of accommodation under technical examination and awaiting approval in my Department.  Other<Col N="69"/>wise, my Department has approved some 48 projects to proceed to tender stage for the delivery of 966 units of accommodation.  There are, in addition, a further 49 projects with 947 units of accommodation where the Department has sought clarification and further documentation from the local authorities.  In all cases, the Department works with the local authority and the voluntary body to progress these projects to completion as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply, in particular the increased amount for the voluntary sector.  The Minister will probably be aware that my county is somewhat of a champion of voluntary sector housing.  I championed it myself when I was in the Minister of State&rsquo;s position in the Department and it has been operating since.</P>
        <P>I bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention the crisis that exists in the social housing area where voluntary housing is directly involved.  I will give the Minister one example.  Celbridge, which the Minister knows well because he opened a housing scheme there recently, is a middle class town.  There are 1,600 families on the waiting list for social and affordable housing in the town.  This figure is extraordinary.  Although a very large sum of money has been allocated to address the problem, it is simply not enough, even when combined with the other moneys available.  There is a need for a further allocation and I hope the Minister of State will press his colleagues in Cabinet to ensure it is made.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State agree there is a need to make some changes in the voluntary housing sector?  Landlords now seem to own far more houses than all others and Respond resists very strongly the possibility of tenants purchasing their houses.  Will the Minister allow for a purchase scheme in the voluntary housing sector that is similar to that pertaining to local authority homes?  I know he will meet strong resistance, as I did when I tried it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>At political level, we receive requests all the time to introduce tenant purchase schemes in the voluntary housing sector.  The Deputy is correct that some large organisations are strongly opposed to it.  Last December, we stated in our policy document that we would instigate a pilot scheme pertaining to tenant purchase in a small number of new schemes.  This must be done in consultation.  Some discussions have taken place and I would like to believe we could have pilot schemes pertaining to existing developments also.</P>
        <P>Many residents, particularly those in integrated estates such as those in Celbridge, might be working in the same factory.  Some 30 houses in the estate might be local authority houses and 30 others might be associated with voluntary housing.  When everyone was unemployed in 1985, for example, this did not matter, but it does at <Col N="70"/>present in that the one group can buy their houses and the other cannot.  This must be addressed slowly and through consultation.</P>
        <P>Deputy Stagg stated his county is a champion of voluntary housing.  The schemes in question would be one of the smaller ones.  I sometimes wonder whether they should have been part of co-operatives rather than voluntary housing associations, but that is another issue.</P>
        <P>I understand what the Deputy is saying but he should note that all of the &euro;243 million allocated for voluntary housing will probably not be used.  Local authorities received an allocation of approximately &euro;980 million this year and the Department&rsquo;s housing Vote amounts to &euro;2 billion.  We have made extra money available this year and we have committed additional money over the coming years.  Our main problem is trying to make the local authorities and voluntary bodies deliver.  There is no shortage of money at present.</P>
        <P>While there is always a demand for housing, it should be noted the number on the waiting list this year dropped by 10% as compared to the figure for three years ago.  This may be due partly to improvements in the compilation of the list, but there is a slight decrease nevertheless.</P>
        <P>I wish the money were spent quicker.  I would love to be able to say to the Minister for Finance that the allocation is all gone.  It is the other way around, however, in that we are driving the local authorities and voluntary bodies so they will do more and use all the money available to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the Minister of State and empathise with him.  I sometimes despair of the local authorities.</P>

	<P>I despair of the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness, if money is being provided to local authorities and they are not doing their job, it is not the Minister of State&rsquo;s fault.  I had the same experience when I was Minister of State and, as a result, I did something which was probably unorthodox, that is, I addressed meetings of councillors.  I went to the elected members over the heads of the officials and it was effective.  I told the members the amount of money they had available to them and the number of houses they could provide each year and we achieved our targets much more readily than we would have done had we dealt directly with officials.  My council is one of the worst in the country for spending the money available to it.  I ask the Minister of State to go directly to the elected representatives to get them on the job in addition to their officials.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>

	<P>The Deputy may have a point.  Members of the Oireachtas still have links with councillors and we try to communicate with them when travelling around the country.</P>
        <P>Some phenomena never cease to amaze me.  I met a delegation from a particular local authority not so long ago which was looking for more money for the authority&rsquo;s programme.  I outlined the facts to the delegation and was rather surprised some weeks ago to find out that what the local authority officials regarded as a really big scheme was shot down at council level over some technical difficulties associated with Part 8 or Part 10 of the legislation.  In reality, they did not want the scheme and they were put under pressure by those with a snobbish point of view.</P>
        <P>As public representatives, we sometimes shout and roar and councillors are no better or worse than us in this regard.  They want social housing and talk about the figures.  They want the Government to provide money but when it comes to making a decision at council level, their bravery sometimes diminishes.  Our job is to provide the resources and we are doing so.  In the past, different Ministers might have slowed down submissions in the hope they would not run out of money.  It is the other way around at present in that we are chasing the councils to make applications for projects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If the local authorities are not doing their jobs and producing the houses, responsibility should be removed from them.  They must meet their responsibility in respect of the applicants.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to a reduction in the number on waiting lists for housing.  In County Louth, there has been an increase &mdash; the number almost doubled in the past year.  This may be because more single people are living in the county or because more people are moving to the county.  One must acknowledge the reality that there are significant increases in the numbers on waiting lists in some counties.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Stagg that people living in houses such as those managed by Respond should be able to purchase them.  Why should one family be able to buy its local authority flat while another family in the same complex, whose flat is not a local authority unit, cannot do so?  This must be addressed.  There is no reason that Respond or any other group should oppose this move.  Everyone has the right to buy his or her own home.</P>
        <P>Conversely, when local authorities purchase houses outside their stock, could they not be offered to Respond tenants or others in similar houses which they could never purchase?  It would give the tenants an opportunity to start buying.  This is everyone&rsquo;s right and people want to do it for their families.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="72"/>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We hope to initiate a pilot tenant purchase scheme to see how it will operate.  I can well understand why the voluntary housing body would still want to control an estate and be responsible for the green areas therein.  I see merit in this because its input and commitment might decrease if it were only looking after half the estate.  I am sure it would be possible to have some sort of scheme or co-operative &mdash; I do not want to use the phrase &ldquo;management company&rdquo; &mdash; whereby the house owner would still pay a certain amount for estate management or landscaping.</P>
        <P>There has been a reduction of 9.8% in the number on waiting lists for housing.  Many people are on more than one local authority housing list, particularly in Dublin where there are four local authorities.  Perhaps we encourage this and I probably do so myself at clinics.  Louth and Meath county council areas are just out the road and, depending on where one&rsquo;s constituent lives, one might encourage him or her to include himself or herself on a couple of lists.  When we carry out the overall national assessment, we account for this duplication by co-ordinating all the information so that the final figure amounts to less than the sum of the parts.</P>
        <P>The aforesaid phenomenon might feature more in Dublin than in the middle of certain other counties.  In the greater Dublin area, people are inclined to back all horses and include themselves on the lists of Fingal County Council, Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council.  When we compile all the figures, we often discover the true size of the waiting list is much smaller than expected.  Co-ordination in the compilation of the data has improved.  During the last assessment, we used PPS numbers and this helped to tidy up the figures.  That was not the only reason for the reduction in the numbers, but it helped.  People who were renting privately and were moving from one rent allowance to another used to sit on local authority lists under a couple of different addresses.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 13 and 119 together.</P>
        <P>Irish waste management policy is based on the internationally recognised integrated approach to waste management, the main emphasis of which is on waste prevention, reuse and recycling.  Landfill is the least preferable option from an environmental perspective.  It is planned to decrease its contribution over time as recycling levels increase and alternative infrastructure becomes available.  Significant landfill capacity is required in the short term until alternative treatment is available for non-recyclable material.  Some landfill capacity will be needed for residual waste in the longer term.  Various policy instruments are available to ensure that the role of landfill is consistent with national waste policy, including the landfill levy being applied.  Other instruments can be developed if required.</P>
        <P>The diversion of waste from landfill sites will be driven by the implementation of the national biowaste strategy, which I published recently.  The strategy sets out a comprehensive approach to achieving the target of increasing the level of diversion from 630,000 tonnes of biowaste in 2004 to 1.8 million tonnes by 2016.  The strategy was finalised following a thorough and detailed process of consultation with all the stakeholders.  I am confident that this ambitious target will be met as successfully as we have met the target for <Col N="74"/>recycling.  According to the latest data, the overall rate of recycling in 2004 was almost 34%, compared to 9% in 1998.  The national target, to be achieved by 2013, is 35%.  We have already passed the 2013 target.  The position is even more dramatic in respect of packaging waste.  The rate of recycling of such waste was 56% in 2004.  We have already met the key target of 50% by 2005, which was set by the European Union.  These achievements have been supported since 2002 by the provision to local authorities of approximately &euro;100 million in grant assistance in respect of recycling facilities.</P>
        <P>The planning authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency are responsible for determining the number and scale of individual facilities, having regard to the relevant regional waste management plan and national policy.  I have issued a policy direction to facilitate a more rational use of waste management facilities.  The direction clarifies for planning authorities and the EPA the national policy position on inter-regional movements of waste.  As Members are aware, one used to be allowed to export waste from Kildare to Germany, but not from Kildare to an adjoining county, which was ridiculous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Some waste was moved from Dublin to Kildare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I have initiated a process of public consultation on the future economic regulation of the waste management sector.  That process has attracted over 50 submissions, including a submission from the industry body that was mentioned in one of the questions.  The wide-ranging remit of the process of public consultation has been approved by the Government.  The process will have regard to policy on the direction of waste to particular facilities, for example.  I intend to finalise further policy proposals after I have considered the views of the various stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government concluded its national overview of waste management plans in July 2004.  The overview identified that good progress was being made in the implementation of the regional plans.  The plans have subsequently been reviewed by the local authorities on the basis of significant public consultation.  I am satisfied that the regional waste management plans properly reflect the needs of individual regions and the range of available technologies.  If Deputies want to ask supplementary questions about the tonnage capacity in various areas, on foot of the problems which arose in that regard in the Dublin area, I will be happy to take them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the increase in the rates of recycling.  Question No. 10 was tabled after some recycling companies stated in the media that they could not compete with landfill facilities.  It has been suggested that people are <Col N="75"/>choosing to dump rather than recycle because the cost to such companies of recycling waste products is greater than the cost of dumping those products.  The companies in question have asked for an adjustment to be made.  I appreciate that the Minister has made a comprehensive statement in this regard.  I do not have a copy of what he said, but I will read it later.  The key issue for the recycling companies is the need for the Minister to use every instrument available to him to ensure that it is cheaper to recycle than to dump.  If the Minister has to subsidise that, he should do so.  Recycling is working better in some areas than in others, as the Minister pointed out.  The regional waste management plans will not work unless we ensure that it is economic to recycle.  We need to find markets for recycled goods in Ireland and overseas.  I understand that a fund of approximately &euro;1 million has been put in place to support recycling.  I am not sure what is the exact number.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>We have made &euro;100 million available since 2002.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to put in place more measures of that nature.  If we do not ensure that recycling is economic, for example by subsidising it to make it economic, we will defeat the purpose of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct.  I am familiar with the industry.  I would like to strike a note of caution.  Deputies are familiar with Adam Smith&rsquo;s comment that when two businessmen get together, they sometimes conspire against the public interest.  A degree of special pleading is taking place, particularly on the part of the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants.  The basic argument being made is that if a certain amount of landfill tonnage capacity is available, it can be uneconomical to move into the waste-to-energy industry.  In 2001, less than four years of landfill capacity remained in Dublin, which was dangerous.  Less than five years of capacity is available in Dublin at present, which means that we are not exactly out of the woods.  The level of capacity that is generally available nationally will last for approximately eight years.  That is probably a prudent approach, given that any other approach will need a long lead-in time.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s point about making it easier for people to recycle was well made.  One of the most dramatic things to happen here in that regard was the increase in the roll-out of household segregation facilities.  Such an approach to recycling is becoming the norm, rather than the exception, and is producing critical tonnages.  The decision I made last year on waste electrical and electronic equipment led to the development of three recycling facilities and the creation of over 300 jobs.  Bring banks and civic amenity centres are part and parcel of this process.  The 80th civic <Col N="76"/>amenity centre in this country is about to be opened.  I agree with Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd that such facilities have to be made available.  The V &amp; W facility in Dundalk, for example, is marvellous, amazing and astonishing.  People meet there because it is seen as a place of social gathering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the same in Drogheda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Such facilities make it much easier for people to recycle.  A general review of the whole area of waste regulation is under way, as I have said.  The self-serving arguments which are being made by some interests within the industry have to be balanced with the public good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a cost issue too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the recycling figures, which are impressive and good.  There is scope to do better in the future.  If we have an over-capacity of landfill facilities and a planned over-capacity of incineration facilities, does the Minister agree that it will be difficult to convince anybody to go down the expensive route of recycling, rather than to put waste materials in landfills or to give such materials to the operators of incinerators, whose fires are hungry and require regular feeding?  There will be an incentive to bring waste products to incinerators.  According to the question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Pattison, the Minister asserted recently that &ldquo;the need for incineration has been over-estimated&rdquo;.  Will the Minister comment on that?  Is he suggesting that he will instruct the people who are carrying out the reviews to propose alternatives to municipal incineration?  Was that his intention when he made the comments to which I referred?  Does he believe that too many incinerators have been provided for in the regional development plans?  Does he agree that recycling could be more expensive than landfill and incineration facilities if the full cost is charged for such facilities?  As well as making it easier, we must also make it cheaper for people to recycle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the central thesis of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, which is that we must get the balance right.  We had 76 local authority landfills in Ireland as recently as 1998, but that is down to 34 today.  We are not oversupplied with landfill.  There is a five-year supply in Dublin, but if one looks at the lead time, that is very tight.  The situation in the rest of the country is somewhat better.  The public statements from a particular sector have come primarily from an individual company that has a vested interest in depressing landfill in order to make it relatively more attractive to move into incineration.  My job is to make sure that the balance is there and that we have a full range of facilities.  An over-reliance on one or the other would not be healthy.</P>
        <P>We certainly do not need an incinerator in each of the ten regions.  We need to get the balance <Col N="77"/>right and this will be the key to making the whole policy successful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>When can we expect to see the incinerators that the Minister sees as desirable?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to comment on anything that is in the planning process, but an extraordinary situation occurred where a company that had applied for planning permission and applied for an extension then suggested that it may not go ahead with the construction.  I understand that the company has clarified the position recently.  We must accept that we have to handle our own waste, including our own hazardous waste and especially that coming from the pharmaceutical industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be in Cork.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>There is planning permission down there for it.  It makes sense that we have it because much of our key industry could be held hostage if we do not have the capacity.  It is about getting the balance right.  Where we have shown leadership, there has been a remarkable response, such as with the electronic waste.  I could not have envisaged a situation 12 months ago in which Ireland would have moved from zero to virtual world leadership.  We now have three of the best recycling facilities anywhere in Europe.  Commissioner Dimas was here to look at one of the facilities and he could not believe it.  Frankly, I could not believe it either.  There are 300 people employed in that industry now.  Waste should not be regarded as a problem, but as a potential resource.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 25 together.</P>
        <P>Over-grazing of livestock has given rise to environmental problems, particularly loss of vegetation and soil erosion in commonages. Damage to the habitat of the red grouse in the Owenduff <Col N="78"/>Nephin Beg complex special protection area in County Mayo has been the subject of a continuing infringement case, under the birds directive, taken against Ireland by the EU Commission in the European Court of Justice.  The reasoned opinion of 18 October 2006, issued by the Commission, calls on Ireland to implement measures and demonstrate improvements in this area and in other commonages.</P>
        <P>My Department, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and Food and the European Commission, has been working to resolve the issue of appropriate commonage management, which is made complex by the multiple shareholdings involved.  The two Departments have put in place a number of measures which are directed at meeting EU requirements fully.  These measures include full rather that partial de-stocking under the commonage framework plans; a requirement for participation in REPS or the NPWS farm plans by farmers in the area; guidelines to planners on appropriate carrying capacities for commonages; and a special closed period for all sheep farming on the Owenduff Nephin Beg commonage for five months of the year, that is, from November to December and from mid-February to mid-May.  Farmers will be paid compensation for additional costs arising from the removal of sheep for this closed period.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department is increasing the monitoring of the condition of commonages and privately owned lands in designated areas.  Where appropriate, it will take the necessary enforcement measures to secure compliance under the requirements of the directive.  A national survey of the red grouse is also underway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister of State explain how compensation is arranged?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has now agreed with farming representatives to make a payment of &euro;40 per head for each ewe taken off the hills for the five-month period.  We are also making a once-off payment of &euro;2,000 to each existing REPS farmer in respect of de-stocking.  A contract was entered into with REPS farmers which obliged them to de-stock at a particular level.  They are now being asked to remove all of their ewes from the hills, so it is only right that they would receive extra compensation.</P>
      </Speaker>

        <P>In light of that explanation, the Deputy will see that this is the one area for which the Minister is directly responsible and on which he may be queried in the House.  I recall the long discussion we had regarding being answerable to the House and suggest that, on further consideration, the Deputy might like to withdraw that amendment.  It remains a ministerial obligation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I feel obliged to respond positively to the Minister&rsquo;s magnanimity.  I thank him for taking amendments Nos. 8 and 9 on board and I am happy not to move amendment No. 10.  I tabled it because the situation can change dramatically in a very short space of time, something that would be particularly true if there were an energy crisis.  For that reason, I felt that it might be useful to the Minister and agency if it were possible to plan for a crisis situation.  In such circumstances, it might be desirable to overshoot the targets slightly, thereby reflecting the international energy supply situation.  That amendment has several connotations, but I am happy not to move it.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The amendment is self-explanatory, but it might do no harm if the Minister gave the House the benefit of his views.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>NORA&rsquo;s function is to maintain strategic oil stocks in line with international stockholding obligations.  While NORA purchases oil to meet them, it is not a commercial body and its core business is not trade in oil.  The <Col N="82"/>Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry into the market.  It is not appropriate that NORA&rsquo;s role extend to monitoring the Irish oil market.  That is a matter for the Competition Authority, whose powers include the examination of acquisitions and mergers.  It is a statutorily independent body with a specific role to enforce Irish competition law.  The authority&rsquo;s role is to ensure that the competition works well for the benefit of customers throughout the economy.</P>
        <P>In that regard, the authority may, from time to time, seek specific information from public bodies and in such a situation, I assure the House, NORA is legally obliged to co-operate with the authority.  CER is an independent body responsible for overseeing the liberalisation of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and gas sector and has no role regarding the oil industry.  I oppose the amendment on the basis that what the Deputy is trying to achieve is already present in the legislation and the obligations imposed on NORA.</P>

        <P FLI="0">It is necessary to take account of market indicators.  That is not second-guessing anyone, since it is a simple fact that projections must have due regard to market indicators regarding purchasing and sales.

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Durkan.</P>
        <P>I support amendment No. 12.  Many issues have arisen over the past year, particularly the last six to nine months, regarding the oil industry and its distribution network.  At present, we do not seem to have any agency other than the Competition Authority to take account of the market&rsquo;s competitive nature.  The past year has seen substantial increases in oil prices and petrol forecourt prices.  There was a major development in the market whereby Topaz Energy Limited effectively took over a very large segment of the market &mdash; I believe over 40% &mdash; through ownership of Shell and now the former Statoil market.  In that context, the Competition Authority did not carry out its requisite public duty in respect of the timing <Col N="83"/>of the takeover and, unbelievably, missed the day on which it should have made a particular comment.  If a Member of the House missed an important deadline of that nature &mdash; for example, in respect of the five-week date that applies to local authority planning applications or with regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la &mdash; it would be considered a grave error by our constituents.  Action has not, however, been taken by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in respect of the matter to which I refer.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We are discussing amendment No. 12 but amendment No. 11 in my name, which was dealt with previously, sought to add a role for NORA in the invigilation of the oil industry.  Under that amendment, NORA would have been obliged to be aware of the levels of stocks held privately within the industry and to play a key role in assessing both the forward pricing of oil and the purchasing of oil.  It was stated recently that Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary of Ryanair seems to have a particular skill in respect of the forward purchasing of kerosene stocks for his company&rsquo;s fleet of aircraft.  This seems to be one of the reasons, as announced in recent days, Ryanair&rsquo;s six-monthly profits increased by &euro;100 million.  It is also why Mr. O&rsquo;Leary appears to have a great deal of success in that area.  I profoundly disagree with the latter&rsquo;s way of conducting his business and dealing with his company&rsquo;s workforce, but he appears to possess a particular skill in respect of forward purchasing.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 11 sought to add to the functions outlined in the Bill another role for NORA.  The Minister will state that it will possess a narrow role and that the CER would be best equipped to deal with matters that arise in this area.  However, the CER has, to date, not been given a statutory role in respect of the liquid fuels market.  In a debate on previous energy legislation, somebody referred to the great competition that exists in that market and contrasted it with the position relating to the gas and electricity markets.  As any comparison of forecourt prices throughout the country will clearly show, however, there appears to be little competition.</P>
        <P>There is a great deal of merit in bestowing a role, particularly in respect of the collation of information, upon NORA.  The latter could also work with the CER, perhaps under future legislation, to introduce proper invigilation of the market.  The Minister will be disappointed that the Competition Authority failed to discharge its statutory duty in this regard in respect of the Topaz takeover, which is an astonishing state of affairs.  Perhaps he will agree that the only way forward is to consider granting particular roles to NORA and the CER in this regard.</P>
        <P>When I was obliged to leave the Chamber earlier, we were dealing with amendments Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive.  We are now dealing with amendments Nos. 11&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="84"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>So we have discussed up as far as amendment No. 67.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The later amendments have yet to be dealt with.  We are discussing amendment No. 12.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister accepted amendments Nos. 8 and 9.  I was totally floored by his generosity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The objective Deputy Durkan is trying to achieve in amendment No. 12 is already incorporated in the Bill in the objectives of NORA.  The primary objective of the latter is to maintain oil reserves for the purpose of meeting Ireland&rsquo;s international oil stockholding obligations.  As stated earlier in respect of amendment No. 11, NORA is not being given a role in respect of the internal market, which is free and liberalised.  The Competition Authority is, as the Deputy observed, charged with dealing with that matter.</P>
        <P>The acquisition of oil stocks by NORA must take account of its own financial resources, the costs involved and obtaining the best value for money at all times.  The Bill proposes that NORA will continue to have responsibility for the holding and maintenance of oil reserves to allow Ireland to meet its international oil stockholding obligations.  To achieve that, the objective for NORA will be to continue to build up oil stocks.  It is in the best interests of the agency to ensure that it obtains value for money when purchasing oil.  Amendment No. 12 could actually fetter the agency in respect of making such purchases.  I accept that the latter is not the Deputy&rsquo;s intent but the suggested wording &ldquo;in accordance with market indicators&rdquo; is extremely imprecise.  What he is seeking to achieve is already covered in the objectives of NORA, namely, obtaining the best value for money at all times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand what the Minister is saying but my intention is to give the agency an edge somewhat similar to that which applies to the NTMA.  The role NORA will play in the fuel industry is similar to that played by the NTMA.  The amendment merely seeks to sharpen the focus in respect of the provisions of the Bill and the functions of the agency.  If the country had adequate storage capacity, a number of weeks ago we could have bought enough gas to last for a year because there was so much available on the international market.  The markets can change quickly and it is the agency&rsquo;s function to respond accordingly.  Perhaps greater emphasis could be made in that regard.</P>
        <P>The amendment was drafted in a hurry.  One often does not have adequate time to draft amendments and sometimes they do not look <Col N="85"/>great when they appear in print.  If the Minister is of the view that the amendment is unnecessary and that the intention behind it is already contemplated in the Bill, I will withdraw it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to include a reference to the market.  I am seeking to strengthen that in amendment No. 18, which was discussed earlier and which relates to the maintenance of the optimum level of stocks.  We engaged in a lengthy discussion on Committee Stage regarding the level of stocks held on the island.  If I recall correctly, the Minister indicated that 108 or 109 days&rsquo; worth of oil are currently held here.  The European Union introduced a 90-day rule and it is possible to hold as much as 120 days&rsquo; worth of oil.  In the interests of ensuring that the optimum level of stocks held on this island &mdash; either by NORA or the oil companies, such as Topaz and others &mdash; are catered for under the key objectives and functions of the agency, Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s amendment is important.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 form a composite proposal, while amendment No. 15 is related.  Therefore, amendments Nos. 13 to 15, inclusive, may be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 9, line 19, to delete &ldquo;develop&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;develop,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Each of these are technical amendments.  Amendment No. 13 is the usual type of technical amendment that the Minister likes.  Amendment No. 15 is somewhat similar &mdash; a change of words with a resulting change of emphasis.  Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are self-explanatory, while amendment No. 15, likewise, is an improvement on the wording.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>To be magnanimous to Deputy Durkan, I will accept the insertion of the two commas as proposed by him in amendments Nos. 13 and 14, but I cannot accept the amendment proposed as part of amendment No. 14 to insert the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; in line 20 of section <Col N="86"/>8.  As this word is unnecessary, I have tabled an amendment to amendment No. 14.</P>
        <P>On amendment No. 14, leaving aside the comma which we are accepting, the amendment which I am rejecting proposes that NORA&rsquo;s powers to construct, operate and develop works, plant, equipment and storage tanks should be qualified by the insertion of the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;.  That is not warranted.  One just cannot go willy-nilly putting stockholdings into storage tanks, plant or equipment that is not appropriate.</P>
        <P>The same applies to amendment No. 15.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Durkan is that NORA&rsquo;s power to hire or engage ships, vehicles and other means of transportation should be qualified by the insertion of the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;.  In this case also, we are satisfied that the text as it currently stands adequately and comprehensively provides for those day-to-day operations for NORA and for it to make the decision, and that NORA has an obligation to ensure that any of these means of transport that it hires or buys is appropriate for the functions.</P>

Due to the level of noise at the end of a vote it is almost impossible for the Chair to be heard and that can lend itself to confusion.  The last vote was a short vote, but some Members thought it was a long vote because there was a lull between the two amendments being put.

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, lines 34 to 37, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;of&mdash;&rdquo; in line 34 down to and including &ldquo;director.&rdquo; in line 37 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;of not more than 5 directors (including the chairperson).&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These amendments relate to the board of directors.  Section 14 specifies that the board of directors will consist of not more than five directors but it includes the chief executive as one of the directors.  We had a lengthy discussion on this matter on Committee Stage and I raised the issue of corporate governance and the best <i>modus operandi</i> for an important State body such as NORA.  I made the point that in former times a board was thought to operate more efficiently with a managing director.  In more recent times, in my experience, a chief executive has reported to a board of directors and acted to some extent as its secretary and that is the <i>modus operandi</i> of a number of institutions.</P>
        <P>The Minister replied that there were examples across the State sector where the chief executive was also a member of the board as a <i>sine qua non</i>, unlike many companies, agencies and community bodies.  I propose a provision that only the chairperson be included as a director.  Recently there has been an increase in executive chairpersons, where the chair takes on an executive function and operates as the final operational officer for the company.  The chief executive reports to that chairperson, who represents the chief executive on the board.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 27 seeks to include a provision that 40% of the composition of the board be male and 40% female.  That is similar to the proposal in amendment No. 38, introducing a new subsection (11) requiring that the Minister ensure not less than 40% of the board be women and not less than 40% men.  This is a tradition of my party.  The Government of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party in the early 1990s introduced legislation to ensure that women were equally rep<Col N="92"/>resented in State agencies.  A fundamental principle of the Labour Party advocates gender equality as far as possible.  At political level we have always tried to promote women candidates and we are proud that one third of our parliamentary party is made up of women, though that is much smaller than we would like it to be.  As my party&rsquo;s spokesman on enterprise, trade and employment, social and family affairs and in my present portfolio I have always tried to insert this requirement in Bills relating to State agencies.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said that, given the technical nature of the oil industry, it would be problematic to tie the hands of a Minister by insisting on gender equality on the board.  There are broader issues.  The <i>Financial Times</i> commented recently that, while there was an upsurge in the appointment of women throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, since the turn of the century, instead of more women at the upper levels of public companies there seemed to be fewer female chief executives and directors.  The <i>Financial Times</i> investigated the reasons this new glass ceiling seems to have appeared, leaving aside the historical difficulties women have combining their devotion to families and children with work, a difficulty men also face.  It is important to put forward this modest amendment throughout the public service and for semi-State bodies to ensure we have the best expertise, in men and women, available at the highest levels of a company.</P>
        <P>The Minister has appointed women to senior positions within his own portfolio, for which I commend him.  He said he did not want to issue prescriptions in this regard but we should make such provisions the norm.  I remember being with the Ceann Comhairle, or a predecessor of his, in the Parliament of Finland.  The Parliament, he might remember, is shaped like our own and has a statue of a man and a woman where our Press Gallery is, though the press gallery is not in such a prominent position in Finland &mdash; it is in a bullpen behind the members.  The thing that struck one about the Finnish Parliament was its gender equality, and men and women were scattered throughout the parties in the assembly, particularly our sister party.  That is a good aspiration.  The Minister should bite the bullet and insert it in the legislation from day one.</P>
        <P>I am sure expertise exists among women not just in Ireland but across the world.  We discussed the oil conference the Minister opened today and his comment that Ireland was an exciting oil province of the future.  It is an area where our most talented men and women will be active.  In that context I want to make a strong case for amendments Nos. 27 and 38.  I also make the case for amendment No. 29 which seeks to insert the phrase, &ldquo;but not withstanding any involvement in these sectors which may cause a conflict of interest to arise when carrying out their duties as a NORA director&rdquo;.  This refers back to previous discussions and asks that the Minister would require a high level of experience and com<Col N="93"/>petence in the oil industry, whether experience of distribution or exploration.  The person selected should have gained experience throughout the industry.  We want to add that this experience should preclude any continuing involvement which might allow a conflict of interest to arise.  Clearly, directors of the NORA board should not have a direct conflict of interest related to the industry.  The Minister referred to these areas in section 3, but I wish to clarify the issue with this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 26 proposes that the CEO should not be a member of the board.  The text of the Bill as it stands proposes that the NORA board should comprise of six persons, including the chief executive in this instance.  Notwithstanding what the Deputy says, there are various practices in various boards.  In this case, and for the same reason as we talked about with regard to the 40% ceiling, it is better that we maintain the Bill as it is.</P>
        <P>A number of bodies under my aegis have the CEO as a board member, including the ESB, Bord na M&oacute;na, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, Eirgrid, Sustainable Energy Ireland and Digital Hub.  With the exception of the chief executive who will be appointed by the director, the Bill provides that all other directors are to be appointed by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, with the consent of the Minister for Finance for a period of five years with the possibility of reappointment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendments Nos. 27 and 38 propose that at least 40% of the NORA board should be women.  As I said on Committee Stage, I appreciate the thinking behind this.  I try to ensure we meet that 40% in all the appointments over which I have control and have appointed a number of women to the chairs of various bodies under my aegis.  I have no problem with the concept and was probably the first Minister to introduce it in legislation.  I do not have a principled objection to the provision being part of legislation, but these matters must be judged on a case by case basis.  However, this is a specific sector.  The Deputy raised this matter on Committee Stage and I checked with experts in the area and am not inclined to enshrine this proposal in this legislation.  Under the circumstances, having a legal obligation to ensure 40% women could seriously compromise the NORA board and result in the appointment of individuals, not on the basis of merit but on the basis of whether the board needed a male or female member at a particular point.</P>
        <P>The same goes for amendment No. 29, which I cannot accept.  The concern in making appointments to State boards is that the board should contain people of the highest calibre who are capable of making a positive contribution to the company.  The provisions in regard to disclosure of confidential information by directors are set out in section 24 and provision is made for the code <Col N="94"/>of conduct in section 25.  I am satisfied that those provisions are sufficient, as they are with the provisions of the memorandum and articles of association of the company.</P>
        <P>With regard to the other amendment, the Bill as drafted provides for appointments to the board of NORA based on experience and competence in one or more of the areas, including finance and economics.  Persons from this background may include persons with experience of the stock market and, consequently, they are eligible to be considered for appointment to the NORA board.  Therefore it is not necessary to include the proposed amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a rehash of our Committee Stage discussion.  Amendment No. 26 is interesting because there are different and changing models of corporate governance.  I notice, for example, the new chief executive of An Post is around the House today.  An Post had a chief operating officer, but that position seems to have been removed recently.  People utilise different models for different companies.</P>
        <P>There appear to be central policy directions which the board must set and because of that the model I suggest would be best.  However, I accept what the Minister has said.  I still feel the gender requirement is a basic aspiration.  While I understand the Minister&rsquo;s point, he should lay down a standard for the gender requirement in some kind of legislation to ensure that in general terms this criterion would be met throughout the public service.  Perhaps I should have framed the amendment differently and perhaps I will do so when the opportunity arises in another Bill.</P>

	<P>This arose on Committee Stage and I undertook to consider the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment regarding the removal of directors of the board and to return to the matter on Report Stage.  The wording of the provision in section 14 of the Bill is a standard text used in legislation for the removal of directors.  We considered the Deputy&rsquo;s proposed amendment and with the benefit of the advice of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office I am satisfied that acceptance would present practical difficulties in the event that I, as Minister, wished to remove a director from the NORA board.  The Deputy will appreciate that the confidentiality of a doctor&rsquo;s relationship with his or her patient would prevent a board director&rsquo;s doctor from disclosing information about his or her patient&rsquo;s state of health without the patient&rsquo;s consent.  In the context of removal from office there is no inducement for the director to provide the necessary consent.  The standard text is provided in the legislation setting up agencies such as Sustainable Energy Ireland and the Digital Hub development agency.  Accordingly, the amendment is not accepted.  It would not be practical.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason for the amendment in the name of Deputy Durkan is to give absolute satisfaction to the evidence required to remove a director.  There is no evidence in this section as to what would constitute the director becoming incapable of performing his or her duties through ill health.  On whose suggestion or evidence is that required to be brought forward to the Minister, who would have to get the consent of the Minister for Finance to discharge a director from his or her duties?  The purpose of this amendment is to give certainty to the position in law.  It would have to be confirmed by a medical practitioner that the person who was a director was suffering from ill health and that there was evidence to suggest why that person was being removed in the event of a dispute about the person&rsquo;s suitability to discharge his or her duties as a director.  Perhaps the Minister will have another look at the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate what the Deputy has said and the motivation behind the amendment.  We had a good discussion on this on an earlier Stage.  I was of a mind to have another <Col N="96"/>look at it to see whether it could be facilitated.  At the end of the day the very practical advice I was given was that it would be quite impossible to get a person&rsquo;s doctor to confirm to another medical person of the board that the client was not well.  If the client did not want that to be done the doctor would not be able to do it.  It could happen that a person would be on a life support system in a hospital and clearly unable to continue with his functions.  A person could have a brain tumour or be in a vegetative state following a stroke and everybody would know it.  Somebody could say the person was in that state and, obviously, he or she would not be medically fit to carry on.  If the Minister of the day was put in a position where he or she had to go to the person&rsquo;s physician to confirm that, the person may not be in a position to allow his or her physician to do it.  If for one reason or another the person does not want to leave the board and is not quite in the state referred to, all he or she has to say to his or her physician is that he or she is not authorising him to disclose any information about him or her.  In that event it would be impossible to remove the person from the board.  On balance, while I tried to facilitate this amendment, gave it careful consideration and took advice on it, it is not practical to put it into the legislation.  For that reason I ask the Deputy to withdraw it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is of a mind to accept the amendment but the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice is that it might create a precedent elsewhere.  We have legislation here where we are trying to establish that procedures are laid down to ensure fairness in the system in the event of a person falling into ill health and that he or she is discharged because of ill health and for no other reason.  If a person is suffering from ill health the Minister will need evidence.  What evidence would the Minister require to discharge the person from their duties due to ill health?  Under the section in the legislation one does not need any evidence.  On what basis will a director of a company be discharged on grounds of ill health?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer is I do not know until the circumstances arise.  I presume the Minister would not make a decision off his own bat.  Presumably what would happen is that a person would have missed six, eight or ten board meetings because of ill health and would probably have made it known to the board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the section, the decision falls to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I know, but the Minister would not suddenly decide that a person was in ill health.  What would happen is that, for one reason or another, the person would miss a number of meetings or may have acted erratically at a board meeting or meetings.  There could be circumstances of which the Minister would be <Col N="97"/>advised.  On the basis of the advice and evidence given to him, perhaps a doctor&rsquo;s certificate if a person was willing to leave the board, at that stage the Minister would make a decision on medical grounds that a person should be removed from the board.  That is one example I can think of.</P>
        <P>The other example would not work because of the nature of the client-doctor relationship.  If the person did not want to leave the board he or she would refuse to give the information and the Minister would be bound by the amendment and would have to get the medical certificate from the person&rsquo;s physician.  That would not be practical.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Hogan very adroitly pursued the amendment and its meaning.  What I was trying to ascertain was how the Minister would determine the board member was suffering from ill health.  Would it be on the basis of missing a number of board meetings at which major decisions could and should have been taken?  Coming to the conclusion that the person was suffering from ill health because he or she had missed a couple of board meetings might be a dangerous area for a Minister to delve into, notwithstanding all the powers conferred on Ministers.  The reason I tabled the amendment was that in the event of a dispute it would be no harm for the board member to be able to say he or she was or was not suffering from ill health.  There is no necessity to get into the minutiae of it.  It should be quite simple to explain or to verify the decision a Minister has arrived at, based on whatever evidence has been provided.  For example, there could be a row on the board, a dispute within the board or somebody could say a particular member is suffering from ill health and should not be on the board.  That may or may not be a correct assessment.  It might be helpful if the Minister was to have another look at the amendment.  I do not know if it can be incorporated in the Bill.  That is what we were trying to do.  We were not suggesting that the Minister would take on the work of the general practitioner.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill as it stands embraces the intention of Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s amendment.  The provisions of section 14 are comprehensive in regard to the appointment and removal of directors.  The directors of the NORA board, who will be <i>in situ</i> when section 14 is commenced, should continue in office under the terms on which they were appointed and the expertise of board members should remain available to the agency as it becomes an independent State body.</P>
        <P>With regard to amendment No. 37, it is not appropriate to include references in this Bill to possible future amendments to other legislation.  Accordingly, references to any future amendments to the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 are not appropriate to the Bill and the amendment is not acceptable.  If the Ethics in Public Office Act is amended at some point in the future, it can be made to incorporate NORA, or new legislation can be introduced in that regard.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 41 is not warranted because the Bill as drafted will allow ministerial direction to be given to NORA regarding the manner in which a strategy statement should be prepared and will take account of any legislative provisions underpinning the submission of such documents.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 46 is unnecessary because directions given by the Minister will be in accordance with legislation and have regard to the common good.  It is assumed that all legislation is drafted for the common good.</P>
        <P>Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s purpose in introducing these amendments was to ensure certainty in respect of aspects of the Bill.  The Deputy can accept my assurances that the caution he advocates in the amendments is catered for in the Bill as it stands.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 12, to delete lines 3 and 4 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) thenceforth no later than every three years a statement of strategy must be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This group of amendments refers to the strategy statement of NORA.  Subsection 15(1) provides that, as soon as the agency is established as an independent State body, a statutory statement will be submitted to the Minister for an initial five-year period.  Amendment No. 40 proposes that subsequent statements of strategy be brought before the Houses every three years.</P>
        <P>The timeframe for this is important, given that the oil market is extremely volatile.  Oil prices have increased from $25 per barrel in late 2003 to $74 per barrel a few months ago.  Just as we were becoming accustomed to high prices on the forecourts, the price fell to approximately $60.  That is an indication of the speed at which circumstances can change with regard to oil stocks.</P>
        <P>The majority of the world&rsquo;s oil resources are located in politically volatile countries.  Iraq, for example, is in a state of civil war and on the point of collapse.  The country used to equal Saudi Arabia and Iran in petroleum output but since the invasion of Kuwait, its production levels have been severely curtailed.  All attempts made since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein to restore output have failed.  At the beginning of this year, controversy arose with regard to gas supplies from Russia to Ukraine, although the situation seems to have since calmed, with agreement now reached on gas supply from Russia to the EU.</P>
        <P>As the Minister noted, different State bodies operate according to differing timeframes.  I have noted the long timeframes that govern the intro<Col N="100"/>duction of reforms and competition to electricity generation.  An argument could be made that NORA should be faster in responding to general developments.  Debate is currently raging on the extent of global oil reserves and the rate of depletion.  Oil companies such as Exxon Mobil speculate that 3 trillion barrels of oil remain in the ground and that peak oil will not arrive for another 30 or 40 years.  Other specialists believe the tipping point will be reached in 2008.  The first strategy policy document would need to take this into account as early as the year after next.  It would be a very difficult challenge for the incoming Government if it needed to respond to some definitive information that we are about to reach the moment of peak oil some time in 2008, based on the estimates of the so-called &ldquo;early toppers&rdquo; &mdash; the late toppers put it off for some decades.  Some people point to speculation over the past 100 or 150 years that we would run out of oil and that many trillions of barrels remain to be explored.  In that context I felt that NORA should have a faster response.  If the next Government has a Department of energy, representatives of the agency would appear before an energy committee and would be responsible to the Minister.  A strategy statement forming the basis for public discussion should also exist.</P>
        <P>During questions to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government earlier today, Deputy Gilmore and others discussed climate change and the cost to the country of carbon credits, which are very closely related to this matter.  As the security of oil stocks is vital, it should be dealt with on a shorter timeframe &mdash; perhaps even a three-year period is too long and an annual report might be better.  In the past two days the International Energy Agency issued its yearly report, which envisaged an enormous increase in the daily demand for oil from the current 84 million barrels to 116 million barrels in 2015.  In that context our demand of in excess of 200,000 barrels per day is very significant.  We will need to ensure that as we move towards renewable sources of energy and biofuels in the case of oil, we have such security on which to fall back.  While the Minister might suggest a timeframe of less than three years, a review of strategy should take place earlier and should be specified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendments, which represent an attempt to identify the direction of the agency and the issues it needs to address.  The statement of strategy is important.  As Deputy Broughan has said, we live in a very volatile time and the market can change dramatically.  We must be led by the information presented to us.  We are not often in a position to challenge the information because it is poured at us from all angles, almost as fast as the gas and oil come.  In those circumstances it would be helpful to have a short-term strategy statement that could roll over every three years or so, which would cover the immediate foreseeable future, taking account of the <Col N="101"/>ambient conditions at a particular time, and would be able to adjust itself in accordance with market requirements and consumer demands.</P>
        <P>It would be no harm to incorporate these amendments.  Amendment No. 42 requires that the draft strategy statement be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.  The approval is important because, as we know, we have on numerous occasions objected to the presentation of a document before the House without debate.  Some approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas should be required, which goes back to what we discussed earlier today, the primacy of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is not an attempt to undermine the Minister or his authority.  The Minister has a job to do and in future the regulator will have a job to do.  However, in the event of something going radically wrong, it all comes back to the Minister whether he or she likes it.  The Minister is accountable to this House.  Of course every Minister would simply like to go through the formalities.  Why not stay at home and press a button on the computer and get approval that way?  However, the approval needs to come in this fashion and it would be good for the industry, for protection and for the regulator.  Most importantly it would be good for the industrial and domestic consumers as it would ensure that the representatives of the voters had some view to express on the short-term strategy which can roll over.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 43 seeks that the Minister should arrange for a short debate on the strategy statement.  The proposals in the strategy should come before the Houses of the Oireachtas not just for rubber-stamping but also for some kind of approval.  Earlier the Minister suggested that we might not have particular expertise in these areas.  Members of a House of Parliament are supposed to develop expertise and not necessarily on just one portfolio or area.  I believe in the old-fashioned concept that Ministers and budding Ministers should have a reasonable working knowledge of all Departments and portfolios and should be able to question those who are experts.  Many experts throughout the world have not been all that expert when closely questioned even by fools like us.  In honour of the concept of transparency and accountability, Members should be allowed to dispute the short-term strategy, which may be completely wrong.  We may have a different vision and may have other information that may be of benefit to us in reaching a decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill as drafted provides for the submission of an initial strategy statement to the Minister covering a five-year period.  In the case of a subsequent strategy statement, the Bill does not specify the precise period to be covered as it will be specified by the Minister at the appropriate time.  The flexibility that the Deputies seek is contained in the Bill as it stands.  It is wise and prudent to commence the operation of NORA on the basis that it creates its business plan and <Col N="102"/>strategy for a reasonable period of five years or longer.  As Deputy Broughan has said, it is equally reasonable to ensure that it subsequently has flexibility.  It may be that a three-year period would be more appropriate at that stage or it may be that a seven-year period might be more appropriate.  The Bill covers what the Deputies are trying to achieve.</P>
        <P>Even in the initial five-year period it would be a very foolish organisation &mdash; we would probably be talking about dismissing some of the directors or the CEO &mdash; if it did not keep its strategy under constant review as circumstances change.  That is a normal part of doing business.  An example to which Deputy Broughan adverted is that the price of oil changes and will impinge on the national oil reserves agency&rsquo;s ability to purchase oil.  Review is required on a constant basis and will take place as a matter of routine.</P>
        <P>I accept the thrust of the Deputies&rsquo; argument.  The process should not be so rigid that it will be unable to respond to market forces.  The specification of the initial five year period is welcome because it will make people focus on a slightly longer term but there is nothing rigid about that.  After two or three years the company could decide it would do another three or five year strategy, or change its strategy completely.</P>
        <P>The flexible approach that is adopted meets what the Deputies want.  It will allow the Minister of the day to prescribe the period to be covered according to the demands at the time.  The second strategy statement required of NORA will specify a two year or three year period.  As it stands, the Bill is along the same lines as most corporate governance requirements imposed on similar bodies.  I ask the Deputies to accept that the Bill reflects the spirit of their amendments in that it allows the flexibility they require.</P>

	<P>I accept that nobody goes out to do other than the best that can be done, identify what needs to be done in advance and make the necessary strategic decisions in such a way as to be of obvious benefit to the agency.  However, there is never any harm in adding the belt and braces, to use an expression that has developed in this House over the years.  It also brings the changes into public focus in a way that would not ordinarily be made known to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Many decisions that happen now regarding legislation, which often is governed by statutory instruments, ministerial orders or whatever, one reads about it in newspapers and so on.  That is not always appropriate.  We, as legislators, should keep ourselves up to date with what is happening and be more informed.  That is the reason I pursued this amendment but if, as the Minister suggests, everything is covered in that regard I do not wish to delay the House.  I will not press my amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have set out the argument in favour of my amendment No. 40.  My amendment <Col N="103"/>No. 42 echoes the raft of amendments Deputy Durkan tabled on the D&aacute;il and the Seanad aspect.  Many statutory instruments and various reports and statements have been laid before the Oireachtas but were not discussed here; the odd report is discussed.  We had a dispute yesterday over the request from our colleague, Deputy Gilmore, to have an important report discussed on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  One must constantly ask the Taoiseach, as Leader of the House, to arrange a debate on a particular document.  Given the importance of our oil stocks and the role of NORA, it would be appropriate that the strategy statements would be approved by the House and it would be an opportunity to discuss these matters.  We have an opportunity during Question Time, albeit limited, to deal with a huge portfolio which the Minister has been battling with for the past three years or so.  I hope he wins that battle.</P>

	<P>We are doing our best with the huge amount of information that is required but it would be a good opportunity to have documents discussed in the House.  Our Green Party colleagues had a useful debate earlier in this Parliament on having reports on climate change put before Parliament on a regular basis to give us an opportunity to address that issue.  This is a key element in the lives of our people and it would be an opportunity to have a discussion.  The D&aacute;il, in its wisdom, could indicate approval on the Order of Business and we could move on to legislation or whatever.  It should have that choice which we currently do not have.  In common with many of the amendments put down by my Fine Gael colleague, that would be a useful one to leave to the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment might be useful.  The Bill states: &ldquo;A direction that relates to the disposal of any assets or surpluses of a subsidiary may only be given with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;, subject to conditions pertaining at the time.  We discussed this amendment earlier and my colleague, Deputy Broughan, felt that might interfere too much in the internal affairs of the agency.</P>
        <P>I tabled the amendment to add another tier of safety, so to speak, and to try to ensure the conditions pertaining at the time are borne in mind.  In 1987, another State agency, the IDA as it was then called, was given instructions to dispose of property throughout the country.  I felt that decision was wrong and that the property would have to be bought back at some later stage.  That decision was taken for cogent reasons, just as another decision had to be taken in 1981 to ensure the solvency of the country.  That is the reason my amendment states &ldquo;subject to conditions pertaining at that time&rdquo; and because an evaluation of the conditions prevailing at any given time can have two possible outcomes.  First, one could read the situation incorrectly and, second, one could read it by anticipating conditions in three to five years, or in the short to medium term.  Without wishing to get involved in the day-to-day running of the authority, I must say I can remember a number of instances during my time in this House in which assets were disposed of by subsidiaries.  This did not always work out as desired.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding that we are only ordinary legislators and have no expertise in any particular area, we learned from the hard school of life and saw many decisions taken at certain times that may have had regard for some of the relevant circumstances pertaining but which may have missed a vital clue.  This happens regularly and this is the sole reason I tabled my amendment.  It merits consideration and I am interested in hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s reason for tabling the amendment but it is unnecessary because any direction given by a Minister must take into account a range of factors, all of which constitute the conditions pertaining at the time in question.  I cannot recall any Minister who totally ignored the conditions pertaining at any particular time and directed a State <Col N="105"/>company accordingly.  It cannot be done and should not be done. </P>
        <P>As is the Deputy&rsquo;s intention, the conditions at any given time must be taken fully into account, as must Government policy and legislation.  I assure the Deputy it is not possible to make decisions such as those in question or to give directions without taking into account the circumstances and conditions of the time.</P>
        <P>By way of further comforting the Deputy, let me say I know enough about the semi-State bodies under my Department&rsquo;s aegis to know that if I gave a direction to the chief executive of one in respect of a particular matter without taking into account the conditions of the time, I would have great difficulty convincing him or the board of directors, which would ultimately have fiduciary responsibility for the body.  The Deputy is suggesting the Minister would make a decision according to whim.  I assure him that his amendment is not needed as what he proposes must be taken into account in any case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept and respect the Minister&rsquo;s view but I tabled my amendment having due regard to certain occurrences.  I will give some examples.  The country was in financial crisis in 1981 and measures had to be taken to ensure the international monetary people did not start to run the country.  Decisions had to be taken that were subject to conditions prevailing at the time.  Had they not been taken, we would have had a serious problem.</P>
        <P>In 1987, when there was a need to curtail public expenditure, a direction was given by several Ministers to dispose of assets, including assets of the IDA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Conditions prevailing at the time were such that a major industrial site in my constituency had been earmarked for disposal.  It disappeared from the agenda and I remember creating a terrible row about it, as one normally does in such circumstances.  It was restored to the agenda by none other than the current Minister&rsquo;s former colleague, John Bruton, who was the Minister with responsibility for this area at the time.  Intel is now located on the site in question.  The conditions appertaining in 1987 were such that we knew it was only a matter of time before a major company would locate on the site.  If the property had been disposed of, account would not have been taken of the prevailing conditions, which were known locally but perhaps not at a higher level.</P>
        <P>A direction was made to dispose of assets of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Given that we were trying to develop the commuter rail service in my area, it was felt locally that it was totally counter-productive to sell them.  However, all the land owned by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in my home town of Maynooth was sold for housing, thus leaving insufficient car parking space for present requirements.  We knew that if all the conditions pertaining at the time had been taken into account, there could have been no sale of assets.  Perhaps <Col N="106"/>a limited amount could have been sold but a significant amount of the car parking space would have been retained.  Such car parking space is required not only at Maynooth station but also at every other station in the commuter belt, including counties Kildare, Meath and Dublin.  The whole area is affected in a similar way.</P>
        <P>I am not at all attempting to stymy the ability of the National Oil Reserves Agency or to question the integrity of the Minister&rsquo;s decisions.  I am really saying that, in certain cases, circumstances pertaining at a particular time, if taken into account, might change the view of the Minister or make it unnecessary to make a decisions of the kind to which I referred.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 48 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 13, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(14) The Minister shall establish a subsidiary oil exploration agency so as to facilitate a holistic approach to Ireland&rsquo;s oil and energy security.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment alludes to an earlier discussion.  The Minister stated it is not appropriate to do what it seeks and that we should seek to establish the agency to which my amendment refers independently.  I ask that one of the subsidiaries of the National Oil Reserves Agency be an oil exploration agency, thus facilitating an holistic approach to Ireland&rsquo;s oil and energy security.</P>
        <P>Under section 16, the agency, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, has the power to establish agencies under given conditions.  I ask that an exploration agency be included in this provision.  This is in many people&rsquo;s minds at the moment, obviously.  It certainly occurred to me in the early days of the Corrib dispute, when a number of motions about the matter were discussed in the House.  The Minister took a number of private notice questions on the dispute, particularly when four citizens from Rossport were in jail for 94 days.  The crisis blew up when the jailing continued after the D&aacute;il resumed in the autumn of 2005.  The Minister agreed with me at that time, when I felt the petroleum affairs division of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government had a dearth of information about the issues that needed to be resolved by the people of County Mayo, and Shell and its partners, Statoil and Marathon.  The various reports on the matter, which have been sanctioned by the Minister, have made it clear that there was a dearth of information.  There was some controversy about the basis on which the various consents were given by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Fahey, between 2000 and 2002, as well as the basis on which Mayo County Council was able to give <Col N="107"/>planning permission for the pipeline and the refinery proposal.  I remember having meetings with the Minister and the Labour Party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, about these matters in the autumn of 2005, at the height of the imprisonment problem.</P>
        <P>I have mentioned twice that the Minister opened a oil and gas exploration conference in the Burlington Hotel this morning.  The subtitle of the conference refers to Ireland as an exciting oil province for exploration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Until five or six months ago, the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, used to say in the various debates we had on this matter that very little could be done because few resources had been found.  They used to refer to the record of exploration in this country.  They would point out that over the previous two and a half decades, companies were not prepared to explore our waters year after year.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, Deputy Cowley kindly e-mailed me an interesting report that was to be submitted to the conference in the Burlington Hotel this morning.  The key point that seems to be made throughout the report is that technology has changed.  It seems that bringing ashore significant gas resources from 70 km off our offshore shelf, through 3,000 feet of water, is not as daunting as it once was.  It was once a nearly impossible prospect, but amazing engineering advances now allow sub-sea infrastructure to be placed <i>in situ</i>.  It is now possible for a stream of oil and gas to be brought ashore over ten or 15 years.</P>
        <P>I had been representing my party in this portfolio for a short time when I met representatives of Ramco.  It was before the Minister&rsquo;s time in the portfolio.  I was interested in the forms of technology the company used at that time to further explore tranches of sub-sea geological structures.  I was told that the technologies in question had previously led to good oil and gas discoveries.  The officials from Ramco told me their little company was prepared to try to extract such substances on a profitable basis.  While it did not work out for Ramco, it was clear that significant deposits were available.</P>
        <P>We know there has been much greater interest in the Slyne-Erris licensing round over recent years, particularly this year.  An interesting case was made by an Irish oil company, Grian&aacute;n, which has been established by a group of young men from County Donegal.  Grian&aacute;n was prepared to give 10% of reserves to the State, as a first gesture, to indicate that it hoped to reorganise how licensing business is done in this country.  We have heard Mr. Gavin O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s exciting reports about the Dunquin prospect and the surrounding seas.  Reference has been made to trillions of cubic feet of gas and substantial oil reserves.</P><Col N="108"/>
        <P>I have told the Minister many times that we have to follow the example set in Norway by Statoil.  In particular, we should consider the formula adopted by Statoil when it was trying to develop resources in the North Sea between 1968 and 1971.  When Statoil was in this country trying to find a resolution to an earlier phase of the Corrib crisis in north Mayo, it explained that it had successfully adopted a strategy of demanding expertise and knowledge from the oil companies.  It was prepared to proceed with licensing arrangements after it got what it wanted.</P>
        <P>We have all read about the interesting history of DONG Energy, which is the exploration company in Denmark.  It supervises the exploration of oil and gas in that territory and gives it self-sufficiency.  We are also aware of the exciting developments in this regard in Canadian provinces like Newfoundland and Labrador, and more recently in the Faroe Islands.  It seems that Ireland is one of the few countries with possible tremendous oil and gas reserves which has not been prepared to take the basic step of establishing a dedicated agency to search for such reserves.  We have to follow the Norwegian and Danish examples.</P>
        <P>The licensing and taxation arrangements for oil and gas around this country&rsquo;s coast have had an unfortunate history over the past 30 years, since the time of my great predecessor, Justin Keating.  When he was the relevant Minister in this area, he established a regime that was very much in line with the regimes in place in countries like Norway and the Netherlands.  If one considers the Corrib issue, particularly the controversy about the refinery in Erris, one will have to reflect on the immediate issue of the location of the refinery and the earlier problem of the location of the pipeline.  The background problem that has to be considered is the failure to deal in a transparent and equitable way with the exploration that is necessary to find any gas and oil reserves which may benefit this country and its people.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The charge that is continuously made against the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Taoiseach is that they gave away Ireland&rsquo;s patrimony &mdash; gas, in this instance &mdash; without a penny or cent of return to this State, with the exception of corporation tax returns.  There has been a scandalous abnegation of responsibility on the part of the Minister, his predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the former Minister, Deputy Fahey, and all the other Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers in this area.  I refer in particular to the performance of the Taoiseach and the former Minister, Bobby Molloy, in 1992.  They totally dismantled the basic licensing regime that had been put in place to give our people a reasonable interest in the resources off our coast.  That is the record.</P>
     <?oasys _dc10- ?>
        <P>In recent weeks, the Taoiseach has been talking about his legacy over the past ten years.  The extraordinary decisions taken in this regard will form part of his legacy.  It has been alleged that <Col N="109"/>Enterprise Oil was significantly involved in trying to influence the Government&rsquo;s approach to the terms of the licences and the royalties.  The former Minister, Ray Burke, and the Taoiseach dismantled our royalties and licensing regime, which resembled in a basic way the manner in which the Scandinavian countries and other normal democratic countries chose to administer their resources.  The Minister, and the other two Ministers, Deputies Fahey and Dermot Ahern, have failed to pull back that ground.  The Minister said on a number of occasions he would review the licensing terms, that he was preparing a review and that he feels there are reasons to take a more pro-active role on our oil and gas resources.  Will there be any fruits of that review in the forthcoming budget or in anything the Minister does before the general election?  The Minister is often referred to as a man who is prepared to address very difficult issues, but does he have the courage to look at the licensing and royalties regime again?  Will he try to emulate the best and most transparent regimes in the world, such as those which exist in Denmark and Norway?</P>
<?oasys _dc0- ?>
        <P>If the Minister is not prepared to do it in this Bill, he should publish another Bill to establish an agency with the skills and the experience needed.  In the past, I commended my constituency colleague, Deputy Woods, when he was Minister and established the Marine Institute.  That institute gave us some kind of basic information on fisheries stocks and the ecology of the seas off our coasts for the first time.  Prior to that we had practically no information worth debating, although much more still needs to be done on fisheries.  I hope the Marine Institute and the new agency to be established after Christmas will make up for that.  I urge the Minister to set up a centre of expertise before the next election which could ensure the dearth of information on our coastal resources will never cause problems again as it did in north Mayo.  An exploration agency can be set up like that which exists in Denmark and Norway.</P>
        <P>Last Monday morning, I walked some of the road with the people of Rossport and Erris.  Of the 100 people who showed up every morning from 6.00 a.m. to 7.00 a.m., many of them were ordinary people of the district such as farmers, fishermen &mdash; including salmon fishermen upset about last week&rsquo;s decision &mdash; teachers and women on home duties doing their bit for their community before they took their kids to school.  It seems the people want face-to-face negotiations between themselves and Shell and its partners, without preconditions.  Efforts to remedy the situation failed before in that respect, perhaps due to the position of both sides.  There should be face-to-face meetings to try to look for a resolution.  Various polls have been carried out by TG4 and others, while I read into the record a poll carried out by Shell and which was sent to me by the CEO of Shell, Mr. Andy Pyle.  Whatever poll we examine, it seems a significant part <Col N="110"/>of the population of Mayo is still very unhappy about the location of the refinery and about the process in which this development took place.  Dr. Mark Garavan and his colleagues put forward a proposal for a commission as a starting point which could lead to a face-to-face meeting between the two sides and which might bring about a resolution.</P>
        <P>We have spoken about the slow nature of energy development, but ten years have passed since the Corrib deposits were discovered.  Mr. Egan told me recently that with the best scoping possible, the gas will come ashore by autumn 2009, but it would be best if we could get past the scenes witnessed on the haulage road from Belmullet last Monday morning and if we could bring the resource home by agreement.  We had lengthy discussions on Committee Stage about ensuring the towns of Connaught would enjoy the benefits of gas.  The Minister must be commended for the decision to extend gas supply to a large number of towns, although I have been told to remind him about Belmullet and Ballinrobe which should be added to the list.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann was not prepared to use criteria which would have permitted a cost-benefit analysis to enable the development of the pipelines across north and central Connaught.  Deputy Durkan, Senator McSharry and I argued that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s point of view was nonsense and that we should ensure the people most affected by this infrastructure should absolutely get the benefit.  I warmly welcome the decision that has been made, but we need to go a step further.</P>
        <P>People were very unhappy with the Minister when he made references to the dispute in the context of the dispute in Northern Ireland.  He should withdraw those remarks and should take a central role in trying to resolve this matter, because this is a key transitional fuel.  Most of us suspect that we have far greater resources off our coast and we may well even be like the Norwegians or Russians and this will be a huge asset for our country in the next few decades.  We may be well placed to help the rest of Europe and the world in this area, but we can only do that if we get past this stage.  There is goodwill among the people of north-west Mayo.  The Labour Party representative in the area, Councillor Harry Barrett, indicates that a resolution of this matter can be brought about if there is good will.</P>
        <P>We must not be kept in the dark about the resources of this country off its coast.  We owe it to the Irish people to make sure we get that information.  We should take a very pro-active role and not leave it to two or three civil servants.  We should set up an agency to carry this out.  I urge the Minister to try to prevent the necessity for the kind of scenes I witnessed last Monday morning.  I urge him to try to get the two sides to come together for face-to-face discussions and to bring about a resolution.  That resolution could be easier than he thinks.  This energy is for our people and not for any multinational company. <Col N="111"/> Fintan O&rsquo;Toole made the point last year that the children of Norway will benefit more from our resources in north-west Mayo than our own children.  That is a diabolical state of affairs and the Minister should be prepared to address it.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to set up this agency or at least to give us a commitment that he will bring forward a Bill to do that.  I also urge him to bring forward a review on the licensing terms and not to close his mind to this straight away.  Deputy Cowley and I were at a press conference at 2.00 p.m.  We received a note from the Minister at approximately 3 p.m. stating he had rejected the proposal made by the protestors on behalf of the people of north-west Mayo out of hand.  He should instead have worked to resolve the issue, something that is possible and in which he should play a central role.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment is timely, constructive and workable, taking into account everything to which Deputy Broughan has referred, having regard to recent experience.  I do not wish to create problems for the Minister regarding the situation at Bellanaboy.  Neither do I wish to equate the Corrib gas field with Norway, since such a comparison would be unfair.  However, it would be of great benefit if the Minister could call on an expert agency of the nature described in the amendment for its advice and use independent technology.  I do not ask that they drill test holes but merely that they avail themselves of the most modern technology in assisting the Minister to reach decisions.</P>
        <P>I have said many times before that no area has more myths surrounding it than energy.  Depending on whom one consults, one hears all kinds of versions of where we are going, where we are coming from, and what we must face as we proceed.  In oil exploration generally, we need a policy that is fairly transparent, so that it is seen as sustainable.  The public must be able to see that there is a gain for the State from it.</P>
        <P>It must also be geared to encourage exploration.  There is no sense in our having a regime that will discourage it, since in those circumstances, companies will go to areas such as Norway that have the best strike rate.  They will calculate that they have a one-in-five, one-in-ten or one-in-20 chance if they go to a lucrative area.  In another area, the chances might be one in 50.  Obviously, finances being what they are, a commercial decision will be made.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding all that, with the introduction of more modern technology it may well become possible to identify promising locations more readily than hitherto.  I do not attempt to compare us with Norway, since I know it has massive resources that have not even been tapped.  I am told that given modern, clean-coal technology, it has five to seven times the world&rsquo;s known reserves, a massive energy resource.  We also <Col N="112"/>know they have gas and oil, also converting the latter to the former for very good reasons.</P>
        <P>This is apropos of another discussion we will have later this evening, which we also had last night.  There is a notion in this country that we should increase the price of energy from fuel and oil and that it will then be lucrative for everyone to get on board in development and distribution.  I do not accept that crazy notion at all; we must develop alternatives.  It is absolutely critical that we avail ourselves of what natural resources we have, exploring and exploiting them to the country&rsquo;s benefit to meet energy requirements.</P>
        <P>We must also bear in mind that we are currently very much dependent on overseas energy imports.  Gas is one of the cleaner sources of energy.  There is no question that it is in the national interest to develop the Corrib gas field with the agreement of the various bodies to which Deputy Broughan has referred to ensure the country exploits its natural resources, and is internationally recognised as doing so, in order to benefit its economy.</P>
        <P>If we fail to do that, we do ourselves a disservice and disadvantage ourselves in the international arena.  We have been reasonably successful as an economic entity in recent years, although it is true that we had a long way to go.  Many people say it all happened in the last ten years, but that is not so.  We came a long way and had far to go.  The motion is sufficient to meet the needs that have emerged in the most recent past.  That is no bad thing, since it is not a question of closing the door when the horse has bolted; rather it is a matter of addressing those issues that have arisen.  It goes without saying regarding the Corrib gas field that if one were starting again, one would not do so from here.</P>
        <P>Why not introduce a new element into the equation by doing as Deputy Broughan suggests and setting up the agency with the required expertise?  Ultimately, having done all that, one must recognise that not everyone will always agree on everything.  There will come a time when everyone has to sit down and say they will either sing together or swing together.  International financial agencies will not tolerate nonsense.  I compliment the work of such people as Peter Cassells, who made Trojan efforts to resolve the issues.</P>
        <P>We live in a time when the development of our natural resources is critical.  We are told that prices will rise further, something of which I have no doubt.  However, if I owned a gas field or oil well, I would love to hear about that.  Every time I picked up the newspaper, I would love to read about it.  Every time someone mentioned it, I would love to say the resource was running out and that it would get more expensive in future.  In such circumstances, I would cap it and let it sit there until it got extremely expensive, afterwards sitting back and enjoying the income.</P>
        <P>However, that is not why we are here.  Many people have said that we should become involved in oil exploration directly as a State.  That would <Col N="113"/>be unwise, involving the State in massive losses, since everyone wants to be associated with the gain.  Everyone would love a share if one struck gold, never mind oil.  It would be great, but there would be no great clamour to share in the losses.  We must keep our feet firmly on the ground when it comes to determining how we go about it.  The method suggested in the amendment is as good as any to bring on board independent experts.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the eminence of the expertise, there will always be people who disagree, meaning that someone must ultimately make a decision.  However, I hope that such a decision can be made after investigation of a project so it might fairly be said all the procedures had been followed and everything necessary done.  Ultimately, they should be able to say that they have produced something fair.</P>
        <P>My initial point regarding oil exploration and licensing regimes in general was that there is a need to make exploration attractive enough for people to become involved.  At the same time, it must be transparent enough to ensure the general public is conscious of what is happening and that it accepts its fairness.  Thereafter, let us proceed to do the best we can to explore and exploit our resources for the benefit of this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with everything Deputy Broughan said and I strongly support his proposal.  This matter was debated in the context of a private Members&rsquo; Bill introduced by Independent Members some time ago.  At that time, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, stated that he would conduct a review of the exploration and production terms.  I welcomed that development and I understood the review was to be available by the end of October.  The Minister may clarify the position but, to date, we have received nothing in respect of it.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that the Minister continued to issue exploration licences.  He referred earlier to people saying that our natural resources are being given away.  As far as I am concerned, that is the case and such resources continue to be given away.  It is difficult to understand how the Minister can defend giving opportunities of this nature to people who have already made massive money in this area.  Tony O&rsquo;Reilly, through his exploration company, Providence Resources, has already made a killing.  Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly obtained an option that covers the Dunquin prospect.  Having secured the licence, he sold off 80% of it to Exxon Mobil, one of the biggest companies in the world, in return for a 16% stake, which he retains, and a commitment from it to carry out whatever exploration is necessary.  That deal was worth millions of euro, before any exploratory work had been carried out.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, continues to give away our resources.  Last week, while he was defending another of our natural resources, namely, salmon, he again granted Providence <Col N="114"/>Resources an option in respect of more than 1,500 square miles of the Goban Graben and Goban Spur basin, which are supposed to include very promising geological structures of the type likely to contain oil or gas.  The option is for three years and relates to an area the size of counties Dublin, Meath and Louth combined.  The Minister has effectively given the oil company a lien over the area for that period.  In return, the company has undertaken to carry out a relatively low-cost seismic survey.  It would need to do so in any event because it needs to discover what is there before applying for a full exploration licence.</P>
        <P>It is amazing that the Minister has continued to act in this way, even though the review of the exploration and production terms is imminent and overdue.  I do not understand his behaviour.  He stated earlier that nothing will change until 2007.  I would like him to confirm that he will give nothing else away in the meantime.  We cannot afford to give anything away because we get nothing from such transactions.  We are giving our resources away for free.  The Minister was anxious to encourage the industry earlier today and stated that he was not surprised that there is a keen interest for high-quality exploration opportunities.  Why would there not be an interest when the price of oil has increased to such a degree and when such great opportunities exist?</P>
        <P>The industry has stated that recent assessments relating to opportunities in the Irish sector of the north Atlantic are phenomenal.  Documentation from the industry indicates that while only nine wells were drilled in the past ten years, there have been two major finds at Corrib and Dooish and that it is estimated that there are in excess of 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent in Atlantic Ireland waters.  The Minister commented earlier on the quality of the digital surveys.  Such surveys show that, at $50 or $60 per barrel, 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent would be worth $600 billion.  That is the amount of our natural resources on offer for free.  Where else would one come across such a situation?  What I have just outlined is somewhat different to what the Minister said about the poor opportunities that exist for unfortunate multinational oil companies that are, out of the goodness of their hearts, spending millions drilling off the coast of Ireland.  Such companies do not do anything for nothing.  As one can see from the actions of Providence Resources, they are doing very well for themselves.</P>
        <P>Shell is not prepared to spend a couple of million euro on an offshore platform for the Corrib gas field and it is getting all the gas contained therein for free.  The amount required for such a platform would represent only a small proportion of the massive profits the company would make.  That money would go a long way towards helping the people of Mayo and this country.  Shell cannot really be blamed because it must make a profit and satisfy its shareholders.  As Deputy Broughan indicated in clear terms, the blame lies fairly and <Col N="115"/>squarely on the shoulders of Ray Burke, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and others.</P>
        <P>The people of Rossport are upset that 400 acres of land in their area are being taken over to facilitate the future development of a petrochemical industry.  Deputy Kenny stated that he hopes everything envisaged for that 400 acres happens.  His view is regrettable because, for the sake of 50 permanent jobs, a pristine area will be completely and utterly destroyed.  How can the Minister rationalise that situation, particularly when he considers the massive wealth involved?  As he is aware, the company merely wants to siphon off the natural resources in the area and is establishing a structure to do so.  As Deputy Broughan indicated, the gas and oil contained in the Corrib field could be brought ashore using modern technology.</P>
        <P>The Minister may contradict what I am saying.  However, the documentation from the industry&rsquo;s conference relating to this matter, which is being run in association with the petroleum affairs division of the Department, states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Recent assessments of yet-to-find resource potential based on petroleum systems analysis indicate in excess of 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent for these basins, on a risked reserve basis.  With play-opening discoveries such as Corrib (gas) and Dooish (gas/condensate), these basins show promising potential which can be effectively and efficiently explored using modern technology and evaluation methods.  As such, Atlantic Ireland is one of the few remaining regions in the North Atlantic offering opportunities to explore and develop major hydrocarbon resources.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Words such as &ldquo;frontier&rdquo;, which we associate with the wild west and cowboys, are used in the documentation to which I refer.  There are many cowboys around and the Minister is doing everything in his power to help them.  He is certainly not rounding up the cowboys who are responsible for cashing in on so much of a giveaway.  We owe a great debt to people such as Colm Rapple, who is never slow to comment on these matters.  One rarely reads about such matters in the newspapers because the Department does not make announcements in respect of them.</P>
        <P>I do not understand why the system relating to this matter cannot be open and transparent.  If Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s amendment was accepted, there would be openness and transparency and we would be in a position to know what is happening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Durkan referred to the security of supply and stated that we need the Corrib gas.  I am glad that an announcement was made regarding the supply of gas to Mayo towns because, for the first time, the idea that the pipeline was built to take the Corrib gas away from Mayo &mdash; which was the intention &mdash; has been decoupled.  The pipeline can now be used to distribute gas <Col N="116"/>throughout the county.  Thank God for that.  However, we do not need the Corrib pipeline to bring gas to Mayo because, thanks to the Langeled pipeline &mdash; the longest pipeline of its type in the world &mdash; which runs from Norway, there is an abundance of supply.</P>
        <P>These matters have come to pass as a result of the stance taken by the people of Mayo and me in respect of the Corrib gas pipeline.  We are being presented with trinkets but we want some real benefit from the gas brought ashore from the Corrib field.  In that context, the Minister must bite the bullet and retain as many of our natural resources as possible until such time as we are in a position to exploit them for our benefit.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred earlier to Irish companies.  As Deputy Broughan stated, Grian&aacute;n Energy, even though it submitted a large number of applications, was not granted a licence.  The multinationals obtained licences but Grian&aacute;n Energy, even thought it was prepared to give 10% of its reserves to the State, did not.</P>
        <P>I greatly welcome the fact that my fellow parliamentarians came down to Mayo, which is more than the Minister ever did although I hoped he would.  Deputy Broughan, who is Labour&rsquo;s spokesperson, came to Mayo, as did Deputies Michael D. Higgins and Costello, Deputy Sargent, the Green Party leader and Deputies Joe Higgins, Catherine Murphy and Healy. This was greatly appreciated by the people.  Since people have come to Mayo and seen for themselves there is a new understanding of the situation and I hope that gets through to the Minister.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Broughan stated, the Minister was quick to reject the initiative that was announced.  It was disrespectful of the Minister to reject an independent public commission of inquiry.  What is wrong with adopting a reasonable and sensible way by which the Corrib gas conflict can be resolved?  As everybody states that they have community support, let us test it now.  Why should anyone have anything to fear about this open, transparent and democratic method for determining how the Corrib gas project can be developed?</P>
        <P>The Minister might state again that this has been through the planning process but that was a flawed process.  The pipeline, which determines where the refinery will be, was not put through that process.  This is a 9 km inshore pipeline carrying unrefined gas, which is unique.  If it were coming in from Clew Bay, it would be like locating it in Islandeady, where Deputy Kenny comes from, which would go right past Westport and that would not be acceptable to anybody.  When one thinks about it, it is ludicrous.</P>
        <P>There are issues such as cold-venting which have not been addressed at all.  There has been no consent for this development.  When I went to Norway last year the Norwegians told me this could not possibly happen there because at least there would be community consent.  I do not see <Col N="117"/>why the Minister would not revisit the Shell to Sea proposal and reconsider his stance on it.</P>
        <P>The Minister should state now that he will not give out any more exploration options to multinationals until such time as he has got back the report from Indecon.</P>

We will become the laughing stock of the world and some day there will be a tribunal into how we managed to give away so much for nothing.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will look at this, and particularly revisit the Shell to Sea proposal.  I reiterate how much I appreciate the visit of my parliamentary colleagues to Mayo and I hope that the Minister might follow suit at some stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought Report Stage was to deal directly with the amendments before us.  It gets a bit tiresome listening to the same type of contribution, time and time again.  I was tempted to ignore it all and just address the amendment before us, but seeing as though people have got such latitude it would be remiss of me not to respond to some of the stuff to which I have had to listen for the past 45 minutes.</P>
        <P>I was asked why was I so dismissive of the proposal from Shell to Sea.  It was suggested that within an hour or thereabouts I had responded to the proposal.  Shell to Sea is not too slow at responding quickly and being discourteous to Ministers, mediators, experts in pipeline safety and various other people who put much time and effort into trying to resolve this difficulty over the past 18 months to two years.  I seem to recall that barely before the Atvantica report was published it had been rejected by Shell to Sea.  Within a half an hour of Mr. Peter Cassells &mdash; who spent seven months meeting with, speaking to and listening to people &mdash; producing his report it was dismissed out of hand.  In fact, I suppose it is more accurate to state that before he even produced his report it was dismissed out of hand by spokespersons for Shell to Sea.</P>
        <P>The proposal that Shell to Sea has now made shows quite clearly that it does not accept the Government&rsquo;s authority to legislate.  It does not accept the EPA as an environmental agency.  It does not accept An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the county council as planning authorities, and it does not accept their decisions.  It  will not accept world experts in pipeline safety and would not accept the bona fides of Mr. Cassells, who gave such time to try to resolve this difficulty and who did <Col N="118"/>his best to get Shell to Sea to sit down in the same room with Shell.  The company was willing to do that and Shell to Sea would not do it.  Shell to Sea would not accept his bona fides despite the fact that it agreed to his appointment, accepted him as being neutral and accepted him as somebody who could possibly move this forward.</P>
        <P>When things do not suit Shell to Sea, it changes very quickly.  Now it wants more commissions or bodies to sit down.  It wants work to stop again &mdash; anything to delay, anything to stop.  It does not have a notion of changing from the position it has taken.  I am speaking about Shell to Sea.  I know that residents had concerns and continue to have concerns.  We have done everything we possibly can to meet those and we cannot do anything further in that regard.</P>
        <P>Deputy Cowley quoted me on poor multinationals or insinuating that maybe multinational oil exploration companies are acting out of the goodness of their heart.  I never said that either inside or outside of this House.  Multinational companies are involved in oil exploration to make a profit and because it is their business.  They will try, in so far as they can, to get the best possible deal for themselves.  I am old enough, experienced enough and have been long enough in this business to know that.  I will not be fooled by them if they come in and tell me that they are considering seeking permission to explore for oil or gas off the west coast of Ireland and they are doing it for the good of my health or that of anybody else.  As a Minister, my job is to try to ensure that we get the best possible deal.</P>
        <P>There is much nonsense being spoken.  Listening to some of the contributions, I could not help thinking that it sounded quite like a press release from the central office of somewhere or other.  The phrases being used were quite similar to phrases that I have seen over the weekend in anonymous newspaper articles to which people do not have the courage to put their name.  No doubt we will see it on <i>Phoenix</i> or somewhere else before too long &mdash; the transfer of licences, the possible benefits of licences, and me, as Minister, granting Providence a transfer of a licence.  The licence is not worth a curse unless one discovers something and there is nothing discovered in these cases, of which Deputy Cowley spoke and in the newspaper propaganda of which he has spoken.  All of these mythical profits of companies are not made until there is a discovery and until the gas or oil comes ashore.</P>
        <P>Deputy Cowley spoke of us giving away the entire benefit to the Corrib developers.  They have been in the field for ten years and no gas has been brought on shore yet.  No company that engages in exploration is guaranteed to discover gas or oil.  Taxing the turnover of companies at various rates was mentioned but 25% or 50% or 100% of nothing is still nothing.  Exploration can involve significant expenditure before a discovery is made and, at the end of the day, of 120 wells sunk in Irish waters since 1970, approximately 115 <Col N="119"/>were plugged without generating a return.  There is a 30/1 chance of discovering oil or gas off the west coast.  That is the ratio of success thus far.  If Deputies are seriously suggesting the Government allocate hundreds of millions of euro in my Department&rsquo;s budget to drill wells for oil and gas, my response is &ldquo;No, thank you&rdquo;.  However, if gas is brought ashore from the Corrib or Slyne Head-Erris Head fields and the current optimistic projections about them come to pass, it will be a totally different ball game because we will then know for definite that abundant resources, as has been suggested, are available.  The companies will also know that and that will leave the Government in a strong position to say, as Deputy Broughan outlined, &ldquo;Hang on a second.  We know there is ten trillion cubic feet of gas or oil in the field and we want a cut of this.  We need a greater share&rdquo;.  That is perfectly legitimate, as a number of companies will have benefitted from the current regime but they have taken all risks by engaging in exploration without knowing oil or gas will be discovered.  It is important to bear in mind always that they will not bring oil and gas ashore for nothing.  When gas is brought ashore, a corporation tax rate of 25% will apply.  Based on the figures quoted in newspapers and so on, that will generate approximately &euro;2 billion for the Exchequer at current prices.  We do not give gas and oil away for nothing.</P>
        <P>I refer to Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s political point regarding the behaviour of the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance, former Deputy and Minister, Ray Burke, Deputy Fahey when he was Minister for the Marine and me.  It is strange if this issue was such a scandal and a giveaway, that when his party was in power between 1992 and 1997, it never felt the need to do something about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>We did in 1975.  Does the Minister recall what happened?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State with responsibility for energy policy at the time was a member of the Deputy&rsquo;s party.  It is strange that he did not do something about that because of the so-called scandalous deal done in 1992.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about 1983 and 1987?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It should have been fresh in the minds of Labour Party members when they went into power with Fianna F&aacute;il that this was a terrible scandal and a terrible giveaway with the people being abandoned.  Why did they not do something about it?  The files on the terms for oil and gas exploration were not even opened by the then Minister of State.  It is a poor reflection on Labour Party Members if they thought this was a scandalous deal that they did nothing about it when they had the opportunity.</P><Col N="120"/>
        <P>It would be wise for Members not to believe and slavishly repeat everything they read in the newspaper because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has said nothing about the companies being able to write off the corporation tax due.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>They can write off expenses relating to wells.  If a company discovers gas or oil and brings it ashore, as will happen with the Corrib gas field, the expenses relating to the discovery can be written off with the balance taxed at a rate of 25%.</P>
        <P>Indecon is conducting the review mentioned by the Deputies.  The Department conducted an internal review, which will also form part of the review by the external experts.  I never indicated that it would be finalised by the end of the October.  I hope Indecon will have delivered the report and I will have everything finalised by the end of the year.  It will certainly be made public before the election.</P>
        <P>The amendment calls on the Minister to establish a subsidiary oil exploration agency to facilitate a holistic approach to Ireland&rsquo;s oil and energy security.  It is interesting that Members are arguing out of both sides of their mouth at the same time.  They accuse us of lacking expertise and say we are being kidded up to our eyes by the oil exploration companies because we do not know what is happening.  However, Members would benefit from a briefing session with departmental officials who could explain to them the processes involved in granting exploration and prospecting licences.  One of the conditions of such licences is that companies must share the data and information they gather with the Department and they must commit to provide seismic data to the Department during the exploration phase.  Much of the data is published by the Department after a period and we emphasised the availability of that data at the conference earlier.  Given that the price of oil is currently $60 a barrel, much of the information provided at the conference indicates it will be more profitable to explore in the kind of waters we are discussing.  However, that information is available and it is not the case that we are totally blind to the possibilities and potential involved.  We do not allow companies to get information without sharing it with the Department.  We are not totally dependent on the companies because we use the expertise of the Department and the GSI&rsquo;s experts to check and recheck information.  The Marine Institute can also be helpful in this matter.  People should be aware of these facts because they seem to wrongly believe that we take the small amount of information we get from the companies, but do not have the ability or expertise to check it.</P>
        <P>The Bill concerns the National Oil Reserves Agency, the stockholding of oil and oil reserves.  It ensures that in the event of a catastrophe, we <Col N="121"/>have stocks to prevent the economy grinding to a halt.  NORA will have no expertise in oil exploration and extending the Bill to allow for such is not the way forward.  If we decide to go down that route, it will be done via substantial primary legislation, not an amendment to an irrelevant Bill.  I am surprised the amendment was tabled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The tenor of the Minister&rsquo;s statement suggests that we may take this type of action in four or five years time depending on the information we will then have.  However, it will be too late.  Unless we change the Constitution or the Minister emulates President Vladimir Putin, we cannot change the terms of the licence awarded to Shell and its partners.  The Minister might be compared&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has allowed Members significant latitude.  The issue before the House is the establishment of a subsidiary oil exploration agency.  I ask the Deputy to co-operate with the Chair and keep his comments relevant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Apparently, President Putin is changing the terms and conditions applicable to Shell and Total in the region of the Russian Federation, including the island of Sakhalin.  The famous Shell company is under the spotlight again because President Putin is prepared to change the terms.  Since the mid-1990s, the Yeltsin Government has been regarded as giving away the vital natural resources of the Russian people.  President Putin is prepared to reverse that situation.  The Minister seems to be saying that while he would like to do something similar, he will not do it yet.</P>
        <P>It has been my experience from dealings with the Department, in so far as Departments deal with the Opposition, that there was not much expertise.  Otherwise, why did the Advantica and the Centre for Public Inquiry reports describe such disturbing issues in respect of the transport system for this resource?  If the Department had that expertise, we would have known about that issue beforehand and, as Deputy Cowley stated, we would not still be examining the issue of cold venting.  We would have known in advance that such was part and parcel of a large refinery and needed approval.</P>
        <P>The Bill could include the genesis of an exploration agency in NORA.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s statement that he might&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>In this matter, the Labour Party is prepared to stand on its record.  Our Minister, Mr. Justin Keating, first established a fair and honourable regime in line with international comparisons.  In the mid-1980s, our great party leader, Mr. Dick Spring, continued the regime.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s comment that people in the mid-1990s, including the subsequent Government&rsquo;s Chief Whip, took their eyes off the ball, but most of our party members are determined to have a fair and equitable oil and gas regime.  First and foremost, we need knowledge and information, which is the purpose of this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the GSI.  In recent weeks, I submitted a question on the GSI, but the question was transferred to another Department despite the GSI being under the Minister&rsquo;s aegis.  It is a clear indication of things that go wrong from time to time.</P>
        <P>This is a critical matter.  Modern technology has improved significantly and geological mapping is more forensic than previously.  For example, it would have been unheard of 25 years or 30 years ago to suggest that the types of resources we are discussing were available because there was no evidence to support it.  In the interim, we have progressed to such an extent that we can with a reasonable degree of accuracy identify the location and the nature of the resources, which is beneficial.</P>
        <P>That notwithstanding, as we move further from our shores, we will incur greater expenditure.  That people have shown interest in this level of exploration is welcome, but our nation must come to grips with the situation.  We cannot argue every toss of the coin and second guess everything.  We must establish a common ground.  I support the amendment because it would present the Minister with the opportunity when taking that route&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Accepting the amendment would not be a bad idea, as it would give everyone a fair opportunity, including the Minister, to draw on available expertise and it could solve many problems.  Given that it may be necessary to do so anyway and despite the Minister&rsquo;s statement that the provision must form an integral part of a major Bill, it would be no harm to include it in this Bill.  The production of a subsequent Bill could refer to this section, which could then be amended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister spoke about a 25% tax.  He can correct me if I am wrong, but 20 years is a long period of time in which to write off operational costs.  How long before the Exchequer gets a penny from the Corrib gas field?</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned intransigence, but it was indecent of him to compare the intransigence <Col N="123"/>of people in Rossport to that of Dr. Paisley and Mr. Adams.  The Minister wrote off the Shell to Sea announcement within an hour of its being made and Shell stated that it was impractical to consider anything other than the Bellanaboy site.  Perhaps this is where the problem lies.  The Minister talked about Mr. Peter Cassells and the Advantica report but he must admit the problem lies in the fact that they were not allowed to examine anything other than the pipeline option.</P>

	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this Private Members&rsquo; business motion.  It is traditional to thank the Member who tabled the motion because it gives backbenchers the opportunity to speak on issues of concern to them so I compliment Deputy Durkan and his colleagues in that regard.</P>
        <P>The constant fluctuation in gas and oil prices this year has made this issue one of real concern not only in my constituency of Dublin South West, but throughout the country, so it is opportune to discuss it.  I do not want to pick on Fine Gael because it is having enough trouble without me doing so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I will however make one point about the motion, which is interesting and raises a number of good points.  I am astounded that no reference is made to the issue of energy poverty, particularly as it affects disadvantaged families and senior citizens.  Senior citizens and the people who look after them have made that point to me.  It is not just an issue in Tallaght, but throughout the Dublin region and the country.  I am sure my colleagues taking part in the debate will make the same point.  I expect people to visit my eight <Col N="127"/>weekly clinics with a variety of issues but energy policy and poverty have arisen recently.</P>
        <P>Other colleagues mentioned that we have received a huge number of pre-budget submissions from all sorts of organisations.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has raised energy costs, as have businesses.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and I, along with other colleagues in Dublin South West, have received an excellent pre-budget submission from the South Dublin Chamber of Commerce, which is based in Tallaght business park.  I have read its submission, entitled Securing Our Prosperity, with great interest, as Members would expect.  It questions the ability of business to remain competitive, which is of concern not just in the Dublin region, but in Kerry, Galway and everywhere else.</P>
        <P>The cost of energy becomes more acute as winter approaches, although we are lucky enough to be having a relatively mild winter so far.  As the weather deteriorates in the next couple of months, as I suspect, it will become an even more important issue.  I expect that the issue will not only fall on the desk of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources but on those of other Ministers, particularly Deputy Brennan.  I expect the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to consider the challenges that presents in a special way.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to patronise but I am a fan of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and I congratulate him on his work.  People tell us there are challenges as far as energy costs are concerned and I hope he understands that Members on the Government benches will say so as much as anybody else.</P>
        <P>Other colleagues will be far more technical than I but we are hugely dependent on imported gas &mdash; the primary fuel used in power generation &mdash; from the UK, amounting to over 86% of our national requirement.  The procurement costs of gas have risen by 50% in the past 12 months because of international wholesale prices.  The Minister has acted on these issues by making a commitment to deliver on energy policy priorities, which include investment in energy infrastructure and setting achievable targets for renewable energy sources.</P>
        <P>The publication of the Green Paper on Energy, which will work towards a sustainable energy future for Ireland, is something we should note.  The public bodies which have direct input into this strategy, including the National Competitiveness Council, Forf&aacute;s, IBEC, the ESRI and the enterprise strategy group are taking a particular interest.</P>
        <P>I have just spent a sad three quarters of an hour listening to President George W. Bush&rsquo;s press conference in Washington, in which he took a very benign approach to politics, as happens the day after an election.  He spoke about working with everybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="128"/>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>It was very interesting and distracted me for five or ten minutes.  There is a similar challenge for Fine Gael to participate in an all-party approach to developing energy policies in the future.  We will all have our politics when it comes to certain things and there will always be occasions when party politics dominate, which I am sure will be the case over the next 230 days or so until the general election.  However, on a quiet night in the Chamber such as this, we should understand there will be challenges on which we can all work together and energy policy is one of them.  This issue is of great concern to everybody &mdash; people in business trying to create jobs, people trying to keep their homes warm and people looking after the elderly and disadvantaged.  There are also challenges for our schools and public buildings.  I have not felt cold in the D&aacute;il since I arrived four years ago.  I do not know whom to tell but maybe a little bit of energy could be conserved in the House as well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>On some days there is a bit of hot air but it seems to be warm enough today.</P>
        <P>The issue is of great concern to everybody.  I do not want to sound like a Member sitting on the Labour benches but I come from a bygone Dublin era when, even though young and not aware of energy costs, I was aware of the challenges people had keeping their homes warm.  We must be careful to help people who have problems in that regard.  That is the reason I said earlier &mdash; I noticed the Minister of State noting my comment &mdash; the Minister for Social and Family Affairs should look at that issue.  I expect he will do so.</P>
        <P>It is important to have debates such as this.  I have already complimented Deputy Durkan and his Fine Gael colleagues for raising the issue which provides an opportunity to discuss matters of concern to our communities.  However, I am happy to support the Government amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this energy policy.  No public representative can remain unconcerned about the rate of increase in the price of electricity and gas recently granted by the energy regulator.  The cost of energy is increasingly an issue of significant concern to manufacturing industries here.</P>
        <P>As a minute and isolated energy market, Ireland was never going to enjoy the security and price benefits which economies of scale can provide to countries on mainland Europe that are well connected to the European grid.  Equally, as a market representing 1% of the European electricity market, it is questionable whether the EU directive on liberalisation should have been inter<Col N="129"/>preted by our regulator quite so strictly.  A strong case for derogation could and should have been made.</P>
        <P>While electricity price increases in Ireland were suppressed for many years, recently prices have increased substantially.  Our industrial electricity costs are now the highest in the European Union and are a major threat to competitiveness and, as a joint committee has heard, the survival of many industries.  Furthermore, the rate of increase of Irish electricity costs is unparalleled in the European Union, as may be seen from data produced by the Irish Academy of Engineering, which shows that in the period 1999 to 2005 electricity prices here increased by 50% but declined marginally in the European Union as a whole.</P>
        <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report into the Irish electricity market points specifically to two issues which affect our electricity costs, namely, our fuel mix and the operation costs of ESB generating plants.  We are inordinately dependent on imported oil and gas and therefore subject to the vagaries of geopolitical circumstance.  While international oil and gas prices are currently declining, the long-term price trajectory is upward.  Rather than tinker with short-term solutions, we need a rigorous rehaul of our energy market.  We need to provide long-term solutions which will safeguard industrial competitiveness and ensure a reasonable price for the domestic user.</P>
        <P>The necessity to develop an indigenous supply through the flow of Corrib gas is compelling and a matter of supreme national importance.  As the Deloitte &amp; Touche report points out on page 38, a way to protect against our perilous oil and gas exposure is to ensure the extraction of this valuable resource with all haste.  I pay tribute to the current Minister&rsquo;s handling of this issue and support his unequivocal stand on the Shell to Sea evolving shopping list.  Anyone with an interest in Ireland&rsquo;s sustainable energy future would support the Minister in getting the gas to the market.</P>
        <P>While the rapid increase in prices was attributed to increasing fuel costs, an examination of the ESB&rsquo;s regulatory accounts indicates that other factors are equally significant.  These include the considerable increase in the ESB&rsquo;s operating and maintenance costs over the period 2002-04 from &euro;480 million to &euro;799 million, an increase of almost 70% over two years.  The regulator should have been more vigilant and not allowed these cost increases.</P>
        <P>The other factor contributing to price increases is the rapid increase in profits within the ESB&rsquo;s monopoly business areas, the transmission and distribution of the public electricity supply, from &euro;215 million to &euro;235 million before interest in one calendar year.  As it is now accepted the ESB&rsquo;s monopoly business will not be privatised in the foreseeable future, there is no economic argument for retaining profits at current levels.  Electricity prices could be reduced by up to 10% in the near term if the Minister issued a direction to <Col N="130"/>the CER to regulate these businesses on a not-for-profit basis.  This would have the added advantage of forcing the ESB to address its acknowledged excessively high power station cost base and generate a more appropriate level of profits from the business areas open to competition.  Whether the regulator has been appropriately prudent in permitting the rate of capital investment which he has permitted over recent years is questionable.  The easiest way for the ESB to generate profits is to increase capital investment.</P>
        <P>The two main energy providers, the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, by virtue of the State&rsquo;s historic investment and support, contain key infrastructural assets.  Why have commercial rates of return criteria been applied to these assets?  Would the country and the economy not be better served by the setting of a regulatory model which would ensure the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann are capable of meeting all their third party debt service obligations and that they retain some of the funds for extending electricity and the gas grid where appropriate, thereby avoiding both companies making combined profits in excess of &euro;400 million, part of which is paid back to the Exchequer?  Reducing the rates of return awarded to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and the ESB would not impact on their ability to pay their third party debts or extend the gas grid, but would significantly reduce the cost of energy for industry.  The management of both companies could be accused of operating as utilities in search of privatisation and this has resulted in unnecessarily high prices for consumers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deloitte &amp; Touche report found inefficiencies in operation and maintenance of the ESB generating plant gave rise to costs in the order of &euro;100 million.  These costs relate to availability of the plant, how regularly it can generate electricity and average wage costs.  Inefficiencies at Poolbeg were particularly stark.  There the report found 67% availability and an average wage cost of &euro;122,000.  It is no wonder &euro;100 million could have been saved.  Business as usual cannot continue to apply in our State energy monopolies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  As electricity and gas consumers, we all know the CER has recently made its determinations on ESB and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann end-user prices for 2007.  Regrettably, gas bills have increased by 33.8% since 1 October while ESB bills will increase by 19.7% from 1 January.  Understandably, the energy regulator has received many queries from customers and industry throughout the consultation period on these price increases.  Many wondered whether falling international gas and oil prices would result in an immediate downward revision of ESB and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann proposals for price increases.</P>
        <P>We need to examine the reasons for the slow reaction to the recent downward trend with <Col N="131"/>regard to end-user prices.  In the case of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, almost 70% of the final price of gas is based on the wholesale price on international markets.  Ireland is reliant on the UK for its gas and we import approximately 85% of the gas we use.  Gas suppliers operate by buying their gas forward.  This means they purchase gas now and during the summer for the coming winter based on the projected forward price.  However, they do not take delivery of the gas until the winter.  This policy guarantees delivery of the gas at a certain price, thereby avoiding the volatile spot market where prices could soar on a particular day.</P>
        <P>During the summer and early autumn Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann would have forward purchased 90% to 95% of its gas needs for the winter, leaving only a small purchase element to the spot market.  Therefore reductions in wholesale gas prices which were seen in recent weeks will only affect BGE for a very small amount of its needs.  The ESB generates electricity from gas, oil and coal, all of which must be imported.  The energy regulator has ensured that the ESB carried out a full assessment on the impact of current prices on its estimated fuel cost.  The most recent analysis indicates that 2007 fuel costs, and as a result ESB prices, would not change substantially as a result of falling gas and oil prices.  There would be a decrease of &euro;9 million out of a total bill of &euro;495 million for 2007.  Falling gas and oil prices internationally would only have a marginal impact on the ESB&rsquo;s cost base for 2007.  There are two main reasons for this.  The price of coal has increased compared to the forward price assumed in the 2007 tariffs and now costs almost &euro;71 per tonne.  This increase largely outweighs the benefits of declining oil and gas prices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The remaining outstanding fuel bill of &euro;150 million from 2005 and 2006 must be recovered by the ESB.  This deficit occurred as the price of fuels in each of these years increased beyond expectations.  The ESB was unable to recover the additional cost as the tariff charged to customers was fixed for the full year, therefore a price lag built up.  I understand that the energy regulator intends to fully track market fuel prices and the impact these have on the ESB and BGE cost base throughout the winter.</P>
        <P>The energy regulator has decided to reopen a consultation on fuel price variation mechanisms in electricity tariffs.  These mechanisms allow unit costs in tariffs to change in response to wholesale fuel market trends.  This commitment follows a number of requests by industry consumers and the Oireachtas joint committee to examine fuel price variation.  The commission will consult on this before the end of 2006 with the intention that any such clause would be introduced in spring 2007.</P>
        <P>Negative politics is not my style.  I believe in people working together for the common good.  I absolutely accept the requirement for the Opposition parties to hold the Government to account. <Col N="132"/> However, I would like to see them do it in a more constructive style.  Will the Opposition categorically state that if in government it would reverse these increases?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely it agrees that matters like this should not be subject to political or ministerial intervention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe for one moment that it is legitimate to accuse the Minister of hiding behind the regulator when what the Minister is doing is respecting the independence of the regulator.  The Opposition is trying to have it both ways.  Much damage can be done by this type of talk as was done with the rip-off Ireland campaign.  It is simply not on to say that Ireland is an expensive country without also recognising the huge increase in earnings that has occurred.  It is wrong to pretend that one can easily combine high earnings with low prices.</P>
        <P>People spoke of the decline of manufacturing.  Manufacturing is associated with lower costs and lower wage economies of which Ireland used to be one.  Are people really suggesting that Ireland should reverse its transition to an advanced economy?  If we were still a manufacturing economy the impact of energy price increases during the past three years would have been greater.</P>
        <P>A second substantial structural change in the economy has taken place in recent years.  This has involved a greater relative importance of services which are less energy intensive and a decline in the relative importance of traditional manufacturing sectors which are more energy intensive.  This has reduced our dependence on oil.  For example, oil imports in the late 1970s amounted to approximately 6.5% of GDP &mdash; the equivalent figure in 2004 was approximately 1.25%.  Nonetheless it is important to develop new sources of energy.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on the new Green Paper on energy.  On 1 October 2000 the Government launched a Green Paper entitled Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, setting out policy proposals up to 2020.  It sets ambitious targets for boosting Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy.  It calls for 30% of electricity consumed to come from renewable sources by 2020.  This is an ambitious goal but one that can be reached.</P>
        <P>During the past two years we have doubled the electricity produced from renewable sources and we are on track to have 15% of electricity consumed coming from renewable sources.  The three pillars of our energy policy must be security, sustainability and competitiveness, all of which the Minister is doing his utmost to ensure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to speak on this <Col N="133"/>important issue.  We all realise the volatility in energy prices is a problem through the EU as it is the largest importer and second largest consumer of energy in the world.  Unfortunately, Ireland does not have a substantial indigenous resource like some other countries but depends on gas imported from the UK.  More than 86% of our national requirement has to be imported and this is the major fuel used in power generation.</P>
        <P>As a people we can contribute to using less by ensuring that energy demand is reduced through innovative energy efficiency measures.  It would also help with security of supply and cost competitiveness.  Better use of renewables brings greater diversity.  Greater efficiency means lower demand and less dependence.  Ireland has great potential in producing renewable energy especially by the harnessing of wind, ocean and bio-energy.  That is the challenge.</P>
        <P>The Government has a long-term strategy for biofuels and biomass which will deliver ambitious targets in the next ten to 12 years.  I commend the Minister and the Government on supporting practical actions on the renewable side such as the comprehensive range of grant supports to develop greener homes, commercial bioheat and CHP units.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember that the gas prices that came into force on 1 October 2006 will be fixed for one year, that is, until 30 September 2007.  The Commission for Energy Regulation plans to review prices again during the summer of 2007.  I have little doubt the Minister will ensure this is done.  As in the case of gas, international fuel price is the major cost driver of electricity.  The plant in Ireland is heavily reliant on fossil fuels.  Some 90% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity is generated by fossil fuel plants.  It should be noted that the price of crude oil increased from $10 per barrel to more than $70 per barrel from 1997 to 2006.  Some 70% of the price of electricity is made up of generation costs which are driven by fuel costs.  Gas, oil and coal, all of which have to be imported, are used for generation.  Forward prices for gas in 2007 increased by 40% compared to 2006 and oil prices increased by 36% which led to increased prices to the consumer.  The Government has taken this into consideration especially for long-term social welfare recipients.</P>
        <P>Under the national fuel scheme administered by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, social welfare recipients receive a fuel allowance for 29 weeks of &euro;14 per week and an additional &euro;3.90 for the purchase of smokeless fuel.  The Government recognises the hardship for the elderly in paying for fuel by providing this allowance.  I have little doubt that in the forthcoming budget the Minister will again look favourably on another increase in this payment.  The Minister has given his undivided attention to creating the conditions to keep energy price increases to a minimum, for which he should be commended.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is timely that the high cost of energy is debated in the House given that electricity prices are increasing by approximately 20% and gas prices are increasing by approximately 33%.  It is clear that the scale of the increases will have a major effect on our competitiveness and will have a great unwelcome impact on domestic users.  There is no easy remedy to our difficulties but it is particularly baffling that prices are rising domestically while falling internationally.</P>
        <P>In terms of electricity generation, wind farm owners often encounter difficulties in connecting to the national grid.  What degree of control is possessed by the ESB and is the Minister satisfied the company is not abusing its dominant position or that obstacles are not being put in the way of smaller operators?</P>
        <P Just="Left">This energy debate is being held at a time when important announcements are being made on the provision of natural gas supplies to several towns in east County Galway.  The decision to supply natural gas to the towns of Tuam, Headford, Craughwell and Athenry is welcome because an alternative source of energy offers a competitive advantage.  In welcoming the decision, however, I must also set out the great need for a gas connection to Loughrea, Gort and Portumna.  I understand that the latter towns will be considered by Bord G&aacute;is under a phase two survey, which is welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The speed at which the Minister moved to rubber stamp the price increases sought by ESB and Bord G&aacute;is was staggering, given the snail&rsquo;s pace at which the Government has approached the development of renewable energy.  Over the lifetime of the Government, electricity prices have risen by more than 60%.  In September, an increase of one third in the price of gas was granted, based on the increase in the price of oil.  However, since the summer, oil prices have dropped by approximately $18 per barrel.  Why, then, does the Minister not insist on a commensurate reduction in the price of gas for consumers?  The answer is simple &mdash; the VAT take on fuel has provided a major increase in funds which can be used to try to buy the electorate next year.  The Progressive Democrats, who could give classes to the tail on how to wag the dog, want to make the ESB more attractive for privatisation.  Higher prices mean more profits and a better selling price.</P>
        <P>The real loser is, once again, the ordinary consumer.  The high cost of living in this country will rise even further, with adverse effects on those who already struggle to make ends meet.  The eld<Col N="135"/>erly are expected to survive on a miserly fuel allowance of &euro;14 per week and low income families were already facing huge expenses prior to the latest increases.  The job security of those who work in the manufacturing sector will be further jeopardised by the increased production costs faced by their employers, which will cause companies to move production overseas.</P>
        <P>Given that the price of gas in our nearest neighbour is 25% lower than here, it would make economic sense for many companies to move to even cheaper locations.  The Minister and the Commission for Energy Regulation should be more than mere signatories for price increases in the energy sector.  They should be enforcing proper price structuring and fuel sourcing because, if garages on the side of the road can vary their prices from week to week, there is no reason decreases in costs cannot be passed to consumers on a quarterly basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion and believe the Government is hiding behind the CER on the matter.  We have seen price increases of 25% in oil, 20% in electricity and 34% in gas at a time when energy prices are falling internationally.  It has been claimed that the prices are affected because we are linked to Britain, yet the price of gas is 20% cheaper there and in the North of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Minister is hiding behind the regulator because the Government stands to benefit from a VAT bonanza.  That money should be used to reduce the price of energy.  The miserly fuel allowance of &euro;14 per week for certain categories of social welfare recipients should be increased to at least &euro;25, as recommended by St. Vincent de Paul, and payable over a 12 month period.  This is particularly important for young families, given that 100,000 children live in poverty in this country.</P>

	<P>The price of gas is increasing, while older people die of hyperthermia every winter.  There is no doubt that more will die because of this increase.</P>
        <P>According to surveys conducted by the Department and industry experts, oil and gas supplies worth hundreds of billions of euro are located off our coasts.  When the Corrib gas comes ashore, it will not result in any reductions in the price of energy.  We will pay the same price for that gas as we would for supplies from Russia or elsewhere.  The opening of the longest pipeline in world, the Langeled pipeline from Norway to Britain, will mean that it will no longer be valid to argue that we need security of supply because there is plenty of gas to go around.</P><Col N="136"/>
        <P>While there have been delays in bringing gas ashore, the price of a resource we have sold for a pittance is increasing continually.  The supply of gas to towns in County Mayo, which I welcome, has overturned the argument for bringing Corrib gas ashore because the pipeline which was supposed to bring gas away from County Mayo can now supply the county instead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am supporting this motion on the basis of its rejection of the recent decision to introduce significant increases in gas and electricity prices, I am amazed at the motion&rsquo;s failure to address all the implications of these increases.  From meeting elderly people in my constituency and, in particular, those who live alone, I have become aware that the increases are causing great concern and hardship among older people.  I concur with Deputy Cowley that the increases will ultimately cause deaths.  The recent decision of the CER to grant price increases should be reversed.  The Government should not hide behind the regulator because it is supposed to be running the country.  Coming just as we enter the coldest period of the year, these increases represent cruel psychological, physical and financial blows to elderly people.  This issue should focus our attention on the inadequacy of the fuel allowances and other supports for the elderly.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I attended a meeting of the forum for older people in the Stoneybatter area of the Dublin Central constituency, at which fuel costs were a priority issue.  Many people pointed out that they need fuel allowances throughout the year and not only during the harshest months.  Inadequate though it is, the allowance is cut off too soon, as the elderly will be the first to tell the Government if it is prepared to listen.  The budget submission by the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament calls for the doubling of the current fuel allowance.  I support this demand because of its importance to the well-being of vulnerable older people who are likely to suffer from hyperthermia if left exposed to the cold.</P>
        <P>I am astonished this aspect of gas and electricity price increases did not receive a single mention in the Fine Gael motion.  I am not surprised, however, that the issues of Shell&rsquo;s exploitation and the handover by our Government of our resources is not mentioned.  The protection of the elderly must be our first priority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This motion expresses an essential truth, namely that the Government has been negligent in anticipating the scale of the world energy crisis and has failed to devise policies to deal with its effects.  Most particularly the Government has been negligent given that those who suffer most from these effects are those who have least.  The ultimate responsibility for this indifference rests with a Government that treats environmental issues and issues of energy conservation with a <Col N="137"/>distaste that belies anyone with any proper respect in public life.</P>
        <P>Last weekend at the smugfest that was the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government referred to my party and its supporters as jihadists.  If any people deserve the title of eco-terrorists it is those who have put in place policies that Nero-like seem to ignore that not only is Rome burning but also the planet itself is burning.  Despite this, those most in need of heat and sustenance are those with least.  For three years the Government failed to increase the social welfare fuel allowance and has a policy that believes the need for fuel allowances exists only in certain months rather than on a full-year basis.  The Government has failed to introduce energy policies as has been done in Denmark which now provides 25% of its energy needs through wind power, while we are scrambling to reach 3%.  The Government is full of incompetence and indifference.  The people will suffer for that distaste for introducing proper policies.</P>
        <P>It has produced 90,000 housing units in a year, practically none of which has any proper energy efficiency standards.  The attitude seems to be to build them quick and get them up fast with no one caring what kind of standards people live in.  Those who suffer most, the elderly, must not only live in houses that are badly insulated, but because of their income they must resort to buying the cheapest and least efficient fuels that have the most damaging environmental consequences.  Yet the Government does nothing.  Like Deputy Gregory, I am disappointed the motion does not go further.  I appreciate it gives a platform for a wider debate, which is needed.  It needs more than just three hours of Private Members&rsquo; time in a given week.  This is the essential international political issue that anyone in public life must seek to address in the next decade and beyond.</P>
        <P>If we are serious about meeting the energy needs of current and future generations we must do so in a fair and just way.  Currently this policy is determined by people outside our country who run multinational corporations and by nations whose interests are in the fossil fuel industry.  If we, as an island nation that is 90% dependent on imported fuel for energy needs, are serious about breaking away from the shackles from which we can break away and starting to become somewhat self-sufficient in meeting our energy needs, we need a Government to introduce policies to address these needs.  We need a Government that does not play along with the type of indifference we see.  We certainly need Ministers unlike the Ministers for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who seem to believe the best form of policy formation is to attack other people in political life who do not make the political decisions or allocate the resources and are not responsible for the mess of our energy <Col N="138"/>policy or the suffering of too many of our citizens who live in fuel poverty.</P>

	<P>The reference in the Fine Gael motion to the need for review of the regulatory arrangements is appropriate given the reduction in global prices at a time when large increases in domestic charges have been approved.  As I said at the time the approval of increases of more than one third in the price of gas and 20% in electricity will have a huge detrimental effect on many low-income householders.</P>
        <P>The generally accepted measure for fuel poverty is any household that needs to spend more than 10% on heating its home.  With the latest increases the number of people falling into that category will increase significantly.  The average annual household gas bill before the latest increase was &euro;1,260, which will rise to almost &euro;1,700.  Likewise the average electricity bill will increase from &euro;740 to &euro;890.  Any household using both will have an overall bill of &euro;2,590.  Any household with a disposable income of less than &euro;26,000 per year will technically experience fuel poverty.  That is a frightening statistic when one considers that the pre-tax average industrial wage is only approximately &euro;5,000 more.</P>
        <P>A 2001 survey showed that more than 17%, almost 230,000 households, were experiencing some form of fuel poverty, which is considerably higher than comparative figures from other EU states.  Given the large increase in prices since 2001, that figure will now be considerably higher.  The survey also found that particular people were most vulnerable, including single people, a large proportion of whom are elderly.  It is a catch-22 situation as elderly people and social welfare recipients are not only in receipt of incomes that make meeting energy costs difficult, but are also more housebound and therefore need to use extra heating systems to live.</P>
        <P>Another group significantly affected are single parents with young dependent children.  That such families spend much time at home is a major contributory factor.  Ireland has significant variations in seasonal mortality, indicating a strong probability that many of those who die in the cold seasons do so because they do not keep themselves sufficiently warm.  They do not keep themselves warm because they cannot afford to do so.</P>
        <P>Another aspect of fuel poverty examined in the survey to which I refer and given prominence in a newspaper by John Healy and Peter Clinch from UCD was energy efficiency.  The homes of lower-income families tend to be less well insulated and thus it costs more to keep them warm due to considerable energy loss or inefficiency.  This could be tackled by altering the current grant structure for the installation of energy efficient and renewable energy systems into homes.  Currently a relatively small number of people take up, for example, the greener homes grant.  In my county, fewer than 600 people have been offered grants so far this year.  The figure for the whole State is <Col N="139"/>fewer than 7,000.  To a large extent this is because even with the grant considerable cost is involved in installing the necessary equipment.</P>
        <P>Currently approximately 270,000 people receive fuel allowance at a cost of &euro;125 million.  That figure is close to the number of households living in fuel poverty in 2001.  Given the link between fuel poverty and energy efficiency, would it not make sense to make everybody in receipt of fuel allowance also eligible for a full grant to improve insulation if they wish to take part in the greener home system?  While the cost would certainly be significant, it might well turn out to be cost effective and would reduce overall energy bills, reduce the consequences and hence the burden on the health service of correlated illnesses and make significant contributions to improving our position regarding renewable sources of energy and reducing energy waste.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this very important issue which affects the whole country and especially my area and that of the Minister who came here last night to shout down everything we tried to say in good faith.  We have many businesses in County Meath and throughout the country that are really suffering from the cost of energy.  They cannot take it anymore.  They have been highlighting the issue for a number of years, but nobody is listening.  The Minister has allowed the regulator to approve an increase and it is getting worse as the years go on.  The country cannot afford these increases, which will put people out of business.  Business people write to us every day telling us that if these energy costs continue they will not be able to compete on the European market, which will result in job losses at companies like Wellman International in Cavan, Tara Mines and Kepak.  These businesses are under pressure.  They employ our friends, relatives and the people we represent.  There is no point in saying it is big business looking for more profits.  It is not about profits.  They are looking to survive and they need the Government to protect them against high costs, especially high energy costs.</P>
        <P>Ireland has the highest energy costs in Europe.  We have the highest wage and insurance costs, hidden taxes such as local authority charges and so on.  We are being ripped off across the board and it is leaving our industries in an uncompetitive position.  That cannot continue and jobs will be lost.  Many companies are being asked by their parent companies abroad the reason they are still in Ireland when they cannot afford to remain there.  The increase in energy costs for one of the companies I mentioned earlier will be &euro;1 million this year.  That is a massive increase for any company to take.  To deal with some of the prices, energy costs are 20% higher in Ireland than anywhere in Europe.  Gas prices are up 50% since 2003.  Electricity prices are up 30% and diesel oil is up 40%.  The Minister said last night that we <Col N="140"/>are the ones preaching doom and gloom, but that is not the case.  It is the businesses which are crying out for help.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The regulator gave his reasons for the increases in energy costs.  The Minister said he cannot interfere in that but we must examine some facts.  The forecast price for gas next year is 45.82 cent per therm as of 6 November.  That is 11% lower than the forecast for 2006, a year ago.  We are entitled to expect that the regulatory regime here is such that the 11% reduction in the cost of gas is reflected in prices charged next year to Irish customers for both gas and electricity, but that will not happen because there will not be a review until September next year.  The Minister mentioned last night that there is hope of a mid-term review early next year &mdash; it is a little like the mid-term elections in America &mdash; but he cannot guarantee that will take place.  The Minister has the power to make the regulator act now on prices.  His contribution last night was all about the future.  The future is important but we are in trouble now as regards energy costs and action must be taken now.</P>
        <P>When the regulator released his papers on fuel costs variation and the ESB tariff increases, he cited increases in gas and oil prices as the key drivers behind the increases.  Correctly, coal did not get a mention.  The fuel cost variation he proposed was to be based on gas price movements only.  In light of that, he cannot now claim an increase in coal prices as the reason for refusing to moderate next year&rsquo;s electricity tariffs.  Coal fired generation in Ireland accounts for only 15% to 17% of total generation.  Gas accounts for approximately 50% to 55%, with oil at approximately 20%.  At the end of July, when the regulator was determining the gas costs assumption to use in setting next year&rsquo;s power changes, the future price of coal as quoted on the intercontinental exchange for December 2006 and January 2007 were $72.65 and $72.60 per tonne, respectively.  They are now lower, not higher, as the regulator claims.  On 3 November, these contracts settled at $68.50 per tonne.</P>
        <P>It is possible that the regulator is comparing apples with oranges.  Whether that is deliberate, cunning or merely disingenuous, it is misleading and is not helpful to industry.</P>
        <P>The regulator&rsquo;s claim that next year&rsquo;s increase is justified by &euro;151 million under-recovery on fuel costs for 2005 and 2006 is not substantiated and is probably false.  The Minister has a duty to explain that to us because he has a say with the regulator.  He can act this year and next year to ease the pain on our employers, the people we need to give employment in this country, and those who are paying rates through county councils.</P>
        <P>To lecture us and say it is not our job to raise doom and gloom issues is wrong.  It is our job.  We are being asked to do it and it is vital that we do so if our communities are to continue with their current employment levels.  It is not good enough <Col N="141"/>to talk about what we will do in 2012 and 2020, having been ten years in government.  We are constantly being told what the Government intends to do.  I read the Minister&rsquo;s speech last night word for word and one would think he was not in government yet but that he was only about to start the job tomorrow.</P>
        <P>Employers explain the problem to their employees, and employees now realise who is responsible for mucking up this issue.  I will know who to blame if we lose jobs, and employers will know who to blame.  It is on record.  The facts are there for all to see.  The costs are too high.  We must reduce them and we can do so.  The questions I have raised, and others I have not had time to raise, must be put to the regulator.  Questions are not being answered and information is not correct.  It is possible to reduce these tariffs.  It is not acceptable that the price of energy is set once a year.  There must be an opportunity for that to be reviewed and changed on a bimonthly or six monthly basis.  An attempt at a review in 2007 is not good enough.  People are trying to survive.  They have businesses to run.  They need to plan ahead but what will happen is an even greater exodus from this country by people looking for jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy English that the recent energy price increases are a national scandal.  I have called for the resignation of the regulator and I do so again tonight.  What does he regulate?  Does the regulator understand how people in this country have to live?  Does he hide behind the name of the regulator?  Does he have any understanding of the way businesses must operate and how people have to try to make a living in this country?</P>
        <P>When the regulator discovered that the price of oil in particular had come down, why was he not able to say that, while he had to increase the prices because the price of oil increased, he would now reduce them?  We are now told he will have to review the position some time next year.  If he has the power to put up prices, he should have the power to reduce them.</P>
        <P>We are facing winter and people are faced with massive energy price hikes.  People will not be able to heat their homes.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, told the poor people of this country that he would do something for them.  He announced the increases that would come into effect from last year&rsquo;s budget.  I hope that in the budget in December the super rich will not be looked after again and that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs will announce generous increases for people to cover the cost of fuel.</P>
        <P>The fuel scheme operates for 29 weeks of the year.  It was increased from 26 weeks but the allowance is not available throughout the year.  It runs from October to April but not between April and October.  Does the Government not know we have bad weather in this country most <Col N="142"/>of the time?  People need to have a fire going in their homes all the time.</P>
        <P>It is a disgrace that the regulator did not see fit to protect the poorest in society.  It is the first time since I came into politics that I have been contacted by business people, employers and people involved in industry who told me they will no longer be able to compete here, that their jobs are at risk because of these recent increases.</P>
        <P>We increased prices for the ESB.  The ESB, like many more companies in this country, has a box in Croke Park &mdash; I do know if the Minister of State ever attended one &mdash; which it can fill without difficulty.  It can wine, dine and look after the rich, yet when it has to make a cut-back it runs to the regulator and the regulator crucifies the small, the weak and the sick with fuel increases.  That is a disgrace.</P>
        <P>I could not speak tonight without mentioning the announcement made last week on gas.  I welcome the fact that towns in my county got the connection, but to me it is the greatest scandal.  If Guinness was produced in Dublin and sold throughout the world but was not available in Dublin, there would be an outcry.  We have a situation where gas will be piped out of Erris, will pass Belmullet and continue to Crossmolina, yet the people of Erris, from where the gas will be piped, will not be connected to the pipeline.  They could not connect Ballinrobe, Swinford or Kiltimagh, but a few constituencies in Galway represented by Ministers were able to get it.  It will go to the midlands in Tullamore.  It was economical to connect it there but it was not viable to supply the county from where the gas was being piped.</P>
        <P>It is time the Government woke up.  The people of this country have had enough.  I want to see that decision by the Minister reversed.  I want the gas to be supplied to Belmullet and proper infrastructure in terms of roads, sewerage and water schemes provided in Erris, particularly now that natural gas from there will supply 80% of our economic needs for many years to come.  I am sure with the gas there will be oil and it would be wrong to steal that natural resource from Erris.  All the people of Erris will get is trouble.  They have to take the risks and it would be a disgrace if the people of Erris did not gain from that.  I call on the Government to rethink that decision immediately.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The regulator sees fit to protect the ESB regarding charges.  For many years taxpayers paid for the infrastructure of the ESB so it could get up and running.  When one receives one&rsquo;s electricity bill every month and sees all the listed charges, one notes that the actual electricity charge is not too bad.  It is all the extra charges that cause trouble.  The Government is cleaning up on VAT and we have to pay some old surcharge and another to be connected to the network.</P>
        <P>When a poor person in a rural area wants to get an ESB pole moved from his land because it <Col N="143"/>is obstructing him, the ESB quotes a price for its removal off the top of its head.  It could amount to &euro;25,000, &euro;16,000 or &euro;7,000.  Who put the infrastructure in place only the hard-working taxpayer?  Why should the ESB be allowed to behave in this way?</P>
        <P>The regulator should not always be heeding big business.  We were told there would be competition in our market, lower electricity costs and that the consumer would be protected.  However, the consumer is not being protected.  He is being ripped off.  There will be many job losses over the coming months owing to the recent increases and they represent a step too far for industry and the employers.  People must be protected.</P>
        <P>An hour or two ago in my constituency there was a major accident resulting in the death of three young people.  I offer my sympathy to their families.  The deaths are bad news for the families and the coming days will be a tragic time in Ballinrobe and the county.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Deputy Durkan on tabling this motion.  Much has been said over the past two nights about the future of energy prices.  To put it simplistically, there are certain things in this country that we cannot change, such as the fact that we do not and will never have oil wells.  We must all accept this.  It is awfully hard to bring in the bit of gas we have.  I do not blame the Government for what we cannot change, and nobody else is doing so.  This is not where the problem lies.</P>
        <P>Given the great increase in the use of oil for industry and transport throughout the world, we know the oil wells cannot keep pumping forever.  I have no idea when the oil will run out &mdash; every expert has his own view &mdash; but we know Ireland has many resources that many countries would give their left hand for.  Until very recently, there was hardly a word about them.  I have not time to discuss them in detail because I want to deal with a more central issue.  Suffice it to say, simplistically, that we did not tackle wind or wave energy to any great degree and we certainly failed to encourage the growth of any crop that might produce oil.  I have seen crops used for this purpose 20 years ago and there is nothing new about doing so.  The economics of growing them can be difficult under certain circumstances, but we must ensure we use our available natural resources to create energy or fuel.  This is a broad-brush approach.</P>
        <P>Let me discuss the factors within our remit.  This subject follows on what Deputy English and others have been speaking about.  I may not be an expert on the world oil market and I am not sure many are, because they all seem to get it wrong on occasion.  When the regulator made its decision, or slightly before it did so, I was foolish enough to believe it assumed the price would plateau at approximately $70 to $80 per barrel.  I believed its decision was predicated on this <Col N="144"/>assumption and could not see any other reason for the remarkable increase in fuel prices.  When the regulator&rsquo;s office was established, I genuinely believed it would be very independent, and I have no reason to believe otherwise, but I believe it was assumed at the time of establishment that there would be a steady increase in oil prices, as we were used to over the years.  This did not happen.</P>
        <P>The whole country held its collective breath on the morning the decision was made.  The issue was well flagged before the regulator announced it.  When the 20% increase in the price of electricity for domestic consumers, the increase in the price for commercial consumers and the 34% increase in the price of gas were announced, I remember saying to myself the country was in for a terrible time.  It is very difficult to sustain such increases.  Naturally, on hearing the decision, I examined the increases in other countries.  We are a good bit ahead of them at this stage and that is where the problem lies.  This is where our anti-competitive aspect kicks in.  It would be acceptable if every other country were subject to similar increases because we must compete with them on the foreign market, but they have not had such increases.  If we had no control over this, I would have nothing to say about the matter because I am as realistic as the next person.  One must pay the commercial rate that obtains in the rest of the world.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, on Tuesday, 7 November at 3.15 p.m., I saw fit to check the Internet for the price of Brent crude oil in dollars per barrel.  I assume the figure I obtained, namely, $55.21 per barrel, is as official as one can get.  This is a base price and prices all over the world are relative to it, although there are some jigs and reels to be danced around it.  If it was $75 per barrel, there would be a different reaction all over the world.</P>
        <P>I had always understood that when dramatic changes took place in the energy market, the regulator was entitled to reconsider existing prices.  The Government might argue, as it does in respect of the HSE and other bodies, that it has nothing to do with the decisions of the regulator, but this is not acceptable.  Energy prices comprise a vital national issue and no other issue will take centre stage in the next ten years.  Energy prices are central to our competitiveness and if we do not get them right we will be in serious trouble.</P>
        <P>I met a lady yesterday who received a bill of &euro;60 from the gas company.  Admittedly, it was not a very large bill.  When she examined it, she noticed that &euro;48 of the &euro;60 was accounted for by VAT and other charges.  She used just &euro;12 of gas, but she was charged &euro;60.  We cannot continue to fleece the people of Ireland in such a manner.</P>

	<P>It is as if volatility in energy prices is occurring on the island of Ireland and nowhere else in Europe.  We should examine the facts.  Gas is an internationally traded commodity.  Ireland is essentially a price taker.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann imports over 86% of the gas used in this country, the cost of which has increased by approximately 50% in the last year.  International fuel prices are the major drivers of the cost of electricity, just as they are in the case of gas.  Some 90% of our electricity is generated by fossil fuel plants.  The price of oil increased from $10 per barrel to over <Col N="146"/>$70 per barrel between 1997 and 2005.  The increase in gas tariffs is not unique to Ireland.  Some of the largest gas suppliers in the UK have faced price increases ranging from 24.4% to 34.6% in 2006.  As I speak, gas is 7% more expensive in the North than it is here.  The price of gas has increased by 74% in Northern Ireland since September 2005.  The price of gas here has increased by 67% in the same time.</P>
        <P>Electricity is currently 8% more expensive in the North than it is here.  Last April, there was an increase of 10.8% in the price of electricity in the North.  Almost 70% of the price of electricity is accounted for by generation costs.  With the exception of some peat, all fuels are imported.  A programme of investment in improvements in the electricity network is under way, at a cost of &euro;2.8 billion, and will last until 2010.  Does the Opposition want a Third World network for a First World economy?</P>

	<P>A reduced rate applies to electricity and all forms of heating fuels.  This rate is well below the rates applied to such products in the vast majority of EU member states.  VAT is reclaimable for business.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about pensioners and those on fixed incomes.  That this is a caring Government is underlined by the generous level of support it has made available, in the form of social welfare payments, in the various budgets over its lifetime.  The ESB and Bord G&aacute;is have schemes in place to help vulnerable customers.  The service will not be withdrawn if an agreed payment plan is in place.  Under the national fuel scheme, various fuel allowances are available to welfare recipients and concessions are available to pensioners.  A generous grant aid scheme of up to &euro;27 million is available for domestic renewable heat technologies and Sustainable Energy Ireland&rsquo;s low-income housing programme to improve the energy efficiency and comfort of homes occupied by low-income households.  Funding is also available for forms of energy efficiency including attic insulation, draught-proofing, hot water cylinders and cavity wall insulation.</P>
        <P>I commend the amendment to the motion to the House on behalf of the Government, which is pursuing the development of a dynamic energy policy, in contrast to the Opposition, which is bereft of ideas about how to cope with volatile international energy markets.</P>

	<P>I await with interest further details of the commitment given by Deputy Durkan tonight.

	<P>I thank all the Members who contributed to this debate.  I tabled this motion to try to get answers to two vital questions.  Was the Government awake to what was happening on the international markets?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>We are always awake.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the Government prepared to pass on the benefits of what was happening on the international markets to consumers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to both questions is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the interesting part of it.  All the evidence suggests that the Government is impervious to the needs of consumers, including householders, factory owners and shopkeepers.  Every house, factory and office in this country is affected by energy prices in one way or another.  Employment is affected by energy prices.  Even though many jobs have been lost from this country to more competitive parts of the world in recent years, the Government has remained inactive.  Its representatives have muttered and mooched around the subject of the impartiality and independence of the regulator, which is amazing.  It seems that the regulator is now sacrosanct and the Government is no longer effective or active.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

In 2002, it took &euro;39.7 million from the ESB and stuck it in its pocket.  It hammered the ESB with that particular burden.</P>

	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;I assure the House that industry and the consumer will have a huge bill to pay as a result of what the Government is doing.  The Government wants to drive up energy prices, bring in more money in VAT, levies and dividends from the ESB and walk away.  However, the electorate may yet have something to say about that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister decried the fact that Fine Gael did not want to become involved in an all-party consensus on energy.  If we had any doubt about what he had in mind, we know now.  We were not foolish enough to become part of an all-party consensus on high energy prices.  We do not wish to hound the housewife and the industrialist, or to beat them over the head with an all-party consensus.  It was the greatest con job of all time.  The Government had it well planned in advance and it must have had the think tanks working overtime.  Condensation must have been pouring out of the heads of Government Deputies by the time they came up with that particular consensus.  They should be ashamed of it because it does not do justice to their cleverness at all.  They should have come up with something much more subtle than that.  If they had been given time, they would have done so.  They should be given time on the Opposition benches.  They could examine their consciences and ask themselves a few serious questions about what they had in mind.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael produced an energy policy independently long before the Government had the guts to do it.  We costed it and priced it, but the Government did not intend to do that because it was afraid to do so.  It was afraid to produce a White Paper so it came up with a different Green Paper, because Government Deputies did not have the guts to go to the public and state their case.</P>
        <P>They spoke about security of supply, but I know what they are up to.  If energy prices are driven up enough, everybody will say that soon there will be no energy and that if we do not pay more for it we will not be allowed to breathe.</P>

        <P>There is only one way to have a proper competitive energy policy in this country that would be of benefit to the economy.  We must invest in the alternative energy area to such an extent that it is grown quickly.  The Government promised to do it and it is a wonder we have not been told <Col N="152"/>it will be done before the next general election, because there is no chance of that now.</P>

	<P>The Government is part and parcel of a litany of failures, such as failure to recognise, failure to hear the words of the people, failure to respond to the needs of the people and failure to take action when it could and should.  We all know that the Minister can influence the regulator and that the regulator consulted with the Minister before he acted.  He did not do that on his own; he got full approval.  We have listened to Government backbenchers telling us why it was important to have high energy prices.  They should tell that to the housewives and investors in this country.</P>

Either the Minister instructed and the regulator told him to clear off, or the Minister failed to instruct and the regulator rang him up and asked the Minister for his instructions and then claimed he was independent.  As long as the Minister remained silent, the regulator could do what he had to do.  This is a burden on the taxpayer, the consumer and on industry and it is a failure on the Minister&rsquo;s part.</P>

He failed to reduce the threat to industry and jobs because he did not address them.  The Government, with the full approval of the Minister, has given backing to ripping off the Irish consumer, industry and the economy.  It has done so willfully in the run-up to a general election in a disgraceful way for which it should be thoroughly ashamed.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate on this Fine Gael motion, which has called for a review of the regulatory arrangements that apply to the cost of energy and <Col N="153"/>to the huge price increases in gas and electricity, and which seeks to allow the Oireachtas to call on the regulator to initiate a review at any time that the Oireachtas so decides.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Householders and consumers who are affected by the man who comes down the chimney at Christmas time can now expect to find some other things dropping through the letter box, such as increased ESB and gas bills.  This is now a high-cost country and it is becoming increasingly uncompetitive for big manufacturers that use a lot of energy.  Last week I highlighted a case involving a major employer, with 1,000 employees, whose ESB bill will rise by &euro;800,000 in the next 12 months.  At the same time, that company was able to sign an agreement for oil for the next 12 months at 22% below the cost price of six weeks ago, as these things are predicated by the world market.  A major multinational company cannot pass on that increase to its customers.  If this continues, American business will deal with that by walking away.  When one considers that industry in Malaysia or Indonesia can employ ten times the number of workers in Ireland for the equivalent of the same wages, then energy cost increases spell out a very serious challenge for the Government.  It creates great difficulty for manufacturers and employers.</P>
        <P>Everyone obviously knows that energy issues and the green agenda have become mainstream, and one wonders whether the Democratic victory in the congressional elections will force a re-examination of US attitudes to the Kyoto Protocol.  It remains to be seen what will happen regarding Japanese, Chinese and Far Eastern problems.  However, to put it in an Irish context, there are the double pipeline coming in on the east coast, Kinsale Head feeding in on the south <Col N="154"/>coast and another pipeline to come in from the Corrib field, which I hope can be harvested in accordance with the highest standards of safety, integrity and environmental care, with no disregard for human life.  There is also a company that wishes to build a liquid natural gas facility in the mid-west, something that may happen within the next ten to 15 years.</P>
        <P>That gives this country energy options, but the regulatory regime to which Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s motion refers requires far more transparency and a greater flow of information so that small and medium-sized enterprises, larger businesses and consumers can understand what fluctuations in world oil and gas prices we face.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, will be aware, liquid natural gas facilities have now created what one might term &ldquo;mobile pipelines&rdquo;, in that carriers can now transport frozen liquefied gas all over the world.  In that sense, other countries have moved far ahead of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Speaker after speaker highlighted the severity of increased gas and electricity charges, which will place a great burden on households this winter and for the coming session.  What the motion in Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s name calls for is very clear.  As an interim measure, we must provide that the Oireachtas compel the regulator to instigate a review of prices at an appropriate time, if that be deemed necessary, and a full review of regulatory regimes.  That is in the country&rsquo;s interest, since as surely as the Minister has responsibility for the matter, the industries that I mentioned are extremely concerned at their bottom line, which is being put under serious pressure by such massive increases in gas and electricity prices at a time when it is available much more cheaply or even given away in other parts of the world.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I was originally contacted by Darryl Kenny&rsquo;s mother last February because she had been seeking occupational therapy for her son since August 2005.  Darryl commenced primary school in September 2005.  His mother had requested occupational therapy services, which was supported by Darryl&rsquo;s resource teacher.  Darryl suffers from dyspraxia with sensory integration disorder.  As a result he <Col N="158"/>has difficulty gripping a pencil correctly and this has impeded his progress in writing.  Unfortunately, as Darryl progressed through junior infants, it became apparent that without the necessary occupational therapy sessions, his writing would not have progressed enough to proceed to senior infants.  In September 2006, more than a year since the original request for occupational therapy services had been made, Darryl commenced his second year in junior infants.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>His parents were so frustrated by their inability to access this service for their son that they felt obliged to see a private consultant with a view to an assessment of Darryl&rsquo;s needs.  This is evidence of yet another failure in our health care system where long delays force concerned, taxpaying families out of the public health service, which their taxes are funding.  The consultant&rsquo;s report recommends two sessions per week with an occu<Col N="159"/>pational therapist for Darryl.  His very concerned mother has been in almost weekly contact with the senior occupational therapist in the district since receiving the recommendation that Darryl should have two sessions per week.  Unfortunately, she recently received an e-mail from the senior occupational therapist, which stated that in this, the last quarter of 2006, they are only working on the 2003-04 list.  Let us assume they are working on the last quarter of 2003 or even the first quarter of 2004, they are approximately three years behind schedule, which is an incredibly long time for a child in junior infants to wait for occupational therapy services.</P>
        <P>Anecdotally, I am led to believe from other sources that no occupational therapist is in place to cover that part of County Wexford.  In 2006, it is unacceptable that so many children as well as other members of the community should not have access to occupational therapy services in a timely manner.  Unfortunately, yet again, this is an example of how the most vulnerable in society &mdash; children and the elderly &mdash; are losing out through the lack of occupational therapy services.  Does the Minister for Health and Children believe it is acceptable for a child in junior infants to have to wait three years for vital occupational therapy services?  Does the Government understand the upset and frustration that a lack of services causes to children and their parents?  Every parent wants to ensure his or her child receives all he or she needs to reach his or her full potential in life and every child needs to know from an early age that his or her needs are important, that they have the same potential as their classmates and that they will succeed.</P>
        <P>The Minister has held this portfolio for more than two years.  Is she aware of these extraordinarily lengthy waiting times?  I hope she does not find them acceptable.  What steps has the Minister taken to deal with the problem?  By this, I mean practical initiatives and increased funding rather than reviews by the HSE.  Has there been a targeted recruitment drive to employ more occupational therapists?  From discussing the matter with colleagues, this is a serious issue across the country, not just in County Wexford.  Is a specific plan to reduce waiting times in place?  What is the target waiting time for occupational therapy in County Wexford and how soon is the achievement of that target anticipated?  When can Darryl and his parents look forward to receiving the two occupational therapy sessions per week he desperately needs?  He must avail of the service as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will outline to the House the position regarding the provision of occupational therapy services and additional funding provided for services for children and <Col N="160"/>adults with a disability in 2006.  I thank Deputy Kehoe for raising this matter on the Adjournment and I am making the reply on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>The question of providing therapy services is a matter for the Health Service Executive in accordance with its functions under the Health Act 2004.  The executive has advised the Minister that in regard to occupational therapy in the Wexford region, there are two approved posts for senior paediatric occupational therapists.  One post has been filled and that therapist concentrates on early intervention services.  In the past year, Wexford Community Services has experienced difficulties in appointing a second occupational therapist due to a shortage of skilled staff at national level.  The Minister is pleased that she has been informed by the HSE in Wexford that it has secured the services of a suitably qualified therapist, who was appointed in mid-August.  The appointment of a second therapist will, in time, alleviate the waiting list pressure that has built up for this service.</P>
        <P>Three new occupational therapy courses commenced in the 2003-04 academic year in University College Cork, the National University of Ireland, Galway, and the University of Limerick.  In total, these courses provide an additional 75 training places.  This expansion in training numbers has been identified in the Peter Bacon and Associates report commissioned by the Department, entitled Current and Future Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists<i>, </i>as being sufficient to meet the long-term requirements for occupational therapists.  Therapists currently qualifying from these courses will address staff shortages.</P>
        <P>The Minister would like to take this opportunity to highlight the 2006-09 multi-annual investment programme for people with disabilities, which is part of the national disability strategy being implemented by the Government.  Additional funding of &euro;51.5 million has been provided by the Government in 2006 to develop services for persons with intellectual disabilities.  Further substantial funding of &euro;22.5 million is also being provided in 2006 to enhance the multi-disciplinary support services for children and adults with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities and those with autism.  The funding will also help to address core underfunding and staffing issues in services for people with disabilities provided by the voluntary sector.</P>
        <P>Capital funding amounting to &euro;45 million has been provided also in 2006 to develop the buildings and facilities for the new services.  The extent of this extra funding, a total of &euro;119 million this year alone, is clearly a strong illustration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to improve our disability services nationwide.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the matter of a painful situation for a 63 year old man, Brendan, and his wife Karen.  In January, Brendan was diagnosed with liver cancer and had two thirds of his liver removed.  Prior to that, he and his wife worked stacking shelves in two supermarkets in Tralee.  Their combined income put them above the qualifying amount for a medical card so they needed to take out medical insurance.  In this instance, that was unfortunate for them.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>Having two thirds of his liver removed necessitated ten weeks as a patient in St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital in Dublin.  His wife took leave and stayed with him in Dublin while he received chemotherapy.  Until two months ago, he underwent 14 chemotherapy sessions during 28 weeks.  Every two weeks, he and his wife travelled from Tralee to Dublin.  Their financial situation was desperate and they got tremendous help from the area&rsquo;s community welfare officer, who provided Brendan with a medical card to help with some of the expenses.  All their savings were exhausted a month ago and they have effectively been left destitute.</P>
        <P>Brendan asked Kerry General Hospital whether it could possibly provide him and his family with a subsidy for their travel allowances.  It would have amounted to approximately &euro;62 and covered his wife&rsquo;s train fare and the cost of a taxi to St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital.  However, he was told that because he was a private patient, he did not qualify for the subsidy.  Consequently, his last four trips to Dublin have involved his leaving Tralee on the early morning train, a four-hour journey to Heuston Station, taking a bus into part of the city, going the rest of the way in other forms of transport, getting his chemotherapy treatment and making the return journey.</P>
        <P>The man is terminally ill.  At best and if everything goes well, he has two or three years left; at worst, he has less than six months.  He applied to Kerry General Hospital for assistance in travelling to St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital once per fortnight, but the response, even on appeal, was that a public hospital cannot be seen to subsidise a private patient of St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital.  Brendan and Karen said that the hospital was wrong and that the intention when rolling out the travel assistance scheme was not to discriminate against public or private hospitals, but to provide assistance to those who need to travel to other hospitals for treatment.  There was to be no distinction.  Even more outrageous than a terminally ill man with little money being refused such basic assistance was the suggestion that he become a public patient as he had a medical card and the transport section would then help him.</P>
        <P>In this situation, which I am sure is replicated in many instances elsewhere, someone who pays his taxes, works hard and gets VHI or other medical insurance is being penalised because he did not incur upon the State expenses when he could <Col N="162"/>have done so.  He could easily have got disability benefits and a medical card and gone public.  It has been suggested that he go into a public hospital, take a bed, when there is a shortage of them, and incur an expense on the State, which he does not want to do because he has paid medical insurance.  According to the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the HSE, it appears that he is to be penalised.  He is caught in an awful dilemma.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking the Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>Deputy Ferris appreciates that the issue he has raised relates to the exclusion of VHI patients from free travel for medical purposes.  He has put on the record of the House certain matters as he is entitled to do, but the Minister is not in notice of those in respect of this matter.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that Deputy Ferris has put a matter before the House wherein a patient was advised that, because he was a private patient with the VHI, he was in some sense disqualified from availing of the service.  However, no distinction in law is made between persons with full eligibility or limited eligibility, or whether the patient is a public or private patient, that is, a patient with VHI cover.  When a person makes use of an ambulance or other means of transport provided under this section, the HSE may impose a charge for the service.  Again, I am not sure that is the point Deputy Ferris has raised this evening.</P>
        <P>The primary focus of the ambulance service is on the provision of emergency transport for those patients with an acute medical need &mdash; the Deputy made the case that this person had an acute medical need.  However, the HSE also arranges non-urgent patient transport services and examines requests for such services on a case by case basis, taking account of individual needs.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that its national ambulance office, in conjunction with the primary, community and continuing care section and the National Hospitals Office, is arranging for a comprehensive review to be undertaken of the non-emergency transport needs of patients attending HSE facilities.  That review will include an examination of the service delivered nationally and make recommendations that will inform its future development.</P>

      <sTitle>School Accommodation.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise this issue.  It concerns the proposed Educate Together national school in Doughiska, Galway, which is one of the most rapidly expanding sub<Col N="163"/>urbs of Galway with perhaps the highest increase in new families.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A primary school had been proposed by Educate Together and 170 children had been signed up for pre-enrolment.  The local committee has decided not to proceed in the absence of any indication of a permanent home for the school.  A decision was taken centrally by Educate Together that, because most of its facilities are in temporary buildings, it will not proceed with applications unless there is some indication of a permanent site.  The responsibility for a permanent site falls on the Department of Education and Science and Galway City Council.</P>
        <P>Educate Together, in making its decision, pointed out that it had opened 23 schools since 2000, only one of which occupies permanent accommodation.  Each year, Educate Together has added to the assembly line of schools in temporary accommodation with no progress in the number moving into permanent accommodation.  Today, of the 41 Educate Together schools, 26 are in temporary accommodation, only one new school building is in construction and two are in architectural planning.  Some 80% of these schools are in areas of rapidly expanding population.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will appreciate the anomaly that arises from the fact that Educate Together provides a choice of primary education, stressing as it does multi and non-denominational education, child-centred education and democratic management involving parents, but at present receives less than 1% of the total primary facilities in this country.</P>
        <P>This week, we have heard references to the rights of the child.  Ireland signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990 and ratified it in 1992 without reservation.  The UN Committee on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, of which this Minister of State, who led a delegation to Geneva, will be aware, has asked the Government to facilitate choice in primary education.  Put bluntly, people should have the choice between faith-based education at primary level and a more intercultural, multi and non-denominational education with parents as patrons.  Educate Together schools are not being treated fairly.</P>
        <P>I raise the issue of one particular school this evening.  It is little less than scandalous and an outrage that planning permission can be given to developers to build hundreds, and in some cases more than a thousand, houses without the necessary educational facilities.  If one wants to provide a place for one&rsquo;s child, be part of a voluntary committee and drag oneself through the seven stages of application, all one needs do is contrast the speed of the permission granted to the developer with the long wait for schools.  In this case, 170 children had been pre-enrolled but the committee has been wound up because it cannot continue in the absence of any indication of a permanent location.  The school was scheduled for <Col N="164"/>September 2006.  The matter is extremely urgent and I ask the Minister of State to at least give an undertaking that the Department of Education and Science will enter into talks with Galway City Council about the provision of a site for this facility.</P><?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>That is a specific point I wished to make about a school in the city in which I live.  On the more general issue of providing permanent sites for the option that is Educate Together, I ask the Minister of State to raise with the Minister and with Cabinet the issues which have been brought forward and agreed not just with the UN Committee on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, but previously with the Committee on the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination, two prestigious UN committees whose opinions I know the Minister will accord the weight they deserve.  They have reasonably suggested that such choice in primary education is important, as it is in terms of constitutional development, circumstances in which we find ourselves at present.  It is also important in terms of making provision for our children.</P>
        <P>I stress, on behalf of the parents and children, the urgency of the need for the Department to hold talks with the planning department of Galway City Council to resolve this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I make this reply on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it affords the Minister the opportunity to outline the open and transparent process in place for the recognition of new primary schools and the position concerning the proposed Educate Together school in Doughiska.</P>
        <P>The new schools advisory committee, NSAC, an independent body, assesses all applications for recognition against published criteria.  It conducts an open and transparent public consultation process as part of this assessment.  The committee&rsquo;s annual programme of work culminates in a report with recommendations on the granting of recognition to applicants.  The Department of Education and Science is happy to support all new schools where it has been clearly demonstrated, in accordance with the criteria, that a demand exists.</P>
        <P>This process has resulted in the establishment of a significant number of new multidenominational primary schools in recent years.  Patrons wishing to establish new schools must identify the level of demand for the provision of education proposed and that potential enrolment will meet certain minimum targets.  Under this process, all patron bodies are treated on an equal footing.  Schools that meet the criteria are generally awarded provisional recognition at the outset.  The question of permanent recognition is considered when the school&rsquo;s long-term viability has been demonstrated and the school is operating in <Col N="165"/>accordance with the relevant provisions governing the operation of primary schools.</P><?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P>It is a condition of provisional recognition that the patron provides suitable accommodation in the stated area, which must be capable of meeting the needs of the school.  When permanent recognition is granted to a school, the Department will then consider an application for permanent accommodation from the school authorities.</P>
        <P>Turning to the specific matter in hand, following consideration by the new schools advisory committee, the Department granted recognition to a new national school in Galway city east under the patronage of Educate Together.  While the application was for a September 2006 start-up, Educate Together advised the Department in April 2006 that it was unable to find suitable accommodation and wished to preserve this recognition to September 2007 and the Department agreed with this request.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy may wish to note that the Department of Education and Science has previously announced, as part of the Department&rsquo;s public private partnership programme 2005-09, the provision of accommodation for a primary and post-primary school in the Doughiska location by way of a shared campus.  The project has already been assigned a band 1 priority rating under the published prioritisation criteria for largescale building projects.  This is the highest banding possible and is a clear indication of the priority the Department attaches to the delivery of the project.  I hope the discussion to which Deputy Michael Higgins referred as taking place between Galway City Council and the Department can be brought to a speedy conclusion.  It is clear from the Minister&rsquo;s reply this evening that there is no resources issue on the part of the Department of Education and Science.  The project has been assigned the highest possible priority in terms of allocation of resources within the Department.  I hope that whatever outstanding issues exist between the Department and the city council can be resolved so that a rapid identification of a site, as distinct from a locale, can be made.</P>
        <P>On the wider issues raised by the Deputy, I attended a hearing in Geneva in September on the Convention on the Rights of the Child and dealt there with the issues pertaining to our education system.  The new schools advisory process is designed to ensure equality of access for all the different patrons recognised under the education legislation in the establishment of primary schools.  It is important that the choice of parents in this matter, a constitutional right, is respected and facilitated by the State.</P>
        <P>In addition, I accept that because Educate Together is a new patron, a substantial number of schools are still in temporary accommodation.  The standard of temporary accommodation is higher than it was in the past, but every effort is being made in the Department to progress these schools into permanent accommodation on sites acquired for that purpose.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue.  In 2005, due to increased pupil numbers the Department of Education and Science appointed an extra teacher to Cloontuskert national school in County Roscommon and a temporary portakabin was erected until such time as the school could get the approval of the Department to build a permanent new building.</P>
        <P>At that time the school had 82 pupils; it now has 90 pupils.  In March 2005, the Department of Education and Science allocated &euro;150,000 to cover the cost of building a new classroom.  Following an appeal for additional funding in April 2006, the board of management was granted &euro;161,000 to build a standard classroom and a standard resource room.  The school initiated the building project, engaged an architect and builders and planning permission was granted.  Building work was due to start in early summer 2006.</P>
        <P>However, in May 2006, the overall cost was put at &euro;183,396.98, with a shortfall of &euro;22,396. 93 for the project fund.  Therefore, the school made a further request for additional funds from the Department of Education and Science.  To date, the school has received &euro;171,000 from the Department, but it now faces a shortfall of &euro;36,871.04 as the cost of building works completed, including fees payable, now stands at &euro;212,424. 24.</P>
        <P>On October 27, the  Department wrote to the school authorities to inform them that it was satisfied that under the terms of the scheme, the school did not warrant additional funding.  The Department now expects the parents to fundraise to make up the shortfall, but this is just not possible.  In 1998 the parents had to come up with in excess of &euro;70,000 at today&rsquo;s values to fund the construction of the new school that was built at that time, a project that had been outstanding for some considerable time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Currently, many of the same parents are fundraising for the refurbishment works approved by the Department for the local post primary school, Lanesboro community college, which is in the adjoining community.  It would be grossly unfair to ask these parents to fund the construction of</P>
        <P FLI="0">two schools at the same time.  In this small community the school&rsquo;s board of management therefore cannot raise the shortfall, in spite of fundraising efforts by parents and the local community.</P>
        <P>This is an unacceptable situation.  It is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science to provide suitable accommodation for teachers and pupils, based on school numbers.  The school more than qualifies for this new building.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, particularly in view of the fact that his late father represented this constituency and that the community in Cloontuskert were loyal supporters, to intervene directly with the <Col N="167"/>Department on this issue.  He has a foothold in the Department and I know he has looked sympathetically at requests I put forward in the past.  In light of the community&rsquo;s support of his late father, I appeal to the Minister of State&rsquo;s generosity and urge him to ask the Minister to reconsider this decision and provide the additional funding without further delay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have the honour of replying to Deputy Naughten on this matter, but I do so on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin.  Were I to follow Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s advice, my foothold in the Department might become only a toehold.</P>
        <P>The Minister wishes to outline to the House the current position regarding the allocation of funding under the permanent accommodation scheme.  Cloontuskert national school is accommodated in a three-classroom school which was built in 1998 and there is a prefabricated unit adjacent to the main building.  The school has an enrolment of 89 pupils and staffing of a principal teacher, three assistant teachers and a permanent learning support-resource teacher.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science has moved towards a model of devolved funding, responsibility and authority for building projects to school management authorities.  Devolution of funding to school management authorities allows them to have control of their projects and assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction.  It can also deliver better value for money.</P>
        <P>The permanent accommodation scheme was originally introduced as an initiative on a pilot basis for 20 schools in the 2003 school building programme and due to the positive feedback from schools, it was extended in the school building programmes of 2004, 2005 and 2006.</P>
        <P>While appropriate for many schools, the Department is aware that the devolved permanent accommodation scheme is not necessarily suitable for all national schools seeking to refurbish their school building or to build new accommodation.  It is not the intention of the scheme to leave schools with massive fundraising requirements.  However, in some cases, the school site or building can be problematic.  In others, the extent of the required work is too extensive for the funding available under the scheme.</P>
        <P>The scheme is not structured on the basis that the Department funding must be supplemented by local fundraising.  It does, however, allow a school to supplement the funding from local resources if it so wishes.  The critical element is that with devolved authority, the school must set <Col N="168"/>the scope of works to match the funding allocated.  A school can make choices within the budget allocated and setting the scope of works is the critical first step.</P>
        <P>Clearly, where a school has a known level of resources apart from the Department funding or knows its capacity to raise additional resources, it is open to that school to extend the scope of works to include additional facilities.  However, if the scope of works is not set appropriately from the outset based on the budget available, there is a risk that the school will be faced with a funding gap when the project is at construction.</P>
        <P>The choices to be made within this devolved scheme rest with the school and that is the cornerstone of any policy of devolution.  The school authority is aware of the budget and must decide what it is capable of building with that budget.  The time to identify a problem is at the outset before entering any contract.  Schools can raise with the Department any site specific problems or unusual planning stipulations that impose additional costs and these will be examined.  Otherwise, schools must reduce the scope of intended works so as to remain within budget.</P>
        <P>A school does not have to accept the invitation to participate in a devolved scheme and can instead be considered for inclusion in the mainstream school building programme in line with the project&rsquo;s priority band rating.</P>
        <P>This school was offered a grant of &euro;100,000 under the permanent accommodation scheme in 2005 to provide an additional permanent classroom.  The grant was subsequently increased to &euro;150,000 at the request of the school authority, to include the provision of a resource room as well as a permanent classroom.  The board of management accepted the grant offered and proceeded with the architectural planning of the project.</P>
        <P>The scope of the project decided by the board of management of the school was for an extension of approximately 150 sq m, considerably in excess of the Department norms of 76 sq m for a general classroom and 20 sq m for a resource room.  Construction work commenced in June 2006 and was completed in September.  In June 2006 and again in August 2006, additional funding of &euro;21,000 was approved to cover unforeseen building costs.  The board of management then submitted a further application for additional funding.  This application was examined by the Department&rsquo;s review group which comprises senior officials from the planning and building sections.  They concluded that under the terms of the scheme, the school does not warrant additional funding.  The school authority has been notified of their decision.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2003, primary responsibility for developing and implementing responses to litter lies with local authorities.  Local authorities are required, so far as is practicable, to ensure that public roads in their functional areas are kept free of litter.  They are also required to take all practicable measures for the prevention, control and disposal of litter in their functional areas.  Each local authority determines its level of expenditure on individual local services, including anti-litter and clean-up operations.</P>
        <P>Since enactment of the 1997 Litter Pollution Act, local authority performance on enforcement of the litter laws has improved significantly, with more litter wardens employed and substantial increases in the number of prosecutions taken and on-the-spot fines issued.  The number of litter wardens employed over this period almost trebled to 406 in 2005, and the number of prosecutions increased more than sixfold from 330 to almost 2,200.  The number of on-the-spot fines levied increased about eightfold to some 26,600 over the same period.</P>
        <P>Under the National Litter Pollution Monitoring System (NLPMS), local authorities carry out surveys to determine the extent and composition of litter pollution in their areas.   The data obtained provides a picture of national pollution levels and measures progress in tackling litter pol<Col N="170"/>lution.  The data is processed and audited by an independent firm.  In recent years the trends indicated by the monitoring system are generally positive.  The emerging pattern is of a gradual but steady improvement in regard to the extent of litter pollution countrywide.  Litter-free areas are increasing and littered areas including litter blackspots are decreasing.  Full details of the survey data are available on the website <i>www.litter.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The Review of Local Government Financing by Indecon Economic Consultants estimated, on the basis of different methods of projecting expenditure, that by 2010 local authority expenditure will increase by &euro;1 billion to &euro;2 billion in nominal terms over 2004 levels.  Funding this expenditure would be met by a combination of the buoyancy in the existing funding system, some additional funding and the achievement of efficiencies over the period.</P>
        <P>As regards the existing funding system, there is significant natural buoyancy in the current revenue sources of local authorities. For example, at local level, the valuation base is growing rapidly as a result of our continued economic growth; in 2006, this valuation base increased by some 10% over 2005. In addition revenue from motor taxation &mdash; which is paid directly into the Local Government Fund &mdash; continues to increase without any increases in the rates of this taxation; in 2006, motor tax revenues are running at 10% above 2005 levels.</P>
        <P>I was in a position to announce record levels of General-Purpose Grants to local authorities from the Fund amounting to some &euro;875m for 2006. Taking account of global valuations, this was an increase of some 8% on the 2005 allocation or<?oasys _jy ?>2&frac12; times the 1997 level.   I will shortly be announcing the general-purpose grant allocations to local authorities for 2007 and I am confident that the levels of funding that will be made available will be adequate to meet ongoing local authority needs.</P>
        <P>To supplement the existing income sources, a number of initiatives are being pursued.  Measures to combat motor tax evasion are being continued and stepped up. I am also considering ways of bringing planning fees, which are fixed by Regulations, into line with the economic cost of dealing with planning applications.</P>
        <P>Additional revenues will be complemented by a range of efficiency initiatives.  In partnership with local authorities:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />I am developing a standard costing system for the sector to deliver enhanced management information, particularly in relation to unit costs,</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />I intend to enhance arrangements for local audit committees in line with best practice, and</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />I will pursue the scope for greater sharing of services between authorities.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will also continue to ensure that the Value for Money Unit in my Department undertakes in-depth analyses of local authority activities and identifies &ldquo;best practice&rdquo;.  The availability of good <Col N="172"/>information is a key to good decision-making and I have published key financial data on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>Under the Rural Water Programme a grant of up to 75% of costs or &euro;2031 per house which ever is lesser, is available from local authorities for the provision of private sewage collection and disposal facilities through group sewerage schemes.</P>
        <P>The National Rural Water Monitoring Committee, are currently undertaking a pilot programme to test a range of new, small-scale wastewater collection and treatment systems under Irish conditions. This programme will evaluate new approaches to meeting the wastewater collection and treatment needs of rural villages and to examine the potential role for group sewerage schemes in extending the collection systems to households outside the catchment of new or existing sewerage schemes. The pilot programme will also test a low cost, low maintenance system to collect, treat and dispose of effluent from existing septic tanks.</P>
        <P>Construction of the pilot projects is currently in progress and monitoring of the performance of the new infrastructure by the National Rural Water Monitoring Committee will commence immediately after commissioning takes place.  I have asked the Committee to report on results as they become available.</P>
        <P>I will review the potential role for group sewerage schemes and the level of any assistance that might be appropriate in the light of the outcome of these pilot projects.</P>

	<P>Emissions from the transport sector in 2004 totalled 12.58 million tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> equivalent, equivalent to 18% of total national emissions in 2004. Road transport accounted for 96% of transport emissions.</P>
        <P>Different treatment already exists for private motor vehicles on the basis of engine size through differentiated vehicle registration and motor tax rates. In addition, 50% relief on vehicle regis<Col N="173"/>tration tax is currently available for both hybrid-electric and flexible fuel vehicles.</P>
        <P>While engine size is related to both fuel consumption and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions, the size of a vehicle&rsquo;s engine is not an accurate proxy for the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions from that vehicle and certain technologies provide a greater CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> efficiency for a given engine size.  I am therefore currently examining the potential to more closely align motor taxation with the rated CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions for given vehicle types.  It is not yet possible to identify the specific changes which might result from this approach. Any changes to the current system of vehicle registration tax are a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

Following the consultation period, a final report will be prepared and its recommendations will be considered by the Departments concerned, including the need for any new measures to be taken in this area.</P>
        <P>The regulation of managing agents will be among the functions of the new Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA).  The authority will licence, regulate and deal with complaints relating to managing agents, which are commercial firms engaged by management companies to carry out day-to-day management and maintenance.  The Authority will also have a public information function in relation to property management.  Legislation to provide for the establishment of the PSRA and other matters relating to property services is being developed by Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>Apartment complex management companies are generally constituted under the Companies Acts and are required to comply with the provisions of company law.

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances.  The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.  However, my Department has asked local authorities to engage with commercial waste collectors to agree on arrangements to assist lower income households by offering alternatives to periodic lump-sum payments.</P>
        <P>In August this year, I published a consultation paper on options for future regulation of the <Col N="175"/>waste sector. Submissions were invited on whether there is a need for a regulator for the sector, if so on what model of regulator might be most appropriate and on what powers any such regulator should be given. Among the possible powers discussed in the paper is the power to impose a public service obligation so that services can be provided where they would not otherwise be economically feasible. Following consideration of the submissions received, which is currently underway, I intend to finalise further policy proposals.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 78 together.</P>
        <P>One of the main barriers to an improved and sustainable recycling performance is the lack of stable and economically attractive markets and outlets for recyclable materials and products manufactured from recycled products. The need for the establishment of a Market Development Group, which would oversee the development of a Market Development Programme, was outlined in the Delivering Change policy statement and the Agreed Programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The Market Development Group, established in July 2004, has met on six occasions.  The work of the Group is currently focusing on three priority waste streams: paper, plastic and compost. Among the key issues to be addressed are promoting stable demand for recovered materials, supporting the achievement of economies of scale in the production of products made from recycled materials and the need for more recycling infrastructure in Ireland to reduce reliance on overseas markets.</P>
        <P>The National Market Development Programme, which the Group is developing, will identify new applications and markets for recyclable material and secondary recycled products. The Group has been asked to identify barriers to the use and marketing of recyclable material and to develop strategies to address these.  The Market Development Programme is being finalised at present for publication early in 2007.</P>

        <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 56 of 13 June 2006 regarding the European Court of Justice Judgment of May 2006.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s international legal team, led by the Attorney General, continues to examine this complex judgment with a view to adapting Ireland&rsquo;s strategy in relation to Sellafield.  The Irish authorities have also written to the European Commission on 18 October to seek a high level meeting with the Commission which would clarify the elements of the dispute falling within and outside the ECJ&rsquo;s jurisdiction.  A response from the Commission is currently awaited.</P>
        <P>On the diplomatic front, I will be meeting Mr. Alistair Darling MP, UK Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry in London on 9 January next to voice the continuing concerns of the Irish Government in relation to the operation of the Sellafield Plant.  Similarly, I also hope to meet Mr. David Miliband, UK Secretary of State at the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs while I am in London.</P>
        <P>This Government will continue to pursue all legal, political and diplomatic options to secure the safe and orderly closure of the Sellafield facility.  I consider that the current legal and ongoing diplomatic initiatives by the Irish Government in relation to Sellafield have resulted in increasing recognition by the UK Government and its Departments and Agencies of the depth of Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about Sellafield and of the priority accorded to the issue of Sellafield by the Irish Government.</P>

Local authorities must publish the draft Register on or before 1 November each year and they must publish the final Register on 1 February.</P>
        <P>In April 2006, I announced a package of measures to assist local authorities in their work on preparing the 2007/8 Register, which included the use of Census enumerators or other temporary personnel to support local authorities in preparing the next Register. The CSO contacted Census enumerators seeking expressions of interest in the work; lists of enumerators expressing such an interest in each city and county council area were made available to local authorities. This cleared the way for recruitment and deployment, as appropriate, by local authorities of additional temporary staff for the registration campaign.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department worked with a group of local authority managers and senior officials to put in place an enhanced programme for improving the next Register.  Detailed procedures for the carrying out of registration fieldwork were finalised and issued to local authorities in early July. The procedures included provision for ensuring that each household was visited and provided with forms and information at least twice, if necessary. In the event that this process did not satisfactorily register the household,  writ<Col N="179"/>ten notification would then be given cautioning of the danger of being omitted from the Register. A person not on the draft register may apply (before 25 November) for inclusion on the final register to be published on 1 February 2007, or may apply for inclusion on the supplement to the register which closes on the fifteenth day before the next polling day.</P>

        <P>New supplies of the electoral registration (RFA) forms were distributed to all local authorities in June (significantly earlier than in previous years).</P>
        <P>I also committed to providing additional ring-fenced financial resources to support local authorities&rsquo; own spending in respect of the register campaign and advised authorities that a contribution of some &euro;6 million can be made available in this regard. An initial allocation of some &euro;3 million, based on the number of households in each local authority area, was made available in July to local authorities for registration work.</P>
        <P>As regards publicity and awareness, a two-stage approach has been developed, involving  information notices followed by an intensive media campaign.  Information notices were published in the national press on 19&ndash;21 August, urging co-operation with local register campaigns. In addition, a national publicity and awareness campaign involving TV, radio, press and outdoor advertising commenced on 11 September and will run until 25 November (the closing date for submitting corrections to the Draft Register).</P>
        <P>An online register search facility is now available through local authority websites and a central website <i>www.checktheregister.ie</i> is also now available, containing direct links to each local authority&rsquo;s eReg enquiry screen, to facilitate people in checking that they are on the Draft Register.</P>
        <P>New arrangements for the deletion of names of deceased persons from the Register are now in place: the new system allows for the efficient and timely deletion of the names of deceased persons from the Register using the Death Event Publication Service which has been developed by Reach in association with the General Register Office.</P>
        <P>New guidance for local authorities on Preparing and Maintaining the Register of Electors was made available to authorities in electronic format on 31 May. Printed copies of the guidance were subsequently sent to all local authorities, returning officers and relevant Government Departments. In the final version of the guidance, the importance of local authorities cross-checking the Register with other databases available to them is stressed.</P>
        <P>It is internationally acknowledged that electoral registration presents particular difficulties and challenges for electoral authorities. I am satisfied that local authorities have carried out the most extensive registration campaign in decades for the Draft Register 2007/8. My Depart<Col N="180"/>ment is currently compiling summary data from local authorities in this regard. While the complete data are awaited, initial indications are that there has been extensive activity with both significant additions to, and deletions from, the Register.</P>
        <P>I have no proposals to change the title of the Register at this stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 31, 34, 52, 62, 104, 122, 359 and 360 together.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Electronic Voting concluded in its Second Report on the Secrecy, Accuracy and Testing of the Chosen Electronic Voting System, which was published on 4 July 2006, that it can recommend the voting and counting equipment for use at elections in Ireland, subject to further work it has recommended. The Commission made it clear that many of its recommendations involve only relatively minor modifications or additions to the system.</P>
        <P>While the software of the voting machine was considered by the Commission to be of adequate quality requiring only minor modifications and further analysis to confirm its reliability, it was unable to recommend the election management software. In the context of its comparison of the electronic and manual voting systems, the Commission concluded that, subject to its recommendations being implemented, the chosen system has the potential to deliver greater accuracy than the paper system and can provide similarly high levels of secrecy.</P>
        <P>In response to the report, the Government has established a Cabinet Committee on Electronic Voting, which I chair, to consider the report in detail; report to the Government on the full implications of the Commission recommendations; consider the composition of a peer review group  &mdash; drawn from international electoral reform bodies and the IT industry &mdash; to supervise any software redesign work; report to the Government on confidence building measures; and identify any other improvements that might be built into the system.</P>
        <P>The Cabinet Committee, which also includes the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, met on 31 July 2006.  Its work is underway and it will meet again in the near future.  The issue of a peer <Col N="182"/>review group will be considered by the Committee at the appropriate stage of its deliberations. The Committee will report to Government when its work is completed.</P>
        <P>The timing of the further use of the system is dependent on the ongoing work of the Cabinet Committee, the associated decisions arising in this regard, and the dates at which future polls may be held.</P>
        <P>Section 22 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2004 provides that the Commission shall stand dissolved on the expiration of 2 months from the presentation by the Commission of the last of its reports; this expiration period concluded 4 September 2006.</P>
        <P>On the question of further testing, recommendations 18 to 21 of the Second Report refer to the need for testing of the system by a body duly qualified and accredited following any modifications that may be decided upon. These and all other recommendations of the Commission will be taken into account in the work of the Cabinet Committee. I am aware of the testing of the system to date here and elsewhere, and fully accept the need for appropriate further testing of the system prior to use.</P>
        <P>The Government decision to proceed with the movement of the electronic voting equipment to centralised premises was made taking into account a range of factors, including costs of current and centralised arrangements and the likely benefits to be realised.  In this regard, the Commission in its Second Report concluded that, as the current arrangements under which voting equipment is stored at 25 locations are likely to give rise to continuing variations in the implementation of security and related control measures, together with replication of similar costs of implementation of these measures which are not insignificant across individual centres, enhanced and more uniform security and greater economy of security costs could be achieved through the rationalisation of storage on a regional or centralised basis.</P>
        <P>In taking forward the decision to centralise storage of the electronic voting machines, the Department of Defence advised my Department of the availability of a hangar at Gormanston Aerodrome, Co. Meath, which can accommodate the majority of the electronic voting machines.</P>
        <P>The total cost incurred to date in the development and roll-out of the electronic voting and counting system is &euro;51.3 million (including &euro;2.6 million in respect of awareness and education initiatives and &euro;0.73 million for work by consultants on assessment/testing of the system). In addition, information provided by returning officers to my Department indicates that the annual storage costs for the electronic voting machines and ancillary equipment is currently some &euro;705,000.</P>

        <Quest> if, regarding the relevant provisions of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 which will enable local authorities to refuse planning permissions to developers with a poor history of development, he will establish a central database containing information on such developers to ensure that all local authorities have access to a comprehensive list of persons to whom they may refuse permission; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 9 of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 amends section 35 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to enable the planning authority to refuse permission to a developer who has been in substantial non-compliance with a previous planning permission.  The applicant will have to apply to the High Court if he or she wishes to have the decision overturned.  This reverses the previous position, whereby a planning authority wishing to refuse permission in such a case was required to first obtain the authorisation of the High Court.  It is intended to assist any planning authority in dealing a developer who has persistently failed to comply with the requirements of that authority.</P>
        <P>Each planning authority has primary responsibility for dealing with applications for permission and planning enforcement within its own area.   The section therefore does not enable a planning authority to rely on information supplied by others, or from a centrally maintained list, when deciding whether to grant or refuse permission in any particular case.</P>

        <P>The Local Government Act 2001 (Section 237A) Regulations 2003, provide, inter alia, for the supply of specified documentation to Oireachtas members by the local authority such as local authority budget, draft development plan etc.  In addition, equivalent systems, procedures and timeframes to those used in relation to correspondence from local authority members apply also in respect of Oireachtas members.  Managers are required to meet at least annually with local Oireachtas members and thus provide an opportunity for an update on developments and for any difficulties encountered to be raised and addressed.  As indicated in earlier replies to Questions on this topic, I am concerned that local authorities should at all times facilitate parliamentary representatives, in both the spirit and the letter of the Regulations, in carrying out their work on behalf of local communities.</P>
        <P>I am, at present, considering issuing supplementary guidance to local authorities in the matter, in the light of practical experience with the operation of the arrangements to date.</P>

	<P>An Bord Plean&aacute;la have experienced sustained high volumes of case intake of the last few years, with cumulative increases of 24% between 2004 and 2005 over the 2003 intake. Based on the rate of intake at end October, it is anticipated that the Board will come close to taking in a record level of appeals in 2006, for the second year in succession.</P>
        <P>By end October the Board had received over 5,000 cases and disposed of 4,773, an increase of 5% on 2005 and 12% on 2004 in the number of cases disposed. The percentage of cases resolved within the statutory period was 53%, while the average time taken to dispose of cases was 18.1 weeks (which compares favourably to the previous peak of case intake in 2001 when the average time taken to make decisions was 25 weeks).</P>
        <P>In recognition of the increased demands on the Board, and to assist in the delivery of the provisions of the Strategic Infrastructure Act 2006, an additional 24 permanent staff has been sanctioned, which would bring the total complement to 160.5.</P>

	<P>The primary role of the local authority fire service in the event of a fire is to rescue people, save property and extinguish the fire.  Fire brigades routinely prepare internal operational reports on fire incidents attended and these reports may include opinions as to the possible causes of the fires.  However, fire authorities do not carry out formal investigations into the causes of fires.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carry out investigations to assist the Coroner&rsquo;s Office in all cases where fatalities occur from fire.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also investigate fires where a crime is suspected.  Investigations may also be carried out by the Health and Safety Authority and, in certain circumstances, such as the Whiddy Island and Stardust fires, tribunals of inquiry have been established to investigate the fires.  While the findings of tribunals would normally be made public, whether the outcomes of other investigations would be made public will depend on the individual circumstances of each case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Article 9 of European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste provides that packaging may not be placed on the market within the European Union unless it satisfies the provisions of the Directive. Annex II of the Directive explicitly provides that packaging shall be designed, produced and placed on the market in such a way as to permit its reuse or recovery, including recycling and composting.</P>
        <P>Under article 18 of the Directive, Member States are prohibited from impeding the placing on the market of packaging which satisfies these essential requirements.  The essential requirements of packaging are transposed into national law under the combined provisions of article 24 and the Third Schedule of the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003, as amended, which provides that a person may not supply packaging or packaged products to the Irish market unless the packaging concerned complies with essential requirements as to its nature and composition.</P>
        <P>The regulations impose obligations in relation to the recycling of backdoor waste on all producers participating in the placing of packaging on the Irish market.  In addition, major producers i.e. those who have an annual turnover in excess of &euro;1 million and who place more than 25 tonnes of packaging on the Irish market, have additional responsibilities with regard to the recovery of packaging waste from their customers.  Major producers are required to take steps individually to recover their packaging waste (i.e. self-compliance) or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes set up to recover packaging waste.</P>
        <P>Repak Limited was established by Irish industry in 1997 to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste with a view to achieving Ireland&rsquo;s packaging waste recovery and recycling targets under the Directive and is the only such approved compliance scheme in Ireland.  Repak membership income is used to subsidise the collection of packaging waste from both the household and commercial sectors.</P>
        <P>While Repak&rsquo;s primary role is to support the recycling of packaging waste, the fee structure applicable to its members &mdash; which is related to the type and amount of packaging placed on the market &mdash; reflects the polluter pays principle and directly incentivises the minimisation and reuse of packaging by producers.  In addition, article 4(5) of the regulations expressly provides that account shall not be taken of packaging destined for reuse for the purpose of determining whether or not a producer is a major producer &mdash; this simi<Col N="188"/>larly provides a direct incentive for producers to introduce systems to promote the reuse of packaging.</P>
        <P>Ireland has enjoyed considerable success in recent years in meeting targets for the recovery and recycling of this significant waste stream.  Data from the Environmental Protection Agency shows that the 25% target for 2001 set under Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste was achieved and also that, with 56% recovery of packaging waste in 2004, Ireland has exceeded the 2005 recovery target of 50% set under the Directive.</P>
        <P>The National Strategy Group on Packaging Waste Recycling, established in 2004, is currently developing a six-year strategy to achieve new higher targets for recovering and recycling packaging waste. I have made it clear that prevention and minimisation measures will be a central element of that strategy.  The strategy will be published early next year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 44 together.</P>
        <P>Establishing sustainable communities with a good quality of life is a key objective for my Department, and is being pursued through a range of policies and measures, which complement other Departments&rsquo; and agencies&rsquo; programmes.</P>
        <P>The Planning and Development Act 2000 which sets the legislative framework for the planning system requires that a development plan set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of an area.  Section 10(2)(d) of the Act specifies that the development plan shall include objectives zoning of land provision of infrastructure and for the integration of planning with the social, community and cultural requirements of the area and its population.  Under the provisions of Section 11(3)(c), plan<Col N="189"/>ning authorities are required to be pro-active in consulting service and infrastructure providers, including education, to ascertain their long-term plans and needs for the provision of services in the area.</P>
        <P>To assist planning authorities in formulating and implementing such plans, my Department is finalising Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans, following an extensive public consultation process.  These guidelines emphasise the importance within such plans of creating a clear strategic framework for the proper planning and sustainable development of the relevant area.</P>
        <P>In addition, Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Residential Density which were published in 1999 and are now in the process of being reviewed and updated, set out the basis on which locations appropriate for higher residential densities may be identified, the range of varying densities appropriate to different locations and the controls and safeguards to be addressed in promoting such development.  The new guidelines are being expanded to take account of changing population and settlement patterns and the extensive experience built up since the introduction of the 1999 guidelines in the design, assessment and development of higher density proposals.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the policy document, Housing Policy Framework: Building Sustainable Communities, was approved by the Government and published in December 2005. This sets out an agenda for an integrated package of housing policy initiatives, including supporting higher densities and compact urban settlement through quality design in the creation of new homes, new urban spaces and new neighbourhoods.</P>
        <P>My Department has and will continue to consult and co-operate with other relevant Departments and planning authorities to ensure that the planning process facilitates the strategic provision of key supporting facilities and services that support sustainable communities.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the existing planning legislation, particularly in relation to development plans and local area plans, and supporting guidance sufficiently underpin this policy approach.</P>

	<P>At end June 2006, 601 units of voluntary housing accommodation were completed with a further 2131 in progress. This compares with 548 units completed with a further 2016 in progress for the same period in 2005. </P>
        <P>The voluntary and co-operative housing sector has an important contribution to make in the provision of social housing.  By working in close partnership with local authorities, it plays a significant role in supplementing the efforts of local authorities in providing social housing in areas where particular housing needs have been identified.  It is supported by my Department through two separate funding schemes, the Capital Assistance Scheme and the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme.</P><Col N="191"/>
        <P>The Government are fully committed to developing and expanding the voluntary and co-operative housing sector by supplying the necessary financial resources and support to enable it to become an important and significant provider and force in the housing area.  To this end, provision of funding for the schemes has been increased significantly from &euro;56 million in 1999 to &euro;243 million in 2006.</P>
        <P>The main strategy for delivery of the Governments social and affordable housing programme is through the local authority 5-year Action Plans for social and affordable housing. The Action Plans, now at their midway stage are currently being reviewed. The reviews are focussing on examining how targets have been met in the first two years of the plan and on incorporating any adjustments required for the remaining years of the plan, in light of outcomes including expected 2006 outputs, and the results of the recent Housing Needs Assessment.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 67 and 72 together.</P>
        <P>The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is designed to cater for the accommodation needs of persons in receipt of rent supplement who have a long-term housing need. It is a collaborative project between my Department, local authorities, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>RAS operates in all housing authority areas. In some cases the County Council is managing the <Col N="193"/>scheme for the County at large. Nearly all housing authorities are now mobilised and most have begun to transfer cases.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>Good progress has been made in implementing RAS. To date over 12,000 cases [nearly 40% of the target group of recipients on rent supplement for more than 18 months] have been reviewed by local authorities for transfer to RAS, some 2,000 cases have actually been transferred to RAS accommodation (approx 25% to private rented sector accommodation and 75% within voluntary &amp; co-operative sector) and an additional 1,500 rent supplement households have also been allocated local authority housing.</P>
        <P>The amount spent to date on the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is of the order of &euro;4.122 million. The breakdown is &euro;164,836 in 2004, &euro;723,280 in 2005, mainly on administrative and start up costs, and &euro;3,234,000 to date in 2006. This funding is in addition to, and separate from, the ongoing capital funding provided to local authorities for the construction of new social housing units and the support of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.</P>
        <P>The RAS initiative is a major new direction for housing authorities and is being carefully monitored. Recent reports from the local authority based Programme Managers on their respective counties have indicated that the transfer of households from rent supplement to RAS is accelerating as authorities are overcoming difficulties they were encountering during initial stages. These problems mainly related to issues such as the   unwillingness of some landlords to join RAS, poor quality of some private rented accommodation, tenancies not being registered with the PRTB, households living in overcrowded accommodation conditions and shortages of supply of particular types of accommodation in some areas.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied at this early stage that RAS is meeting the objectives set for it by Government in July 2004. It has progressed from piloting to full local authority mobilisation and while the rate of transfer of households from rent supplement to the RAS had been slower than originally expected I am satisfied that good progress is being made on speeding up the transfer of cases and expect to see an acceleration of the rate of transfers to RAS of greater numbers of eligible households. In the future RAS will take a pivotal role in providing local authorities with solutions to a range of accommodation demands and will provide fresh options for local authorities to extend the range of social housing supports.</P>

	<P>As required under the Disability Act 2005, my Department&rsquo;s sectoral plan was approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas on 18 October 2006. The plan, covering my Department, its partner bodies and local authorities, sets out national objectives and guidelines for access to public buildings, services, amenities, and information, as well as to heritage sites and other facilities. The plan provides for a range of positive measures, including improvements to Part M of the Building Regulations, the introduction of a new Disability Access Certificate and the development of a Housing Strategy for people with disabilities. The implementation of these measures will promote and pro-actively encourage equal opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economic, social and cultural life of the community.</P>
        <P>There are many major spending programmes and schemes funded by my Department, for example in the areas of housing, non-national roads, libraries and urban and village renewal, which are used to provide facilities for and services for people with disabilities as well as for other groups in the community. Such spending can not be readily disaggregated.</P>
        <P>I have provided &euro;18 million in 2006 to help my Department, local authorities and bodies under the aegis of my Department to implement the National Disability Strategy. This forms part of a cross-Departmental multi-annual funding programme, introduced in mid-2005, which will continue until 2009. The information requested in respect of the National Disability Strategy funding is set out in the tabular statement. My Department is working closely with its partner bodies and local authorities to optimise the gains made from this expenditure and to deal with issues as they arise.</P>
        <P>The tabular statement also gives details of the combined capital allocation for disabled persons and essential repairs grants notified to local authorities in each year from 2000 to 2006 and the combined expenditure on those schemes and on works of adaptation to local authority rented <Col N="195"/>dwellings for a disabled member of the household from 2000 to 2005. Data in relation to 2006 expenditure will be published in the Annual Housing Statistic Bulletin early in 2007. Expenditure on the grant schemes is funded by the two-thirds recoupment available from my Department together with the one-third contribution from the resources of the local authority.</P>
        <P>The review of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme, which incorporates the conditions gov<Col N="196"/>erning the Essential Repairs Grant scheme and the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme, was recently finalised within my Department.  Proposals for the future operation of the schemes are now being prepared by my Department, in consultation with other public agencies concerned, and I expect to be in a position to announce these shortly.</P><Col N="195"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 49, 60 and 103 together.</P><Col N="197"/>
        <P>I have noted the recent launch of the MakeRoom campaign by Focus Ireland, the Simon Communities of Ireland, the Society of St Vincent de Paul and Threshold. The stated aim of the MakeRoom campaign is to end homelessness by 2010 and in this context indicates this to mean &ldquo;nobody will sleep rough; nobody will stay in emergency accommodation for longer than is absolutely necessary and nobody will become homeless because of a lack of appropriate services&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The social partnership agreement Towards 2016 contains a commitment to the elimination of the long-term occupancy of emergency homeless accommodation by 2010.  This is well aligned with the goals of the MakeRoom campaign. It should also be noted that the Homeless Agency, which is the partnership body which coordinates homeless services in Dublin, has already defined as its overarching goal the elimination of long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough in Dublin by 2010.</P>
        <P>The Independent Review of Implementation of Homeless Strategies, published earlier this year, examined the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s Integrated and Preventative Homeless Strategies and concluded that they should be amalgamated and updated. The Government have accepted the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Review and work is underway on the preparation of a revised and updated Strategy on Homelessness. As part of this process, a National Homeless Consultative Committee, including representatives from homeless service providers, will be established to provide input into the development of the revised homeless strategy and ongoing government policy on addressing homelessness.</P>
        <P>Very significant resources are being made available to address the issue of homelessness at national level in a comprehensive and co-ordinated manner.  Since 2000, the Government through my Department and the Department of Health &amp; Children, have provided almost &euro;450 million in capital and current funding nationally for the provision of accommodation and care related services for homeless persons.</P><Col N="198"/>
        <P>There is now a wide range of accommodation and services across the country &mdash; from emergency hostels, transitional accommodation programmes to outreach and resettlement services and long term supported accommodation.  A key task is to assist homeless persons who can live independently into mainstream long-term accommodation as soon as possible.  This will involve the refocusing of efforts on the provision of accommodation in the social, voluntary and private rented housing sectors. The Rental Accommodation Scheme has significant potential in this area. This increased supply, together with appropriate outreach and resettlement support is essential in assisting people out of homelessness altogether.</P>

	<P>Since 1995 national waste statistics in respect of all waste streams have been published at three-yearly intervals by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with the most recent National Waste Report being in respect of 2004.  Between 2001 and 2004, two interim database reports were published to provide data on municipal waste specifically (i.e. household and commercial waste) for the years 2002 and 2003 respectively.  It is my understanding that since the publication of the National Waste Report 2004, a full report will now be published every second year with an interim report (due shortly in respect of 2005) in the intervening year.</P>
        <P>The table sets out the position in relation to the amount of the wastes specified in the Question that have been landfilled in each of the respective years since 1998 for which data is available.</P><Col N="197"/>

	<P>The Building Regulations lay down performance-based standards, and do not either mandate or prohibit the use of specific construction products or systems. Various competing products or systems demonstrating compliance with the regulations may lawfully be used; and the choice is left to the designers, builders and the market.</P>
        <P>The broadly based Building Regulations Advisory Body (BRAB) commissioned an independent report by the Energy Research Group UCD to examine the impact of proposed higher <Col N="200"/>thermal performance standards under Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) of the Building Regulations on commonly used forms of house building &mdash; single leaf (hollow concrete block), twin leaf (solid concrete block), and timber frame.</P>
        <P>The Energy Research Group Report was published in November 2000 and concluded that 9&rdquo; hollow blocks could be insulated to comply with the proposed higher thermal insulation standards. Following a public consultation process, the relevant amending Part L Regulations were made in 2002.</P>
        <P>The Part L energy performance standards for the construction and reconstruction of buildings have been progressively increased since they were first introduced in 1992 &mdash; in 1998, in 2003 (dwellings) and 2006 (non-domestic buildings). The next revision of the Part L standards for dwellings will take place no later than 2008.</P>

The first two such reports were published in mid 2005 and 2006 respectively, and copies are available in the Oireachtas library.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Local Government Customer Services Group, which drew up the current set of indicators, to carry out a review.  The group is representative of my Department, local authorities (at both elected member and official levels) the LGMSB, the Local Government Computer Services Board and the Institute of Public Administration.  Extensive consultations are being carried out as part of the review, including with local authorities, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and Chambers Ireland.  Local authorities have also been asked to take account of their customers&rsquo; perspectives, when providing input to the review.  In addition the Independent Assessment panel, which I established to quality assure the service indicators, is being consulted.  I am satisfied that the Customer Services Group is consulting widely on the review and I am looking forward to receiving their recommendations in due course.  It is envisaged that amendments to the indicators arising from the review will apply from 2008 on.</P>

	<P>The Code of Conduct for Local Authority Employees was published in June 2004 under Part 15 of the Local Government Act 2001. Arising from a review of the Code and following consultations with the Standards in Public Office Commission, the Minister for Finance and staff interests, I recently amended Section 10 of the Code.</P>
        <P>Under the amendment, local authority employees must inform the appropriate authority before taking up employment outside the sector where the possibility of a conflict of interest may exist. Employees below Director of Services must inform the relevant County or City Manager. Employees at or above Director of Services level will be required to inform the proposed Outside Appointments Board for the Local Government Sector before taking up such employment.</P>
        <P>Also, employees to whom Part 15 (Ethical Framework) of the Local Government Act 2001 applies, or applied at any time during the six month period prior to their retirement or resignation, must obtain the consent of the relevant County or City Manager, or the Outside Appointments Board for the Local Government Sector as appropriate if, within twelve months of resignation or retirement, they intend to accept an offer of employment or consultancy engagement the nature and terms of which could lead to a conflict of interest.</P>
        <P>I intend to appoint the Outside Appointments Board for the Local Government Sector shortly. The Board will comprise the Secretary General of my Department, a former County or City Manager and three other members who are not serving or former public servants one of whom will act as Chairperson.</P>
        <P>The amendment made to Section 10 brings the local authority Code of Conduct into line with the provisions that currently apply to civil servants in regard to external employment.</P>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme all Dublin based operations of my Department are being decentralised, with the exception of Met &Eacute;ireann, ENFO, the Private Rented Tenancies Board and a small co-ordination section which it is proposed to retain in Dublin to assist with the Department&rsquo;s D&aacute;il and other business. The programme involves the relocation of my Department&rsquo;s operations to four locations in the South East: Wexford, Waterford, New Ross and Kilkenny. </P>
        <P>Implementation plans, setting out the issues to be addressed in implementing the Decentralisation Programme for this Department, have been submitted to the Decentralisation Implementation Group.  These plans are also published on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i></P>
        <P>At this stage a total of 226 staff, in respect of 661 posts to be decentralised and which are fillable through the CAF, have confirmed their availability to decentralise to the South East.  120 of these are now serving in my Department and the process of agreeing arrangements for the early transfer of the others to the Department has commenced.</P>
        <P>As outlined in the most recent Progress Report (September 2006) from the Decentralisation Implementation Group, the indicative timescales for the completion of the Departments offices in Wexford, Kilkenny, New Ross and Waterford are Quarter 3 2008, End 2008, Quarter 4 2009 and <Col N="204"/>Quarter 3 2010 respectively. The Office of Public Works are currently assessing tenders for the construction of the Department&rsquo;s Headquarters in Wexford.</P>

	<P>Ireland signed the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters on 25 June 1998.  Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level.  To date, the European Union has adopted two Directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.  These deal with public access to environmental information (2003/4/EC) and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures <Col N="205"/>(2003/35/EC).  Ratification of the Convention will take place after these Directives have been transposed into Irish Law.</P>
        <P>Work is continuing in my Department with regard to the transposition of these two Directives and will be completed as soon as possible.   When the above work on transposition is completed, the instrument of ratification of the Aarhus Convention will be laid before the D&aacute;il in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution.</P>

	<P>The European <Col N="206"/>Commission is currently in correspondence with my Department in respect of 35 cases relating to possible infringements of EU environmental legislation for which my Department is responsible.  This compares to 53 such cases at the end of October 2005. This considerable improvement illustrates the positive outcomes from my intensive efforts to resolve issues in dialogue with the Commission and stakeholders.  The cases, which relate to a number of Directives, are at various stages of proceedings as set out in the table.</P>
        <P>My Department has not had to deal with any costs arising from cases as referred to in the Question.    The Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office provide the legal service to the State in the conduct of European Court of Justice litigation.

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Recycling is a <Col N="210"/>significant element of the Government&rsquo;s overall integrated policy framework on waste management &mdash; which is based on the internationally recognised waste hierarchy &mdash; prioritising waste prevention, minimisation, reuse, recycling, energy recovery and the environmentally sound disposal of residual waste which cannot be recycled or recovered.</P>
        <P>This significant emphasis on recycling is reflected in the 1998 policy statement Changing our Ways which provided a national policy framework for the adoption and implementation by local authorities of strategic waste management plans under which specific national objectives and targets would be achieved. Specifically, Changing our Ways set ambitious recycling targets to be achieved over a fifteen year timescale &mdash; i.e. by 2013 &mdash; including a recycling target of 35% of municipal waste recycling and a diversion of 50% of household waste from landfill.</P>
        <P>National waste statistics are collated and published by the EPA. In its National Waste Database Report for 1998, the EPA estimated that 166,684 tonnes (9%) of municipal (household and commercial) waste was recovered for recycling in that year. In its corresponding 2004 Report, the EPA estimated that the recovery rate of municipal waste had increased to 918,995 tonnes<?oasys _jy ?>(33.6%).  Similarly, the EPA 2004 Report states that 295,134 tonnes (19.5%) of household waste were recycled in 2004 compared with 37,518 tonnes (3.2%) in 1998.</P>
        <P>The dramatic increases in recycling rates for household waste have been driven by successful Government policies including:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the provision of segregated collections for dry recyclables to over 540,000 households by 2003;</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the continued expansion of the numbers of bring facilities.  The number of bring banks grew from 837 in 1998 to 1,929 by 2004 while the number of civic amenity sites grew from 30 to 69 over the same period;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the roll out of pay-by-use by public and private sector waste operators in recent years; and</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />raising awareness through campaigns such as the Race Against Waste.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In order to provide further impetus in this area, a range of further measures have also been, or are in the process of being, undertaken:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />successful producer responsibility initiatives are in place to support the achievement of recycling targets for certain waste materials e.g the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) scheme introduced in August 2005 has lead to a five-fold increase in recycling of this waste stream while the European Union set 2005 target of 50% recovery rate for packaging waste was exceeded in 2003 and reached 56.4% in 2004;</P><Col N="211"/>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste was published in April 2006. In 2004, almost three quarters of municipal (household and commercial) waste sent to landfill was biodegradable. The Strategy sets out measures aimed at the separate collection, recovery and recycling of biodegradable waste with a view to achieving the progressive diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill by 2016 to 35% of the amount of biodegradable municipal waste generated in the baseline year of 1995; and</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the Market Development Group was established in 2004 to oversee the development of a Market Development Programme which will identify new applications and markets for recyclable material and secondary recycled products. The Group has been asked to identify barriers to the use and marketing of recyclable material and to develop strategies to address these. The Market Development Programme is being finalised at present for publication later this year.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am confident on the basis of the measures outlined above, and the enthusiasm that exists among the general public for recycling, that the target set out in Changing Our Ways in 1998 of 35% recyclers of municipal waste and 50% diversion of household waste from landfill by 2013 will be achieved.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 110 together.</P>
        <P>Income to date from the plastic bag levy amounts to &euro;64,988,365.  The 15c levy on plastic bags, as provided for in the Waste Management (Environmental Levy) (Plastic Bag) Regulations 2001, has led to a dramatic reduction in use of plastic bags with a consequent positive environmental benefit. Plastic shopping bags accounted for 5% of litter arisings prior to the introduction of the levy, but for just 0.22% of litter arisings in 2004.</P>
        <P>There has been an upward trend in receipts remitted by the Revenue Commissioners since the levy was introduced, but this must be interpreted with caution.  Firstly, these figures are not a precise measure of the number of bags supplied in a given period &mdash; each year&rsquo;s figure will also include levies recovered in respect of earlier periods on account of retailers filing late returns and the recoupment of levies due following Revenue audit findings.  Secondly, the increase in income is also likely to be due in part to increased enforcement by local authorities and audit activity by the Revenue Commissioners.   Enforcement efforts have been stepped up and a special network of local authority officers has been established to monitor and co-ordinate the enforcement drive.</P>
        <P>I have previously indicated that I am anxious to ensure that the levy&rsquo;s positive effect on our environment is maintained.  To that end, I have decided that the levy will be increased to 22c shortly &mdash; this is the maximum level that can be set under the existing legislative provisions.   While I would like to increase the levy sooner, I must give both the Revenue Commissioners and retailers time to adjust their systems.  The proposed change represents a substantial 47% increase on the original levy and I am confident that it will have the desired effect in discouraging use of plastic shopping bags.  I will monitor the implementation of the new levy carefully; if it becomes apparent that further increases are required I will bring forward the necessary legislative changes to the Waste Management Act.</P>

	<P>The improvement and maintenance of non-national roads is a matter for local authorities to be funded from their own resources supplemented by State Grants provided by my Department. </P>
        <P>The results of a Pavement Condition Study on non-national roads, which was carried out by consultants and completed in 2005, have shown that <Col N="216"/>there has been a very large growth in traffic volumes, including numbers of heavy goods vehicles, on our roads over the last 10 years and that the combination of growth in traffic volumes and damaging power has dramatically increased the structural loading on the non-national roads network. The study concludes that the economic boom, since the first study was carried out in 1996, has fundamentally changed the loading regime on the non-national roads network, with much higher and more frequent loading by heavier vehicles now being the norm.</P>
        <P>The rate of occurrence of potholes and road disintegration has effectively halved since 1996 as a result of the &euro;1.5 billion investment in Restoration Improvement and Maintenance works over the 1997 to 2004 period. However, the instance of other defects, such as rutting and edge cracking, has increased since 1996 as a result of growth in traffic on the network &mdash; particularly that of heavier and wider commercial vehicles.</P>
        <P>The Study identified the level of pavement restoration needs in all county council areas.  Based on these findings, my Department estimated that a sum of approximately &euro;2 billion, at 2005 prices, would be required to address the needs identified. In order to ensure that pavement restoration needs in all counties are addressed within a 10-15 year period, I have increased the grants available for Restoration Improvement works to &euro;205.3 million in 2006, which is an increase of over &euro;31 million, or almost 18%, on the 2005 allocation. This very substantial increase means that significant progress can be made in allocating funds to address the deficiencies identified by the Pavement Condition Study. I have also allocated grants totalling &euro;75 million for Restoration Maintenance works this year. This represents an increase of &euro;15 million, or 25%, on the 2005 allocation.</P>
        <P>In addition to the pavement restoration programme, my Department also provides grants to local authorities for works on non-national roads under a number of other grant categories. An estimate of the total funding requirements for improvements to, and construction of new, non-national roads is not available in my Department. Grants are allocated on an annual basis and in determining the annual non-national road grant allocations, the overall objective is to resource each local authority appropriately in relation to their ongoing and special needs.  The process is guided by a range of criteria, including road pavement conditions, traffic volumes, length of road network, population and eligibility in relation to specific projects such as EU Co-Financed Specific Improvements Schemes.</P>
        <P>In 2006, the total grant allocation by my Department for non-national roads is almost &euro;558 million &mdash; an increase of 13% or &euro;62.5 million on the record 2005 allocation.</P>

	<P>During the course of the first local authority Traveller accommodation programmes adopted in accordance with the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 and covering the period from 2000 to 2004, there was a significant improvement in the accommodation position of Travellers. During that time an additional 828 families were accommodated in standard local authority accommodation. In the same period, 398 new units of permanent Traveller specific accommodation were provided and a further 322 units of permanent Traveller specific accommodation were refurbished to modern standards. </P>
        <P>This progress has continued under the second programmes covering the period 2005 to 2008. At the end of 2005 there were 589 families on unauthorised sites, as shown in the November 2005 Annual Count of Traveller families. This represents a reduction of over 50% in the number of families on unauthorised sites, down from a figure of 1,207 at the inception of the programmes. The Table provides details of the number of Traveller families on unauthorised sites in each local authority area.</P>

        <P>In the case of Waterford City Walls, I provided an additional &euro;260,000 to Waterford City Council to assist them meet their financial commitments with regard to restoring the medieval city walls. This brings my Department&rsquo;s cumulative contribution to this project to &euro;2 million.</P>
        <P>I responded favourably to requests for additional funding from many Local Authorities for their Conservation Grants Schemes by allocating a further &euro;1,067,000 to enable  them to grant-aid the conservation of structures of architectural significance in the Record of Protected Structures (RPS) which the Local Authority lists under the Planning and Development Act 2000.

	<P>I have noted the contents of the report referred to in the Question.  With regard to local government funding in general, I consider that the present system of funding local government, put in place by this Government, has served us particularly well, and has placed local government in a much better financial position than in the past. </P>
        <P>This year I announced record levels of general purpose grants to local authorities from the Local Government Fund amounting to some &euro;875m.  Taking account of global valuations, this was an increase of some 8% on the 2005 allocation or<?oasys _jy ?>2&frac12; times the 1997 level.  I will shortly be announcing the general purpose grant allocations to local authorities for 2007 and I am confident that the levels of funding that will be made available will again be adequate to meet ongoing local authority needs.  I specifically requested that in order to support competitiveness in the economy and to protect the interests of communities, local authorities should to the greatest extent possible ensure that they exercise restraint in setting any increases in commercial rates and local charges for 2006.   I am pleased that local authorities responded positively to this request.  I will again ask them, in the context of the adoption of their <Col N="222"/>2007 budgets, to keep increases in rates and local charges to the minimum required.</P>
        <P>With regard to development contributions, I am glad to note that Chambers Ireland are fully supportive of development contributions, stating that they allow for local authorities to charge all developers of property, both business and residential, for the provision of associated infrastructure including roads, amenities, etc.  The Report primarily points to a variation in the charges levied for commercial and industrial development throughout the different local authorities.</P>
        <P>The adoption of development contribution schemes is a matter for the elected members of each local authority following a full public consultation, an approach that was relatively recently endorsed by the Oireachtas in the context of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The Act provides that the basis for determining the contributions must be stated in the scheme, based on  the actual estimated cost of the infrastructure provided or to be provided by or on behalf of the local authority.  Since that cost will differ among local authorities, depending on local need for infrastructure investment and rates of development, it is inevitable that there will be variation in the development contribution schemes.  However, my Department advised planning authorities, in circular letter PD 4/2003, that they should be mindful of the policies adopted by other authorities in their immediate area so as to avoid a major divergence in the level of contributions charged.  Planning authorities were also advised in this Circular that while it is expected that developers should make an appropriate contribution towards the costs of public infrastructure and facilities, care should be taken to avoid development contributions that are excessively high.</P>
        <P>My Department has established an Interdepartmental Committee, including representation from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to look at issues raised by different interests in relation to development contributions schemes.   This Committee is considering whether revised guidance should issue to planning authorities before they review their schemes next.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 113 together.</P>
        <P>Last December, the Government launched the Housing Policy Framework: Building Sustainable Communities. An important component of this policy framework is the commitment to improve the quality of social housing and particularly, run-down local authority estates by accelerating the rejuvenation of social housing stock. Almost &euro;1 billion has been spent on regeneration and remedial works for local authority housing estates since 1997, and work is proceeding in many of the estates in Limerick.</P>
        <P>The Government fully recognises that, problems in disadvantaged areas will usually require a multi-faceted response.  Structures are in place to facilitate this through the RAPID programme, for example and through City/County Development Boards and the associated Social Inclusion Measures Working Groups which are in place in many counties.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Government have recently appointed Mr. John Fitzgerald, former Dublin City Manager, to lead an initiative to address social exclusion, crime and disorder issues in Moyross in Limerick. Mr. Fitzgerald will work with existing agencies and community groups, to identify immediate actions which could be taken to improve the situation in Moyross.   He has also <Col N="224"/>been asked to bring forward suggestions about the regeneration of Moyross and other disadvantaged areas of Limerick in the context of the wider strategic development of the Limerick/ Shannon Gateway.  Mr Fitzgerald will be reporting back regularly to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion on the progress being made.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The table sets out the increases in local authority current expenditure since 1999.   The data for 1999 to 2005 are based on outturn figures and the data for 2006 on budget data provided by local authorities.</P>
        <P>The increased expenditure by local authorities in the period is in response to the needs of an expanding population, growth in economic activity associated social and quality of life expectations, and high environmental standards.   Indecon Economic Consultants in their Review of Local Government Financing (March 2006) identified that pay rates in the local authority sector increased by 44.7% between 1996 and 2002 compared to manufacturing pay rates which increased by 54% over the same period.  The cost of benchmarking payments arose each year from 2003.  It is estimated that the cumulative cost of benchmarking payments represents approximately 2.45% of total current expenditure between 2003 and 2006.</P>

        <P>On 18 October, the European Commission issued a Reasoned Opinion requiring Ireland to complete the task of publishing Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and transmit the final list of SACs to the Commission.

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The definitive Action Plan for the Implementation of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2002/91/EC) in Ireland was published on I August 2006. Section 6 of the Plan set out proposals for a comprehensive consultation, promotion and information campaign to inform the general public and business industry.  I understand that Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has held and participated in more than 90 information sharing seminars on the implementation of this Directive with interested parties throughout the country.  These seminars have been attended by more than 8000 participants, including 2,800 builders who attended the Home Bond Right on Site lecture series. SEI has also been maintaining an active information website (<i>www.sei.ie/epbd</i>), as well as issuing regular newsletters to an extensive mailing list. </P>
        <P>I will be making European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations early next month providing for the implementation of the Building Energy Rating (BER) of new dwellings commencing on of after 1 January 2007.  SEI will then initiate an information and publicity campaign focusing on the format and meaning of the BER label for a new dwelling; and the circumstances in which it will be required.</P>
        <P>It is currently envisaged that the operative date of 1 January 2007 will be subject to the transitional exemption of new dwellings for which planning permission had been applied for on or before 30 June 2006, provided substantial work is completed by 30 June 2008.  Transitional provisions are a common feature of major changes to the building code, so as not to disrupt the start of work on new buildings at an advanced stage of planning or design.  The transitional exemption of new dwellings from BER has been reduced from 3 years, as proposed in the draft Action Plan to implement the EPBD, to 2 years.</P>
        <P>While my Department is not in a position to give an accurate forecast of the number of new dwellings which could potentially benefit from the transitional BER exemption, the maximum number would be around 110,000 units.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that delivery under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006 is low.  Part V applies only to applications for planning permission for multiple housing developments on land zoned for residential use, or a mixture of residential and other uses.  Accordingly, not all housing developments are subject to Part V.  It does not apply to planning permissions granted prior to the introduction of Part V, or to developments of less than four units, or to developments on residentially zoned land that does not exceed 0.1 hectares, or to developments on land that is not zoned residential.  </P>
        <P>Part V is gathering momentum and will undoubtedly play an increasing role in the delivery of social and affordable housing in the future. It is envisaged that over 8,000 social and affordable units will be delivered under Part V in the next 3 years alone.</P>

	<P>The development of the public library service is, in the first instance, a matter for each library authority. Under the Public Library Capital Programme, my Department has grant aided new libraries up to 75% of the capital costs, with expenditure in excess of the grant aid a matter for the relevant local authority. According to information supplied to my Department by local authorities 49 new libraries were provided by them since 1997. </P>
        <P>The information requested on the number of positions vacant and unfilled is not available in my Department.  Under Section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, it is a matter for the manager of each local authority to make such staffing and organisational arrangements as may be necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he/she is responsible.</P>

	<P>Under the Air Pollution Act 1987, the occupier of any premises, other than a private dwelling, is required to use the best practicable means to limit and, if possible, to prevent emissions, including smoke emissions, from such premises.  In addition, the occupier of any premises is prohibited from causing or permitting an emission in such a quantity or manner as to be a nuisance.  The Act provides local authorities with powers to prevent or limit air pollution and penalties include fines and/or imprisonment upon conviction.</P>
        <P>The Waste Management Act 1996, as amended, places a general duty of care on the holder of waste not to hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. Local authorities have specific powers under the Act to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused by the holding or <Col N="229"/>disposal of waste, and mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of any such activity.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding successful prosecutions taken using the legislation as it stands, I am exploring the possibility of strengthening the current legislation by way of a new set of waste regulations aimed at more specifically outlawing the unacceptable practice of backyard burning.  In order to bring the issues involved to a wider public audience, under the Race Against Waste Awareness Campaign an information leaflet entitled Backyard Burning has been published, which highlights the effects of uncontrolled low temperature backyard burning of waste.</P>

	<P>Two recommendations in the recent National Consumer Agency Report are stated to be for action by my Department.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Recommendation 25 refers to the completion of developments in accordance with the terms of the planning permissions and makes reference to section 35 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Planning authorities already have substantial enforcement powers and duties under the planning legislation.  Further, the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, which was enacted on 16 July 2006 effectively reversed the burden of proof in Section 35 of the Planning and Development 2000 Act which provided that planning authorities may refuse to grant planning permission, subject to the consent of the High Court, to any developer who has seriously failed to comply with a previous planning permission.  From now on the planning authority will be empowered to refuse permission in such a case and the developer will have to go to the High Court if he wishes to apply to have this decision overturned.</P>
        <P>Recommendation 12 is that the contract between the developer and the management company to convey the title of the buildings and common areas to the management company should include a contractual obligation on the <Col N="232"/>developer to attend to the management company&rsquo;s snag list, prepared by an independent architect/surveyor and that this should be implemented by means of an amendment to planning legislation.  Having examined this recommendation I do not consider that planning legislation is the appropriate vehicle for implementing it.</P>

	<P>I initiated a public consultation process in December 2005 on a review of the existing Part M (Access for People with Disabilities) of the Building Regulations and the related Technical Guidance Document (TGD) M.  I asked interested parties to identify any deficiencies in the existing Part M/TGD M regime; and to suggest how they should be remedied. </P>
        <P>An excellent response has been received &mdash; more than 40 detailed submissions by the end of the consultation period on 30 March 2006. The submissions have been summarised by my Department and are now the subject of examination by a Sub-Group of the Building Regulations Advisory Body (BRAB).</P>
        <P>I expect to receive a draft amended Part M/TGD M proposals from BRAB, early in 2007, <Col N="233"/>and to publish draft regulations shortly thereafter.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is already aware, in August this year the Government agreed to my proposals for the establishment of an Inter-Departmental Committee (the Casino Regulation Committee), on which my Department is represented, to report on the possibilities for a legislative basis for the strict regulation of casino-style operations within the State.  The Casino Regulation Committee is due to report to Government shortly.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should be aware that my Department has taken a decision not to have individual meetings with promoters of change in the law outside of the Committee framework pending the completion of that Committee&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>The Committee issued a public call for submissions and has met many of the parties who made submissions.  As part of its functions on that Committee my Department was represented at those meetings.  Outside of this framework in that time, I have received representations from eight parties promoting changes in the law and one against such change.  My response to all such representations is that having established a Committee to consider these complex issues, I do not propose to comment on future policy in advance of receiving and considering the report of the Casino Regulation Committee.</P>
        <P>It is a fact that some organisations and individuals may not want their names appearing in the public domain and bearing in mind the requirements under the Freedom of Information legislation to protect third party information, I do not propose to provide details of the individuals or <Col N="235"/>organisation who made written representations to me at this time.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September, 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 has resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that Rathcoole Garda Station forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region West Division. The personnel strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Region West Division as at 31 December, 1997 was 513 (all ranks). The personnel strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Region as at 7 November, 2006 was 692 (all ranks). This represents an increase of 179 (or 34%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities state that the personnel strength of Rathcoole Garda Station as at 31 December, 1997 was 11. The personnel strength of Rathcoole Garda Station as at 7 November, 2006 was 23 (all ranks). This represents an increase of 12 (or 109%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.</P>
        <P>Local Garda management reports that there is currently one Community Garda attached to Rathcoole Garda Station.  Local Garda management are satisfied that the policing requirements of the Rathcoole Sub-District are adequately met by the existing available resources attached to Rathcoole Garda Station.</P>
        <P>Local Garda management also reports that there are no plans to extend the opening times of Rathcoole Garda Station. The station is currently open from 10 am to 1 pm and from 2 pm to 6 pm daily.  The extension of the opening hours would necessitate the employment of additional personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be <Col N="236"/>more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In January, 2005 I announced a scheme whereby the non-national parents of children born in Ireland before 1 January 2005 could apply for leave to remain in the State based on their parentage of those children.  This so-called IBC/05 Scheme and its terms and conditions were widely advertised and its closing date was 31 March, 2005.  Generally, leave to remain was granted for a two year period initially, effective from the date of issue of the letter granting leave to remain.  The permission allows the applicant to work without the need of a work permit and to engage in business without seeking the permission of the Minister.  That scheme followed from the Citizenship Referendum in 2004 and the passing by the Oireachtas of the Immigration and Citizenship Act, 2004, the effect of which is that children born to non-nationals from 1 January, 2005 no longer enjoy an automatic right to citizenship.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question about the deportation of families of Irish born children, since the change in law, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004, which was commenced by me with effect from 1 January 2005 provides at Section 4. 6A (1)2 &mdash; &ldquo;A person born in the island of Ireland shall not be entitled to be an Irish citizen unless a parent of that person has, during the period of 4 years immediately preceding the person&rsquo;s birth, been resident in the island <Col N="237"/>of Ireland for a period of not less than 3 years or periods the aggregate of which is not less than 3 years &rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It should be made clear that Irish citizen children cannot be deported and statistics are not maintained as to the number of Irish born children who accompany their parents who are the subject of deportation orders to their country of origin.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note also that children are not sent back with their parents to the parents&rsquo; country of origin where no right of residency for those children exists in that country.  For example, any child of Nigerian parents (i.e. the largest nationality group of asylum-seekers) is a Nigerian national by virtue of its parentage regardless of where he/she is born and is consequently entitled to reside with his/her parents in their country of origin following deportation. Given that such children will have an entitlement to citizenship in the State of their parent(s) it is not my intention to monitor the welfare of such children following their return to that country and the question of Ireland&rsquo;s consular services being available to such persons would arise in only the most exceptional of circumstances.</P>

        <Quest> if it is possible for a Bulgarian national to enter Ireland on 1 January 2007 with a valid passport only, if that person only wishes to visit the country; the length of time they will be able to stay here without working; the documentation a Bulgarian national would need to live here indefinitely if supported by an Irish person; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Nationals of Bulgaria, as and from 1 January, 2007, will have the same rights as other EU citizens except that, arising from the Government&rsquo;s recent decision, nationals of Bulgaria (and Romania) may not take up employment in the State except in accordance with an Employment Permit or where they are otherwise exempt.  They may enter Ireland on production of their passport and/or national identity card.  Visa requirements will no longer apply and they may reside here for up to three months.  Thereafter, they must be: in employment; self-employed; enrolled on a course or study or vocational training and have private medical insurance; or self sufficient and have private medical insurance.</P>
        <P>As and from 1 January, 2007 the main immigration law which will apply to Bulgarian and Romanian nationals is the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 226 of 2006).  Those Regulations, which I signed on 28 April 2006, transposed into Irish law the European Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family <Col N="238"/>members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.</P>
        <P>While the Regulations do not specifically require the registration of EU citizens with the immigration authorities in the State, EU citizens can apply to my Department for a Permanent Residence Certificate if certain conditions are met as set out in the Regulations.  In that context, a national of Bulgaria residing in the State and not economically active but supported by an Irish person and who claimed self-sufficiency on that basis would be expected to provide my Department with details of the relationship with the person on whom they depend and documentary evidence that they had sufficient financial resources to maintain themselves without recourse to State benefits.</P>

        <P>I understand from the Immigration Division of my Department that the person referred to by the Deputy failed to return with the documentation requested.  It is the case that as she did not produce the requested documentation, she is therefore residing illegally in the State.  The person concerned has continued to remain illegally in the State and the Immigration Division of my Department is dealing with this matter under Section 3 (4) of the Immigration Act 1999.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September, 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 has resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, adminis<Col N="242"/>trative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>

	<P>Garda Youth Diversion Projects are a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seek to divert young persons from becoming involved or further involved in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects.  By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within <Col N="243"/>communities and enhancing Garda/community relations.  The projects are funded by my Department and are administered by the Community Relations Section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>I secured additional funding of &euro;1.2 million for the projects in 2006, bringing the total amount of funding for the projects to &euro;6.6 million for the year.  It is my intention to expand the scheme to 100 projects nationwide before the end of 2007.  The first phase of this expansion programme is currently being implemented with the establishment of 10 new projects recently, bringing the total number of projects currently established to 74.  I hope to be soon in a position to announce the establishment of a further 10 projects.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner considers applications in accordance with the Garda Youth Diversion Project Guidelines drawn up in 2003 and brings forward proposals for the establishment of projects based on local need.  Factors which are taken into consideration include increases in juvenile crime and the number of cases dealt with by the Juvenile Diversion Programme.</P>
        <P>There is currently one Garda Youth Diversion Project in Tipperary, the CYD Project which is located in Clonmel.  This project has been allocated &euro;81,300 in funding for 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Stamp Duty is a charge on documents, which are mostly legal documents, used in the transfer of property.  Where a property is purchased, stamp duty is charged on the conveyance or transfer effecting change of legal ownership of the property concerned.  If there is no conveyance, there is no stamp duty.  A builder or developer can, therefore, obtain a licence from a vendor to build on land owned by the vendor without incurring a stamp duty charge at that stage of the venture.  Once the buildings, whether commercial or residential, are completed, the conveyances or transfers of such properties to purchasers are chargeable to stamp duty in the normal manner unless specific exemptions are available to such purchasers, for example first time buyers.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their review of the use of such measures by developers, builders etc. is ongoing and they will advise me of the outcome of the review as soon as it is completed.  As advised on in a previous reply on 27 September, it should be noted however that, as the documentation in relation to such arrangements does not have to be stamped, the information necessary to establish the extent of these practices is not readily available to Revenue.  Revenue are progressing the review in a broader context as part of their project on the construction sector in 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In Budget 2005, I announced a special stamp duty relief relating to an exchange of farm land between two farmers for the purposes of consolidating each farmer&rsquo;s holding. The relief is contained in section 121 of the Finance Act 2005 which provides that no stamp duty will be charged on an exchange of such lands where the lands are of equal value. In a case where the lands exchanged are not of equal value, stamp duty will only be charged on the amount of the difference in the value of the lands concerned.</P>
        <P>The scheme was introduced on 1 July 2005 for a period of 2 years.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that from 1 July 2005 to 31 December 2005 there were two cases of farm consolidation relief.  In 2006, from 1 January to 31 September there were 12 cases.</P>
        <P>At the Partnership talks earlier this year it was agreed to look at the possibility of extending this relief to cases where only one farmer is consolidating his/her farm holdings.  However, as was stated at the time, such a measure will probably need EU Commission approval, which may be difficult to achieve.</P>

	<P>In November 1977 the Minister for Health established the Expert Medical Group on Whooping Cough Vaccination to examine persons who, it was claimed, had been permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination, to review the medical information available in relation to them and to indicate whether, in its opinion, the damage was attributable to the vaccination.</P>
        <P>Of the 93 cases presented to the Expert Group, the Group found that there was a reasonable probability that the vaccine was responsible for damage in 16 of these cases.  Where there was a reasonable doubt in any case, the Group gave the benefit of that doubt to that person.  In 1982, an offer of an ex-gratia payment of &pound;10,000 was made in 14 cases with a further 2 offers in 1984.  There was no acceptance of liability on the part of the State or any public authority.

	<P>In recent reports Diabetes: Prevention and Model for Patient Care and the Diabetes Federation of Ireland publication Diabetes: Securing the future the issue of a structured retinopathy screening programme has been identified as a priority for Irish patients.</P>
        <P>The HSE is responding to the Diabetes policy Diabetes: Prevention and Model for Patient Care published by the Department of Health and Children in 2006 and its specific recommendations.  The key issue in screening for diabetic retinopathy is to identify those people with sight threatening retinopathy who may require preventative treatment.  There are two main approaches to screening for diabetic retinopathy</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Opthalmoscopy and biomicroscopy</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Retinal photography and subsequent grading</P>
        <P FLI="0">Screening is usually provided in stationary centres and/or mobile units. In Ireland there is a mobile community unit providing services in the North West. This programme uses digital imaging as the preferred method of screening. Preliminary results are coming back and the HSE are reviewing these at the moment.</P>
        <P>At present in the North East region a pilot retinal screening programme for type two diabetics enrolled in the Diabetes Watch scheme is in progress but this currently only covers approximately 1000 diabetics.  This service is a mobile service <Col N="261"/>and involves digital retinal photography. It is nurse run and led by a community ophthalmologist with specialist training in retinal disease management.  It is linked directly into treatment of detected diabetes in the public hospital system.</P>
        <P>An Expert Advisory Group is to be established shortly within the HSE in order to prioritise Diabetes care. This group will act as advisors to the CEO and the HSE and will determine the appropriate strategy and monitor the effectiveness of its implementation through the HSE. One of the priorities identified by the HSE is the roll out of a retinopathy screening programme.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 &mdash; 2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.  </P>
        <P>The NCIP is a key element of the National Childcare Strategy 2006-2010 and is effective from 1 January 2006. Unlike the existing EOCP, the NCIP is entirely Exchequer funded.  The decision by the Government to create a major new 5 year investment programme immediately, rather than wait until the EOCP expired, is evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the provision of quality childcare.</P>
        <P>The NCIP aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality childcare supports and services, which are grounded in an understanding of local needs.  The Programme has a budget of &euro;575 million for the 5 year period 2006-2010, with a target to create 50,000 additional childcare places and with a greater focus on pre-<Col N="263"/>school places for 3 to 4 year olds and school age childcare. The 50,000 new places will include 5,000 after school places and 10,000 pre-school education places aimed at 3 to 4 year olds.</P>
        <P>The City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) now play a key role in the implementation of the NCIP 2006-2010, to enable greater flexibility and responsiveness to local needs.  As a result, additional funding has been allocated for the implementation of their 2006 Supplementary Action Plans and the recruitment of additional staff to take account of the CCC&rsquo;s expanded role under the NCIP.</P>
        <P>&euro;13.8 million has been allocated under the NCIP to end September 2006. The funding allocated is expected to lead to the creation of over 6,600 new childcare places and to support or enhance over 1,660 existing places.</P>

The results of this research are available on the Department&rsquo;s website &mdash; <i>www.dohc.ie</i>  in presentation format. The research found that a newborn baby weighing 3 kg would have to drink 15 litres of water fluoridated at 1 part per million to ingest the level of fluoride associated with any ill effects.</P>
        <P>The research findings also showed that fluoridated water is safe for use in baby food; fluoride intake is well within the safe level; that the mean acute exposure of infants to fluoride in areas served by fluoridated water supplies was estimated to be between 0.11 and 0.14 mg/kg weight per day and that these predicted intakes were well below the intake of fluoride associated with acute toxic effects (5mg fluoride (F(-)/kg body weight).</P>

The Bill is included in Section C of the Government&rsquo;s Legislative Programme for Autumn 2006 for technical reasons.  However, having carried out a public consultation process on the draft Heads and General Scheme of the Bill, I will now be submitting proposals to Government for its approval shortly.   </P>
        <P>My Department has been working very closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and work is at an advanced stage on the draft provisions.  As I told the House last week in response to a Parliamentary Question from Deputy Timmons,  I intend to publish the Bill before the end of the year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 212, 213 and 215 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland.  Government policy is to achieve best outcomes for patients based on all aspects of cancer care, surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy delivered by multi-disciplinary teams based around major centres.  The Government decided in July 2005 that the best option for improving geographic access for patients in the North West to radiation oncology services is to (i) facilitate access to Belfast City Hospital (BCH) and (ii) to progress consideration of a joint venture for the provision of oncology services in the medium term to patients in the North West from a satellite centre in the North West linked to BCH.</P>
        <P>Last Autumn, I agreed with the then Minister for Health for Northern Ireland that the radiation oncology centre at BCH would provide treatment for patients from Donegal.  A Project Board was established under the aegis of Co-operation and Working Together (CAWT) to deliver on this commitment.  It included representatives from BCH, Altnagelvin, Letterkenny, the HSE and both Departments.  At the last meeting of the British Irish Inter Governmental Council on 24 October 2006, it was announced that agreement has been reached for the referral of about 50 radiation oncology patients annually from Donegal to BCH.  It has also been agreed that the number <Col N="273"/>will be increased if there is sufficient demand from patients in Donegal. Patient pathways have been developed and the HSE and BCH have agreed the basis for costing the service provided by BCH.  The costs will be proportional to the number of Donegal patients treated by BCH, taking into account the full cost of BCH&rsquo;s service to all patients treated, both local and from Donegal.  The first referral clinic is scheduled to take place today.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is aware that the Government adopted the key recommendations of the report by the Independent Group established to examine the implications of fully aligning the management of the wild salmon fishery with the scientific advice in 2007 and beyond. The central recommendation of this report is the creation of a hardship fund for those affected by the compulsory cessation of indiscriminate mixed stock fishing at sea.  The Government&rsquo;s primary <Col N="274"/>motivation in adopting the report is that of conservation of the wild salmon species, which has long been regarded as one of Ireland&rsquo;s most prized fish. It is vital to afford every protection to the remaining salmon stocks and to clearly prioritise conservation over catch. The current imperative must be to maintain stocks above conservation limits or at the very least halt the observed decline.</P>
        <P>The Government realise that these proposals will entail hardship for commercial fishermen and vulnerable coastal communities. To offset this they have established a hardship fund for those affected. This fund, worth over &euro;25 million, will be available to:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />All those subject to a compulsory closure of their current commercial fishery, namely the holders of drift-net licences and some draft net licence holders.</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />On a voluntary basis, to all those engaged in draft-net, loop-net, bag-net, snap-net, and head-weir fishing</P>
        <P FLI="0">The level of payments will be determined as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Payments should be based on the average verifiable (tag return) catch for each licence holder for the past 5 years (2001-2005).</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Payments should be based on the average net income per sal mon in the commercial drift and draft-net fishery for the past 5 years (2001-2005). This is estimated to be &euro;23 per salmon.</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Each individual licence holder should receive 6 times their average catch multiplied by the average net income per salmon.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In all cases a payment equal to 6 times the current licence fee in respect of each licence surrendered will be made. For example, in the case of drift-net fishermen, this equals a payment of &euro;2,022. In the case of draft-net fishermen participating in the voluntary scheme the payment will be &euro;1,140.</P>
        <P>In every case, those who avail of the hardship fund:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Will no longer be eligible to apply for a commercial salmon licence.</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Must verifiably decommission their net(s) or fixed fishing engines to the satisfaction of the competent authority.</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Must comply with any other reasonable conditions required to manage the fishery.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The hardship fund will be managed on an administrative basis by BIM and the Regional Fisheries Boards over a three-year period.</P>
        <P>The Government has also put in place an additional &euro;5 million fund that will be available for a community support scheme. This support scheme will be designed to aid the development <Col N="275"/>of those communities where the impact of the cessation of drift netting will be hardest felt and provide alternative employment and economic opportunities for those affected.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The detailed breakdown of information requested by the deputy about the catch by geographical location (fisheries district) is available <Col N="276"/>in the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Fisheries Statistics Report published annually by the Central Fisheries Board and available on their website.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, I appointed an Independent Group to examine the implications of alignment of management of the wild salmon fishery with the scientific advice for r the commercial salmon fishing sector in 2007 and beyond. The Independent group, in their report published recently, calculated the average net income per salmon in the commercial drift and draft net fishery for the past five years (2001 to 2005) and estimated this to be &euro;23 per salmon. The income derived from fishing by each licence holder is dependent on the catch over the period.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the estimates his Department has of the number of wild salmon being killed annually in Irish coastal waters, estuaries and rivers as a result of infestation by sea lice; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past 15 years the overall marine survival of wild salmon has declined. I am advised that survival of salmon at sea is influenced by many factors including changes in the marine environment itself, predation by marine mammals, seabirds and fish, parasites and diseases, competition for food, by-catch in non-directed other fisheries. It is not possible to completely disaggregate the proportion of the mortality associated with each specific mortality factor.</P>
        <P>I understand, however, that in the early 1990&rsquo;s when increased sea trout mortality was associated with greatly increased sea lice levels on the fish no equivalent problem was recorded from salmon. Recent Norwegian studies have indicated that treatment of migrating salmon smolts prior to release may improve survival, however, similar Irish studies are not complete. Research work undertaken by the Central Fisheries Board over the 2003-2006 period, as part of an EU programme, has shown that there has been differential return of treated and untreated hatchery salmon smolts returning to the coast as grilse using the in-feed treatment &lsquo;Slice&rsquo; against sea lice infestation. This data suggests that sea lice inferred a mortality factor on out-migrating hatchery salmon smolts but it is difficult to extrapolate from the results of this experiment the numbers of wild salmon smolts being killed by sea lice infestation.</P>

        <P>The Government recognise that these proposals will entail hardship for commercial fishermen and vulnerable coastal communities. To offset this they have established a hardship fund for those affected. It is not compulsory to apply for this scheme. The Independent Group estimated that if all drift net fishermen currently engaged in the mixed stock fishery and approximately  50% of draft net and other salmon fishermen were to cease fishing and apply for payment from the fund this would cost in the region of &euro;25m. I expect the National Salmon Commission to bring forward shortly their recommendations for management of the wild salmon fishery in 2007 based on the advice of its Standing Scientific Committee and the National Fishery Managers Executive. This will identify, in compliance with the Habitats Directive, the extent of the exploitable surplus of fish for 2007.</P>

	<P>On the 26th of April 2006, the Labour Court made a recommendation regarding the redundancy terms for Irish Sugar workers at the Mallow plant.  The recommendation provided that redundancy should be 5 weeks&rsquo; pay per year of service, where a week&rsquo;s pay would be defined as actual finishing salary, excluding overtime, plus statutory redundancy entitlement, plus a bonus payment for an orderly wind-down.</P>
        <P>The Court issued two clarifications in May, but these failed to achieve a resolution to the dispute.</P>
        <P>The Labour Court invited the parties to return to the Court with a view to resolving the dispute.  However, the company rejected the Court&rsquo;s invitation.  I very much regret the decision taken by the company in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Labour Court issued a third clarification of its Recommendation on the 17th of October 2006.  The company has indicated that it is not prepared to alter its offer.  Similarly, the trade unions have not changed their position and are not prepared to accept the company&rsquo;s existing offer.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Minister Miche&aacute;l Martin, has met with representatives of both the trade unions and the company and urged them to resolve their differences and to avail of the dispute settling machinery of the State, as necessary.  I have also <Col N="281"/>met with union representatives to discuss this matter.  The National Implementation Body has also worked with the parties concerned to seek to identify an agreed procedure to resolve the issue in dispute.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes is a matter for the parties involved.  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing a solution on the parties to an industrial dispute.</P>
        <P>Where the Labour Court operates as an industrial relations tribunal in trade disputes, its recommendations are not enforceable.  In such cases, the Court hears both sides and then issues a recommendation setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it considers the dispute should be settled.  While these recommendations are not binding on the parties concerned, the parties are expected to give serious consideration to the Court&rsquo;s recommendation.  As the Labour Court is a Court of last resort in the industrial relations process, it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and, consequently, are prepared to accept the outcome of the process, namely, the Labour Court recommendation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Budget 2006 contained a number of important measures designed to target resources at particular groups of older people, including farmers. In considering these measures I was anxious to target resources at those who are at the greatest risk of poverty, to encourage saving, and to simplify the system of income support for older people who do not receive contributory pensions.</P>
        <P>One of the key measures that I was pleased to announce on Budget day, was the establishment of a single standardised pension scheme with a greatly enhanced means testing regime. In September, the State Pension (Non-Contributory) replaced the old age pension and, for recipients aged 66 and over, blind pension, widow/er&rsquo;s pension, one parent family payment, deserted wife&rsquo;s allowance and prisoner&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>All the schemes in question featured a common means disregard of &euro;7.60 per week, which was not <Col N="282"/>increased since the 1970s. The means disregard for the new non-contributory pension is now &euro;20 per week, an increase of &euro;12.40 per week. Over 30,000 pensioners who were in receipt of a reduced rate of payment gained from this change with increases of up to &euro;12.50 per week in the personal rate of payment and increases in the qualified adult rate, where applicable, of up to &euro;8.30 per week. I should point out that these increases were in addition to the increase of &euro;16 per week in the rate of old age non-contributory pension which took effect from January 2006. Furthermore, the new State Pension (Non-Contributory) also features an innovative disregard of &euro;100 per week in respect of earnings from employment. These measures benefit all those farmers who were in receipt of an old age (non-contributory) pension, as well as entitling some to a means tested pension for the first time.</P>
        <P>Consequent on the increase in the means disregard to &euro;20 per week, a single person, with no other means, is now able to have up to &euro;35,000 in capital and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate. This figure is doubled in the case of a pensioner couple.</P>
        <P>By any standards, the levels of increases and revised means test arrangements announced in Budget 2006 are exceptional. The modernisation of these arrangements through the introduction of the new state pension is also a further demonstration of our commitment to all those who are elderly including farmers.</P>
        <P>Further improvements will fall to be considered in the context of the forthcoming Budget.</P>

        <Quest> the cost of doubling the &euro;51 maximum of income over the contributory pen<Col N="283"/>sion rate which is used to decide eligibility for the fuel scheme; and if he will consider such a measure in the forthcoming budget in view of the increase in the cost of heating fuels. </Quest>
        <QRef>[36800/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person&rsquo;s normal heating expenses.  It is estimated that some 274,000 people (151,000 with basic fuel allowance and 123,000 with smokeless fuel supplement) will benefit in 2006 at an estimated annual cost &euro;125.1m.</P>
        <P>Eligibility to the fuel allowance scheme is subject to means and other conditions.  People in receipt of contributory pensions which are not means tested, may have a combined household income of up to &euro;51 per week or savings/investments of up to &euro;46,000 or, over and above the maximum rate of state pension (contributory) and still qualify for fuel allowance.  This income limit was increased to &euro;51 per week with effect from 1 June 2005.  The fuel allowance income limits increase each season in line with the increases in the rate of the state pension (contributory).</P>
        <P>The cost to the exchequer from raising the qualifying threshold as outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question would depend on the extra numbers who would apply and qualify for the fuel allowance as a result of the measure. An accurate quantification of these numbers is not readily available but it is estimated that it could cost approximately &euro;4 million.  Any such proposal will be fully considered in the context of other priorities and of the resources available for social welfare improvements generally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a <Col N="284"/>rent supplement to assist eligible people who are unable to provide for their immediate accommodation needs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
        <P>Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur. Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels.  This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the Health Service Executive may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent levels as an exceptional measure, for example:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances for example, disabled persons in specially-adapted accommodation or homeless persons,</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />where the tenant will be in a position to re-assume responsibility for his/her rent within a short period,</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />where the person concerned is entitled to an income disregard AND has sufficient income to meet his or her basic needs after paying rent, taking into account the appropriate rate of rent supplement that is otherwise payable in the case.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.</P>
        <P>In November 2002, when the Central Statistics Office Privately Owned Rent Index first showed evidence of continued reductions in rent levels, regulations were introduced to set the maximum amount of rent in respect of which a rent supplement is payable.  These limits remained in place to the end of December 2003.  Further Regulations introduced in December 2003 and prescribed the limits to be used between January 2004 and June 2005.  The current rent limits cover the period July 2005 to 31st December 2006.</P>
        <P>Despite recent increases in rent levels the Central Statistics Office Privately Owned Rent Index shows that rent levels for September 2006 were in line with those which applied in November 2002.</P>
        <P>My Department is in regular contact with the community welfare staff of the Health Service Executive regarding the various elements of the scheme.  In the course of these ongoing contacts, the prescribed upper limits on rent levels supported under the rent supplement scheme have not emerged as having a detrimental impact on the ability of eligible tenants generally to secure <Col N="285"/>suitable rented accommodation to meet their needs.</P>
        <P>My Department are currently reviewing levels of rent limits in order to develop proposals regarding what limits should apply from January 2007 onwards.  The review is taking account of prevailing rent levels in the private rental sector generally, together with detailed input from the Health Service Executive on the market situation within each of its operational areas.</P>
        <P>The review will also include consultation with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  In addition, a number of the voluntary agencies working in this area have made detailed submissions.  This process will ensure that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country, and that they will continue to enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs.</P>
        <P>The introduction of rent limits by regulation has had a positive impact on the rental market in general by limiting unjustified increases in rent tenants.</P>
        <P>It is not necessary for tenants to make up shortfalls in rents, given that the limits are reasonable, they have been reviewed regularly and there is provision for exceptions to be made where necessary.</P>

	<P>The random drug driving testing scheme referred to by the Deputy is limited in application.  It is based on saliva and the test is carried out at the roadside for the presence of methamphetamine and cannabis only.  While this is an important step forward, there is no feasible basis yet in Europe for the introduction of a scheme of preliminary roadside testing for drugs. Testing devices are still in the prototype stages. At a meeting of the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in July 2006, representatives from all over Europe addressed the issue of random drug test<Col N="288"/>ing of drivers at the roadside in the light of the most up to date developments throughout this region.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na participated in that seminar, which concluded that there is currently no device considered to be reliable enough in order to be recommended for roadside saliva screening of drivers for drugs.  Even in countries were there is a significant detection of driving under the influence of drugs (Norway being a prime example), no random roadside drug testing is yet in place.  The Medical Bureau is keeping abreast of developments in this area. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have made clear in the past, funding is being made available under Transport 21 for the development of park and ride facilities, which are an important component in persuading people to transfer from private cars to public transport.  All new station developments on the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann commuter networks are designed to include car-park facilities.  This is the case, for example, in respect of new stations on the Kildare line being developed as part of the Kildare Route Project and in Cork as part of the Cork Commuter Services Project.</P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have also been extending car parking facilities at all locations where the company has land available. Parking extensions are currently under way at Mallow, Ennis, and Leixlip Louisa Bridge. My Department is currently funding, as part of Transport 21, a study by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann into the prioritisation of car-park initiatives across the rail network, with a view to developing a strategic, programmed approach to the future provision of car park facilities.  This study will inform the development of car parking facilities under Transport 21. There are currently four Park and Ride sites along the existing Luas network at Red Cow, Sandyford, Stillorgan and Ballally.  The RPA propose to <Col N="290"/>open a new park and ride facility adjacent to the Luas Tallaght stop within the next two years with a similar mode of transfer and an anticipated capacity of 450 spaces.</P>
        <P>Metro North, the preferred route for which was announced last month, will have two park and ride sites providing parking for over 2,000 cars. One will be located at Lissenhall, north of Swords, and a second at Metro Park, between the Airport and the M50. The Luas extension from Sandyford to Cherrywood, for which I granted a Railway Order during the summer, will have a park and ride site at Carrickmines providing 300 spaces. I also expect that there will be a significant park and ride located at the junction of the N11 and the Luas extension from Cherrywood to the Bray area. The potential routes for this extension are the subject of an ongoing public consultation process by the RPA. I understand that there will also be substantial additional park and ride facilities at key locations along the route of Metro West where it meets national primary routes such as the N2, N3 and N4.</P>
        <P>I am also making funding available to the local authorities under Transport 21 for bus park and ride. To date this year, I have received no applications from local authorities for the development of park and ride facilities but I understand that several authorities are considering possible sites.</P>

As the Deputy is aware, the NRA is now in the process of procuring a barrier free toll system which will become operational with one tolling point in 2008. The installation of barrier free tolling is a crucial element of the M50 upgrade which is underway at present. NTR will be compensated in accordance with the existing West-Link Agreement. The exact details of the arrangements, including compensation, remain to be finalised <Col N="291"/>between NRA and NTR and as these discussions are ongoing at present, I would not wish to pre-empt their outcome.</P>

	<P>Transport 21 provides for the development of seven Luas projects over its 10 year timeframe and includes an appropriate budget provision for their implementation.  The projects will be funded through a combination of direct Exchequer funding to the RPA, Public Private Partnerships, development levies and developer contributions. I have continually stated publicly that I am not in a position to release details of the costs for Transport 21 projects because the details are commercially sensitive from the point of view of protecting public funds and getting best value for money.  Consideration will be given to the release of information regarding the costings of the proposed Luas projects after the signing of the contracts for the projects.</P>

	<P>I was pleased to launch the report, to which the Deputy refers, last week.  The campaign was brought about through a unique alliance of groups and agencies working on the frontline on drugs issues in the area in question and funded by my Department through the Local Drugs Task Force.  The main function of the campaign was to gather information about drug dealing and to ensure that the information reached the Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>The Garda&iacute; have confirmed that much information was generated by the campaign, especially in its earlier stage, and that a significant amount of this information was useful.  Following on from the evaluation of the campaign, the steering group has proposed, as one of a number of recommendations, that the campaign be piloted countrywide.  The recommendations arising are now to be considered by the National Drugs Strategy Team and on receipt of their views I will consider the matter further.</P>
        <P>In considering the matter going forward I will be particularly interested in the views of the Dept of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It may be the case that initiatives such as this have maximum impact when strongly targeted at specific local areas for defined short periods, rather than being rolled out generally with no specific timeframe.</P>

	<P>The person named applied for an allocation of entitlements from the Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under category B.</P>
        <P>Category B caters for farmers who, between 1 January, 2000 and 19 October, 2003 made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000-2002.  Investments can include purchase or long-term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.</P>
        <P>The person named applied under the investment category in respect of the construction of a slatted shed and while his application was initially refused it has since been reviewed following the receipt of further information and now has been deemed to be successful.

	<P>Around 640,000 tonnes of poultrymeat was imported into the EU last year, the equivalent of approximately 6% of consumption.  These imports are permitted in accordance with the EU&rsquo;s WTO obligations and are in full conformity with the comprehensive veterinary standards applicable to such products.</P>
        <P>Unprocessed third country poultrymeat must bear an indication of the name of its country of origin on the label.  It is an offence to mislead the consumer to a material degree in regard to the origin of the meat.</P>
        <P>The concept of substantial transformation is the basis used throughout the EU and elsewhere <Col N="298"/>to define the origin of goods as being from the country where the last substantial economic change was made to them. In my view it should not be used to disguise the origin of certain products or to mislead the consumer as to the origin of raw materials. I have made my concerns in this respect known to the European Commission both in the context of the review being carried out by them on &ldquo;Labelling, competitiveness, consumer information, better regulation for the EU&rdquo; and in the Council of Ministers as well as in bilateral contact with Commissioners Fischer Boel and Kyprianou.</P>
        <P>My intention on poultrymeat labelling is to seek to require in law that information on &lsquo;country of origin&rsquo; be provided on all poultrymeat at retail level including that coming from other EU Member States and to examine the possibility of extending that to poultrymeat products with a substantial element of poultrymeat in them.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has opposed Member States introducing legislation in this area that is in excess of common EU requirements.  Nonetheless, my Department is at present in the process of drafting new regulations to require operators to provide country of origin information on poultrymeat, pigmeat and sheepmeat.  It is my intention to submit these regulations, when they are finalised, to the European Commission for approval as required by EU legislation. I will also continue to press the Commission to introduce compulsory country of origin labelling on all meats at EU level.</P>

	<P>My Department provides a range of supports to second level schools to enable them to cater for students with special educational needs. The supports in question include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over key functions from the Department of Education and Science in relation to special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1 October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The Council acts under the broad policy direction of the Department of Education and Science but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities/special needs.</P><Col N="299"/>
        <P>The provision of speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and other health related supports is a matter for the Health Service Executive.  However, the NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities/special needs.</P>
        <P>The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Deciding on applications for special needs assistant (SNA) hours;</P>
    <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. Students attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</P>
        <P>The NCSE, through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</P>
        <P>The NCSE has confirmed that additional teaching resources have been granted to the school in question to cater for the special educational needs of pupils enrolled, including the pupil referred to by the Deputy.  An application for assistive technology for the pupil in question has also been received and is currently being processed by the SENO.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require.</P>

	<P>My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students. These are the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees&rsquo; Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses. The Higher Education Grants Scheme is administered by the Local Authorities. The other three schemes are administered by the Vocational Education Committees. The process of assessing eligibility for third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. I am not aware of any specific delays being experienced by third level students in the Waterford. Among the factors which give rise to delays in processing applications is where the administering body is awaiting further information/ documentation from applicants, or applicants have failed to submit complete application forms.</P>
        <P>My Department in recognition of the importance of the timely provision of payment to eligible students is engaged in on-going consultations with the Irish Vocational Education Association and the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association with a view to enhancing the existing arrangements and ensure the earlier processing of applications and the making of payments to eligible students. In this regard, a working group with representatives from both Associations was established last year. The broad terms of reference of this group is to examine on-going operational issues with the current system of administration of the schemes. Issues in relation to the <Col N="301"/>early payments of grants to eligible students are a priority for the group.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that in accordance with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students in higher education. This will, I believe, provide for a more coherent administration system which will facilitate consistency of application, improved client accessibility and ensure the timely delivery of grants to those who need them most.</P>
        <P>The arrangements to be put in place will involve clearly defined targets for the delivery of a quality and timely service to applicants for maintenance grants, including the expeditious payment of grants to applicants who comply with the terms of the schemes. The arrangements for the future administration will, as I have previously indicated, be provided for in a new statutory framework through a Student Support Bill, which is currently being drafted.</P>

        <P>After deducting some &euro;2.5 million expenditure incurred under the ad-hoc scheme and allowing for interest of some &euro;0.75 million, the Education Finance Board had a net fund of approximately &euro;11 million at its disposal on establishment. This money is being managed by the National Treasury Management Agency on behalf of the Board.</P>
        <P>The functions of the Board are laid down in Section 25 of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Act 2005. The principal functions are:</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) to pay grants to former residents of institutions and their relatives to assist them in availing of educational services:</P>
        <P LI="1">(b) to determine and publish the criteria by reference to which it will make decisions on applications for the payment of such grants, and</P>
        <P LI="1">(c) to make available to the persons aforesaid information in relation to the educational services in respect of which grants are payable.</P>

	<P el="0">Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s Post-Primary School Transport Scheme, a pupil is eligible for school transport if s/he resides 4.8 kilometres or more from the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which s/he resides.</P>
        <P>The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside. However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area &mdash; otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children are required to make their way to the nearest pick-up point within that catchment area.</P>
        <P>My Department has been informed by the Transport Liaison Officer for County Clare that the students referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied have applied for catchment boundary transport. My Department also understands that there are no spare seats available on the relevant transport service to accommodate these students. However, as the position with regard to spare seats may change from term to term, the parent/students should keep in touch with the local Bus &Eacute;ireann office in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  There are now 4000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.  Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and <Col N="308"/>we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.</P>

	<P>In 1997 agreement was reached with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces.  This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, <Col N="317"/>provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years.  Extensions from 5 to 9 years and from 9 to 12 years were subject to the individual soldier meeting certain criteria including standards of medical and physical fitness, conduct and courses attended or period of overseas service.    In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994.  Following detailed and prolonged discussion on this claim a set of criteria has been agreed.  The criteria meet PDFORRA&rsquo;s desire to provide longer careers in the Permanent Defence Force while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s previously stated objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern defence forces.  The criteria require that any person re-engaging must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis.  Re-engagements will be subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.</P>
        <P>Following a ballot of all post 1994 personnel PDFORRA have advised that their members accepted the agreed criteria for re-engagement (after 12 years&rsquo; service) and continuance in service (after 21 years&rsquo; service).  As a result personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994 may now serve beyond the current 12 year limit.</P>
        <P>The maximum service periods for other ranks enlisted after 1 January 1994 are as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service.</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years and to the age of fifty-six in all higher ranks.</P>

	<P>The detailed <Col N="319"/>information sought is not available in my Department.  National waste statistics for all waste streams are published by the Environmental Protection Agency.  National Waste Reports were published in respect of the years 1998, 2001 and 2004.  Two interim database reports have been published to provide data on municipal waste specifically (i.e. household and commercial waste) for the years 2002 and 2003 respectively.  An interim Report in respect of 2005 will be published shortly by the Agency.  As outlined in successive National Waste Reports, the general situation in Ireland is that we are substantially reliant on foreign based materials recycling infrastructure, which dealt with 73.8% of recycled waste in 2004.</P>
        <P>The roll out of producer responsibility schemes is contributing to increased recycling capacity and associated new jobs in Ireland. The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations have led to a surge in the collection rates for this waste stream, the creation of over 200 jobs and the provision of three new WEEE reprocessing facilities in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The National Waste Report 2004 states that 33.4% of municipal waste was recovered in that year compared with 9% in 1998.  The total quantity of material exported for recycling was 891,240 tonnes.  Spain and the UK are the principal destinations for recyclables exported from Ireland for subsequent reprocessing, accounting for some 82% of total exports in this area.  Europe as a whole accounts for almost 92% of all recyclable waste exported from Ireland for further treatment with the remaining 8% exported to the Asian continent (China being the principal recipient) for reprocessing.</P>
        <P>The export of waste is regulated by local authorities, in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No. 259/93 of 1 February 1993 on the supervision and control of waste within, into and out of, the European Community.  In this context, it should be noted that clean segregated materials are a sought after resource which are freely traded under EU and international law.</P>
<P>While international trade in waste is consistent with Government policy insofar as it supports improved performance in recycling, the Government also recognises the value of a more developed recycling infrastructure in Ireland.  To this effect, a Market Development Group was established by Government in 2004 with a view to identifying market opportunities for materials recovered for recycling.  The Programme which the Group is developing will identify new applications and markets for recyclable material and secondary recycled products. The Group has been asked to identify barriers to the use and marketing of recyclable material and to develop strategies to address these.</P>
        <P>The work of the Group is currently focusing on three priority waste streams: paper, plastic and compost. Among the key issues to be addressed <Col N="320"/>are promoting stable demand for recovered materials and supporting the achievement of economies of scale in the production of products made from recycled materials.</P>
<P>The Market Development Programme is being finalised at present for publication early in 2007.</P>

	<P>Local authorities and the Health Service Executive are responsible for meeting the accommodation and health care needs of homeless persons. The Government&rsquo;s Integrated and Preventative Strategies on Homelessness provide the framework within which the agencies fulfil these responsibilities.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made in the Dublin area over the last number of years in providing for and improving services to homeless persons. This has been facilitated in large part by the Homeless Agency, the partnership body responsible for the coordination of homeless services in Dublin.  Rough sleepers have been enabled to access emergency accommodation and homeless persons have been facilitated to move out of emergency accommodation into accommodation more suitable to their needs.</P>
        <P>Recent assessments indicate that there has been a welcome decrease in rough sleeping in Dublin over recent years. According to Counted In 2002, the assessment of homelessness in the Dublin area undertaken by the Homeless Agency in March 2002, 312 people self-reported that they had slept rough for four nights or more in the previous week. The number of persons self-reporting as having slept rough for four nights or more in the most recent assessment, Counted In 2005, undertaken by the Homeless Agency in March 2005, was 185 &mdash; a decrease of 40%.</P>
        <P>In relation to the overall number of homeless persons in Dublin, Counted In 2005 recorded that the number of homeless households in the Dublin area was 1,361 comprising some 2,015 persons and this represented a 19% reduction in the number of homeless households since the 2002 assessment. This was comparable with the experience of the Homeless Persons Unit which saw a 20% decrease in the number of households presenting as homeless in the same period.</P>
        <P>The Homeless Agency has as its overarching objective the elimination of long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough in Dublin by 2010. The Agency is currently in the process of finalising its Dublin Action Plan for the period <Col N="321"/>2007 to 2010, which will set out the means by which it will achieve this objective.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 327 and 352 together.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are responsible for meeting the accommodation needs of homeless persons.  It is a matter for individual authorities to determine the level and category of accommodation and related supports to be provided, having regard to the need for such services in their areas.  My Department recoups to local authorities 90% of their expenditure on accommodation and related services, including tenancy sustainment, for homeless persons in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.  Details of Section 10 expenditure by my Department over the past 10 years are set out in the table.</P>
        <P>The figures for 2004 and 2005 reflect a reorientation in homeless accommodation provision from high-cost short-term private emergency accommodation to transitional and longer term accommodation, coupled with a decline in homeless numbers, particularly in the Dublin area.  Local authorities operate a wide range of tenancy sustainment services for formerly homeless persons, including the employment of resettlement workers who engage in a variety of such activities.  My Department does not have a comprehensive listing of such services.  Examples of some recent tenancy sustainment initiatives include the Dublin City Tenancy Sustainment Service, established through the Homeless Agency and operated by Dublin Simon; and the Midlands Regional Settlement Service, operated by Midlands Simon; both of which have been approved for funding by my Department.</P>
        <P>In the context of the local authority Housing Action Plans 2004 to 2008, renewed focus is being placed on the provision of long-term accommodation together with the supports necessary to enable homeless persons to move into independent living.  Local authorities have been urged to address this issue in relation to their own accommodation and in discussions with the voluntary <Col N="322"/>sector active in the housing area.  The need for particular focus on the development of long-term accommodation, with necessary support services such as tenancy sustainment, as opposed to emergency homeless accommodation such as bed and breakfast, is one of the main recommendations of the Independent Review of Homeless Strategies, which was published earlier this year.  This issue will be taken forward in the context of a revised Government strategy on homelessness, which is being prepared by my Department.</P>

	<P>When I agreed action plans for social and affordable housing with local authorities in 2004, I also made provision for a mid-term review to be undertaken in 2006.  The review, which commenced earlier this year, focuses on examining how targets have been met in the first two years of the plan and on incorporating any adjustments for the remaining years of the plan, in light of outcomes including 2006 outputs, and the results of the recent Housing Needs Assessment.  The review process included meetings between officials from my Department and all local authorities as well as the preparation of review statements at local level.</P>
        <P>An Action Plan Working Group is being formed to carry out national analysis of the local reviews.  As well as examining outcomes to date, the Group will consider any actions required to improve delivery and monitoring of Action Plans.  This will ensure that the action plan process con<Col N="323"/>tinues to provide local authorities with a framework for the integrated and cohesive planning and delivery of social and affordable housing measures, based on their relevant housing strategy, over the coming years.</P>

	<P>Water services providers are required to recover the cost of providing water services from all non-domestic users <Col N="325"/>of these services in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s water pricing policy, reflecting the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive.  This requirement of cost recovery from the non-domestic sector involves the provision of meters, which are necessary to ensure that water charges to users relate to actual consumption and to incentivise all non-domestic users to manage and conserve their use of water.</P>
<P>Cost recovery for the provision of water services means that local authorities must calculate all the costs of providing water to non-domestic users, including meter installation costs, and recover that amount from the non-domestic sector.  While detailed guidelines have not yet issued from my Department on the way in which local authorities may secure cost recovery, I envisage that this will be done shortly based on the experience of a pilot billing project in one local authority area.</P>

	<P>In accordance with section 10 of the Roads Act 1993, the classification of public roads, which includes national and regional roads, is a function of my colleague, the Minister for Transport.  My Department has no responsibility in the matter.</P>
        <P>There is no statutory classification of strategic or non-strategic roads. My Department provides grants to road authorities under a number of grant categories to assist them in discharging their functions in relation to the improvement and maintenance of non-national roads. In this regard, there are two categories of grant for roads which are considered to be of strategic importance. One relates to a scheme of grants for which funding was approved in December, 2000. The aim of this Exchequer funded investment programme is to provide grant assistance for certain roads which facilitate housing and related development in the most densely populated areas of the country where housing needs are greatest.  The second grant category was introduced this year for non-national roads which make a significant contribution towards implementation of the National Spatial Strategy.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority which operates under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Transport.</P>

	<P>The provision and improvement of non-national roads in County Waterford is a matter for Waterford County Council to be financed from its own resources supplemented by State grants provided by my Department. Grants totalling &euro;635,091 were provided by my Department to Waterford County Council for this project over the period 2003 to 2005. In 2006, a grant of &euro;366,000 was allocated to the Council for the project under the new grants scheme for strategic non-national roads which support the National Spatial Strategy.</P>
<P>Waterford County Council wrote to my Department earlier this year requesting an increase in the rate of funding for the R708 Access Road to Waterford Airport from 75% to 100%. On 16 October, 2006, I also received a letter from my colleague, the Minister for Transport, in support of this application. In order that the matter could be examined, my Department requested the Council to submit further details including income from development contributions and projected expenditure on the scheme.  A reply has recently been received from the Council and the matter is currently being examined in my Department.</P>

	<P>The National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste promotes the reuse of textiles.  In particular it advises householders to bring good quality textiles to charity and second-hand shops and encourages local authorities to accept waste textiles at recycling centres.    There is currently competition between organisations for donations of textiles.   Householders should exercise caution in relation to door-to-door collections of second-hand clothes.  Genuine charities may benefit from such collections but bogus operators may undermine traditional charity shops.</P>
        <P>A local authority has adequate powers to control such activities if it is of the opinion that a person is collecting waste for the purposes of reward, with a view to profit, or otherwise in the course of business. Section 34(1) of the Waste Management Act 1996 requires that any such person must obtain a waste collection permit from the relevant local authority.  A waste collection permit is needed for each region in which the person intends to collect waste.  It is a matter for individual local authorities to decide if an individual / business is involved in the collection, transport <Col N="328"/>or storage of waste.   In making their decision, local authorities are guided by the definition of waste which is set down in the Waste Management Act 1996.</P>
        <P>A charitable organisation that wishes to source textiles, either by way of a collection service or by providing bring banks, should discuss the matter in the first instance with the relevant local authority.</P>

	<P>The provision of a fire service, including the assessment of fire cover needs and the allocation of the appropriate level of resources to meet those needs, is a statutory function of the individual fire authorities and my Department has no direct role in this matter.  My Department supports the local fire authorities through the setting of general policy, the provision of capital funding, the issue of guidance to fire authorities in relation to fire prevention and operational matters, and other such initiatives.  I have no plans to provide any funding to local authorities to facilitate the holding of bonfires at Halloween or otherwise, as the concerns involved related not only to public safety but also to air quality and emission controls.</P>
        <P>Over the past 25 years, almost &euro;240 million has been provided to local fire authorities under the fire services capital programme for the provision of new and refurbished fire stations and the purchase of fire appliances and other equipment.  This sustained investment means that the fire authorities are very well equipped to address the full range of risks to which they are likely to be exposed.  At this stage, over two-thirds of our fire stations, including almost all of the busiest stations, have been replaced, we have a modern fleet of front-line fire appliances, and we have a modern emergency response communications system.  In the current year almost &euro;20 million was allocated to the Fire Services capital programme; this allocation is being used to further modernise and update the resources available to the fire authorities.  In addition, since 2001, my Department has provided almost &euro;4.2 billion in general purpose grants to assist the local authorities in carrying out their statutory functions, including the provision of fire services.</P>

        <P>In December 2005, the Government launched a new Housing Policy Framework: Building Sustainable Communities, which outlines key principles underpinning housing policy and investment over the coming years.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 354 and 355 together.</P>
        <P>The loan limit for the Shared Ownership Scheme was reviewed and increased with effect from 1 January 2006.  The maximum loan that may be advanced by a local authority in respect of the share of the dwelling being purchased (minimum 40%) is &euro;185,000.   While the cost of a dwelling may substantially exceed this amount, the borrower&rsquo;s income must be sufficient to meet the financial commitments involved under the scheme.   Accordingly, local authorities may also <Col N="333"/>apply a house purchase price upper limit to reflect local market conditions, to ensure priority of funding for lower income groups and to avoid any significant impact on house prices in their area.</P>
        <P>Local authorities assess each application for shared ownership on its merits, having regard, in particular, to the applicant&rsquo;s ability to make the necessary mortgage and rent payments.  They ensure, in determining the level of finance approved or house price, that monthly outgoings do not exceed 35% of net household income.</P>
        <P>Returns provided to my Department by local authorities indicate that in the twelve months ending 30 June 2006, a total of &euro;115.3 million was drawn down in respect of 708 borrowers under the Shared Ownership Scheme.  Detailed information on the number of applicants and number approved for shared ownership loans in each local authority area is published in my Department&rsquo;s Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library and also on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>While there are no plans at present to alter the terms of the scheme, I am committed to keeping it under review.</P>

	<P>The improvement and maintenance of non-national roads in County Kildare is a matter for Kildare County Council to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State grants provided by my Department.  In 2006, the total grant allocation by my Department to Kildare County Council for <Col N="334"/>improvement and maintenance works on non-national roads is &euro;26,950,874. I am satisfied that this significant level of State funding, supplemented by Kildare County Council&rsquo;s own resources, provides appropriately for the Council&rsquo;s ongoing non-national road requirements in 2006. I intend to announce non-national roads grant allocations for 2007 early next year.</P>

	<P>The statutory assessment of housing need is undertaken by local authorities on a triennial basis.  The most recent assessment of need for social housing was undertaken by local authorities in March 2005.  The results of that assessment indicated that there were 43,684 households on local authority housing waiting lists.  More comprehensive data in relation to the 2005 assessment at an individual local authority level was published in the Annual Bulletin of Housing Statistics, a copy of which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>My Department has successfully promoted a range of measures to provide additional social <Col N="335"/>housing in recent years, and is committed to maintaining a strong programme of social housing provision into the future.  In the coming three year period 2007-2009 we are specifically committed to further additional investment in social housing with 27,000 new units to be started over the period.   This will include the commencement/ acquisition of an additional 4,000 new housing units through a combination of local authority, voluntary and co-operative housing and RAS long-term contractual arrangements for new supply as provided for under Towards 2016.</P>

	<P>Schemes currently approved for funding are set out in the Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  Earlier this year my Department asked local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital water services works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.  In carrying out the assessments, authorities were required take into <Col N="336"/>account specific criteria, including compliance with national and EU environmental requirements and standards.  The updated needs assessments will inform the selection of new schemes for inclusion in future phases of my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme.</P>

	<P>It is a matter for local authorities to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the essential repairs grant scheme in their area from within the allocation notified to them by my Department for disabled persons and essential repairs grants and to manage the operation of the schemes from within this allocation. Allocations are notified to county councils in respect of the all local authorities within a county.</P>
        <P>My Department recoups to local authorities two thirds of their expenditure on the payment of individual grants, with local authorities funding the remaining one third from their own revenue resources with amounts provided for that purpose in their annual budget.  The combined capital allocation notified by my Department to Wicklow County Council for the payment of disabled persons and essential repairs grants in 2006 was &euro;2,010,000. My Department is continually monitoring expenditure patterns of local authorities for the schemes to ensure that the resources being made available are utilised to the maximum extent possible. Wicklow County Council has not requested any increase in their 2006 allocation.</P>
