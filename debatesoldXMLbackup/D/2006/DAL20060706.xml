   <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the lending restrictions imposed on credit unions in the Credit Union Act 1997, which restrict lending to 20% of the unions&rsquo; loan book over five years and 10% over ten years; the consequent stifling of the credit unions' ongoing growth and development, whereby their limited lending capacity may force many families with minimal equity to resort to moneylenders who charge exorbitant interest rates; and a call on the Minister for Finance to level the playing field for credit unions by issuing a ministerial order revising the lending restrictions upwards from 20% to 40% over five years and from 10% to 20% over ten years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the very serious condition of a hunger striker, Peter Preston, who has been protesting at the D&aacute;il gate for many weeks; the urgent need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to meet this victim of crime; and to urgently support this person and his family in this urgent situation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JackieHealyRae"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, to appoint a temporary teacher to a school in County Kerry in which 118 pupils will be on the roll on 30 September 2006 and which will have three classes with 30 or more pupils before amalgamating in 2007. As a result the school will not be able to make this appointment and, therefore, it needs to be granted a temporary appointment with effect from 1 September 2006.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1194"/>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should withdraw his support for the Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism when the Deputy needs him?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the alarming MRSA infection rates and the emergence of similar and potentially life threatening infections in our hospitals.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the increasing MRSA infection rates in our hospitals and communities and the need to put in place a national surveillance system for measuring the extent of health care associated infections to bring infection rates under control.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Deputy Finian McGrath&rsquo;s appeal to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding Peter Preston, who has been outside the D&aacute;il for the past 44 days on hunger strike.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot go off on a tangent. He is messing with Standing Orders. If he does not wish to pursue his matter, I will move on.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a serious situation. It has been going on for 44 days. Get off the stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, how AIB Wexford could overcharge a small business, Tweedswood Limited in Wexford, so much that it almost went into bankruptcy last week; that AIB has admitted this overcharging but disputes the amount of &euro;460,000 on foot of overcharging calculated by a specialist company Bank-Check of Belfast and is offering &euro;66,000 as the amount overcharged; to ask how much overcharging is going on and how this can happen, despite legislation and a financial regulator; whether legislation can be introduced to protect the citizen who has little remedy before he can take action, as the courts and the Ombudsman can take at least a year to deal with such matters; and the lack of independent audit of the banks to ensure they are accountable.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the recent report that showed that Ireland was second from bottom in a league table of 26 European countries in the delivery of health services and particularly the total failure of the Government to address the ongoing crisis in accident and emergency units throughout the country.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No <i>a</i>12<i>a</i>, motion re establishment of joint committee on child protection; No. <i>a</i>12<i>b</i>, motion re membership of committee; No. 12, motion re Standing Order 121; No. 13, proposals for legislation on broadcasting &mdash; instruction to joint committee; No. 14, Supplementary Estimate for Public Services [Vote 40] &mdash; back from committee; and No. 14<i>a</i>, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the disposal of shares in Aer Lingus Group plc by the Minister for Finance in accordance with section 3(2) of the Aer Lingus Act 2004.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. and business shall be interrupted on the conclusion of oral questions to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, which shall be taken for 75 minutes immediately on the conclusion of No. 14<i>a</i>; (2) Nos. <i>a</i>12<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>12<i>b</i>, 12 and 13 shall be decided without debate; (3) the proceedings on No. 14 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 60 minutes, any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith, and the following arrangements shall apply: the speeches shall be confined to a Minister or Minister of State and to the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order and who may share time, and which shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; (4) the proceedings on No. 14<i>a</i> shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 4 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the speech of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (iii) members may share time; (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes; and (5) the D&aacute;il on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 27 September 2006.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are five proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Sullivan report into the failure in communications between the DPPs office and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in respect of the constitutional crisis whereby a self-confessed child rapist walked free for a temporary period will be published today. Will the Minister for Fin<Col N="1196"/>ance tell the House when it is expected we will discuss that? I raised this matter yesterday with the Taoiseach and he personally did not have any objection to discussing it. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was reluctant to allow any discussion on the Sullivan report, even within the committee being established to deal with this matter. Will the House have an opportunity to discuss this report today?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised this matter on a number of occasions with the Taoiseach. This issue convulsed the country and it seems the Government has deliberately contrived to hold over the Sullivan report until there is no opportunity for the House to debate it. People outside this House have a genuine difficulty in appreciating why an issue which caused such tumult in the country cannot be discussed in the D&aacute;il before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>I notice it is all over the newspapers this morning and that the Taoiseach was able to tell us the essence of the report as long ago as last Wednesday. This is in keeping with what happened to the electronic voting report, where it was passed to the Minister, either knowingly or otherwise, or perhaps because he was one of the affected parties against whom adverse findings were made. I do not know the rationale.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach had the report and was able to tell us last Wednesday what is in it. His spin doctors were able to tell whatever journalist is covering the story for this morning&rsquo;s newspapers what is in it. However, it is deliberately contrived that it will be published to the Members of this D&aacute;il after the Order of Business. That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I propose that, as the House is to conclude business on No. 14<i>a</i> at 4 p.m., the Minister for Finance agree to permit at least one hour for preliminary statements to be made in the House on the Sullivan report and that Question Time be taken after that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister for Finance accede on behalf of the Government to extend the time we have today so the Sullivan report can be discussed and we can broaden the terms of reference of the committee, as is necessary, to include the Sullivan report? There is too much <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i> from beef tribunal days in the way matters are dealt with here. I also ask that we consider membership of the committee. This issue has constitutional implications&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are discussing the late sitting.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

   </Speaker><Col N="1197"/>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am explaining why we need a later sitting. At present, not all parties are to be represented on the committee which will deal with a constitutional matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the people&rsquo;s Constitution, not that of a couple of larger parties.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I formally second Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s proposal that we have an extension of time today. It is the minimal request the Minister could expect in respect of addressing the Sullivan report. The hour indicated is hardly adequate to deal with the import of the issue. We should seriously consider reconvening in the morning to give it the full address it properly deserves. However, in anticipation of opposition from the Government benches and to make it as easy as possible for the Minister to agree, I join in the appeal for the extension of time to accommodate that opportunity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking the Order of Business on the basis that it is outlined. The report due to be published today will be aired in full in the media and elsewhere.</P>
   </Speaker>

   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand, in his reply to Deputy Kenny, the Taoiseach mentioned that it would probably be raised at the joint committee on child protection being established to deal with all issues surrounding child protection. One of the terms of reference will be to consider the implications arising from and the consequences of the Supreme Court decision of 23 May 2006 in the CC case. The failure in communications to the Attorney General on certain matters despite protocols already in existence is the issue addressed by the Sullivan report. These matters can be taken in that context.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Government can send the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, on his weekly slot on the &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; show.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>An amendment has been proposed that does not disrupt the schedule &mdash; it delays the rising of the House for one hour &mdash; so that spokespersons will have an opportunity to make an initial statement.</P>

I ask that the terms of reference for this joint committee on child protection represent the political diversity in the Chamber to the greatest extent possible, given that we are dealing with an issue that is pertinent to the Constitution, which is the people&rsquo;s Constitution and is not the preserve of any select group of political nominees. I ask the Government to recognise that the membership of the committee is too narrow to reflect the degree to which it needs to deal with a matter that has constitutional implications. For that reason I oppose the membership as outlined. The Green Party asks that our spokesperson, Deputy Cuffe, be allowed serve on the committee given that he has been involved in the debate and in trying to resolve the difficulties to date.</P>

	<P>The Government has made a mistake in not allowing an hour&rsquo;s debate on the matter this evening. Having deliberately suppressed the matter until today, we are now asked to give full sanction to the committee. Before we decide on whether to vote on the proposal, I ask the Minister for Finance to guarantee that the committee will be properly resourced in terms of back-up staff, in view of the outrage felt by the community at large by the constitutional crisis that was caused. What facilities will be available to the committee? Why were the negotiations concluded by the Minister of State with responsibility for children instead of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>

	<P>In line with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s oft-repeated commitment to establish a committee representative of all parties in the House, Sinn F&eacute;in nominated one of its number to serve on this committee but, like the Green Party, was denied that access and opportunity to play its part in what is a very important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It is a serious issue and I find it bewildering that Members can find anything humorous within it. It is anything but humorous. The issue of all-party participation is crucial to the success of the committee&rsquo;s deliberations. Like the Green Party, we have been denied that opportunity and, as the Chief Whip can confirm, in repeated representations to secure the right of access to participate in this committee, the establishment of which we have fully endorsed from the outset, I now ask that an amendment be introduced to accommodate the full participation of all the identifiable groupings in this Chamber, including the Green Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Progressive Democrats, if it still <Col N="1202"/>wishes to exercise the same right of participation. Any other formula in moving forward with the committee will be fundamentally flawed and will set off the work of the committee on the wrong foot.</P>
    <P Just="Left">While we do not want to call for a division, we may be forced to do so if we are excluded as the committee would not meet its purpose. I ask the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government to indicate acceptance to the right to additional participation. I note that the Minister and the Minister of State nominated <i>ex officio</i> have full voting rights in any event. Does the formula of <i>ex officio</i> offer a means of accommodating the need to have voices from the Green Party and Sinn F&eacute;in? It certainly does.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The composition of the committee is based on proportionality of representation in the House. It is also important to have a committee with such numbers as will lend itself to effectiveness so that it can get through the important business it needs to do. Obviously the committee will report back to a plenary session of the House when every Member will have an opportunity to discuss and debate its deliberations. This composition of the committee meets with precedent on the establishment of all such joint committees. The Technical Group has nominated a Member. The suggestion from Deputy Rabbitte that the Progressive Democrats should have two out of the 11, which would suggest almost 20% representation, is not something that party would seek anyway.</P>

	<P>Is proposal No. 5, that the D&aacute;il on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 27 September, agreed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not agreed. Deputy Martin Brady informed me that Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers are not just tired, they are exhausted. They wish to get out of here.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDavern"><NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose an amendment to proposal No. 5, that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on its rising on Thursday, 13 July shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 September 2006. Fine Gael and the Labour Party published a joint document on D&aacute;il reform calling for longer sitting periods. My amendment would shorten the summer recess by three weeks. We must discuss the Sullivan report, the Barron report, the report on the Supreme Court decision, published on Monday, and the Harris report. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a new way of producing legislation by holding a press conference on draft legislation on privacy and defamation. These issues are of great importance to the population at large. I recommend that the D&aacute;il sit next week and return on 12 September. Not only will that arrangement give Members of the House time to discuss these important issues but it will also demonstrate to the public that D&aacute;il reform, efficiency and professionalism are matters we take seriously.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a modest and reasonable proposal that the House sit for another week and return in the middle of September. I am always surprised that the Government appears to be insensitive to the inevitable snide commentary that going on leave today, as it will be presented, until 27 September attracts for this House and politics generally. It is immensely damaging that we are not seen to take a reasonable break in line <Col N="1208"/>with other parliaments. This House sat 55 fewer days this year than the parliament in the neighbouring island.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Barr report on the shooting of John Carthy in 2000 has been completed for some time but has not been brought before the House and the report on the death of Pat Joe Walsh has not yet been made available to Deputies and ought to be debated here. The Barron report has not been discussed, it has been deliberately contrived that the Sullivan report will not be discussed and the e-voting report has not been discussed. The Dalton report exposes the glaring inadequacy of political supervision of the State company that runs greyhound racing and the shenanigans associated with the redevelopment of Shelbourne Park. Mr. Dalton has brought difficulties to light that were not included in his narrow terms of reference, following a particular sequence of events leading to the dismissal of the chief executive. A great many other matters have been brought to his attention and have now been passed to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reflect on the proposal. There is much business for this House to do next week. We have spent the last three weeks railroading important legislation through the House without giving it adequate scrutiny. Everybody is aware of that. Legislation has been introduced almost without notice and, in some cases, all Stages have been taken together with no adequate opportunity to scrutinise it. That this House sit for an additional week and return in the middle of September is an eminently reasonable proposal and would avoid much of the negative commentary and coverage that the business of politics will attract as a result of the Government&rsquo;s decision to shut down the House until 27 September.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government should acknowledge the widely held view that with the House rising today until 27 September the Government wishes to insulate itself from scrutiny and accountability. D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is where account<Col N="1209"/>ability takes place. We support the motion, although we would prefer that the House return on 5 September. Even that date is out of line with other parliaments. We would prefer to have parity with the Westminster Parliament given that we are part of a peace process and party to the Good Friday Agreement, one of whose objectives is parity of esteem. Parity of esteem means one must earn one&rsquo;s esteem and that can be earned by having parity in the number of sitting days, for a start. What work takes place can be assessed after that.</P>
    <P>Westminster sits for 55 more days that this Parliament. How can the D&aacute;il justify sitting 96 days, not even reaching 100, while across the water parliament sitting another 55 days is considered normal? That makes it difficult to secure parity of esteem in terms of accountability for the democratic process in this jurisdiction. If we are serious about resolving matters in the North, we could start by getting our own house in order and ensure this House sits for the same length of time as the parliament across the water.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>While accepting the argument for a shorter summer recess, it is important to emphasise that Members will attend committee meetings during this month and in September. Rather than that being seen as a way of avoiding the responsibility of returning earlier we should look on it as an opportunity. Many Members will be here in any event. It is important for the democratic process that the truth is put on the record.</P>
    <P>The majority of Members work extremely hard and for long hours. I do not know the comparisons between this Chamber and the neighbouring island but we have left this House after midnight over the past couple of nights. Those hours were worked by people of all views. It is important not to lose sight of those facts and not to peddle a false impression as to the extent of the input of Members. That also applies to the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas who work with us over these long and difficult days.</P>
    <P>It should not be seen as one side arguing with the other about the number of days. We should acknowledge to each other the extent of the input and effort made by all Members in ensuring we have a vibrant, democratic Chamber. However, not everybody is heading away this weekend and not everybody will be away throughout September. We could accommodate more sittings to address many of the important points Members have made. Rather than take the view that it will call their bluff, perhaps the Government should consider the argument and agree that things could be done differently and better. More sittings and fewer long nights that stretch into the early hours of the morning might accommodate a better quality of deliberation as well.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, I cannot accept the amendment. It is important to point out, as has been mentioned by one speaker, that although we are discussing closing the plenary session of the D&aacute;il, the committee system will continue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>The education committee finishes today.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of establishing a committee system was to ensure there was the ability to continue the accountability mechanism that Parliament provides to the Government, as provided for in the Constitution. We should not suggest that this is not the case because it is the case. During this month and in September the House will sit in its respective committee formats and continue the work those committees decide must be done as a matter of urgency, within their remit and terms of reference.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no Ministers at those meetings.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Those of us privileged to be Ministers will continue our work as a Government. This month will see the beginning of an Estimates process, the setting out of a budgetary strategy to be agreed by Government and preparations of budgets for the following year. It is not a question of work ending after today; work will continue in the context of the continuing progress we are making. It is important that the committee system is seen during July and September to provide the level of accountability that has been ascribed to it.</P>
    <P>I ask that the motion put down by the Government be accepted. Deputy Sargent referred to the esteem in which the Parliament should be held. The Parliament will always be held in esteem when it conducts its business properly and appropriately instead of trying to grab cheap headlines, like Deputy Sargent did last week, when he was abusing privilege in this House. He might reflect on that during the summer.</P>

	<P>Now that the House has decided to adjourn today and return in September, I wish to take this opportunity to wish you, a Cheann Comhairle, and your staff a relaxed time during the summer. I thank you for your efficiency and courtesy during your time in the Chair, despite the fact that we might have had some altercations. I also wish the staff of the House every good wish during the summer period. I thank them for their co-operation, courtesy and dedication at all times. I thank all the Members for their participation in democracy and express the hope that they will return here in September with their loins girded for the hustings.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a bit premature.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In particular, I pay tribute to Se&aacute;n Sheils, one of the longest serving members of the staff, who is retiring. Mr. Sheils has been the senior bar manager here for the last 38 years. With Denis Reid he has formed the longest working coalition within the Houses of the Oireachtas for a great number of years. I wish Se&aacute;n every success in his retirement. He has assured me that he will not write the book for some time because therein lies not one story, but many.</P>

   <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the leader of the Labour Party, I also want to convey our best wishes to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for a good break. It is a pity we are taking such extended leave but that is nothing to do with you, Sir. Your staff have been working very hard, particularly in recent days with the late sittings. I thank the staff of the House for their endeavours. I also wish to congratulate Se&aacute;n Sheils and wish him all the very best. I think it is a pity he is not going to write the book. Not enough is written about political life in Ireland. When one looks at our history, and particularly as this year marks the 90th anniversary of the 1916 Rising, the literary works of many great leaders &mdash; those involved in 1916 and before &mdash; are quite remarkable. That literary tradition should be encouraged. If the barman wants to write the story he will find an audience and I wish him well if he intends to do so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Deputies Kenny and McManus in wishing you a good restful summer holiday. As you have advised us many times with your medical hat on, it is important to take a break. I am not sure whether you would recommend such a long break for health reasons. However, I appreciate that is not your choice but maybe the Government had its own reasons for wanting a long break.</P>
    <P>I thank the staff and wish them well for the summer. No doubt we will bump into each other during the days and months ahead as the office will remain open and we will meet more staff than Ministers. I hope we will all be safe and well rested when we meet in a full D&aacute;il in September.</P><Col N="1214"/>
    <P Just="Left">I wish Se&aacute;n Sheils all the best in his retirement and thank him for his many long years of service. I hope that during the summer the Government might reflect on the need to sit down in a spirit of consensus and work on D&aacute;il reform in order that we can agree on what makes for a good working democracy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other colleagues in extending good wishes to yourself and to all the elected representatives of all parties and none for the summer period ahead. It will be a busy time for all of us, perhaps more so than in previous summer recesses with the looming general election.</P>
    <P>I wish the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas similar good wishes, those who serve us directly in the Chamber, those who record the daily proceedings, the ushers and all the support staff whose courtesy towards Members is very much appreciated. I wish the members of the press well. I am sure they will be able to fill their column inches with other pursuits over the summer period rather than commenting on the affairs of this Chamber and, maybe, that will be a rest for some of us as well.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that everybody has some little break planned. I just want to share with the House before resuming my seat that I have it on good authority that a number have planned exotic destinations. I have it on good authority that the Progressive Democrats Party has made a very special holiday arrangement for its president, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. I understand its members have chipped in together and he is being sent to Coventry for the summer where we hope he has a wonderful time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Taoiseach I join leaders of political parties in wishing you and your staff a restful period ahead and thank you for your co-operation and for discharging your responsibilities so conscientiously during the course of the term. I look forward to everyone coming back in good and robust health, ready for the fray. As one who is, perhaps, less frequently in the bar than many, I wish Se&aacute;n Sheils a happy retirement. I thank Se&aacute;n for his friendship, discretion, courtesy and professionalism. He will be missed by many of us. He has been a fixture for a long time. When long-standing members of staff leave there is always a sentimental aspect to it. I am sure he will enjoy his good health with his family and I have no doubt he will be very busy in the years ahead also. I wish him well and thank him for the many times he poured a good pint.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizODonnell"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I too wish colleagues on all sides a good summer break, mindful of the fact that many of us will return to our constituencies and come into the House on committee business. I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for your court<Col N="1215"/>esy during the year and in particular for your chairmanship of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, of which I am privileged to be a member. The commission has done significant work in the first couple of years of its existence. I congratulate the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas for putting in place many changes for the benefit of the Houses and the Members. There have been significant improvements in the facilities for Members and the provision of extra staffing resources for Members of both Houses.</P>
    <P>I thank all the staff, personal assistants, secretaries, clerical staff and the ushers who look after us so well, including our constituents when they come to visit the House. All the reports from our constituents when they come to visit the Oireachtas confirm that they are treated with tremendous courtesy and professionalism by the staff. I acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>I wish Se&aacute;n Sheils well as he goes into his retirement. He is a good friend to all Members. I wish all the staff and support staff in your office, a Cheann Comhairle, a good break for the summer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

I am sure the public is unaware there are many Members who will take no break and will work every single week of the recess and have done so for many years. I advise all Members to take a break of at least two to three weeks. It will be good for them and their health, good for their families and in the medium term will be good for their constituents. When you are away on your break, do not forget that your constituency colleagues of all parties will be only too delighted to look after your work. I advise you to enjoy the recess.</P>

Sectoral plans were to be put in place by every Department, including the Departments of Finance, Health and Children, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, which are all lead Departments. These plans were to be put in place by 31 July but were to be laid before the House before then. The Minister knows that nothing can happen without the sectoral plans. It is now a year since they were promised but we still have not got them. Will anything happen before the end of July and how will we deal with it?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1217"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

	<P>Will they be dealt with in committee or will they be laid before the Houses?</P>

Will the report be published before the circulation of the single electricity market Bill?</P>
    <P>I ask my next question by way of being helpful and hope it will help address the communication issue between the backbenchers on the Government side of the House and the Ministers. Would it be possible to bring forward the electronic communications (miscellaneous provisions) Bill to offer a two-way system and equality of communication in both directions on the Government side of the House?

	<P el="0">The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 was signed by the President on 23 June 2006. The Act provides a clear legal framework for a scheme to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long-term residential care. All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive and the estates of all those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full.</P>
    <P>The decision to limit repayments to estates of those who died since 9 December 1998 reflects the reference in the Supreme Court judgment to the possible application of the Statute of Limitations: &ldquo;The State has available to it a defence of the Statute of Limitation i.e. a 6 year limit&rdquo;. The Government has a responsibility, in light of the substantial sums involved, to have regard to what the Supreme Court said about the Statute of Limitations to place appropriate limits on the scale of total repayments which today&rsquo;s taxpayer will have to fund.</P>
    <P>Charges for publicly funded long-stay residential care have been raised by health boards from people under two sets of regulations: the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954, as amended in 1965, which applied to all, including those with full eligibility, and the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976, as amended in 1987, from which medical card holders and those with dependants were exempt.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court judgment in the <?oasys _jy ?>McInerney case in 1976 narrowed very significantly the grounds on which a charge could be raised for institutional assistance. It could only be made for shelter and maintenance without any medical or nursing care being provided. A circular from the Department of Health to the health boards in 1976 authorised a practice by which the chief executive officer of a health board could regard patients as not meeting the criteria for full eligibility while being maintained in an institution, since necessary general practitioner and surgical services were being provided for them, and so withdrew their medical card. The withdrawal of full eligibility in this way allowed a charge for inpatient services to be raised.</P>
    <P>The health boards, with the knowledge of the Department of Health and Children, continued to raise charges under both sets of regulations up to 9 December 2004. On the basis of advice from the Office of the Attorney General, the Department instructed the health boards to cease charging all fully eligible persons in receipt of inpatient services in public long-stay institutions and in contract beds in private nursing homes <Col N="1224"/>solely by virtue of a contractual arrangement with a former health board with effect from 9 December 2004. By way of a goodwill gesture, the Government agreed to have <i>ex gratia</i> payments of up to &euro;2,000 made to those wrongly charged and who were alive on 9 December 2004. The Health Service Executive made payments in excess of &euro;21 million to approximately 10,800 individuals.</P>
    <P>The Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 17 December 2004. The purpose of the Bill was to provide a statutory basis for the imposition of charges on those to whom inpatient services were being provided in public long-stay institutions. It also contained a retrospective element which provided that charges levied prior to the enactment of the legislation were also lawful. This Bill was referred to the Supreme Court for a decision on its constitutionality. The retrospective element provided that a relevant charge levied under section 53 of the Health Act 1970 for long-stay care prior to the enactment of the legislation was lawful. The Supreme Court decision of 16 February 2005 found this retrospective element of the Bill to be unconstitutional because of the property rights of citizens.</P>
    <P>The charging for long-stay care was put on a statutory footing under the Health (Amendment) Act 2005 and is being implemented by way of the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005. These regulations were signed on 14 June 2005 and reinstated charges for inpatient services and provided for the levying of a charge in respect of the maintenance of persons in receipt of such services. The regulations were prepared following extensive consultation with the Health Service Executive and others.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court in its decision of 16 February 2005 did not consider the exposure of the State, or the magnitude of the sums involved, to justify the extinguishment of a property right. In light of the amount of repayment which would be due to individuals in certain cases and the overall amount of money involved, it was agreed a repayment scheme to repay fully eligible individuals who paid inpatient charges while in publicly funded residential care would be established and placed on a statutory basis. The Government agreed the key elements of the scheme for the repayment of these long-stay charges last year.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Extensive discussions have taken place with the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Finance, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the probate office of the High Court, the office of the wards of court, the Law Reform Commission, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Courts Service, the Data Protection Commissioner, the Mental Health Commission and the Health Service Executive regarding the provisions contained in this Act. In addition, the national oversight committee which the T&aacute;naiste appointed, which is representative of service users, including Age Action Ireland and the <Col N="1225"/>senior citizens parliament, has provided an independent input into the repayment scheme design. It will monitor the operation of the scheme to ensure it is implemented quickly and in the most effective way possible. The committee is chaired by Professor J. Bernard Walsh, consultant physician, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, and reports directly to the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that up to approximately 20,000 people who are still alive and a further 40,000 to 50,000 estates will benefit from repayments under the scheme. The overall costs arising from the long-stay charges repayment scheme have been estimated at approximately &euro;1 billion</P>
    <P>Owing to the nature, volume and complexity of the repayments involved, it was decided, in line with the Government decision, to appoint an outside company with appropriate knowledge and experience in dealing with mass repayments. The HSE has selected a preferred service provider, a consortium comprising KPMG accountancy group and McCann Fitzgerald solicitors, to manage the repayment scheme within the agreed Government parameters. This company will also provide an independent assessment of the amount of repayment due to each applicant under the scheme, which will help to reassure the public that the scheme is being operated in the most equitable and effective way possible. The tender was awarded to the most economically advantageous tender. The award criteria was based on cost, technical capacity, legal expertise and economic and financial capacity.</P>
    <P>The HSE has indicated that all EU guidelines and directives have been complied with in awarding the contract. The cost of the company will be based on the number of repayments, but has been capped at &euro;15 million exclusive of VAT. The HSE is satisfied the successful consortium met the necessary criteria and is confident of the ability to deliver all aspects of the scheme. The HSE has worked directly with the Data Protection Commissioner to ensure that all necessary measures are in place to protect the confidentiality of information. It is understood from the HSE that a very small proportion of the work to be undertaken by the company will be sourced outside the EU. This work is of a data entry nature and will not involve the operation of help lines, the provision of information or any related matters, all of which will be performed within the State.</P>
    <P>The HSE has supported the decision to engage an outside company, as the nature of the work is not one of its core functions. In any event, it would not be in a position to administer a repayment scheme of this magnitude within existing resources without having to divert staff from normal functions in the delivery of health services. The HSE is already committed to providing resources for the implementation of a unitary system for the delivery and management of health services at local, regional and national level, following its establishment in January 2005.</P><Col N="1226"/>
    <P>Consideration had been given to the involvement of public sector staff to assist in administering the scheme. However, the HSE informed the Department that the time constraints of the procurement process and the potential for significant logistical difficulties and protracted delays, with consequent implications for the commencement of the repayment scheme, did not allow for the implementation of this option. There would also have been a requirement to assign dedicated HSE resources to train and supervise such staff, thereby removing them from their normal duties with a subsequent effect on service provision.</P>
    <P>However, in recognition of the importance of progressing repayments, the T&aacute;naiste has asked the HSE to identify those living patients who were wrongfully charged and to calculate the details of the repayment due to them in as many cases as possible during the period prior to the selection of the outside company. This will ensure a significant proportion of patients should receive their repayments as soon as possible, with the repayment process commencing before the end of July.</P>
    <P>The national repayment scheme will refund all those fully eligible persons who were incorrectly charged for publicly funded long-stay residential care. Medical card holders, and those aged over 70 with effect from July 2001, are considered to be fully eligible for the purpose of this scheme.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It has been agreed that those not having a medical card on admission but who fell within the income means threshold for a medical card, for example, those in receipt of the non-contributory old age pension, will be regarded as having full eligibility for the purpose of this scheme. This is because of the vulnerability of those in long-stay care, and being cognisant that the former health boards did not make a determination on eligibility status in many instances, based mainly on the incorrect assumption that full eligibility could be removed from long-stay care patients as set out in the Department of Health circular 7/76. This action will ensure the scheme is broadly inclusive and is implemented in a fair and equitable manner.</P>
    <P>All those wrongly charged for inpatient services will be repaid in full. For the purpose of this scheme, community hostels which provide either medical or nursing care on a rostered basis are considered inpatient services, and residents will have any unlawful charges repaid in full.</P>
    <P>Priority in making repayments will be given to those who are still alive to allow these people to benefit from the repayment by availing of comforts which they may not otherwise be able to provide. In the case of estates, it will not be those who actually paid the charges that will receive the repayment. Many of these living patients have already been identified as a result of the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme which was announced in December 2004. As mentioned earlier, at the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s request, the HSE had already begun proactively calculating the amount of repayments due to living <Col N="1227"/>patients in advance of the selection of an outside company. This advance work will help ensure the repayments process will commence before the end of July.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation by reference to the consumer price index. The consumer price index is a widely accepted tool for monetary calculation over an extended period of time. Data from the CPI is also available on a regular basis, thereby facilitating a match with periods when payments are due. The CPI is also used by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in dealing with underpayments of social welfare entitlements.</P>
    <P>The scheme will include a transparent and user-friendly appeals process that will be independent of the HSE and the company engaged to administer the scheme. Suitably qualified independent appeals officers will be appointed to consider appeals. The appeals process will allow both written and oral submissions to support an appeal. Applicants to the scheme will be advised of the outcome of their application as soon as possible, and they will be provided with details of their entitlement to appeal if their application has been rejected or if they dispute the amount of the repayment. Applicants will also be informed of their right to bring a complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman. The legislation allows for regular reports on the operation of the appeals process, which will be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children had previously indicated that funding of &euro;400 million would be required for the health repayment scheme in 2006. It was originally anticipated that repayments would begin in May of this year. Due to a prolonged tendering process and the extensive consultation required in the drafting of the Bill, repayments will not commence until late July or early August of this year. It is now estimated that the total funding required to service the health repayment scheme for 2006 is &euro;340 million. The revised estimate is based on a reduced volume of repayments to be completed this year.</P>
    <P Just="Left">As already indicated, approximately 20,000 people who are still alive, and approximately a further 40,000 to 50,000 estates, will benefit from repayments. In order to begin making repayments as soon as possible, the HSE has indicated that the details of 7,600 living patients have been calculated. In addition, the HSE will also have completed 3,500 calculations in respect of those who are deceased, making an overall total of 11,100 calculations at an estimated cost of &euro;222 million.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that these initial repayments will be made in the first two months of the service provider&rsquo;s appointment, with a further 4,000 living persons receiving payment in the current year at a further cost of &euro;80 million. In addition to the cost of the actual repayments including interest, <Col N="1228"/>there will also be an additional funding requirement for the outside company. The total cost of the outside company has been capped at &euro;15 million excluding VAT, but the actual cost of the company will be based on the number of overall repayments and will not be known until all the repayments have been completed. A costing of &euro;5 million has been provided for 2006.</P>
    <P>A further &euro;33 million has been set aside for other costs associated with the scheme, which will include the costs associated with any additional repayments which may be issued in the current year; establishing and resourcing the appeals process under the scheme; and the cost of employing staff from the probate office to process streamlined applications for probate from estates.</P>
    <P>The figures provided for the cost of the repayments outlined above are based on estimates provided by the HSE, which indicate the average repayment due to an individual is approximately &euro;20,000. This average figure will vary depending on length of stay and the amount of health charge paid by the patient in the first instance.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the total funding requirement for 2006 has been revised downward from &euro;400 million to &euro;340 million, with the balance of the funding of &euro;660 million required in 2007 and 2008.</P>

   <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish a good summer to Members and staff of the Houses, who work so well during the year.</P>
    <P>We have heard much debate on this matter over the past 18 months, and we should reflect a little on it. Departments responsible for health and justice matters are two major social bodies in any country&rsquo;s government. Fianna F&aacute;il, which claims to represent two of every five voters in this country, has no control over these two Departments. The Progressive Democrats, as far as I am concerned, does not have an ethos which allows it to empathise with the people who most need the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly resent that remark.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a slump in the corporate governance of these Departments under the PDs. The attitude of Fianna F&aacute;il to the slump is no surprise to us in the House. They have failed completely to provide political leadership.</P>
    <P Just="Left">As Fine Gael spokesperson on health and children, there have been three major issues in which I have had an interest in recent weeks: the statutory rape crisis, the report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction and the legislation to which this motion refers. There a common theme running through these three issues. The response time one would expect from the Government with regard to dealing with the important issues I have just outlined is an <Col N="1229"/>absolute disgrace. Something else these three issues have in common is that the Supreme Court is playing, or could potentially play, a central role in them. All that indicates to me is complete incompetence on the part of the Government. The Supreme Court pushed the statutory rape issue, the Supreme Court is central to the legislation referred to and it looks like the Supreme Court will decide on the report on the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction because the Government is failing to do its job. That is incompetence. A constant factor in all of these issues is the involvement of the Progressive Democrats. Although it has always claimed to be good on corporate governance, the Progressive Democrats has been central in some of the greatest messes we have witnessed in this House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">These messes were there a long time and Deputy Twomey&rsquo;s party also was in government, and he well knows that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The disengagement of Fianna F&aacute;il from any of these issues is also of great concern to the people. In fact, the only political slump that we are seeing at present is how the coalition, of which Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley is a part, is governing the country. Some &euro;340 million will be paid out this year to repay illegal nursing home charges. Some &euro;600 million must be paid out next year.</P>
    <P>There is potentially another illegal nursing home charges issues, which I have constantly raised on this side of the House with both Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and to which I have never receive a clear answer. This issue is private nursing home charges on those over 70. Every time the T&aacute;naiste has been asked about this, her reply is that the courts will decide. What is our role here in this House? Are we legislators or do we take our diktat from the Supreme Court? The Department of Health and Children officials have expressed concern about this issue, but not one Minister in the past 18 months or two years has shown the leadership he or she is supposed to show in his or her Department or has come in here to tell me that I am wrong about the illegal nursing home charges for private patients in private nursing homes. Not one Minister has come in here to disclose the Department&rsquo;s good advice on this and to state why the Department is standing over this. When the Travers report was discussed in the Joint Committee on Health and Children, we asked about the charges in private nursing homes. The Government has not answered in two years. I suppose this should not surprise us because it has taken the Government 18 months to come to this point.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The T&aacute;naiste stated, when the legislation was first thrown out by the Supreme Court, that both herself and the Taoiseach felt strongly that these repayments should be made quickly because of <Col N="1230"/>the age and the vulnerability of the people who are still alive. As Members will be aware, the average length of stay of a person in a nursing home is between two and three years. It will nearly be two years before the Department makes the first repayment, in other words, many of the people of whom we spoke when we first raised this issue are now dead. That is the sort of useless foot-dragging Government we have at present.</P>
    <P Just="Left">This is the last sitting day before the summer recess. During the recess the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, might go to the trouble of getting an answer to my question. Deputy Harney&rsquo;s predecessor in the Department of Health and Children, the Minister, Deputy Martin, not having read his briefing documents, told the Joint Committee on Health and Children that he had no responsibility for the illegal nursing home charges. At that time the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, acknowledged that he saw the importance of that memo when it was shown to him and maybe he might have the intellectual capacity to come back into this House and tell us whether we are wrong on the issue of the charges for those over 70 in private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney is showing almost the same cavalier attitude of Deputy Martin to what potentially may be a considerable cost to the taxpayer next year. It just goes to show that the Progressive Democrats is infected with the Fianna F&aacute;il virus, that life begins and ends at election time. The Progressive Democrats has shown no consideration for what may happen to the public finances in the future. It has shown no consideration to the people for whom it is supposed to be responsible and that is why I say that the Progressive Democrats ethos does not fit well with looking after the elderly. It has a casual attitude and does not quite understand the concerns of the elderly. It merely see all of this as a routine it must go through. That is why the people are growing tired of it after five years. The people are growing tired of it because it&rsquo;s competence in providing good government is failing day by day.</P>
    <P>One of the questions we asked on Committee Stage was why the Government was unable to look within the capacity of the Civil Service to make these repayments. It seems amazing that the HSE has the details of 10,500 people involved who it maintains are still alive and the Minister of State stated that there are approximately 20,000 people involved who are alive. As the HSE identified these 10,500 last December, I am sure it has identified far more since. While, according to the Minister of State, the Department will hand all this information over to a private company, it seems all the company must do is sign the cheques. How difficult could it be for the company to find the remaining people involved? The HSE has more or less done all the hard work for the company, in the case of the people who are alive.</P><Col N="1231"/>
    <P>The Department also has probably identified the vast majority of the 40,000 or 50,000 people involved who are deceased. No doubt a significant amount of work has already been done on that by the HSE. The HSE has identified those whose estates must undergo probate because it has already identified what level of resources it will need to do that. A considerable amount of this work has been done.</P>
    <P>While the Minister of State stated that the HSE would not have the resources to do this work, and I agree with him for a different reason, what of the other Departments? The Department of Agriculture and Food made significant payments on an annual basis and it does not make those payments any more. The Department of Social and Family Affairs, which is more or less the Government&rsquo;s bank, makes significant payments every week. Is it really beyond the Government to get the heads of these Departments together to see if a solution could be reached, where the civil and public services could provide a significant amount of the resources and back-up to make these repayments, rather than adopt the knee-jerk approach of contracting it out to a company?</P>
    <P>I have serious concerns about the HSE. If half of the concerns expressed to me about the HSE are true, we will be back after the next election looking at the Health Act 2004 which established the HSE. I hope the Department of Health and Children stays together and functions well because it looks like it might take over many of the functions of the HSE in the future.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste seems oblivious to what is happening in the HSE. She has really distanced herself to an unbelievable extent. I recognise she is doing it for political reasons. She thinks that any scandal will not stick to her if she sets up all these groups. The HSE has been established almost as a semi-State company with little accountability, and yet the Government seems to be almost trying to ignore the concerns that people are expressing about it.</P>
    <P>While we in this House often criticise the parliamentary affairs division, that division is just a manifestation of the wider problems within the HSE. If information encounters a difficulty in flowing back to the chief executive&rsquo;s office which responds publicly to Deputies in this House, what problems are occurring behind closed doors? Ministers need to wake up and smell the coffee because their only role is to run the health service competently. They are supposed to act as chief executive officers of their Departments, not as television stars with big egos jockeying for position within their respective parties. That is why it has taken 18 months for the Government to come close to repaying people who were abused by the State. The T&aacute;naiste should get a move on and make the repayments properly.</P>
    <P>Are further problems regarding illegal nursing home charges being covered up? I have raised <Col N="1232"/>this issue previously and I will continue to pursue it. The Minister of State should not hide behind the courts. As legislators, we do not have to wait for courts to decide because if problems are identified, we can legislate to address them. Would the Government parties wait, as they almost did, for the courts to decide to allow child rapists to walk free? Is their attitude that cavalier that they do not care and they will wait for a diktat from the Supreme Court when it reaches a decision? The Opposition is concerned about accountability, transparency and good corporate governance. These are buzz words Ministers throw out at press conferences before they run helter skelter when there is trouble. Every strategy and document is launched at a press conference and there is no question of anything being introduced in the House because the T&aacute;naiste is afraid of accountability. However, when she was asked a difficult question at the press conference for the launch of the cancer strategy, the HSE chief executive officer, Professor Drumm, who is not part of the political Executive that is supposed to respond to the people, jumped in to reply.</P>
    <P>Ministers are disengaging from their duties and the public and that is why they are losing the confidence of the people. I recently watched a television programme about Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s government. Her Ministers became so arrogant and incompetent towards the end, I had a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i> as I was reminded of the behaviour of our Ministers. The people are concerned about health, justice, crime and public expenditure. The issue of illegal nursing home charges has been discussed thoroughly but the Government has been damn slow to address it. Are Ministers trying to cover up more banana skins in this regard because they are afraid to acknowledge they may have been responsible for incurring a significant liability on behalf of the taxpayer as well as treating vulnerable elderly people in a cavalier manner?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to acknowledge what happened and why &euro;1 billion of the health budget is being set aside to make reparation to elderly vulnerable people and their families who were robbed by the State. This is a lamentable record, although I appreciate a number of Administrations are to blame. However, &euro;1 billion is being taken out of the health budget, which could have been spent elsewhere. For example, an additional 350 hospital beds could have been provided and many other services could have used this money. However, the State must repay money it took illegally from people who were extremely vulnerable.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The bill should not be as high and that is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility. If the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, had undertaken the simple task of reading his brief, as a Minister should, the cost would have been less. If his well-paid political advisers had done what they were supposed to, the bill would be <Col N="1233"/>less. The most disturbing aspect of the increased bill, which resulted from the Minister&rsquo;s failure to do his job, is that the Government, composed of the Progressive Democrats, which is supposed be the watchdog, and Fianna F&aacute;il, has exonerated the Minister and rewarded him with a transfer to a more tranquil Department, where it is all good news for a change. The then Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children took the hit and that is no way for a Government to operate. It highlights a paucity of leadership, which is both revealing and disturbing, not only in the Department of Health and Children but throughout the Government. At the very least, we need to ensure those who are in positions of responsibility accept it and do not only accept the trappings of office such as the large salary, the minders, the driver, the advisers and all the praise and flattery that goes with the position. When they do not live up to their duties, the buck should stop with them.</P>
    <P Just="Left">That attitude has pervaded the entire Government. For a long time the Taoiseach managed to deflect criticism but that is no longer the case. He became known as the Teflon Taoiseach but this culture has pervaded the Government in a corrosive way. The Taoiseach&rsquo;s attitude is not working any longer and, generally, the Government is feeling the heat. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, about whom there is a touch of a school boy, uses a silly phrase in this regard. However, support for both Government parties has slumped but that was inevitable given their record. If there were ministerial accountability &mdash; I do not only refer to the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin &mdash; the public at least would feel a sense of security that some principle remained within politics and the Government.</P>
 
    <P>The costs that have been added unnecessarily by privatising the process are questionable. Why was a process embarked on to employ a private company to manage a simple set of procedures? What is the big deal? Not only did the Government hire a private company, the company tendered late and the process was repeated so the company could win the contract worth &euro;15 million. The appeals process cost &euro;33 million and, therefore, a total of &euro;48 million will be paid for administration alone. We do not need to spend money like that. The Civil Service has spare capacity. As Deputy Twomey pointed out, 400 officials in the Department of Agriculture and Food processed very complex payments, which were abolished following the introduction of the single payment scheme. The Department of Social and Family Affairs made repayments when the European Union decided that married women were being discriminated against. The then Minister for Social Welfare, Proinsias De Rossa, did not need to hire a private company as a crutch on which to lean. Payments of much greater amounts are made by the Department of Social and Family Affairs as a matter of course. <Col N="1234"/>To be fair to that Department, the improvements made during the past ten years in terms of efficiency and better service are quite remarkable. It seems the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children is obsessed by some type of old fashioned or ideological thinking whereby she has no faith in anything the public sector does. It must be private, otherwise it is no good.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We are paying a price for an extremely blinkered Minister who does not understand the public service or the health service terribly well, and at every stage seizes the private solution whether it is private hospitals or private companies managing relatively simple processes or running GP services. It is an easy solution, but it is not the right solution. To every difficult question, as HL Mencken stated, there is a quick, easy and wrong solution. The Minister has found the wrong solution yet again in this instance.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Labour Party carried out a study of Deputy Harney&rsquo;s first year in office and I noted what she stated regarding these payments. On 14 April 2005 she stated, &ldquo;I hope we will start to make repayments towards the end of the year, beginning in autumn. . .&rdquo;. That referred to autumn 2005. We now hear it will be July and into the autumn of this year before these repayments are made. It shows more lethargy, delay and prevarication.</P>
    <P>Even when the Minister acts quickly, she does not get it right. When she introduced legislation after this scandal was unearthed, she refused to accept that constitutional issues were raised. It was as if a pigheadedness drove her and she continued regardless of the best advice given by this side of the House. Fortunately, the President referred the legislation to the Supreme Court where it was struck down quickly and new legislation had to be introduced. Even when she speeds up, the Minister does not seem to be successful or productive.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions, Deputy Twomey raised the issue of the rights of elderly people in private nursing homes. I agree with him that it is important to hear the Government&rsquo;s view on this issue. The previous Ombudsman, Kevin Murphy, produced a report in which he clearly stated that in his view a sizeable cohort of people are entitled to free care. Kevin Murphy came before the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children and I remember asking about this matter. It was clearly flagged and that was quite a number of years ago. Mr. Murphy left office clear in his own mind that this was the case.</P>
    <P>Since then, we have not heard from the Government what is its position or what is the advice of the Attorney General. What we do know is that cases are going through the courts and eventually the courts will make a decision and the Government will react. At that stage, another bill must be paid which, because of prolonged inaction, will be higher than it should be.</P><Col N="1235"/>
    <P>Debating an Estimate such as this also raises other issues regarding the care of the elderly. Many people were shocked by the extremely revealing RTE programme on Leas Cross. We tend not to think too much about what happens within nursing homes. Many nursing homes are excellent. My mother lived in a nursing home for a number of years and I pay tribute to all those who looked after her. They did a wonderful job.</P>
    <P>However, without proper scrutiny we do not have the confidence to state in all cases our elderly are well looked after in nursing homes. I will quote the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children again. On 31 May 2005 she stated, &ldquo;The relevant Bill to establish the social services inspectorate on a statutory basis to deal with both private and public nursing homes will be published later this year&rdquo;. The reality is this has been subsumed into another Bill and we have yet to see it. Inspections with prior notice to nursing home owners are not good enough. Inspections of public nursing homes are in-house in the sense they are not examined by an independent body. That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I do not want to pre-empt any investigation but in a recent case, Hannah Comber regrettably slipped in a chair and died from being choked by a restraining belt. A group has been established to investigate that case and I welcome that investigation. However, it seems indicative that all is not right in terms of ensuring the elderly are protected. I note a social worker is not in the group.</P>
    <P>The point was made to me that clear guidelines are required on the use of restraining belts and restraints in psychiatric institutions or nursing homes. That point has certain validity. The Irish Association of Social Workers produced an ethical statement on the use of restraints in residential hospital and institutional care settings. The statement sets out clearly a framework whereby the use of restraints can be permitted in an ethical way which is protective of the patient. Will the Minister examine that short document to see whether these measures, which I imagine are commonplace when dealing with frail people or within the psychiatric services, are appropriate?</P>
    <P>Reference must be made to another issue when discussing care for the elderly, which is community care and home care packages. This Government promotes itself as one which cares about the elderly. However, currently we have 41 public health nurse vacancies and 100 vacancies out of 280 public health doctor posts. We have fewer community nursing beds than we had in 1997 and Limerick has seen a reduction of approximately 60 beds. The reality is that community services for the elderly are shrinking.</P>
    <P>Compared with Northern Ireland, we are a disgrace. Chiropody services are unavailable because chiropodists are effectively on strike regarding public patients. Chiropodists will not visit nursing homes and I fully understand why. What they are paid is pathetic. These are the type <Col N="1236"/>of quality of life services which elderly people require. One may wait eight or nine months for a visit from an occupational therapist to approve a disabled person&rsquo;s grant. That is the reality at community level and it must be addressed. Meanwhile, we put this money aside to pay our debts.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Connolly. I speak on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Gormley, the health spokesperson of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, who has raised the issue of conditions in nursing homes and patient care for many years. He has called for more emphasis on community care, an issue I will return to.</P>
    <P>My party welcomes the provision of the Supplementary Estimate; that principle is established. We are concerned, however, about the wider implication in terms of the delay, the fact the President had to determine the position for the people, and the principle now established of elderly people having to pay for their own care. That is wrong. I have said previously in the House that whatever about the measures being put in place to pay for the money stolen in the past, there is a wider problem in terms of what happens in the future. I will not go into that now because my time is limited.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Gormley, asked me to raise a number of issues, one of which is community care, which he described to me yesterday as being in a shambles. I am aware of that also in my constituency. The position appears to be that one hand of bureaucracy does not necessarily know what the other is doing. There is no co-ordination. For example, a relative of an elderly patient who is in need of some community care was told she would have to wait up to four years before she could be assessed by an occupational therapist to determine if she would qualify to apply for a grant to install a shower. Thankfully, that case was sorted out fairly quickly. We found out that if the person is over 80 the waiting list is a year, not four years. This individual, miraculously, found out that she would be served within five or six weeks. I am delighted the highlighting of that issue helped in some small way but there are similar cases throughout the country where a lack of funding and targeted resources are affecting elderly people, no more so than in nursing homes.</P>
    <P>The need for an independent inspectorate for public nursing homes was raised earlier by Deputy McManus. There is little point in informing a nursing home that it is about to be inspected because everything will be ship shape during that period, only to return to its normal way of operating following the inspection.</P>
    <P>I was invited to a particular nursing home to meet and talk to the constituents living in the home. It was a very nice day. The residents of the nursing home enjoyed the visit but when it came to following up on the visit I found, from examining the marked register, that not one of the resi<Col N="1237"/>dents had voted. I suggest that is because the proprietors of the nursing home were more interested in the photo-shoots and the publicity surrounding the visit of a candidate but when it came to putting their money where their mouth is, they did not bother arranging for a bus to bring the residents to vote. That is just one example of the sort of treatment residents are subjected to in some nursing homes.</P>
    <P>We need more, smaller, community orientated facilities. I acknowledge the role the Government has played in some situations but to reiterate on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Gormley, there is not sufficient funding. The available funding is not being targeted in the right areas. There is not enough co-operation among various sections within the Department of Health and Children and also in terms of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. I have more comments to make but as the time is limited I will pass to my colleague.</P>

	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in will not be opposing this Estimate. We recognise it is necessary for the long overdue payments to people who were wrongly charged for nursing home care and also for their heirs in many cases. We oppose the referral to the committee without debate. Our position has been vindicated by its appearance on today&rsquo;s Order Paper when the issues we raise will be lost in the welter of all the other issues that will be addressed today, the last day of the D&aacute;il sitting.</P>
    <P>Very serious issues have arisen regarding the tendering process for the Health Service Executive contract to administer the repayment scheme for people wrongly charged for nursing home care. During the debate on the legislation I raised questions about the wisdom of contracting out this contract to the private sector. Now we find that the firm selected wanted to outsource the work to India and that this may be in breach of European Union regulations. Regardless of whether it is in breach of EU regulations, this is yet another farce. It is incredible in the context of the nursing home repayment debacle.</P>
    <P>Questions have also arisen about the way the tender was sought. It was reported on 28 June that KPMG, the private consortium selected by the HSE to administer the refund of nursing home charges, is to be paid up to &euro;15 million for the job. The HSE has confirmed that that figure does not include value added tax, which means it will be much more. The HSE has also confirmed that the consortium plans to out-source some of the work involved in the administration of the refunds to India.</P>
    <P>When that was first revealed, a question was raised about whether such outsourcing was permissible under EU regulations and data protection. The HSE has claimed that EU law facilitates the transfer of data outside the EU for processing where certain contract clauses are used. It said it had worked with the Data Protection Com<Col N="1238"/>missioner to ensure all necessary measures were in place to protect the confidentiality of information. Many questions arise about all of that and there is fairly universal concern, and not just on the Opposition benches. I ask the Minister to address it substantively in his closing remarks.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate if serious consideration was given to the carrying out of this work by the HSE? What are the working conditions of the people in India who will be doing this outsourced work? Will Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money be used to the benefit of employers who may be exploiting workers with pay and conditions we would not tolerate in this country?</P>
    <P>The HSE has said it initiated the tendering process last July but the initial process was abandoned and a second one started in February 2006. What was the reason for that? That must be explained. What was the difficulty with the first tendering process? A reply from the HSE to a parliamentary question from the Minister&rsquo;s colleague in Government, Deputy Glennon, stated that after short-listing 12 expressions of interest, three companies were invited to submit a tender. The HSE further stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">The reason that the procurement process was terminated in 2005 was due to the fact that one of these tenders arrived late for consideration, a second tender was found to be materially non-compliant and the third tender was materially compliant subject to some minor issues. With only one tender remaining in contention, it was decided to fold the process and to commence a second process with the possibility of a more competitive market response.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The KPMG consortium has confirmed it was excluded from the first tendering process because its submission arrived late. It tendered again when a second competition took place and was successful. Again, it is reasonable that people would ask if the process was abandoned and restarted to ensure the successful tender by KPMG?</P>
    <P>The Estimate before the House is for the &euro;340 million due to be refunded this year out of some &euro;1 billion overall due to people who were overcharged. That money must be allocated and paid out but we have every right to raise the questions that I and other Deputies have raised today. I hope the Minister will satisfy not only our intent at getting to the full facts but a much wider public interest.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. The nursing home charges fiasco has turned into a major issue but it would have been a non-issue if there had been some honesty in high places. That is one of the tragedies of the whole process because there were people who knew that what was happening was a con or a deceit. While people do not mind paying for a bed, they do not like being conned. People I have met recognise that they do not get anything <Col N="1239"/>without paying for it. To add insult to injury, the instruction to the health boards was not to charge those creating a sufficiently big fuss, which was a serious deception and a very shabby way to treat a very vulnerable group of people at the end of their lives.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, made a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children during which he referred to different levels of return to people. I detected that this might refer to people who had been in mental health institutions or people of intellectual disability. I would like that issue clarified in the House today. I could not support such differences in repayment.</P>
    <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in spoke about outsourcing, with which I also have major difficulties. When the contract was agreed with the Health Service Executive I have no doubt that no reference was made to the fact that part of the work would be sent to India. We have no way of knowing whether these people are paid 50 cent an hour. Is this another Gama? It sets a precedent which should be addressed. The work is not highly technical. Many students here could do this type of work during the summer and we would keep the money in the country. We cannot let this happen again.</P>
    <P>Some people who had worked for health boards left and got their superannuation. When they had to return to work and repay their superannuation, the health board charged them a compound rate of interest, which was a severe penalty to those wanting to get back into the workforce and wanted to buy back their pension rights. People whose money was taken illegally are getting repayment which only reflects the consumer price index increase. There is a significant difference between these two cases. I would like some consistency with the Health Service Executive in terms of returning money.</P>
    <P>The issue for most people is getting a nursing home or acute hospital bed when they are sick. If their lives are in danger, they need to be able to get a bed in an acute hospital. Upwards of 2,000 beds can be occupied by elderly people who are inappropriately left in general hospitals. A general hospital costs approximately &euro;700 per day. However, if the patient is transferred to a nursing home, &euro;700 would pay for a bed for a week. Despite this, we have difficulties with discharge. Nursing staff know that a significant issue when elderly patients are clinically fit for discharge is where to send them. Should they be sent home? Does the home need repair work? Do the patients need care hours which will cost? Obviously it would be much cheaper and more satisfactory for patients if that were delivered in their own homes. The major issue is that of subvention, which comes from a separate budget to that for hospitals. In-house fighting takes place in the health services. If those responsible for community-based services are not prepared to pay, <Col N="1240"/>the patient will be left in hospital occupying a bed.</P>
    <P>Too often we hear of the negative aspects, which reflect badly on those working in nursing homes. We should acknowledge the brilliant work done by a large number of people in nursing homes. People feel that what happened in Leas Cross has reflected badly on staff in all nursing homes, which is not the case. Many very happy people are in nursing homes. When the Inspector of Mental Hospitals was due to visit a psychiatric hospital, it was notified approximately three months in advance which gave it the opportunity to put its best foot forward. Nursing home inspections should be unannounced and regular.</P>

   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I wish to draw the attention of the House to a serious flaw in the motion before us. On reading the motion yesterday, I noticed what seemed to be a disparity between the terms of the motion and what is required under the primary legislation. I have now received three separate sets of legal advice confirming that the motion is seriously flawed and does not comply with what is required under the primary legislation, which states: &ldquo;The Minister for Finance may not dispose of any shares in the Company without the general principles of the disposal being laid before and approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.&rdquo; The motion calls for our approval of the disposal of the shares and, therefore, any sale that might proceed on the basis of this flawed motion would be unlawful. I ask the Minister to withdraw his motion.</P>
    <P>I had submitted an amendment on behalf of Fine Gael yesterday. In view of this flaw in the motion, I now wish to submit another amendment, which corrects that flaw. I hope the Acting Chairman will be willing to accept this amendment. While I realise it is not normal procedure to accept amendments on the hoof like this, it is an unusual situation. This is the last slot on the last day of the D&aacute;il session.</P>

	<P>My response to the Deputy is very straightforward. What I have before me was drafted by all the legal teams involved in the matter. I have no reason to believe that there is any defect in the Government motion, which is fully in accordance with the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Even a non-expert can realise that the Minister is not doing what is required in the legislation. I find it astonishing that he has had such eminent legal advice and could not come up with a motion in line with the terms of the primary legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>What I have before me is the legal opinion drafted by the legal experts. I am in their hands regarding that interpretation.</P>
    <P>I move:</P>
    <P LI="1">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, pursuant to section 3(5) of the Aer Lingus Act 2004, approves the disposal of shares in Aer Lingus Group plc by the Minister for Finance in accordance with section 3(2) of the Aer Lingus Act 2004, the general principles of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 4 July 2006.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The motion seeks the approval of the House for the general principles of the disposal of shares in Aer Lingus. The Aer Lingus Act 2004 contains a provision requiring the approval of the D&aacute;il for the general principles of any proposed disposal of shares in Aer Lingus. A document setting out the general principles was therefore laid before the House earlier this week.</P>
    <P>Before addressing the general principles, I would like to trace some of the background to the proposed public offering of shares. Aer Lingus was founded by the Government in April 1936 to provide air services to and from Ireland. From a modest beginning with a single aircraft, the fledgling airline grew steadily over the following decades. A significant milestone in 1958 was the inauguration of transatlantic services to New York using a fleet of three leased Lockheed aircraft. The 1960s saw the airline take delivery of a fleet of Boeing aircraft and, in the early 1970s, the iconic Boeing 747 was introduced and, throughout the 1980s, continued to service the north Atlantic. By the early 1980s, Aer Lingus had diversified significantly. Its subsidiaries included hotels, a computer processing company, personnel and project management services, a <Col N="1242"/>helicopter operation, airframe maintenance and engine overhaul companies, and other business.</P>
    <P>However, the company was adversely affected by the economic downturn of the early 1990s resulting in serious financial losses. A restructuring plan, Strategy for the Future, subsequently referred to as the Cahill plan, was introduced by management in 1993 to return the group to profitability. The plan entailed an injection of &euro;222.2 million of new equity by the Government over a three year period and covered all the commercial and operational areas of the business. In subsequent years, the company was able to take advantage of the upturn in the industry and performed strongly. In the period from 1994 to 1999, Aer Lingus implemented a major disposal of its non-core assets, including CARA, Aer Turas, PARC and TEAM.</P>
    <P>The tragic events of 11 September 2001 acted as the catalyst for a further financial crisis. Faced with major threats to its viability, Aer Lingus implemented a radical survival plan which included the reduction of over 2,000 staff, extensive work practice changes, a pay freeze and the sale of non-essential assets and remaining non-core subsidiaries. In addition to cutting costs, the company also implemented a new low fare strategy and expanded its network within existing resources. As a result of the implementation of this plan and the commitment of management and employees, the company turned around its financial performance. Since then, the company has continued to perform well in a particularly challenging operating environment and has posted good results for 2005.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has a proud record of success in serving the economic interests of the State. The airline&rsquo;s history, which has been punctuated by the need for radical rationalisation measures, most notably in the 1990s and in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the US, demonstrates the need for the airline to be able to access equity to fund growth.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Repeated calls have been made for the State to invest in Aer Lingus. It is true that a State investment in a State company made in accordance with the so-called market economy investor principle is capable of surviving a challenge under the European Union&rsquo;s state aid rules. In practice, however, the application of the principle is not straightforward and investments in Aer Lingus cannot be guaranteed to accord with it. The guidelines published by the Commission in 1994 on the application of the EU treaty provisions concerning state aids in the aviation sector states the following in the conclusion of its introduction:</P>
    <P LI="1">An important element in the Commission&rsquo;s judgement will be the fact that the company has already been granted State aid. Therefore the Commission will not allow further aid unless under exceptional circumstances, unforeseeable and external to the company. Moreover, given the fact that Article 222 of the <Col N="1243"/>Treaty is neutral with regard to property ownership, the Commission cannot impose the privatization of an airline as a condition of the State aid. However, the participation of private risk sharing capital will be taken into account in the Commission&rsquo;s analysis.</P>
    <P FLI="0">It will be recalled that the capital injection of &euro;222.2 million, which was made by the State in the company as part of the 1993 Cahill plan, had to be approved in advance by the European Commission and this approval was given on the understanding that the investment would not be repeated. Any further State investment in Aer Lingus could therefore be expected to be the subject of a critical appraisal by the European Commission. Challenges could also be brought before the European Court of Justice by other member states, airlines or even ferry companies.</P>
    <P Just="Left">In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 2001 and the ensuing aviation industry downturn, it was clear from contacts with the European Commission that the prospect of approval for a Government investment to support the survival plan was remote, even though it was argued that there was compelling evidence that an investment would satisfy the market economy investor principle. The rules pertaining to state aid are complex and give rise to issues, such as approval and susceptibility to legal challenge, which do not apply to private sector investments. Even if an investment by the Government in Aer Lingus withstood scrutiny, there could be no guarantee that this would always be the case. This absence of certainty in regard to the access to funds hinders the ability of Aer Lingus to prepare effective business plans and puts it at a disadvantage in a very competitive industry.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, even if competing priorities facilitated Exchequer investment in Aer Lingus, the possibility of an investment being made by the Government as and when needed without raising state aid concerns would be far less certain than would be the case if the company could access investment through the international capital markets.</P>
    <P>The company&rsquo;s potential to expand in existing and new markets improved markedly as a direct result of its turnaround and improvement in competitiveness. The company has identified a range of new and exciting opportunities for expansion and has launched a large number of new European routes over the past few years. More recently, it inaugurated its first ever east bound long-haul service to Dubai. The potential for growth has brought sharply into focus the need for new funding to finance business expansion.</P>
    <P>Recent history has shown that the airline business is becoming increasingly competitive and some well-known airlines have gone to the wall. The emergence of a significant number of low cost carriers has brought new challenges to traditional industry structures and assumptions. <Col N="1244"/>Against this backdrop, the Government&rsquo;s strategic aim for Aer Lingus is to ensure the company has access to sufficient resources over the long term to enable it to compete successfully and develop its business as market opportunities emerge and to give it the strength in its balance sheet to withstand industry downturns and external shocks, both of which are recognised features of the airline industry.</P>
    <P>To provide the company with this certainty, I brought proposals to Government last May on its investment requirements and future ownership structure. These proposals took account of consultations with the trade unions in line with the terms of Sustaining Progress. In its decision, the Government agreed to a reduction in the State&rsquo;s shareholding in Aer Lingus, while retaining a significant stake of at least 25.1% to protect key strategic interests, provided that the Minister for Finance and I are satisfied that this level of reduction is warranted on foot of the analysis prepared by our advisers for the IPO.</P>
    <P>Following the Government&rsquo;s decision, the Minister for Finance and I appointed financial and legal advisers to advise us on the most appropriate investment transaction mechanism for Aer Lingus and the scale and timing of the proposed transaction. The advisers reported to us at the end of last year. On the basis of the advice we received, we brought proposals to Government on 4 April for the implementation of an investment transaction for Aer Lingus. Arising from that meeting, we are proceeding on the following basis. In line with the Government&rsquo;s decision of May 2005, the Government intends to reduce its shareholding in Aer Lingus while retaining a significant stake. The company will also issue new shares to fund business development through an initial public offering of the company&rsquo;s shares on the Stock Exchange. The Government will retain a minimum stake of 25.1% in the company to protect the State&rsquo;s key strategic interests. The transaction is to be implemented as soon as possible, subject to Stock Exchange rules and market conditions. This will provide the company with ongoing access to capital on the same basis as its main competitors and give it the means to develop and grow in coming years to the benefit of the airline&rsquo;s consumers and staff and the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>Throughout the process, the importance of securing the support of Aer Lingus workers has been to the forefront of our minds. I met the trade unions on a number of occasions over the past year with regard to the future of Aer Lingus and met them twice in the month before I finalised the proposals for a transaction. I am aware of the concerns of many staff in Aer Lingus with regard to the proposed IPO, particularly in respect of issues such as job security and pensions. However, I am confident these issues can best be secured in the context of a strong, growing and competitive company.</P><Col N="1245"/>
    <P>Arising from my consultations with the trade unions, Aer Lingus management was mandated to engage with the trade unions with a view to addressing the issues identified by the unions. There has been an intensive process of engagement and a range of proposals have been tabled and discussed to address the concerns expressed. The proposals include measures pertaining to job security, pensions and the ESOT shareholding. There is now a basis for bringing these matters to a satisfactory conclusion in the near future.</P>
    <P>I will now discuss the general principles of the IPO. For legal reasons, I am restricted in what I can say about Aer Lingus and its business at this stage in the privatisation process. Accordingly, as required by the Act, I am seeking the approval of the House for the general principles of the sale. I have clearly indicated in the general principles laid before the House that the Minister for Finance intends to dispose of a number of shares in Aer Lingus by way of an initial public offering. At the same time the company intends to issue new shares to raise fresh equity for the business to fund development. The shares will be listed on the Irish and UK stock exchanges. As a practical matter in flotations of this nature, many of the details will not be decided until much closer to the IPO date and some issues such as the definitive offer price range and the exact structure of the offer will not be decided upon until closer to the marketing process.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of the share offer is to allow Aer Lingus to raise funds to ensure that it has the financial strength to fund business development and to withstand the external shocks and industry downturns that are a recognised feature of the aviation industry. The possibility of raising new equity also affords the company the opportunity to address the concerns of the Aer Lingus trade unions and workers arising from the funding of the company&rsquo;s main pension scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to selling shares so that a majority of the shares in Aer Lingus will be held by institutional and private investors after the transaction is completed. Without a commitment to ensuring that a majority share of the company will be held by the private sector it would be more difficult for the company to raise equity through the issue of shares. The Minister for Finance and I will decide on the actual number of shares to be sold at a date much closer to the IPO itself and this decision will take account of considerations such as market conditions and the level of demand. The State will retain a shareholding of at least 25.1% with a view to protecting strategic interests.</P>
    <P>The offer structure will be an institutional offer to both domestic and international institutions, including institutions in Europe and the United States. In addition, there will be an offer through financial intermediaries in Ireland. A minimum application amount of &euro;10,000 will be set for retail investors in Aer Lingus which will facilitate <Col N="1246"/>participation by members of the public in the share offer. The allocations of shares to institutional and retail investors will be decided on the basis of the demand for the shares established by the underwriters for the IPO.</P>
    <P>The process of offering shares for sale will commence with the issue of a prospectus. The prospectus will include a price range for the shares, although the IPO share price could ultimately be above or below this range. Following the launch of the offer, the underwriters will market shares to institutional investors in Ireland, the rest of Europe and the United States and to Irish stockbrokers acting as intermediaries for retail investors. These institutions then submit competing bids to buy shares. Following this marketing or bookbuilding process the Minister for Finance, in consultation with me and the company, will agree the IPO share price with the underwriters.</P>
    <P>The proceeds to the Government will depend entirely on the number of shares disposed of and the price per share. The proceeds will be paid into the Central Fund of the Exchequer. The company&rsquo;s equity requirements, including requirements for pension agreements, will be met through the issue of new shares as distinct from the sale of the Government&rsquo;s shares. The exact amount of new equity to be raised by the company will be decided just before the IPO, having regard to its anticipated requirements and market demand for the shares.</P>
    <P>A shareholding of over 25% is significant under the provisions in company law, notably in enabling such a shareholder to prevent a compulsory takeover of 100% of a company and in denying the remaining shareholders the ability to pass special resolutions. Examples of such resolutions are making changes to the memorandum and articles of association. As a major shareholder, the State will also have representation on the board and thereby the opportunity to influence key decisions subject to the fiduciary duties of directors.</P>
    <P>Consideration has been given to the possible need for further safeguards over strategic interests in the context of the disposal of a majority shareholding in the company. London Heathrow Airport currently serves an important role in ensuring connectivity to and from Ireland. The scarcity value of slots at Heathrow could give rise to the possibility of decisions being taken in the commercial interest of Aer Lingus that are not in Ireland&rsquo;s strategic interest. On the other hand it must be acknowledged that the importance of Heathrow as an international hub for Ireland is expected to decline as other hubs such as Amsterdam, Paris and Dubai gain in importance. It will also become less relevant as the range of destinations to which direct services from Ireland are available increases and as Dublin evolves as a hub airport in its own right. The Government has mandated the Dublin Airport Authority to proceed with a significant capi<Col N="1247"/>tal investment programme, including in particular the development of terminal 2 for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic about the potential for new long-haul services both to the east and west and I am in discussions with Singapore and Thailand on new bilateral agreements. Aer Lingus is not subject to any obligation to provide services to Heathrow Airport. It is doing so on a purely commercial basis, as is the privately owned British Midland. This speaks volumes about the commercial value of such services.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, measures must be taken to ensure that sufficient slots are available for services between Ireland and Heathrow to preserve access to the global network of connections available at Heathrow. New articles of association, adopted by the company as part of the IPO process, will, for the purpose of providing the required safeguard, provide that sales of slots at London Heathrow would be subject to a shareholder&rsquo;s resolution. In accordance with company law, these provisions of the articles of association could not subsequently be changed if opposed by the State as a 25.1% shareholder in the company.</P>
    <P>It is intended to provide that a resolution relating to the sale of slots may not be adopted if it is opposed by a defined percentage of shareholders. This percentage will be set at a level some 5% or so in excess of the Government&rsquo;s retained shareholding. In effect this mechanism will enable the State with the support of other shareholders, or of a significant shareholder such as the employee share ownership trust, ESOT, to block a slot sale that is against Ireland&rsquo;s strategic interests.</P>
    <P>It will also be necessary to set out the criteria that will be applied in considering any resolution relating to the sale of slots. The criteria will ensure sufficient services between the State airports and Heathrow to allow passengers connect throughout the course of the day with key long-haul destination flights to and from Heathrow. The connectivity requirements in each case would take account of services provided on the relevant routes by other carriers and would also take account of the evolution of connectivity to and from Ireland from other hubs, particularly Paris, Amsterdam and Dubai. Exceptions to this would be allowed in the case of services that are loss-making and not expected to return to profitability and in respect of short-term leasing arrangements for slots.</P>
    <P>There is no proposal to have a golden share, namely, a provision for a Government veto over company decisions that is not based on the Government&rsquo;s shareholding and the associated voting rights under company law. Golden share arrangements have been found to run counter to EU law. The proposed approach to safeguarding slots has been developed following consultations with the European Commission concerning the treaty rules relating to free movement of capital. It is evident from these consultations that a protection mechanism for Heathrow slots that could <Col N="1248"/>be exercised solely by the Government would be regarded by the Commission as a special right that would be challenged before the European Court of Justice. This is the reasonable and balanced approach to providing safeguards for Heathrow services while respecting the legal constraints of the treaty rules and the need for the company to protect its financial welfare.</P>
    <P>The final decisions with regard to the implementation of the transaction will be sensitive to market considerations. The draft prospectus relating to the company and the IPO will be lodged as soon as possible this month. The necessary regulatory approvals under the prospectus rules will be completed over the summer period. The offer period will commence once the prospectus is issued and is expected to last a number of weeks. This will depend on market conditions and the level of demand. I expect this transaction to be completed before the end of September.</P>
    <P>Certain issues have been identified by the trade unions as the key concerns of staff in Aer Lingus regarding the IPO. As well as engaging with the trade unions under the terms of Sustaining Progress prior to the Government decision last year to proceed with an investment transaction for Aer Lingus, I met with the trade unions on a number of occasions earlier this year. The trade unions identified the key concerns of staff as pensions, job security and dilution of the employee shareholding with new shares being issued in the company. I then mandated the company to engage with the trade unions to address these concerns. Discussions between the company and the trade unions on these issues are continuing and I am confident that these can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion soon.</P>
    <P>While pension issues are primarily a matter for the company and the staff, the Minister for Finance and I stated that we were open to the company using part of the proceeds from issuing new shares in the IPO to supplement the funding position in the company&rsquo;s pension scheme as an element of an overall solution on funding involving increased employer and employee contributions. The position of pensioners will also be addressed in any solution that is agreed. The final figure will be reached in measures to address the concerns of workers. The potential to raise funds through the IPO process presents an opportunity for both the company and staff to supplement the funding of the company&rsquo;s main pension scheme and in this way create a far healthier position which is in the best interests of both the company and staff.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the issue of the level of the employees&rsquo; shareholding in Aer Lingus and the potential impact of the IPO on that shareholding. The employee share ownership trust, ESOT, in Aer Lingus currently holds approximately 12.4% of the shares in the company while existing and former employees hold approximately 2.5% of the shares. The issue of new shares by the company in the IPO process will have the effect of <Col N="1249"/>reducing the proportionate shareholding in the company by the ESOT and employees. This reduction in proportional shareholding will not, of itself, dilute the value of this shareholding. Rather, the value is likely to be enhanced as a result of the IPO both because of the provision of new equity to the company and the increase in the liquidity of the company&rsquo;s shares.</P>
    <P>The terms of the existing ESOT agreement which was negotiated a short number of years ago in view of a potential third party investment, provide for substantial safeguards against dilution of the ESOT&rsquo;s shareholding. The company is currently consulting with trade unions and the ESOT on further measures to counter potential dilution. This process does not entail, as speculated upon in some sectors of the media, the granting of free shares to the ESOT. I understand there has been active dialogue on all of these issues and that a considerable level of progress has been made to date. The company is making every effort to bring the outstanding matters to a satisfactory conclusion in a timely manner.</P>
    <P>I wish to set out briefly the position on the negotiations between the EU and the US on an aviation agreement.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In November 2005 EU and US negotiators concluded work on the text of a first phase EU-US open skies agreement. The text was unanimously endorsed at the December 2005 <Col N="1250"/>Transport Council subject to sufficient progress by the US side on opening up ownership and control of US airlines to EU investors. The formal US process of changing its ownership and control rules was expected to be concluded early in 2006 so that a final decision could be taken at the June Transport Council. However, the rule-making process has been extended and is now expected to be concluded in August and the matter will be considered by the October Transport Council.</P>
    <P>As part of the EU-US deal I met with US Secretary for Transportation, Mr. Norman Mineta, on 9 November 2005 to negotiate transitional arrangements for Shannon which were included in the EU-US text. This provided that the 1:1 Shannon stop requirement, that is, one stop at Shannon for every stop at Dublin, would change to 1:3 for the period November 2006 to end March 2008, after which the Shannon stop requirement would end. During the transitional period access to three additional US destinations would be allowed.</P>
    <P>It has been agreed that these transitional measures will take effect at the end of October if the necessary political agreement is reached at the Transport Council earlier that month. The opportunities that an open skies agreement will present will complement the possibilities for expansion of services from Ireland in an east bound direction as well.</P>
    <P>The legal framework for the IPO and sale of shares in Aer Lingus and related matters is provided for in the Aer Lingus Act 2004. Some parts of the Act have already been commenced. I propose to make arrangements for commencement of the appropriate parts of the Act as and when required to implement the IPO. Most of the provisions will only need to be commenced immediately before implementation of the IPO.</P>
    <P>Legal advisers to the Minister for Finance and I have made clear that financial securities laws restrict the release of important information about Aer Lingus. Failure to observe the publicity restrictions could require postponement of the offering or result in civil or criminal penalties. I am advised that no opinions or speculation should be given concerning the success of the flotation or about the business, financial condition or future prospects of Aer Lingus. The prospectus to be issued of the transaction will set out comprehensively its investment case for shares in Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P LI="1">In the last line after &ldquo;2006&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;, and furthermore, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann resolves that&mdash;</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p4- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the Minister for Finance shall gain the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann before allowing any reduction of the State&rsquo;s shareholding in Aer Lingus Group plc <Col N="1251"/>below the 25.1% referred to in the general principles;</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p4- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>any approval granted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the general principles of the disposal of shares in Aer Lingus Group plc shall, if not acted upon, expire within four months of the passing of this resolution; and</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p4- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>all shares in Aer Lingus Group plc to be issued or placed in the initial public offering shall be valued and sold at an equal unit price per share to all investors and there shall be no price differential or distinction made between those shares, the proceeds of the sale of which go to the central fund of the Exchequer, and those shares, the proceeds of the sale of which go to Aer Lingus Group plc.&rdquo;</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">I had hoped to withdraw this amendment and submit a new amendment based on the flaw I identified earlier but I understand that is not permissible. I ask the Minister to consider what I say before 4 p.m. and not to proceed with the motion as published.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has always believed that Aer Lingus&rsquo;s best interests are served by allowing it access to private capital and the commercial freedom to respond quickly and appropriately to the often volatile market conditions in the aviation sector. This is not an ideological position or decision, it is purely practical. We are aware of the extremely competitive, volatile and difficult environment in which any airline now operates, subject to external shocks, local and global political conditions, natural disasters and fuel price fluctuations, over none of which any airline has control regardless of whether it is in the public or private sector.</P>
    <P>We do not believe private ownership is the panacea for a successful airline. There are no guarantees but we believe that Aer Lingus&rsquo;s best chance to survive and prosper lies in private ownership. It is already competing with airlines that have access to private capital and that can respond to rapidly changing market conditions without reference to a lethargic, ponderous and cautious political system. We should not spancel or disadvantage Aer Lingus <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the other airlines with which it must compete.</P>
    <P>However, from a position of support in principle we are now asking, as are many members of the public, if this sale makes any sense and whether it is, in fact, a sale or just a giveaway. It is difficult to conceive of a less propitious preparation for an IPO. Time and again, indecision, lethargy and procrastination postponed a decision until the timing, the most crucial variable in a flotation, was no longer in the Government&rsquo;s control. Foot and mouth disease, the events of 11 September 2001, a general election, a fuel crisis <Col N="1252"/>and, finally, sheer petulance, when the Taoiseach refused to be pushed into a sale by a management increasingly desperate for a decision, took the initiative from a Government simply unwilling or unable to make a decision.</P>
    <P>The Government lost the best airline management team in Europe. It was forced into another year long delay while new management was found and got established. In the meantime, market conditions deteriorated, the price of airplanes escalated, the price of fuel went through the roof, other competing airlines positioned themselves on the best routes to the best destinations, restructuring at Aer Lingus stalled and the cost base of the airline grew to 50% more than that of the average European airline.</P>
    <P>Desperation set in and the Taoiseach, who will do anything for a quiet life, sent word to the management that it was to buy peace at any price. That is precisely what the management did, with a generosity with the taxpayers&rsquo; asset that leaves us reeling. I am not the only one questioning if it makes sense to pay &euro;250 million to employees for permission to raise &euro;400 million. It certainly devalues the airline in the eyes of a potential investor and even the employees must be wondering if this package, with all its hostages to fortune, is really in their long-term interests.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Given that introduction, we can be forgiven for being a little wary of giving our unmitigated support to the sale. With considerable prescience, we were wary in 2004 when the Aer Lingus Act was passed. At that time Fine Gael requested that what would amount to a White Paper in all but name be presented to the House for detailed debate and that this debate would take place early enough in the process to allow an input into the decision-making process. It was envisaged that there would be a comprehensive analysis of the potential gains and losses of a sale, if the gains would outweigh the losses or vice versa, identification of the extent of the losses, for instance, in terms of the country&rsquo;s strategic interests, and how those interests could be protected. The Minister of the day thought this condition entirely reasonable, saying:</P>
    <P LI="1">I will produce a paper laying out the Government&rsquo;s position and the position of the company in good time to allow for discussion on it before finalisation of proposals for change of ownership . . . It is appropriate that any such paper be published in time to make a difference as opposed to it being published when the die is cast . . . There are serious issues, and it is my intention to address them in the position paper about which I am talking. I will produce it in good time for members to consider it and make a serious input into the process.</P>
    <P FLI="0">That never materialised, no strategic analysis was ever produced of why we were selling Aer Lingus or how we would go about it while protecting our strategic interests. The D&aacute;il has had no input into <Col N="1253"/>the nature of the sale. To compound that breach of faith, the general principles document, which the Minister agreed would be the basis for giving us all the information, is an insult to the D&aacute;il and to the taxpayers who own this company.</P>
    <P>The principles outlined here are nothing more than an outline of the procedure to be followed by any company in the placing and issuing of shares. We could get this information from any text book or website. It adds nothing to our knowledge and makes it impossible for us to play our role as a watchdog for the public.</P>
    <P>It is even worse than that. Not alone does the Minister tell us nothing, he cannot even get the procedure right. The legislation requires that he gets approval for the principles of disposal. They must be laid before the House and approved by the D&aacute;il, but the motion calls for the approval of the disposal of the shares. Legally the D&aacute;il cannot do that. The motion is not what is required by the legislation and we are bound by that.</P>
    <P>In the sorry saga of the sale of Aer Lingus this is just another monumental mess &mdash; gross incompetence, gross indifference or gross carelessness. Worse, it is yet another example of the arrogance of this Government, reflecting the view that the D&aacute;il does not really matter and anything is really good enough. It is not even necessary to have regard for primary legislation.</P>
    <P>This is a dud motion. If the Minister pursues it and clings to belief in its validity, any sale following this flawed approval will be unlawful. The Minister should consider that before we vote on this at 4 p.m. It will put PPARS and electronic voting machines in the ha&rsquo;penny place in terms of the cost to the taxpayers. If he has faith in his legal advisers, the Minister should go to his underwriters and ask them if they are willing to expose themselves to the loss of huge sums on behalf of the taxpayer. This will be challenged and, at the very least, a judicial review will be granted.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants approval today for a September sale, he must accept my amendment or introduce one of his own before he goes home this evening or he will have egg on his face, the sale will be further delayed and the airline will be in jeopardy and further exposed to swings in the notoriously volatile market for airlines.</P>
    <P>To say that the principles are vague is to understate it. There is simply no information on which the Opposition or Government backbenchers can make an informed decision. We are acting on behalf of the real owners of Aer Lingus, the citizens of Ireland. If this were a plc sale of shares, all information about the sale would have to be made available to shareholders at a general meeting so that they could give their approval. We, however, get nothing. In a few weeks the prospectus will give all relevant information to the buyers but, bizarrely, the seller cannot even be told how much is to be sold. We do not know how much is to be raised for Aer Lingus or how much is to be <Col N="1254"/>raised for the Exchequer. That is basic information.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The share price will be determined by the amount needed to be raised by the new share issue. Raising the required capital for Aer Lingus is naturally a vital concern, but concern for Aer Lingus should not cloud the Government&rsquo;s judgment about the timing of the issue and about what would be an acceptable yield to the taxpayer. I have said before that the Government must have a predetermined floor price below which the sale becomes untenable.</P>
    <P>It is my job to defend and the taxpayers. In doing that, I do not want their share of the proceeds to become the residual, perhaps offered at a lower price than the issue price to ensure the success of the new issue in raising the target funds for the airline. That is not acceptable to me or to Fine Gael. We will not tolerate a giveaway or a fire sale of a national asset which has been invested in and supported for more than 70 years by the people. We will support a sale, but not a sell out or giveaway.</P>
    <P>The only control the D&aacute;il can exercise to prevent a knock-down price for the taxpayer, a tactic which could be pursued by the Minister to ensure a successful new issue for the airline, is to establish some kind of floor price below which it becomes unacceptable. The D&aacute;il cannot let the Minister sell at any price.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we cannot nominate a floor price without jeopardising maximising its value. We can, however, demand that the price per share to the taxpayer would be no lower than the price per share to the airline. It may be that the shares will face a buoyant demand and I hope that is the case, but I cannot depend on it and my job is to be the watchdog of public assets on behalf of the citizens of Ireland of whose asset we are now disposing.</P>
    <P>That is one amendment I have submitted. The second amendment also seeks to maximise the value for the taxpayer by ensuring that the sale occurs at the optimum time. Voting for disposal by the D&aacute;il is not voting for disposal at any price and, as the Minister is aware, the price may vary dramatically over time. Therefore, it is reasonable to place a time limit on the approval and so avoid the pitfall of giving <i>carte blanche</i> to a Government which may become desperate to sell, even at the bottom of the market and at a price unacceptable to the shareholders. Therefore, if the Government fails to sell within four months of today, the motion would require fresh D&aacute;il approval for disposal.</P>
    <P>My final amendment clarifies and leaves outside any doubt the requirement to seek D&aacute;il approval should the Government, of whatever hue, wish to allow the dilution of the State&rsquo;s 25.1% shareholding. This percentage, we are told, is the minimum required to protect our national strategic interest. If that is the case and the Government thinks it can guarantee that, it is <Col N="1255"/>reasonable to require a vote of the D&aacute;il if we are to abandon that objective.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated an intention to change the articles of association to prevent the disposal of the Heathrow slots. I am not sure to what extent this attempt would be successful in the longer term, but it is not the disposal of the slots we should be worried about &mdash; the Minister has missed the point. Aer Lingus does not own the slots and we are not really concerned about their disposal. We are concerned about the transfer of the use of the slots from the base in Dublin to some other base which might be more valuable in future. The Minister should be honest and admit this is a real danger and that in the longer term, there is probably little we can do to prevent it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come to us with a flawed motion during the last D&aacute;il slot on the last day of the session. It may now be inconvenient for the Government to accept that its motion is simply not what the legislation calls for and that on an important issue like this, on the disposal of something to which every citizen feels some sort of attachment, the Opposition must be allowed to speak and offer some protections for the public.</P>
    <P>We are not being irresponsible. We want a successful sale and a thriving airline. We understand that sentiment in the market can change overnight and we appreciate commercial sensitivity. We comprehend that the price will be set by market demand at the time of offer and we do not want to do anything that would jeopardise attaining the optimum price. However, the public is entitled, before any sale, to know how much it is intended to sell, how much it is expected to raise and to be reassured that in no circumstances will its airline be given away.</P>
    <P>The amendments I have submitted should go a long way to ensuring that the public can be reassured. I ask the Minister to support the amendments and, more significantly, not to allow the House to adjourn without considering the nature of the flawed motion put before us. The Minister has until 4 p.m. to consult his legal advisers. Otherwise he will be going home with serious problems. The Minister will expose the taxpayer to huge potential losses. The sale of the airline will be jeopardised and the Minister will certainly have egg on his face.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>In the years to come, today will be seen as a bad day for the country and for Aer Lingus. Today, the Government is asking the House to approve the sell-off of our national airline. We all accept Aer Lingus has played a critical role in the economy. As an island nation, we are all heavily dependent on air travel for trade and tourism. We are fortunate in the services that Aer Lingus has built up so that, as travellers and traders, we have direct access to many destinations. In addition, we have access to almost anywhere in the world, via Heathrow. It is critical <Col N="1256"/>for our economy that those services are maintained. The only sure way of doing that is by retaining the company in Irish public ownership.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s justification for the sale of Aer Lingus is that the airline needs investment so it can continue to grow. No one denies that the company needs access to capital and we all certainly want to see the company expand. It is important to note that the capital needs of the company have never been accurately quantified. Various figures have been tossed about, but at no stage have we seen any business plan setting out the investment needs over, say, the next ten years.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that under the open skies policy, Aer Lingus will need significant numbers of new aircraft. We hope that will be the case but the reality is that the open skies issue is far from being resolved and has recently been set back by resolutions passed by the US Congress.</P>
    <P>We all accept that over the coming years the company will need a certain amount of capital. If that is the case, however, one must ask why the Government is proposing to remove itself as a source of capital from the company. That is exactly what it is proposing to do. If Aer Lingus needs capital, it has a number of options. It could easily borrow, based on its own performance. It could enter into long-term leases, which is what airlines generally do. Alternatively, the Government could invest in the company. We know there is no obstacle to the Government doing this, despite the erroneous impression that some Government representatives have been trying to give to the contrary.</P>
    <P>If this is a good investment for the private sector, then it is also a good investment for the public sector. The Labour Party, as well as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, have put forward proposals for a State holding company, a vehicle through which investment could take place while also ensuring critical commercial freedom for the company.</P>
    <P>The traditional argument for flogging State assets has always been that there was a need to raise funds for the Exchequer, but that argument does not hold up anymore because the Government coffers are overflowing. The reality is that this right-wing Government is fundamentally opposed to a commercial semi-State sector, and its motivation in doing this is entirely ideological.</P>
    <P>So what of the proceeds of this proposed sale? What about the promises to invest in the pension fund and new aircraft? We are not getting any of that. The Government proposes to sell off up to 60% of Aer Lingus to raise between &euro;300 million and &euro;400 million. It will take the money and run. In the process there will be a buy-in by private investors who will undoubtedly use the company for their own interests. Private investors will act as private investors always do &mdash; they will seek to get the best possible return on their investment. In other words, they will try to make as much money as they possibly can, as quickly as they <Col N="1257"/>can, and to hell with the consequences. The consequences could, indeed, be very damaging for the company and for all of us who depend on good air transport links. It is quite possible that, as a nation, we will lose control of our air travel services, as Aer Lingus becomes merely a vehicle for profiteering, just like Eircom.</P>
    <P>In the general principles, the Minister makes vague references to our strategic interests. He says that &ldquo;sales or transfers of slots at Heathrow will be subject to a shareholder&rsquo;s resolution&rdquo; and that &ldquo;provision will be made that the resolution will not be passed, if opposed by a defined percentage of shareholders&rdquo;. The Minister goes on to say that &ldquo;this will enable the State, along with other shareholders, to prevent the disposal of slots against Ireland&rsquo;s strategic interests&rdquo;. This is patent nonsense.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact the Minister does not even define the percentage he is talking about, there are three other pertinent points. First, the EU is likely to rule against such a so-called controlling share. It is also interesting to note that the Government has made no formal approach whatsoever to the European Commission on this issue.</P>
    <P>Second, while the State may retain a minimum of 25.1% on the initial public offering, there are no proposals whatsoever to protect that shareholding from dilution on the proposed new share issue.</P>
    <P>Third, if a mechanism was found to retain that kind of influence, it would so devalue the company share price as to render this whole exercise worthless. There is no doubt we would end up in a position where the taxpayer was getting bad value. This is a figleaf and the Minister should be honest enough to admit it.</P>
    <P>As regards the importance of the Heathrow slots, in recent weeks the Minister has spoken about the importance of Dubai becoming a hub, but that does not wash in an Irish context. Who will be travelling via Dubai? It is nonsense when one thinks about it.</P>

	<P>As far as the promises to look after Aer Lingus pensioners are concerned, it now appears the Government has reneged on them also. The Government is walking away from the pension issue entirely. This section in the <Col N="1258"/>general principles starts with the words, &ldquo;Pension issues are primarily matters for the company and the staff&rdquo;. When I read that, I knew the Government was washing its hands of the issue. We are told the pension shortfall is to be met through the issue of new shares, as well as higher contributions from the company and the workforce. What about all the guarantees and promises that were made in this House by the Minister and the Taoiseach that the pensioners would be looked after?</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>On top of that, the staff&rsquo;s significant concerns in respect of job security and terms and conditions are far from being resolved. The detail of the general principles before us is sketchy to say the least. One has to ask if the Minister, Deputy Cullen, understands the gravity of what he is proposing. As recently as 31 May, the Minister told the Joint Committee on Transport, &ldquo;I clearly stated that the proceeds [of the IPO] are for investment in Aer Lingus&rdquo;. When pressed on this he went on to say, &ldquo;The reason we are <Col N="1259"/>putting Aer Lingus on the market is so the proceeds will be invested in the company&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>What about that, Minister?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>When asked again what he intended to do with the proceeds from the sale of the State share, he repeated for a third time, &ldquo;We will invest them in the company&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should answer that point now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Either the Minister simply did not know what he was talking about or else he was deliberately misleading the committee. I believe the former explanation is more likely, given the cock-ups he has caused and the wanton waste of public money he was responsible for concerning e-voting.</P>

	<P>Aer Lingus is too important to the economy and to the country generally to subject it to the kind of incompetence we have become used to from the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues. We note that the Joint Committee on Transport is in the process of preparing a report on the implications of the proposed sale and it is entirely premature for the House to second-guess those deliberations.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has maintained from the beginning that the proposal to privatise Aer Lingus was ill-considered and ill-judged. This move would serve neither the national interest nor the interests of the travelling public. However, it is clear the Government has not been honest with either the public or the Aer Lingus workers. This motion must, therefore, be defeated.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Today is a day of shame and betrayal by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, especially the Fianna F&aacute;il representatives of Dublin&rsquo;s north side, and the Progressive Democrats Party. We north side representatives in the Labour Party are used to those empty seats in Dublin Airport at various meetings that have been called when none of the Fianna F&aacute;il north side Deputies has had the courage to come and explain why they believed in selling the workforce of Aer Lingus down the river into a privatised, ruthless world of capitalism and ensuring, perhaps, that the great economic driver of the region may well be sacrificed in the future and become a regional airport served by regional airlines to a hub at London.</P>
    <P>Those Deputies&rsquo; names should be noted at the outset &mdash; we have one in the House at least, Deputy Glennon; Deputy Wright, Dublin North; <Col N="1260"/>Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern and Deputy Carey, Dublin North-West; Deputies Haughey and Callely, Dublin North-Central; Deputies Martin Brady and Woods, Dublin North-East, my own constituency; Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Dublin West; and the 11th member of this shameful team, the Taoiseach, Dublin Central. Those 11 Members have refused to stand up for the economic interests of our region and have betrayed it. I hope the workforce of Aer Lingus, the former Aer Rianta and now the Dublin Airport Authority, and the 40,000 or 50,000 workers who depend on that region will remember this eight or nine months hence and will ensure those seats are filled by representatives who will truly represent the people.</P>
    <P>The three page document with which we were presented, which is uninformed and hides behind the scam of &ldquo;we cannot talk&rdquo;, or &ldquo;we cannot give you this or that information because of the legal requirements of security&rdquo;, and this disgraceful speech leave us no wiser on the future of our great company, Aer Lingus, and its workforce. In some ways, this contribution by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, is laughable and ludicrous in regard to the slots. It appears we will have to seek a new hub airport outside of Heathrow. This is the Minister&rsquo;s solution. Effectively we are going to leave Heathrow. The Minister has admitted we are going to Dubai and, perhaps, we will have the Fianna F&aacute;il tent at the Nations Cup in the years ahead. There is no solution to the possible loss of these slots. There is no reference to slot busting which is an important issue for airlines at every airport throughout the world.</P>
    <P>There is nothing for workers in this. There is nothing in terms of their pension entitlements. They are being sold a pig in a poke and are being told that, down the road, there will be negotiations and that something will be done. There is nothing on dilution.</P>
    <P>We are aware that following the privatisation of Eircom there have been five sales. Eircom workers and its trade union, the Communication Workers Union, have desperately had to retrench, weave and bob in the financial markets to try to hold on to their percentage, as they have done successfully in the latest sale. There have been five sales and Eircom workers have had a very uncertain future.</P>
    <P>The major turnaround in recent years in Aer Lingus, which came about because of the ferocious hard work and commitment of the workforce, which was halved in size from what it was a few years ago, is what has created a bright future for our State airline. Since I became a Member in 1992, it has been their work and sacrifices that have created a platform and now the Minister has the cheek to come into the House and present this nonsense and lack of detail.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to reiterate my bitter opposition to the privatisation <Col N="1261"/>of our national airline, which I enunciated on the second day after I became a Member. As an island people, a key part of our infrastructure must be at least one airline that will service the national strategic interest. We have before us the recent history of many state airlines that have been privatised. There have been the remarkable cases of countries similar to Ireland, in particular, New Zealand, which had to buy back the company, Air New Zealand, many years after privatisation. We have also had the experience of the Eircom privatisation. Throughout the history of the Government there has been the disastrous handling of the sale of strategic national assets to the private sector.</P>
    <P>I commend and salute the Aer Lingus workforce. It has been promised a pay increase of<?oasys _jy ?>3%, lump sum payments of up to &euro;4,400 and a 7.5% profit sharing scheme to be transferred to the employee share ownership trust. That is supposed to prevent their share being diluted from 14.9%. According to the Minister&rsquo;s speech and his perspective, the workforce members are being sold a pig in a poke. Privatisation of state airlines was a device concocted by right-wing parties, such as the Minister&rsquo;s and the party from which he was sprung, the Progressive Democrats Party. It is a device to which the Minister has always adhered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Finian McGrath, Sargent and Crowe.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The emergence of the mid-west as an advanced industrial area has been aided greatly by the emergence and continued development of Shannon Airport. The importance of the airport to companies choosing to base themselves in and around Shannon cannot be overstated. In Clare, many companies, in particular American-owned ones, have warned about their long-term future in Ireland in the event of Shannon losing or reducing its transatlantic services. I would go so far as to say that the future of the mid-west, from Limerick to Ennis to Galway, is dependent on an increase of air routes at Shannon Airport and the continued improvement of the infrastructure in the area.</P>
    <P>I am proud of the improvements made in the road network in the mid-west in the past decade. This must continue and I look forward to the completion of the Ennis bypass in the near future. Allied to this, the rail link from Limerick to Galway with a spur link to Shannon must now become a priority. There is no point in having an excellent infrastructure in place unless Shannon Airport continues to hold its prominent position in the air traffic industry.</P>
    <P>It is a source of shame that the staff who helped to turn Aer Lingus from a loss-making company in 2001 to the strong position it is in now should suffer. It is their hard work that has made the company an attractive option to privatise. I hope that the mistakes made in the privatisation of Eircom are not repeated.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Similarly, I hope the situation at An Post is not repeated where staff and pensioners still have not received the increases due to them under Sustaining Progress despite An Post recently announcing profits of &euro;40 million. Workers at Aer Lingus deserve a guarantee that something similar will not happen to them.</P>
    <P>The Government has stated it intends to hold on to a 25.1% share of Aer Lingus in any flotation. I would like the Minister to give a commitment to maintaining that share in the event of a new share issue and guarantee that the Government will buy new shares in such an event and not allow its shareholding to diminish slowly. To facilitate regional development, Shannon Airport in the past lost money by deliberately setting prices too low in an attempt to attract investment, knowing that the loss could be absorbed by the high profits made on Dublin based routes. Dublin Airport has now been boosted by the impending construction of a second terminal, whereas it would appear Shannon is to be simply cut adrift.</P>
    <P>An investment plan to secure the future of Shannon should be put in place immediately before any privatisation or disposal. Shannon Airport had revenue of approximately &euro;95 million in 2004. To help increase this, the catchment area needs to be made more attractive to industry. Along with the Ennis bypass, the rail link needs to be fast-tracked and a river crossing <Col N="1263"/>should be constructed to open up south Limerick and Kerry to the airport.</P>
    <P>The Minister is selling the workers of Aer Lingus, but I plead with him not to do it. We want Aer Lingus and Shannon and want viable airports. The Minister is also trying to sell the airline by the abolition of the bilateral agreement. There is no demand on him to do this from America or Europe, but he wants to do it because he wants to pander to the Dublin lobby as the Government has done over the years.</P>
    <P>We had just one friend in Government, Charlie Haughey, who protected Shannon against privatisation. He would not allow a change to the bilateral agreement. The Government, however, has sold us out and continues to do so. I plead with the Minister to withdraw this foolish proposal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity of speaking on the important issue of the general principles of the disposal of shares in the Aer Lingus group. I am 100% behind the staff and pensioners of Aer Lingus. I gave a commitment to support them on this important issue and today I stand by that commitment. Unlike other Deputies, I will not duck or dodge on this important matter. I commend and pay tribute to all Aer Lingus pensioners. They are part of the team that built up the airline and should be looked after in a fair and decent way.</P>
    <P>According to management and the Minister, the effect of the flotation will be to raise only &euro;400 million out of the &euro;2 billion required for capital investment and development. That being the case, the Government would have to match a relatively small amount of money as an investment, particularly given that it has committed a significantly larger sum of &euro;34.4 billion to road and rail infrastructure under Transport 21. As is well established by virtue of EU competition rules since at least 1984, and subsequently recently further clarified on foot of queries by a number of MEPs, the State is well capable of making such an investment on the market investor principle within EU rules.</P>
    <P>An alternative, which I support, was offered by the ICTU in the State holding company proposal, but it has been effectively brushed aside without discussion by the Department of Finance. Nevertheless, to date, no detail has been offered by the Government as to the size of the retained shareholding &mdash; conversely the amount to be divested &mdash; other than a commitment to retain a minimum of 25.1%.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the sale of our national airline, Aer Lingus. It would be bad for workers, the economy and damaging to the national interest. I urge all Deputies to support the Aer Lingus staff and come out against privatisation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party has already stated its position on the privatisation of Aer <Col N="1264"/>Lingus. We believe the Government should invest in the company as a vital national asset. This would be in the best interests of the airline, the workers and the economy. Aer Lingus has proved that a publicly owned company can be both profitable and innovative. The Government should consider this before selling off an asset so vital to the economic security of the State.</P>
    <P>The regularly repeated view that the European Union would prevent the State from making such investment is incorrect. EU rules only prevent state investment in loss making state enterprises and would not bar us from investing substantially in Aer Lingus. We see no reason the Government could not provide the necessary capital by investing directly in the company.</P>
    <P>There is great uncertainty about how much the sale will raise, perhaps only &euro;400 million. The amount raised will certainly fall far short of the &euro;2 billion capital requirement for fleet renewal outlined by Dermot Mannion. With no investment return to the Exchequer and no clear gain in the form of better management of the company resulting from the flotation, it is difficult to see the advantages of selling Aer Lingus. If the Government pushes ahead with the flotation, as it seems determined to do, it must not fail. A failed flotation, added to the insecurity the Government is bringing to Ireland&rsquo;s position in the world economy, would be a disaster.</P>
    <P>I understand the reason many workers are concerned about their futures and the future of the airline. There is an air of great uncertainty about the flotation. If the Government could not make a success of floating Eircom, around which there was an air of certainty, it cannot creditably claim that it will make a success of this flotation. Several factors exist that create uncertainty and they seem to indicate that a flotation now is a reckless decision.</P>
    <P>In September 2005, Senator Mary O&rsquo;Rourke said: &ldquo;I have a gut feeling it won&rsquo;t go ahead at the end of next year because we&rsquo;ll be within three to four months of a general election&rdquo;. I doubt the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a successful flotation, as do many workers and potential investors. The Government&rsquo;s priority is to cover its own backside.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s attempt to ride two horses at the same time by pushing for the flotation behind the doors of the Cabinet room and publicly criticising those who were planning a similar fate for the airline is disingenuous. While trying to hedge his bets politically, he is undermining the chances of a successful flotation. Following two years of prevarication, the Government&rsquo;s lack of commitment to its policy is creating further uncertainty.</P>
    <P>Major industrial relations issues, including the pensions&rsquo; fund deficit, which affects many people who built up the airline during a period of high taxation &mdash; 60% in many cases, pay and staffing levels and the retention of employees&rsquo; shares have yet to be settled. How are workers expected to support a flotation with these issues still up in <Col N="1265"/>the air? Why should investors feel any confidence before they are settled? It is unreasonable to ask me as a representative of many Aer Lingus workers in north Dublin to support the flotation before these issues are resolved.</P>
    <P>As I said yesterday during the debate on social partnership, energy is the economy. There has already been speculation among stockbrokers and investors that rising oil prices may scupper the flotation. Some have said that if oil prices even approach $80 a barrel, the flotation will be in danger. Oil prices are currently above $72 a barrel.</P>
    <P>The recent difficulties with the Air Berlin flotation demonstrate the power of oil prices. It had to go to the market with a reduced IPO and its value has fallen 12% since its flotation last month. Ryanair is down 13% since the beginning of the year. In the past two months, Lufthansa is down 7.5%, SAS is down 30% and Iberia is down 12%. Aer Lingus has only hedged 51% of its oil exposure until the end of the year. Therefore, it is exposed, as is the country.</P>
    <P>Other factors will influence the success of the flotation. The US Department of Justice&rsquo;s investigation into alleged cartel activity by the airlines, including Aer Lingus, is yet to conclude. There has been a delay in agreeing a new open skies agreement and there is increasing competition coming down the line for Aer Lingus on long haul routes.</P>
    <P>It is not only about the success of the airline that we must be concerned. This is a matter of national economic security. Ireland is an island nation and a globalised nation and transport is critical for our economic security. We have yet to receive a guarantee that the Government can secure the airline&rsquo;s slots in Heathrow. With a minority shareholding the Government will not be able to give such guarantees, but there have been plenty of attempts to obfuscate this fact.</P>
    <P>How will the Government address in its aviation policy the peak in oil production? How does surrendering its ambitions for Aer Lingus contribute to this? A strategic approach to Ireland&rsquo;s medium term transport and economic needs is vital. I have suggested to the Taoiseach that he should establish a Cabinet sub-committee on peak oil to consider the impact of peak oil on the economy, including the aviation sector and aviation dependent industries. I repeat that suggestion now.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to look at the experience of another island nation. New Zealand&rsquo;s national airline was privatised, went bankrupt and was bought back by the state within a decade at twice the price. It is now a successful publicly owned airline.</P>
    <P>The Government does not have a mandate for the sale of Aer Lingus.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should know that all public transport is subsidised. I urge the Government to pay heed to the current conditions and to re-examine the retention of Aer Lingus as a strategic asset. If the Government is to close Aer Lingus, I urge it not to jeopardise its prospect further for its own political purposes and to be honest about the amount of control over Ireland&rsquo;s economic well-being that the Government is surrendering on behalf of the taxpayer. I ask Members to oppose the motion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will oppose it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>This is both an historic and a sad day. I have had telephone calls today from some very upset Aer Lingus workers. It is a disgrace that we were informed of the sell-off by means of a leak to the newspapers. The feelings of the workers were not taken into account, many of whom have given the best part of their lives to trying to make a successful airline of Aer Lingus. They have made many sacrifices over the years. This Government in its wisdom leaked a story to a newspaper. This is how the workers found out about their future. It is a scandal and a disgrace. Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistent in its opposition to the privatisation of our national airline. I express Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s solidarity with those Aer Lingus workers who are justifiably concerned about the future of their jobs.</P>
    <P>The Government has arrogantly pushed ahead with its privatisation ideology. I have not heard any business plan and no real argument about the sale of the national airline. Rumblings of opposition to the sale have been heard. Many Fianna F&aacute;il councillors in Dublin and beyond have supported motions at council level against the sale of our national airline and some members of Fine Gael have also been supportive.</P>
    <P>This issue highlights the unworkable coalition of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, with the Labour Party against privatisation and Fine Gael in favour of it. Many workers are wondering what they will do in coalition.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy need not worry about us. Sinn F&eacute;in should look after itself.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>This privatisation will only work for the benefit of a few. The general travelling public and Aer Lingus workers will undoubtedly lose out. The country and the taxpayers who have invested in the company over the years will also lose out. Aer Lingus is the property of the Irish people and it should remain so. It is a profitable State asset, not a liability. It was valued this week at &euro;1.1 billion. Aer Lingus is not a burden on the State and it can continue to make money for the people. Despite the negative media and Government spin, the future of Aer Lingus should not <Col N="1267"/>be bleak. It has a lower cost base than many of its competitors and made an operating profit last year of more than &euro;70 million. It has continued to open up new routes and increase passenger numbers. It has an exceptional workforce who care dearly about their company and its future.</P>
    <P>As an Irish republican, I believe that companies such as Aer Lingus should remain in public ownership and be administered effectively in the interests of the people. It should be used for the benefit of the people, not sold off to a few investors whose main interest will be profit and who may well ride roughshod over the rights of the workers. Unknown to themselves, taxpayers have already invested &euro;27 million in airlines all over the globe, including British Airways and Ryanair, yet the current Government refuses to invest in Aer Lingus. The decision to sell off Aer Lingus is a political and not an economic decision. No concrete plans exist on how the pensions shortfall of more than &euro;250 million will be resolved. This will affect the current workforce of 3,600 and the 8,000 retired employees.</P>
    <P>This is an island nation and our economy depends on the national airline. How will our goods be delivered to their markets? Irish Shipping was sold off and it is now proposed to sell off the national carrier. Nobody should be fooled. This Government is pushing the privatised agenda to enrich their high flying friends at the expense of the common good. It is a sell-off but it is also a sell-out of workers and Irish taxpayers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment all those who appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport, including the unions, management, workers, retired aviation staff and individuals.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a waste of time. Where is the report?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>They were invited in and we listened carefully to the divergent and opposing views. The debate was constructive, even though there would never be agreement on this matter. People made their contributions and there was a good discussion at the meeting. I refer in particular to the pensioners. All Members will share a common view that irrespective of the Government&rsquo;s proposal, the pensioners who built up the company over many years and decades should be taken care of. This has not been the case because of the unfortunate set-up of their pension scheme.</P>
    <P>The long-term interests of Aer Lingus, the country and the workers, are served by today&rsquo;s historic decision. We have a choice to make. Do we recognise what has been recognised by every other country and airline, that a completely new aviation environment exists? It is an ultra-competitive and difficult environment, an environment where ready access to capital, to aircraft and to quick decision making are more essential than anything else in the aviation industry.</P><Col N="1268"/>
    <P>Some would have us stay in the safety of the past. Aer Lingus management and workers have served the country well for many years. The old model of giant carriers, slow decision making and lack of competitiveness may have worked in the past but to stay there would be to abdicate<?oasys _jy ?>our responsibilities and ignore new aviation practices.</P>
    <P>The aviation business is governed by its cyclical nature and by competitiveness. I refer to Ryanair, which is a home-grown airline. Like may others I have had difficulties and problems with Ryanair. However, the people of this country have voted with their tickets and with their e-mails in ever increasing numbers. They subscribe to an airline that is extremely competitive even though it might cut a few corners here and there which people may not like. It is an airline that makes quick decisions about buying aircraft when the market conditions are right. If Aer Lingus was in a position to make the kind of decisions that it will now be able to make, it could be able to purchase aircraft and save at least &euro;500 milliont.</P>
    <P>The ability to survive in modern aviation is inextricably linked to the access to ready capital and flexible decision making. I would be the first to admit that the words &ldquo;prevarication&rdquo; and &ldquo;delay&rdquo; were used. This is the greatest argument in favour of what the Government is doing. If the Government takes five years to make a relatively simple decision about which people have different views, or if it takes the Government two years to tell Aer Lingus to buy a new fleet, it might not be possible to buy the aircraft or the prices might be inflated. There may be a waiting list to acquire those aircraft. It is the inability to make quick decisions that characterises State ownership. I have much faith not just in the management, but in staff, to recognise the new environment, embrace it and make the necessary decision to bring Aer Lingus forward.</P>
    <P>On the general principles the Minister has set out, I welcome that a strategic share of at least 25.1% is being retained in the airline. We have all listened carefully to the very important arguments made on the Heathrow slots. Deputy Broughan made a passionate case arguing that we are abdicating these slots. Significant protections remain, arising from the 25.1% share and the inability to change the articles of association of the company by way of special resolution.</P>
    <P>Even if it were possible to sell off the slots willy nilly, does anybody believe it makes sense for a commercial airline, which has seen increased commercial movement in recent years, to sell the slots? Would it make sense for Aer Lingus to do so, as the slots are among the most profitable in the company? The opposite would be true also. We should face up to the reality that if those slots were not making money tomorrow morning, even though hundreds of thousands of people are being transported from Dublin to Heathrow on them, the company would part with them quickly. <Col N="1269"/>If the slots caused a loss, the company would not subscribe to them.</P>

    <P>I welcome the plans to expand routes both eastwards and westwards. I compliment everybody involved in doing so. In Dermot Mannion we have a chief executive who recognises the realities of world aviation. He is the person to bring Aer Lingus forward in the new market.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion this afternoon. It is an important motion for any Deputy in the mid-west region. In recent months Shannon Airport and its future have been to the fore in radio interviews and newspaper reports. The issue does not just concern the future sale of Aer Lingus, but military flights etc.</P>
    <P>The focus on the airport is sometimes very wrong. Deputy Peter Power knows that Shannon Airport is the second-largest airport in the country, and it is the key economic driver for business and tourism in the mid-west region. It is a counterbalance to the immense growth in the eastern region.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus, our national carrier, has served Shannon well down through the years. It has been very much a part of the success story of Shannon Airport. This is partly because there is a bilateral agreement in place which protects the transatlantic services going through Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>The airline business has changed dramatically in recent years, and particularly since 9/11 and the Iraq war. Shannon Airport was the main loser when Aer Lingus decided to cut its services in the reaction to 9/11. We lost in the region of 64 flights in Shannon Airport. Since then there has been a continual erosion of services.</P>
    <P>One only has to look at the <i>Cara </i>magazine produced monthly by Aer Lingus. I looked at last month&rsquo;s copy, and the route map in the magazine shows no European route for the airport, and there is only one cross-channel route to England. The rest of the services go to America, but even that service has been cut back in recent years. This year we have only four direct flights a week from Shannon to the US. The rest of the services originate in Dublin and go onwards to Shannon. That cuts back capacity for people coming in through our airport.</P>
    <P>There has been great change in airlines, not alone in Ireland but internationally. Boeing and Airbus are facing troubles, and two of the Airbus chiefs resigned last week over delays in production of the A380, the new flagship of the company. That is causing untold problems for the company. Boeing has also had severe problems in competing with Airbus. It now seems to be coming back on the market with a new airliner, the 787, which is very fuel-efficient.</P>
    <P>I listened to an airline analyst recently who told people that they should travel the world now, as in a few years they will not be able to because of the price of fuel and other charges which will be imposed, including environmental charges. This is the future we are facing in the airline business.</P>
    <P>People wish to travel, and the success of Ryanair in recent years can be considered in this regard, along with Southwest Air in America. They have been the exceptions to the rule with regard to the success of airlines. However, although Ryanair had its highest profits ever this year, the share price is down approximately 15% since the beginning of the year. The share price <Col N="1271"/>has been flat over the past three years. One might question if this is the correct time to have an IPO in the airline.</P>
    <P>Naturally, Aer Lingus is on a sound footing at the moment. It must spend much money if services are to be expanded into the US and if it is to open 20 new routes, as the Minister, Deputy Cullen, has indicated. I do not believe that will happen. When the Minister went to the US last year to negotiate the bilateral agreement, he made a fatal mistake in negotiating the three-for-one rule.</P>
    <P>The effects of this have already been seen in Ireland, not just in Shannon Airport but in Dublin Airport. Four US airlines now serve Ireland. They are Continental, US Air, Delta and American Airlines. I can only speak for Shannon because I represent the constituency, but there were queues out the door last year at the Aer Lingus check-in desk at the airport. Those queues are not there anymore. The other airlines are gobbling up business. As a result of Aer Lingus being so small, in a post open skies scenario the company could be swallowed by the big carriers, such as British Airways and Lufthansa. That will be a problem.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>I wish to comment on the services provided by Aer Lingus at Shannon Airport. The company has not operated any new services from the airport in recent years. At the same time, it has opened many new services from Dublin and Cork. I worry about the future of the workers in Shannon Airport. These are the people who protected the airport through the years and they will be the victims of what will happen in Aer Lingus in the future. I worry about the future of those working in the Airbus A330 hangar at Shannon Airport. With a privatised Aer Lingus these jobs could be at stake and could be transferred elsewhere. In a privatised Aer Lingus, the jobs of workers at check-in desks at Shannon Airport could be at stake because a new owner could decide to sub-contract this work. These are my worries as a public representative in the Shannon area.</P>
    <P>Last week saw the withdrawal of World Airways from Shannon Airport. It will have a devastating effect on the region and in particular on the catering workers in Shannon Airport. Where 3,000 meals a day were being prepared by them, the figure has now been reduced to 800.</P>
    <P>Another example of what happens in Shannon with Aer Lingus occurred last Wednesday. Once a year Aer Lingus operates a charitable flight to America for Northern Ireland children with disabilities, and I have no difficulty with that. However, the company cancelled this flight EI111 and there was no scheduled flight from Shannon on Wednesday. There were three flights from Dublin to New York but we had no direct service. As my colleague, Deputy James Breen, pointed out, Aer Lingus&rsquo;s direct daily flights to the US are strategically important for industry in the <Col N="1272"/>region. One of the three flights from Dublin last Wednesday could have been routed through Shannon, but once again we were the victims of the policy of Aer Lingus and Mr. Mannion to operate a hub out of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Mr. Mannion, in an interview in the monthly <i>Cara</i> magazine celebrating the 70th anniversary of Aer Lingus, stated that he wanted Dublin to become a hub. There was no mention whatsoever of Shannon Airport in that interview. I protested in writing to Mr. Mannion a month ago asking what was Aer Lingus&rsquo;s plan for the future of Shannon Airport but I have not heard a word in reply. I believe Aer Lingus has no plan for the future of Shannon Airport. Its plan is to leave the airport with just a feeder service in winter and to cherry pick the routes in the summer when there is business.</P>
    <P>Shannon must be protected in the interests of balanced regional development. The Government has refused to commission an economic impact study. The report by Sorensen and the former Minister, Mr. Dukes, on the impact of open skies concluded that Shannon would be the biggest loser and Aer Lingus and the Dublin lobby would gain in this.</P>
    <P>We in Shannon have much to fear. The workers fear for their future. That is why I am here today, to try to protect the workers in Shannon whom I represent. They must have job security, which is so important. Their pension rights must be settled.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus does not have a manager at Shannon Airport. The man who manages Shannon Airport is the manager from Cork. Do they call that commitment to Shannon, to the mid-west and to balanced regional development? Whereas four American airlines are servicing Shannon Airport and have faith in the airport&rsquo;s future, at the same time Aer Lingus is eroding services.</P>
    <P>There are other issues I wished to raise, particularly the commitment which the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, received that Aer Lingus would put 400,000 passengers through Shannon each year. I do not believe he got that commitment in writing. Transatlantic business is worth &euro;25 million a year to Shannon. Whatever happens, that must be protected. The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, must look at the Government&rsquo;s policy on balanced regional development.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be relatively brief and try to focus on the issues at hand. Aer Lingus is obviously an issue which gives rise to much passion on all sides. It is a company which, since its foundation 70 years ago, has held a special place in the hearts of all Irish people. I say so, not in the usual clich&eacute;d way but genuinely. Aer Lingus means different things to different people.</P>
    <P>As someone born and reared in north County Dublin like generations of my family before me, <Col N="1273"/>I have strong memories of the development of Dublin Airport on the back of Aer Lingus.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did Deputy Glennon not turn up to the meeting?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>The development of Dublin Airport happened on the back of the company that is Aer Lingus. Over many years the workforce has shown remarkable loyalty and attachment to the company&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike Deputy Glennon and his colleagues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and a commitment far above and beyond the call of duty. That has been manifest in the way in which direct financial sacrifices have been made by staff at various times of difficulty within the company, and particularly in what has now proved to be one of the major issues as we deal with the proposed investment in the company, that is, pensions.</P>
    <P>In a way, today is a sad day but it is also a proud one. What decides whether it is a sad or proud day depends really on where one is coming from in this discussion and on whether one sees the glass as half empty or half full. It is sad that we are debating the probability of Aer Lingus moving out of State ownership at all. State ownership has served Aer Lingus well for a long number of years.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Equally, it is a proud day in that it is one on which a major step will be taken for Aer Lingus to take its place among the airlines of the world with its own financial foundation in place, regardless of state aid. I wonder how the founders of Aer Lingus 70 years ago would look on it. I believe they would look on it as a proud day, from which the airline can go forward with pride, building on the tradition and on the brand recognition generated over the years and building also on the loyalty of the workforce which is in no way diluted since the early days.</P>
    <P>Today is a difficult one for many of the individual issues of the proposed transaction, the considerable detail of which, unfortunately, we are of necessity lacking. It is by no means over the line yet. There are several issues remaining and I believe these will be dealt with. As I stated, the staff have made significant sacrifices over the years and, equally, have shown remarkable commitment in the work ethic. We need not look too far into the past. In recent years, post 9/11, when Aer Lingus, with many other airlines, was looking over the precipice, it was the staff, with good management, strong ideals and a strong ethic, who rescued the airline. In addition, the Cahill plan was implemented approximately ten years ago. On each occasion Aer Lingus was rescued by the commitment of the staff and those who were prepared to make sacrifices. Ten years ago the company had a staff of 7,000 and 3,500 pensioners, while the reverse is the case today.</P><Col N="1274"/>
    <P>The major issue in this transaction is the deficit in the company&rsquo;s pension fund. It has been suggested that the deficit has been introduced as an opportunistic lever to secure the flotation but that is untrue. The first meeting I attended as an Oireachtas Member six years ago concerned the pension deficits faced by Aer Lingus, the Dublin Airport Authority and SR Techniques. The issues are complex but it is fundamental to this transaction that the deficit should be resolved satisfactorily before it proceeds.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no guarantee that will happen.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say there was a guarantee but the issue must be dealt with equitably to the satisfaction of the pensioners and the current employees.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>If not, what will the Deputy do?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>I will proceed with my contribution. Job security is another issue of major concern to employees. The simplest way to guarantee jobs and, hopefully, create jobs on the long haul and transatlantic routes is to procure the necessary funding to enable the company to move forward. The new business generated by long haul routes should result in additional jobs and such expansion will be funded by the flotation.</P>
    <P>The stock required to generate the funds required for the expansion should not be at the levels mentioned earlier. The Government has the power to sell up to 60% of the stock but I hope sufficient funds can be generated from the sale of a lower volume of stock to implement the ambitious business plan of Aer Lingus management. It is important not only that the 25% share is retained, which is fundamental to the entire transaction, but that a sufficient cushion is provided for options in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputies James Breen, Pat Breen and Peter Power made passionate contributions about Shannon Airport. Passion has never been monopolised on the football fields by one province or county. People have a different way of expressing their passion for particular institutions. The people of Clare and the mid-west are passionate about Shannon Airport but the airport&rsquo;s survival is not dependent on the development of Dublin Airport. Since the abolition of the Shannon stopover, Dublin Airport has experienced what it was missing during the years Shannon Airport was protected. Shannon Airport should stand on its own two feet and go for it in the same way as Dublin Airport.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Deenihan.</P>
    <P>Ireland and Aer Lingus have come a long way since 1936 when the Government decided to establish a national airline. The company instilled pride and confidence in a fledgling State which, <Col N="1275"/>as with most new democracies, had to stumble before it walked. For many years, the only visible international symbol of Ireland was the famous shamrock on the company&rsquo;s airplanes as millions of people were transported to and from the State. Most people like to think that Aer Lingus will maintain a connection with the public, irrespective of what happens when the company is partly privatised.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Olivia Mitchell outlined, because it will be difficult for the company to attract investment in future years and for the Government to make the necessary investment, we can only hope that the Minister&rsquo;s proposal pays off. I salute the men and women who kept the company going down through the years. Great pain was experienced during the various redundancy schemes but I hope the Minister will protect the pensions people believe they are entitled to as of right. Can he ensure the pensions will be guaranteed following the flotation?</P>
    <P>Many issues arise. Deputy Olivia Mitchell referred to the validity of the motion and I hope the Minister will clarify the legal position. The Deputy has put in a great deal of effort into researching the procedures and the Minister would do her a great disservice if the procedures he is following were wrong. There has been enough messing over Aer Lingus over the past ten years and it would be nothing short of a disaster if the Minister started out on the wrong road on the first day of the flotation procedure.</P>
    <P>Like other Members, I would like the Minister to guarantee the slots at Heathrow Airport. He cannot do so but they are critically important for the future. The people have a connection with Aer Lingus and they would like the aircraft to be based in Ireland. The flotation could lead to the company setting up a hub on the Continent, with Dublin being used as a remote location. I hope that does not happen. The flotation of Air Berlin a couple of months ago caused many headaches. I can only hope the Minister has his homework done on this issue. It took him and his predecessors a long time to do it and had the long unnecessary five-year delay in taking action on Aer Lingus not happened we would now be in a different position.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to turn Shannon Airport into a helicopter pad. We will not accept that from a regional development point of view. If I had enough time I would spend an hour on that subject. It would not look good and we will not allow the Minister or Aer Lingus to do it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this motion. Aer Lingus is synonymous with this country. It is a well-known brand throughout Europe and other parts of the world. It has been the flag-carrier for Irish tourism for years. It is important to recognise that the high standards of hospitality of Aer Lingus and the friendliness of its air hostesses are the reason <Col N="1276"/>so many people prefer to travel to and from Ireland with it rather than other airlines. It also has a great safety record and the pilots it trains are of a high standard. It must be recognised that Aer Lingus has become respected throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that Aer Lingus was in trouble in recent years, it has turned around. Recently, I read in the newspapers that it will make a profit of approximately &euro;85 million this year. Willie Walsh and those who came after him deserve great credit for that turnaround.</P>
    <P>It is important for the economic future of this country, particularly tourism which is my area of responsibility, that Aer Lingus is strong. Many parts of the country are dependent on tourism, especially the west, and Aer Lingus has a critical role to play. The airline must expand, buy more aircraft and service more cities not only in Europe but also in the United States. I understand 21 cities in the United States seek an Aer Lingus service. I am familiar with San Jos&eacute;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As is the Taoiseach.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>A delegation is here from San Jos&eacute; at present, seeking Aer Lingus flights to that city. It is in the middle of Silicon Valley, which has contributed so much to Ireland. Major IT companies based here want a dedicated service to San Jos&eacute; airport. That is the demand which exists and the company needs money to meet that demand.</P>
    <P>From where will the money come? It will come from either State investment, which we do not have, or private investment. It is important that we make this an attractive package in which people will invest. I hope for as much Irish investment as possible because there must be a sense of ownership here. The concern is that it could be owned by international investment companies and banks. We could lose the connection with the country. The UK is concerned at present because British Airways will no longer be owned by British people. Similar concerns will be raised about Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>I agree with previous speakers that we should have had a White Paper on the flotation of Aer Lingus. The matter should have had more consideration in this House. More discussion should have taken place. It should have been discussed at the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on which I sit. We discussed many issues, but not this. Neither the discussion on this matter nor the preparations are acceptable. Now we have confusion on whether we should agree the principles of the motion rather than the sale of Aer Lingus. That is a critical issue.</P>
    <P>How much time do I have remaining?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>Six seconds.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1277"/>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is indicative that we do not have enough time to discuss the matter. The efforts of the employees of Aer Lingus in bringing about this change must be recognised. Their concerns regarding pensions and so on must be addressed, and I mean that sincerely.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Pat Breen&rsquo;s concerns about Shannon Airport. This has nothing to do with the Minister, but with the future policy of Aer Lingus on Shannon Airport. I hope a new Aer Lingus will see Shannon Airport as a critical catalyst in the development of regional Ireland. We have a major disparity between east and west.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies O&rsquo;Sullivan and Costello.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>We must bring this issue back to basics, as many people have done during this debate. Last Monday morning, I attended a meeting in Cork Airport. Sometimes the regional airports get forgotten in this debate. It was a worthwhile meeting with the south west regional authority. It boiled down to the fact that Aer Rianta did not ask to be broken up. It did not make that request, nor is that what it wanted. It was a political, ideological decision forced upon the company. As part of that decision the then Minister, Deputy Brennan, stated Cork Airport would be left debt-free to allow it the capacity and ability to develop. Development at Cork Airport is badly needed.</P>
    <P>We now have a terminal about to be opened and the debt issue is unclear. The current Minister appears to be claiming that making it debt-free could not possibly be done under the Companies Act. This House legislates and we can do it under the Companies Act. That Act may need to be changed, but the Government has changed enough Acts to allow us to do it again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We would discredit the entire Irish financial sector if we were to change our company law to suit public companies.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>As a member of Fianna F&aacute;il, the Minister knows a lot about discrediting financial institutions. Let us not go there. That is not what I came here to debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It would undermine every company, public and private.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister wants to discuss discrediting people in terms of financial implications we can have that debate another day.</P>
    <P>To allow Cork Airport, which has the highest charges of any airport in the country, to carry this burden would cripple it. It will not be a level playing pitch, as the Minister promised it would. The Government should live up to its promise, but why should I be surprised if this promise is broken? God knows it has broken every other <Col N="1278"/>promise it has made. It should ensure that the southern region, which is vital to the country&rsquo;s economy, has the ability to expand. This issue is not only about a terminal. It is about apron space and runway capacity, which must be provided as well, but it will now have a burden of debt whereby further expansion will be impossible. Passenger charges will increase and therefore passenger numbers will reduce, when every other airport is expanding. That is outrageous.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about Aer Lingus.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Aer Lingus is a key part also. I am surprised the Deputy has mentioned Aer Lingus&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what we are discussing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because he is supposed to be representing the employees but they are being sold a pup.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has not. Somebody had to represent them. The Deputy has not mentioned Aer Lingus.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a company which, if it has to expand, has two ways of doing so. It could borrow or the Government could invest in it. There is nothing stopping the Government investing in it but the only argument that is accepted is that it has to be sold. This is the only time a profitable, well run, slimmed down State sector company has had to be sold, and we all know what will happen. The carpetbaggers will come in and stop it.</P>
    <P>As for the poor pensioners, they are being sold a pup. When they realise that the profits from this venture are going into the general coffers, with none of them being directed towards solving their pension problem, I hope Deputy Glennon will be knocking on doors to explain it to them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is nonsense. What debate is Deputy Lynch listening to?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with my colleagues that this is a sad day for the country. We are selling off a strategic asset, Aer Lingus, for the price of four planes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should go back to primary school and learn to add.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>That money will not be put into buying planes, nor does the Minister intend to fulfil his commitment to the pensioners. We are an island nation yet we are selling our airline. When New Zealand sold its airline it had to buy it back because it could not flourish as a private company. We have the example of Eircom also yet the Government is gung ho on selling off this <Col N="1279"/>asset. It makes no economic sense and it makes no regional sense from the point of view of my area. It is interesting that so few Government representatives have come into the House to speak on the motion and defend their regions. It appears only the Opposition Members, particularly those from the Shannon region, with the exception of Deputy Power, have any interest in the Shannon region. There is no doubt that Aer Lingus in State ownership is a crucial factor for Shannon, as it is for the entire country, but I am concerned for Shannon in particular.</P>
    <P>I agree with both Deputies Breen who spoke earlier that Aer Lingus has not shown much concern for Shannon and does not even have a manager in Shannon. At the same time, the fact it is a national airline means it must have national interests at heart and give some service to Shannon, as it has done in recent years. When it is no longer a national airline, however, it will not have any obligation. We know there is no guarantee the so-called golden share the State is supposed to be retaining will last in perpetuity and, as Deputy Lynch said, the carpetbaggers will have their way. That is what we face with a national airline that we have been so proud of, that turned around its economic position and that is profitable. There is no need to sell it off. The case for not selling it was well made by my colleague, Deputy Shortall, but on the last day of the D&aacute;il session we are providing for it to be sold. That is very sad.</P>
    <P>The strategic and regional interests of Shannon Airport are crucial to our half of the country. This provision to allow a sell off is just one element of what the Government is doing; the open skies deal is another but I do not have time to develop that point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very bad day for Aer Lingus and the country. It is strange that Fianna F&aacute;il could only bring in one backbencher from the northside to speak in the debate. Only one of the 11 backbenchers has turned up. There is a Government slot after we speak going a begging but where are all the Government backbenchers? It is obvious they are not too happy to stand behind what the Minister, Deputy Cullen, is doing.</P>
    <P>This proposal is not out of character when one considers what has been done in the past nine years. The Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government is privatisation mad. The PD tail has been wagging the Fianna F&aacute;il poodle for over nine years. The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, has done an inventory of all lands in the Department of Health and Children with a view to selling them for a private sector tax incentive development. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, sold his offices in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green for &euro;52 million and now he is a wandering Minister getting temporary accommodation down the street. The Minister of State, <Col N="1280"/>Deputy Parlon, in the key Office of Public Works, is busily engaged in selling all the State properties he can lay his hands on and buying property throughout the country at exorbitant prices for his so-called programme of decentralisation. We have the <i>ex officio</i> fourth PD Minister, Deputy Cullen, engaged in the sale of the century but Aer Lingus is very different. This sale is an issue of the utmost national importance and it is disingenuous of the Government to say it will retain 25.1% of the shares to protect key strategic interests.</P>
    <P>When the Irish Sugar Company was privatised some years ago the State retained 30.4% of the shares. However, it had to dispose of all of those shares within two years. If it was not able to protect its own shareholding it had little chance of protecting the strategic interest of the Irish sugar industry, its employees and the sugar beet farmers. The entire industry has gone to the wall.</P>
    <P>There is scarcely any need to rehearse the more recent debacle of Eircom when the citizens of this country were induced into purchasing worthless shares and venture capitalists, or vulture capitalists, took control, fragmented the company and instead of injecting the promised equity, starved it of funds and left the telecommunications industry here in a shambles.</P>
    <P>This is a real scandal of privatisation. This Government is on its last legs. Next year, with a little luck, we will be burying it and a suitable epitaph would be, &ldquo;In a time of plenty it sold all the family silver it could get its greedy hands on&rdquo;.</P>

If we rowed back to 1999 and substituted &ldquo;Eircom&rdquo; for &ldquo;Aer Lingus&rdquo;, that headline would not look out of place. Less than a year after Eircom was floated, the headline read: &ldquo;Eircom stock price dives on share dump&rdquo;. Not only were small investors stung badly, there was a failure to invest in broadband and the State had to shore up the industry, which meant a doubling of the cost. Given the experience with Eircom, I expect the public will be rightly sceptical in this case.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus was set up in 1936 and 70 years later it is strategically more important than it was at its inception, with air traffic at an all-time high. There have been very few events in the past 70 years that the public has been proud of and while this sale impacts on Aer Lingus staff and pensioners, many of them living in north Dublin, the decision has a national impact also.</P>
    <P>The proposal before the House is a disgrace. The fact we are an island nation is critical in terms of its strategic importance. The company is in profit, largely because the workers made it <Col N="1281"/>profitable, and the public has confidence in the services it provides. The staff have every reason to be sceptical also because while it appears a good deal on paper, the experience of workers seconded to TEAM Aer Lingus tells a very different tale. For some workers it has been a 16 year court battle, which is not over. The Supreme Court issued a judgment in King and ors <i>v.</i> Aer Lingus PLC on 22 March this year. The question of damages and back pay was referred back to the High Court by the Supreme Court but Aer Lingus is repudiating the Supreme Court order that those engineers be paid the same as engineers who did not second. Months later, however, that has not occurred. Highly trained engineering staff seconded to TEAM Aer Lingus, who returned to Aer Lingus, have been deployed since 1998 in baggage handling and wash-up duties, and have had their pay withheld. The Supreme Court judgment states:</P>
    <P LI="1">I conclude therefore on this issue that on returning to Aer Lingus in 1998, the claimants were at that point entitled to do so as if Team had never existed, that they were then entitled to be paid the same levels of remuneration as mechanical engineers employed by Aer Lingus who had not been seconded. They were further entitled, in my view, to have their seniority fully recognised and be placed on the appropriate incremental scale as though they had never left Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P FLI="0">That clearly has not happened. What possible commitments can be given by the Government when that has been the practice of the company? I heard Deputy Glennon say that this was one of the matters that needed to be resolved. It also shows the shameful practice of the company in terms of a commitment that was given. The commitment was not just given by the company to the workers. It was made here in the D&aacute;il in a reply to a parliamentary question by the then Minister for Public Enterprise, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke. It is a disgraceful decision and a disgraceful practice in terms of how the workers were treated. While this issue in its own right needs to be resolved, it also sends a very strong message to the pensioners and workers of Aer Lingus, who need to consider the matter very carefully.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>The motion brought forward by the Government regarding the privatisation of Aer Lingus is an absolute insult not only to the general public but also and especially to the Aer Lingus staff who have been invaluable in building up the company. They have been internationally commended for building up the airline as one of the foremost airlines globally and for their major contribution in returning the company to record profitability. Many of the Aer Lingus staff will justifiably view the proposed sale as a betrayal of all their sacrifices and success in rescuing the airline and restoring it to a healthy position, and we <Col N="1282"/>in Sinn F&eacute;in absolutely supported them in their industrial action this morning.</P>
    <P>Privatisation of Aer Lingus will benefit no one, apart from those who have fat wallets anyway. The public will suffer and the workers will suffer. My party has continually opposed the privatisation of Aer Lingus and wholeheartedly supported the opinions of the trade unionists, the workers, the local authorities and even the Fianna F&aacute;il councillors who were willing to voice their concern regarding this ridiculous manoeuvre by the Government. Those Fianna F&aacute;il councillors are in stark contrast to that party&rsquo;s Deputies from the area who have not come out in support of the workers.</P>
    <P>Privatisation in itself threatens job security; it costs only the taxpayer and will inevitably lead to the same &ldquo;race to the bottom&rdquo; scenario we witnessed with Irish Ferries. The Government would have us believe that the objective of privatising Aer Lingus would be to save a floundering company, when in fact the only objective in privatising this semi-State body is to profit a few at the expense of many. Aer Lingus should remain in the hands of Irish people and this valuable asset should not be so wantonly distributed to those who care not for the public Aer Lingus serves or the workers it employs, but only for those who want to make a quick buck. It is an absolute scandal that the Government would even utter such an idea and then try and fool us into believing that it is of great benefit for not only the company, but also the State as a whole. It is not working.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the Government&rsquo;s idea that privatisation will somehow magically raise the amount of money that is required for capital investment and development, which it will not, it remains a mystery to my colleagues and me that if Aer Lingus is good enough for a private investor to invest in, then what is the problem with the State investing?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Aer Lingus pensioners also need to be looked after. They paid through the nose in huge taxation throughout their working lives and now at the time when they most need some financial support the Government is letting them down and it should not be tolerated.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I come here in haste, as we are very engrossed in the Committee of Public Accounts today. The privatisation of Aer Lingus is an act of gross treachery by the Government against the people, the Aer Lingus workers and the communities that depend on the national airline. This privatisation is not driven by the interest of the welfare of the workers or the national airline but by the right wing neo-liberal agenda of the Government representing capitalists&rsquo; interests. The normal fraud is repeated again today with the front page of the <i>Irish Independent</i> giving the impression that ordinary working people can invest in Aer Lingus. The people will not be fooled this time as some of them were with the Telecom &Eacute;ireann privatisation when they were badly burned. The proprietor of Independent News and Media was one of those who handsomely gained from that privatisation, sweating that national asset of the people for huge profits and with very detrimental effects on the investment that was necessary in broadband and in other aspects of that industry. Privatisation is detrimental to workers&rsquo; interests. All we need to do is consider Irish Sugar here which was once a thriving industry and is now completely wiped out in favour of sweated sugar from Brazil. That is the logic of capitalist privatisation. It benefits only the sharks.</P>
    <P>I commend the workers of Aer Lingus, who did not want to discommode passengers this morning, but had no option except to show in a small way the huge power they carry and the extremely important role they play in the transport infrastructure. The workers of Aer Lingus can only rely on their own power. I urge them to carry on and to go forward with more developed industrial action to stop the Government carrying on in this completely undemocratic way. The Government has no mandate for this action. In the last general election campaign neither of the Government parties proposed the privatisation of Aer Lingus if the people returned them to power.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Bruton.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the switch that has taken place, can the Acting Chairman confirm that the Government is so ashamed of this grubby deal that it is not putting up speakers to fill its slots?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan. The position paper presented by the Minister today is a joke. I would have expected an approach that would have made a serious attempt to set out a White Paper addressing the strategic issues, the tests of success of the project from the point of view of the taxpayer, the travel<Col N="1284"/>ling public and international access to the country, and the critical benchmarks we need to achieve to make it a success. However, none of this is contained in the position paper. One year ago Aer Lingus had a superb management team in place and the company had successfully overcome huge difficulties within an opportunity for great development. When we asked the Government how the company could get access to capital for its development we were met with a deafening silence. There was no suggestion of State money or of agreeing to a flotation. Twelve months later, the company has lost the management team, the environment is nothing like as propitious and the Government is pushing ahead. I cannot understand why it has not proposed a well thought out strategy that could be laid before the D&aacute;il that could give us confidence that the Government knew what it was doing on the matter. My confidence in the Government&rsquo;s handling of this matter was dramatically undermined when the Taoiseach accused the former management of trying to steal the company&rsquo;s assets. That sort of thinking suggests the Government is trying to drive on both sides of the road at the same time, the natural result of which will be a crash. I worry that the ordinary stakeholders &mdash; workers, the travelling public and Irish taxpayers &mdash; will be made the patsies because the matter was not properly thought through. I am disappointed we do not have a position paper which could pass muster in terms of addressing and analysing the issues we are debating. We will probably not get another opportunity to debate these issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>As a Deputy for Dublin North, I consider it a disgrace that in the Government&rsquo;s haste to put the final touches to the Aer Lingus Act 2004, it allowed me only two minutes to describe the disgust and anger felt by former Aer Lingus employees and the general public. Since it was founded in 1936, Aer Lingus has made a major contribution to the economic and social development of Ireland. Generations of Aer Lingus workers can be proud of the contributions they made to the economy and the north Dublin region over the past 70 years. However, compliments will not put food on the table or provide a reasonable quality of life to the people who worked for the company. Pensioners have no guarantees with regard to consumer price index increases and, in other semi-State schemes, have fallen behind by 50% in the past ten years and have been fobbed by this Government for the past nine years.</P>
    <P>This morning at Dublin Airport, while expressing opposition on behalf of the Labour Party to the privatisation of the company, I appealed to the trade unions to negotiate with management on outstanding issues. They have to address work related issues because the political decisions have already been made and are being copperfastened here this afternoon. I asked the unions to ensure the interests of pensioners are made part of the package and I am sure that will be the case.</P>
    <P>This Government, and Fianna F&aacute;il in particular, is selling Aer Lingus for as little as &euro;400 million. Willie Walsh and company told us Aer Lingus would require &euro;1 billion. The current CEO, Dermot Mannion, informs us the company will require &euro;2 billion. If another CEO is appointed, that figure may increase to &euro;3 billion. However, the State will give a mere &euro;400 million to the company and the balance will have to be secured from other sources.</P>
    <P>The advocates of privatisation take it as given that only private companies can be efficient and profitable but Aer Lingus is both thanks to the efforts of its staff. We are told privatisation is the only way by which companies can raise capital to fund future investment. These arguments are untrue and they ignore the strategic importance of Aer Lingus and other semi-State companies to the future of the economy.</P>
    <P>Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies should lower their heads in shame as they vote through the sale of our national carrier. A recent meeting was held at Dublin Airport, to which 11 Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies were invited, including Deputies Martin Brady, Woods, Haughey, Callely, Carey, Noel Ahern, Glennon, Wright, Brian Lenihan and Fitzpatrick.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1286"/>
   <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should conclude.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>With the honourable exception of Deputy Glennon, none turned up. The remainder have failed to raise the issue in this House, yet they will vote to sell Aer Lingus. That is an utter disgrace and a dishonour to the people who voted for Fianna F&aacute;il over the years.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their contributions to this debate, in particular those who made constructive comments. I was saddened by the Deputies who offered nothing but political slogans, jargon and cliches to the workers of Aer Lingus. I have seen many instances of companies which could have been saved but for politicians who played populist politics.</P>

	<P>Some of the attitudes expressed in this debate were about &ldquo;me and my seat&rdquo; and had little to do with Aer Lingus and its staff or the development of aviation services. It is extraordinary that the expansion to Dubai, which is the most significant new route opened by Aer Lingus since the foundation of the company&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should not talk about Dubai as if it could replace Heathrow Airport as a hub.</P>

	<P>I did not shout Deputy Shortall down and I expect her to respect me when I speak.</P>

	<P>I ask the Minister to address the Chair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is nonsense to suggest it can replace Heathrow.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The route offers fantastic economic opportunities in terms of tourism and the development of aviation in this country. I did not portray Dubai as an alternative to London, despite Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s best efforts to portray that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister knows he cannot protect the Heathrow slots.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am long enough in politics to remember the Labour Party&rsquo;s slogans in the elections in 1973 and the 1980s.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Look at our record.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1287"/>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are in the 21st century, and I note the contrast between the Labour Party&rsquo;s lack of advancement in political and economic thinking and their European counterparts. The same old tired slogans, scaremongering and nonsense that characterised the party&rsquo;s former electioneering continue to be rolled out.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>We were right about Eircom.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It was all about the party&rsquo;s lust for power and nothing to do with the reality of economics and development in this country. I was described as an ideologue on privatisation but I was the Minister who stood in the gap to prevent the Dublin Airport Authority from being taken over by private interests.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Minister lie to the Committee on Transport about the sale?</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This motion seeks the approval of the House for the general principles of the disposal of a significant portion of the State&rsquo;s shareholding in Aer Lingus.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister clarify whether he intends to amend the motion?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will address that issue presently. The future funding requirements and ownership structure of Aer Lingus have been the subject of extensive analysis and debate over the past number of years. The future of the company is being considered by a dedicated Cabinet sub-committee and has been debated in the House on a number of occasions. My Department and the <Col N="1288"/>Department of Finance have commissioned studies on the matter. Throughout this time, the board, management and staff of Aer Lingus have done a fantastic job in maintaining the airline&rsquo;s competitiveness and expanding its business in an industry which is widely regarded as one of the world&rsquo;s most dynamic. The quick turn around of the company&rsquo;s performance following the events of 11 September 2001 is a testament to the commitment of all involved. Standing still and seeking to preserve the <i>status quo</i> is not an option for Aer Lingus or any other airline.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should stop misrepresenting the issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We could continue to debate the issues indefinitely but that would not be fair to the company or its staff. The company needs certainty if it is to plan effectively for its future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is throwing Aer Lingus to the wolves.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>At least I stand for something and have the courage to make the right decision.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is no longer a member of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>My decision is in the interests of the airline, its staff and the people of this country. My career will not be characterised by the old political slogans and jargon of this debate.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Not more than 12 minutes are allotted for both questions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>In assenting at its meeting on 4 July to the publication of the Dalton report, the Government also approved my proposals for the implementation of the main recommendations made by Mr. Dalton. These address,<i> inter alia</i>, the need for the creation of an independent doping control structure for the regulation of greyhound racing; a comprehensive review of existing legislation governing the operations of Bord na gCon to bring legislation into line with best current practice; changes concerning the tenure of the chairman and members of the board, with each now to be restricted to a maximum of two terms of five years in the case of the chair, and three years for board members; and an increase in the size of the board from seven to nine members.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to progress the drafting of amending legislation as rapidly as possible. I will engage fully with the board of Bord na gCon in carrying out this change agenda and I am certain I will have its full support in this process. I will also request the board to review its corporate governance procedures and to address issues of low staff morale, which were also highlighted in the Dalton report.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations will be of benefit to the greyhound industry, bringing it in line with best current practice for State boards, and will bring about a greater stability in this important sector. I am grateful to Mr. Dalton for conducting his inquir<Col N="1294"/>ies in a sensitive and thoroughly professional manner.</P>
    <P>I express my gratitude, and that of my Government colleagues, to Mr. Taggart for his many years of service to the greyhound industry. As Deputies will be aware, Mr. Taggart has advised me that he will step down as chairman of Bord na gCon with effect from tomorrow. His outstanding achievements in transforming the greyhound industry will long be remembered.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the Minister in acknowledging the contribution Mr. Paschal Taggart made to the greyhound industry since being appointed by the rainbow Government back in the mid-1990s. Whereas I welcome the publication of this report, I find the process that was carried out in publishing it to be unacceptable. First, the letter that was sent by the chief executive officer to the Minister&rsquo;s office back in January was leaked to the press, by whom we do not know. In April, the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report were leaked to Jody Corcoran, a high profile journalist with the <i>Irish Independent</i>, and to <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>. We had the report&rsquo;s conclusions and recommendations back in April.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister was asked in this House why he had not published the report earlier, he said it was because he wanted due process. Was there due process when these leaks were carried out? In most cases they were very selective. As regards the report&rsquo;s recommendations, I produced a Bill two weeks ago which was rejected by the Minister. I was accused of pre-empting this report. Does the Minister accept that the same independent regulatory process is being recommended in the Dalton report? I said it would be because it was included in one of those leaks.</P>
    <P>I have previously raised the absence of female board members in Bord na gCon. Has the Minister ever appointed a woman to that board? There are certainly no women on the board now. This came out very strongly in the report.</P>
    <P>Does Bord na gCon have a rule book and a list of prohibited substances?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to be brief because we will run out of time for the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude but this is very important. Does Bord na gCon have a rule book, like they have in England? Will the Minister classify steroids as being a prohibited substance, as recommended in the report?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I believe that due process was administered. In so far as I was con<Col N="1295"/>cerned, I followed up on my promises to the letter all the way from the time when Mr. Dalton was first appointed to the date when the report was published. I repeat that neither I nor my departmental officials were responsible for any leak, anywhere, at any time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Who was?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is the mysterious individual?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>How in the name of goodness could I possibly know who leaked it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be an inquiry into it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is asking the wrong person.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be an inquiry into it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Deenihan wants to call for an inquiry, that is his business. I am afraid, however, that I must be practical about it. I know very well from past experience that an inquiry would not get us too far. In any event, I followed due process from the moment that Mr. Dalton was appointed right to the day the document was published. There can be no question but that neither I nor my departmental officials were responsible for any leak at any time during that period.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of Deputy Deenihan&rsquo;s Bill, he complains about leaks, which is fair enough. It appears, however, that his Bill has resulted from the leaks because one of the leaks related to the question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I read it all in the newspaper in April.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of a doping control agency. That is what Deputy Deenihan&rsquo;s Bill suggested.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggested the Bill in 1997.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not sufficient and, unfortunately, we could not take that Bill on board. It is my intention, in accordance with the Government decision, to implement the recommendations the Government has agreed. I appointed a woman to the board of Bord na gCon, Ms Helen Nugent from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, and, unfortunately, she subsequently resigned. We will move on to bring in new legislation. The Greyhound Industry Act 1958 is out of date in so far as modern conditions are concerned. The membership of the board will <Col N="1296"/>be increased. We will provide that the chairman may serve for no longer than two terms. We will also make similar provision for ordinary members.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I too wish to be associated with the previous speakers in regard to the work Mr. Taggart did during his 11 years stewardship of Bord na gCon. Does the Minister accept that the Dalton report, even with its limited terms of reference, is a damning indictment of mismanagement, inadequate corporate governance and unsatisfactory controls against doping and poor staff relations in the organisation and has led to Mr. Dalton stating that morale is at a very low level? Does he accept that urgent steps are needed to restore confidence among those involved in the industry, be it the staff of Bord na gCon, the owners or those who patronise it? What steps does the Minister intend to take in providing a new chair and filling vacancies on the board, bearing in mind the gender factor, as raised by Deputy Deenihan?</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>There are five recommendations under the heading of corporate governance, all of which we will seek to implement. In so far as the whole question of doping is concerned, the report makes it clear there should be an independent agency governing this matter. We are taking that recommendation on board. With regard to the issue of morale within Bord na gCon, naturally following all the traumatic events that have occurred since the dismissal of Mr. Tynan, there is a difficulty. However, it is a difficulty we shall resolve. Prior to this difficulty erupting, morale in Bord na gCon was quite good. The board of Bord na gCon, together with the Government, has succeeded in transforming the industry right across the country. Much of this was due to the work of the chairman and the board and could not have been done without substantial Government funding, particularly since 2001, when the horse and greyhound racing fund was set up.</P>

	<P>I wish to ask about certain information to which Mr. Dalton has referred that was not within his remit to comment on but has been passed on to the Minister. It relates to the development of Shelbourne Park. I listened to the debate in the Committee of Public Accounts today on that matter. What mechanism will the Minister put in place to restore confidence in that aspect? Did he receive the PricewaterhouseCoopers report much discussed at the Committee of Public Accounts? We know what has been determined by Mr. Dalton in a limited reference. <Col N="1297"/>Given its huge significance throughout the country, will there be wide-scale investigation of this industry to include all the people and all the tracks involved and the benefits to local communities in those areas as well as nationally?</P>

There is a need for a revamp of the legislation in so far as it affects Bord na gCon and the entire sector. On the question of how we will achieve this, I will follow the recommendations in the report as closely as possible. If there are any further points that occur to Members or others that appear to be a good idea we will examine those suggestions carefully.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matters outside the scope of the investigation which were drawn to Mr. Dalton&rsquo;s attention on the basis that they might merit further examination, these issues have been brought to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General who, I understand, will examine them.</P>

     <Quest>and Tourism the way in which the population criteria was used to arrive at the decisions in view of the recent sports capital grants allocation and the fact that Kildare received the lowest <i>per capita </i>allocation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[27236/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme allocates funding to sporting and to voluntary and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>All applications received under the programme are assessed on an individual basis by my Department in accordance with a detailed set of assessment criteria as specified in the guidelines, terms and conditions that accompany the application form for the programme. Following the assessment process, each application receives a score, which gives its order of priority within its own county.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The assessment process takes into account factors such as the existing level of facilities in an area, the number and quality of the applications received, the amount of funding being sought by each applicant and the strategic positioning of major facilities that may be required as well as the most recent census of population figures. <Col N="1298"/>Every effort is made to achieve a balanced geographical spread of funds throughout the country, while also affording priority to projects in areas of social and economic disadvantage. In relation to the 2006 sports capital programme, a total of 1,338 applications were received nationally, of which 1,211 were for projects classified as local and 127 as non-local, that is, projects which were categorised as national, regional or municipal and multi-sport.</P>
    <P>I recently announced provisional grant allocations under the 2006 programme in relation to the local applications totalling &euro;53.745 million to 719 projects and I will announce the provisional allocations for the non-local projects in the near future, for which five applications were received from Kildare.</P>
    <P>Of 28 applications from County Kildare for local projects this year, 17 were provisionally allocated funding totalling &euro;1.41 million. My Department has written to the remaining 11 applicants enclosing a copy of their assessment and explaining why they were unsuccessful on this occasion, in order to assist with any future applications which they might submit. Ten of these applicants failed to meet basic minimum qualifying conditions as outlined on the application form and the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.</P>
    <P>A salient point, of which the Deputy may not be aware, is the reduction in the number of applications received from Kildare this year compared with previous years. The overall number of applications from Kildare this year was down by 25% on the number of applications made in each of three previous years, 2003, 2004 and 2005. The Deputy will appreciate that the programme can only respond to the applications received from any particular county in any particular year. A reduced number of applications, taken with the quality of those applications and the amount of funding sought, affects the overall level of funding allocated to a county.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, sports capital funding to County Kildare amounts to &euro;59 <i>per capita</i> since 2003 and the national average over that time is &euro;60 <i>per capita.</i> Since 1998 a total of over &euro;23.4 million in sports capital funding has been allocated to County Kildare. This means that the county, with less than 4.2% of the population, has been allocated over 5.2% of the total national funding since 1998.</P>
   
  <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that County Kildare has been treated more than fairly in the administration of the sports capital programme and I believe that the Deputy will agree with me that the funding provided has made a major difference to the range and quality of the sports facilities available throughout the county.</P>
</Speaker><Col N="1299"/>
   <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have looked at our applications for the past four years. Is the Minister saying it is all down to expertise which is particularly good in certain countries? For example, County Kerry has done extraordinarily well over a number of years. If we compare that county with Meath, a county with almost exactly the same population, in 2002 County Kerry got almost four times the amount. The same happened with regard to swimming pools. Kerry got funding for four swimming pools, but there are some counties that got no funding allocation. The same happened also with regard to arts grants. Six counties, including Kildare, got nothing under the access programme since 2002. What is the reason for this? Why do some counties do disproportionately well? Kerry does exceptionally well.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware there is a particular difficulty in developing areas? In places where many houses are built it takes time for the area to function as a community and it is more difficult for such growing communities to make an application for funds as they are not established. Counties like Kildare, Meath and Fingal are disadvantaged in that regard.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I see no rationale for the census of population having a bearing on this. If it does not have a bearing, what is the basis for allocations to a county? Is whoever represents the county the key factor in terms of how well a county does in terms of lottery grants?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year Kerry finished in the middle of the table, but this year it did not. The grants announced to date represent grants for local clubs, not grants to major regional infrastructure projects which are normally in more urbanised centres. When the regional grants are added in, the picture will probably change. While the number of applications from County Kildare was down this year by 25%, the number of applications from Kerry was quite high.</P>
    <P>Department officials do their best in terms of what are limited funds and use certain criteria in coming to an assessment of the scores. The criteria include the extent to which the projects increase active participation and result in improved standards of sport, the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds and an equitable spread over different sports and community groups while prioritising designated disadvantaged areas, the financial viability of the project and the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, schools, the local authority and the national governing bodies in order to prioritise proposed improvements and facilities.</P>
    <P>With regard to the disbursement of grants for various disciplines, in the round they are far more equitable than the Deputy imagines.</P>

     <QRef>[27535/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have advised the House on a number of occasions this year, most recently on 31 May, individual actions and measures relating to tourism promotion or development at regional level are day-to-day functions of the State tourism agencies.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I have previously informed the House of my full support for the proposed changes in regional structures and the establishment of five new regional development boards for tourism. As the Deputy is aware, this initiative emerged from a major study of regional tourism structures undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers at F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s request and supplemented by the work of a small independent group, chaired by Mr. John Travers. The PWC report highlighted the need for a much wider brief for regional tourism, with more emphasis on its strategic rather than administrative role and contributing more directly to national policy. It recommended a greatly increased emphasis on targeted marketing, product development and enterprise support and suggested establishing an integrated linkage between regional tourism strategy and national policy and exploiting avenues to leverage increased resources. I am confident the new regional tourism arrangements, with enhanced functions being put in place at local level, will enable tourism to grow in the regions to a greater extent than at present.</P>
    <P>In the case of four tourism regions, namely, the south-east, south-west, west and midlands-east regions, the resolutions necessary to allow the reorganisation to proceed have been passed. I have also given my consent, on foot of a request from F&aacute;ilte Ireland, to the delegation of increased functions from the authority to the four new development boards for these regions.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the north-west tourism region is that the regional tourism authority has adjourned its extraordinary general meeting until 19 July. I understand F&aacute;ilte Ireland is in contact with that authority.</P>
    <P>My officials met the chief executive of F&aacute;ilte Ireland as recently as last Monday, 3 July. At that meeting F&aacute;ilte Ireland advised that it is still working towards the end of summer target as the date when the change in regional structures will be delivered. This is in line with the target I gave to the House previously.</P>
    <P>The chairperson and chief executive of the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation conveyed the full support of the industry for this initiative when I met them earlier this week.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the event of the north-west regional tourism agency refusing to wind down its company, is any legal process open to F&aacute;ilte <Col N="1301"/>Ireland or the Department to direct it to wind down? If it does not wind down, will the whole process cease or can the other four authorities go ahead? Will the Minister clarify what the position will be if it refuses to wind down at the meeting?</P>
    <P>The Minister&rsquo;s reply indicated that the role of the RTAs has been greatly diminished and they have been stripped of their main role of tourism promotion. He said they will have a strategic role. What exactly does &ldquo;strategic role&rdquo; mean? Nobody has yet explained what they will be doing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Neither the Minister nor F&aacute;ilte Ireland require the consent of any regional tourism authority to enable that authority to be disbanded. Even if the authority votes to stay <i>in situ,</i> the State tourism authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, can go to the High Court to ensure the policy is adhered to. However, as in all matters such as this it is always best to try to find a solution which does not require a stricture or imposition. Therefore, I had a meeting this week with the chairperson of north-west tourism to discuss the particular difficulties it appears to have with the concept.</P>
    <P>I explained to the chairperson that far from this being a diminution of the powers of the regional tourism authorities, it is quite the reverse. I have been concerned in recent times about the growth of tourism numbers in large urban centres relative to what is happening in the regions. I know there are various factors involved, including people taking shorter breaks, a major increase in low price access to the country, people going to urban centres for shorter periods of time and short notice bookings. Nonetheless, there is a disparity which is a cause of concern. Therefore, I have given far greater powers to the regions under this initiative than ever before.</P>
    <P>When I say that their powers will be more strategic, I mean they will be less administrative. For the most part, everybody would agree that regional tourism authorities have been involved in administration. They did that well, but I want to see them involved strategically in tourism, targeted marketing, product development and enterprise support. I want them to have a more active role in terms of attracting people into the regions than they have ever had.</P>
    <P>This method, which follows closely on a report commissioned from PricewaterhouseCoopers will enable us to do that. I am also confident the problems with regard to north-west tourism will be resolved and that by the end of the summer we will have the five new development boards in place.</P>

     <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The Arts Council is a statutory body under my Department&rsquo;s aegis. It is the principal channel through which State support is directed to the arts. It is understood from the council that there are 143 works in the collection in question, which were jointly funded under the Arts Council&rsquo;s joint purchase scheme. These include works by Gerard Dillon, Patrick Collins, Louis le Brocquy and Basil Blackshaw. These were purchased primarily in the 1960s and 1970s, at a cost then to the council of &pound;7,233. The total cost of these works at the time came to &pound;14,466.71.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council is aware of the issues arising from potential sale of these works and is in contact with CIE and the chief executive officer of the Great Southern Hotel Group in this regard.</P>
    <P>In that context, I have asked the following questions of the Arts Council. What part of CIE&rsquo;s collection was passed on to the Great Southern Hotels and where are these now? Which parts of the collection were jointly purchased by the Arts Council and where are they now? Which paintings were or are now owned by CIE and where are they now? Which paintings in which the Arts Council has an interest were not offered to the State and where are they now?</P>
    <P>The Arts Council has given my Department preliminary responses to these questions and I have asked that its efforts to establish the full facts of the matter be redoubled.</P>
    <P>On my instructions, my Department also brought the matter to the attention of the chief executive officer of the Dublin Airport Authority in early June and asked for a full report on the matter. I understand that potential vendors are obliged to notify such intended sales to the State so that first option on such items may be exercised by the State collecting institutions. The Dublin Airport Authority has responded to my Department confirming that it will consult in full with it and the Arts Council before any decisions are taken. The DAA has also confirmed that it will comply fully with all State guidelines. I have also asked the aforementioned questions of the Dublin Airport Authority and await its full response.</P>
  
  <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>These works of art are part of our national heritage and belong, in effect, to the people. They should not be disposed of for short-term pecuniary gain and should be returned to the national collecting institutions and the OPW, who will <Col N="1303"/>retain them in public ownership for continued public viewing and enjoyment. The sale of these works is totally at variance with the original intent of the scheme, that being to provide a platform for Irish artists to display their works. It was never the intention of the scheme that the public bodies involved would seek to commercially exploit these works.</P>
 </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. Will he indicate when he anticipates being in a position to publish the lists referred to? The full list of what was acquired by CIE under the purchase scheme at the end of the 1960s and 1970s is contained in the appendix to the excellent exhibition of CIE&rsquo;s own collection, Art on Wheels.</P>
    <P Just="Left">There is a problem. The reason the full list must be put in the public realm arises from the fact that these paintings are a crucial part of the cultural heritage. In the appendix, a painting by Jack Yeats entitled <i>Something Happened in the Street</i>, is listed as national loan exhibition 1945, returned in 1973 and Arts Council subsidy refunded. Where is that painting now?</P>
    <P Just="Left">My second question relates. Have any of the pictures that were 50% assisted been offered for sale, either in Ireland or outside the jurisdiction? With reference to the second part of his reply, who owns these pictures which are 50% assisted by the Arts Council and the other 50% paid for by a semi-State body, Irish Rail, which in turn disbursed them to the Great Southern Hotel Group? Are they not in the ownership of the State? Why could that ownership not be transferred to public galleries?</P>
    <P>The scheme introduced in 1953 suggested the purpose of the scheme is to have them on display to the Irish public, to introduce Irish artists to the public, and so forth. The purposes of that scheme cannot possibly be met by a sale to private collections.</P>
    <P>I refer to the list of the Great Southern Hotel collection, of which the paintings in the Arts Council assisted purchase scheme may only be part. Where are these paintings? I put it to the Minister that it is in the interest of pointing out to the Dublin Airport Authority that they are not its paintings to sell. For the Dublin Airport Authority to say the OPW would be given first option is saying to the Irish people that they will be given first option on purchasing half of that which they own themselves already.</P>
    <P>The issue of public scrutiny which is involved is that if I and my colleagues had not raised this issue, would we have known where this heritage was? I am dissatisfied with the reply stated publicly that paintings were removed from the Great Southern Hotel for appraisal and storage and were not being prepared for auction. My information is not so, that people were asked to tender for appraisal, storage and preparation for sale.</P><Col N="1304"/>
    <P>This is an urgent matter. It is urgent that the full list is provided. We must be given the full list of those purchased by CIE to go into the CIE hotels. What happened those paintings that were on exhibition in the four hotels that were sold, in Kenmare, Mulrany, Sligo and Bundoran? Was the 50% returned to the Arts Council and will the files in that matter be made available to the public?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter was first brought to my attention by people working in the Parknasilla Great Southern Hotel. Subsequently I read that Deputy Higgins had also raised the matter. Following upon the discussion I had with some staff members in the Parknasilla Great Southern Hotel, I wrote to the chief executive of the Dublin Airport Authority, advising him of the wonderful collection that was in the Parknasilla Great Southern Hotel. I stated to him that some of that art had been removed recently with a view to its possible sale on the market. I pointed out that there was a circular from the Department of Transport some years ago which specified that in the event of art valued at more than &euro;10,000 being put on the market by a State entity, the State through either the OPW or the national collecting institutions, must be given first option on that art.</P>
    <P>I also stated that I understood that receipt of this notification was acknowledged at the time by the commercial State companies, including the then Aer Rianta. I also pointed out that I understood that some of those paintings may be jointly owned by the Arts Council and that the paintings included some by Arthur Armstrong, Norah McGuinness, Daniel O&rsquo;Neill, George Campbell, Gerard Dillon and others. I asked what was the intention of the Dublin Airport Authority in respect of those paintings and whether it was the intention to put those paintings on the market and if so, what plans existed to give the national collecting institutions first option on what I regarded as these heritage works.</P>
    <P>I received a reply from the Dublin Airport Authority, dated 16 June in which it was stated that some paintings had been removed by art specialists de Vere in order to have them properly valued, these being the precise words used. The reply also stated that as a natural matter of course the Dublin Airport Authority would comply fully with all relevant State guidelines and would consult the relevant Ministers and the Arts Council as necessary regarding the future of the<?oasys _jy ?>paintings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins and I have discussed this issue in which we both have a great interest. These works of art are part of our national heritage and belong to the people. They should not be disposed of for short-term pecuniary gain and they should be returned to the national collecting institutions and the OPW which will retain them in public ownership for continued public viewing and enjoyment. The sale of these works is com<Col N="1305"/>pletely at variance with the original intent of the scheme which was to provide a platform at that time for Irish artists to display their works. God knows they had little enough places to display their work or customers to which to sell them.</P>
    <P>It was never the intention of the scheme that the public bodies involved should seek to exploit these works which are part of the heritage of this nation and which in truth and in justice are the property of the Irish nation. I have set in train an inquiry through the Arts Council and through the Dublin Airport Authority to ascertain which of these are jointly owned by the Arts Council and CIE as it then was, which of these have been disposed of and where they are located. These relevant questions have been put into the process which I hope will yield the necessary results. Like Deputy Higgins I am extremely sceptical that the list on the catalogue is exhaustive which is impossible to believe.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that I thank the Minister for his very full reply. I am glad we share the concern about what should happen to these pictures. We should also consider those paintings of regional significance, such as those of Maurice McGonigle, for example, in the west of Ireland, and others that would be appropriate to Dublin. We should consider how best the purposes of the 1953 scheme might be achieved by the paintings being placed for public view. It is of interest that the Heritage Council has offered to be of assistance in this regard and we should use its expertise.</P>
    <P>We should establish the provenance of the paintings involved, especially in light of the other implications which arise. That is another question which I am happy to have the Minister investigate, namely, regarding any paintings which may have been offered for sale within the jurisdiction or outside it. I gave the particularly worrying example of the last painting listed in the appendix, the Jack Yeats work, <i>Something Happening in the Street</i>. A remarkably similar painting was offered for sale in Christie&rsquo;s many years after it is noted here as being returned to the Arts Council in 1973. That was in the 1980s.</P>
    <P>I am very happy with the Minister&rsquo;s reply and I suggest he use the resources of the Heritage Council. I put it to him that it is in all our interests that we bring the matter to as speedy a conclusion as possible. The Minister would agree.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The Arts Council has engaged the visual arts specialist consultant, Oliver Dowling, to establish beyond reasonable doubt the location and provenance of works purchased under the joint purchase scheme with a view to providing conclusive answers to the questions outlined earlier.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council does not have a conclusive list of works from CIE&rsquo;s collection that were passed on to the Great Southern Hotel group. I sincerely hope this will be addressed in the con<Col N="1306"/>text of the current project. The list provided by the Arts Council to the Department is the outcome of research into the CIE collection, which was undertaken by Jane Eckett in 2006 and based on the Arts Council&rsquo;s record of the scheme.</P>
    <P>It represents the complete body of works purchased through the joint purchase scheme by either CIE or the Great Southern Hotel group. They are listed as a single collection and the Arts Council is establishing the distinction between works published by the Great Southern Hotels and those purchased by CIE.</P>
    <P>On its part, the Great Southern Hotel group has transferred a number of works to de Vere-Whyte&rsquo;s for safe keeping. Some 54 works have been transferred in total, of which approximately 30 are from the original CIE collections. Inaccuracy in various painting titles leads to some confusion. For example, de Vere-Whyte&rsquo;s list Anne Yeats&rsquo;s <i>Eggs in a Basket</i> and this might correspond with what is on the Arts Council record as Anne Yeats&rsquo;s <i>Eggs in a Hat</i>. One man&rsquo;s hat is another man&rsquo;s basket.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council, in co-operation with the Great Southern Hotel group, is establishing the provenance and location of the remaining works. The current research will establish if, and to what extent, works were sold on. However, the organisations and agencies that purchased works under the joint purchase scheme were not contractually obliged to offer works for sale to the State.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed nationwide audit of sports facilities is being carried out in stages to help speed up the availability of information. The first phase of the audit will establish a record of national and regional sports facilities and is being carried out within my Department.</P>
    <P>The work being undertaken is a data gathering exercise in conjunction with the main sporting bodies and local authorities to identify the facilities for inclusion in this phase. Having identified in excess of 100 sports facilities of national or regional significance funded under my Department&rsquo;s sports capital programme since 1999, my Department has written to 16 of the main sporting bodies seeking their input before finalising this list of national and regional sports facilities.</P>
    <P>This draft list, which will also include details of third level educational institutions and swimming pools, will be sent to local authorities for their input before it is completed. Following this, a detailed questionnaire seeking the necessary <Col N="1307"/>information on the sports facilities will issue to facility owners and managers, and this will be used to establish a comprehensive database. Work has commenced on the content of this questionnaire, which should be ready for issue by the end of the summer.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the detailed information to be provided in response to the questionnaire will be collated and stored on a database by the end of the year. By ascertaining and mapping what is already in place at a national and regional level, an important part of developing a strategic approach to future facility provision is put in place.</P>
    <P Just="Left">This is also of critical importance in the context of maximising opportunities around the London Olympics in 2012. It is clear that decisions on where to locate their final pre-Olympic training camps are likely to be taken by many of the leading sporting teams over the next two to three years. The president of the Olympic Council of Ireland, Mr. Pat Hickey, has advised me that he has already received inquires from several high profile countries.</P>
    <P>In addition to key national facilities such as the National Aquatic Centre, Morton Stadium and national centres for other sports such as rowing, basketball, hockey and tennis, this first phase of the audit will also include universities. The location of a wide range of sporting facilities, along with living accommodation in a campus style setting, may be an important requirement for visiting teams.</P>
    <P>The enormity of completing the audit of sports facilities, even in this initial phase, should not be underestimated. Given the experience of other countries, it is likely to take a number of years to complete. The benefits will be considerable, and in establishing the level of need that still exists in the sports sector and helping to determine future priorities, it will underpin a strategic approach to facility provision.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>This question arises from promises in the programme for Government, and the audit was to be carried out. When is the expected date for its conclusion and publication? I appreciate that considerable funding has come from the Minister&rsquo;s Department, which has been helpful. For example, a swimming pool in Skerries would not be built, along with many other projects, only for such funding. I also acknowledge co-operation with the Department of Education and Science to ensure that facilities are used to their maximum capacity.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, there is a growing reliance in communities on private funding for facilities. As long as facilities are provided, any funding is good funding. There are a number of projects that slip through the net. Speaking to constituents, the Minister and I know how fairly basic facilities, such as a skateboard park costing approximately &euro;40,000, are not in place. They seem to be plenti<Col N="1308"/>ful in other European countries. In this country it is different. One is being built in Drogheda, but there is none for Dundalk. There is one planned for Swords, but none for Balbriggan.</P>
    <P>There is a selective and insufficient provision of quite basic facilities, which are important in the first instance because of the issue of childhood obesity, but are also important for the basic quality of life we expect for people. Does this fall through the net, given the Minister&rsquo;s comments about the Olympics and other high level sport activity?</P>
    <P>There was a promise when the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy McDaid, was responsible for such matters, that there would be an indoor athletic area in Santry for people who depend on Santry&rsquo;s stadium at the moment. Many of those athletes now have to go abroad. One of our top athletes, who was from Donabate, was tragically killed in a road accident abroad recently. There are many athletes &mdash; although not many of her high standard &mdash; who have to go abroad for training. Appropriate indoor training facilities do not exist in this country.</P>
    <P>Is that a priority? When the audit is done, will there be a priority on the absolute needs, especially based on promises made and which badly need to be fulfilled? Morton Stadium does a fantastic job, but an indoor athletic arena is badly needed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to know when an effective and comprehensive national audit of local facilities will be completed. It is a major undertaking. The Sports Council in Northern Ireland embarked on a similar exercise in recent years, and it has taken between two and three years to identify the facilities. I am pleased with the progress of the sports capital programme since 1998. We have now financed approximately 5,600 projects in every city, town, village and parish in the country. That has improved facilities enormously.</P>
    <P>With regard to other facilities, criteria which I outlined earlier are used by the Department&rsquo;s officials in assessing various applications. This year, more than 700 applications were successful from a total of almost 1,400. That equates to an approximate 50% success rate. Regional grants have not yet been announced but we hope to announce them in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The indoor arena to which Deputy Sargent referred is obviously a concept in which I have a great interest. Phase one of Abbotstown should be completed by the end of 2010 or thereabouts, and I certainly hope the question of an indoor arena can be addressed in the context of the next phase of Abbotstown.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We all agree with and fully understand the reason the amount of funding that has been provided through the national lottery for facilities right around the country. Will the audit check that those facilities are being used to maximum effect or will it merely state there is a facility in Athy, in Killorglin in Kerry or wherever? Will it go further than the basics of noting the facilities or will the questionnaires of which the Minister spoke involve an audit into participation in the context of the facilities? Is it an audit of existing facilities or of the use made of the facilities?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The audit is to ascertain what is available at present, and then to identify any facilities which are lacking in various areas and any existing gaps. This, in turn, will enable the Minister to fill those gaps.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 25 and 40 together.</P>
    <P>In January 2006, the Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company &mdash; LRSDC &mdash; the company charged with delivery of this project, submitted a planning application to Dublin City Council and then provided a detailed response to questions raised by the city council about that application. In the process of preparing the planning application the company engaged in extensive consultations with relevant interests and specialists, including local resident groups. The application lodged endeavoured to address, to the maximum extent possible, the issues identified by expert advisors and the concerns expressed by those groups consulted.</P>
    <P>The issue raised by the Deputy relates to the house at No. 70 Shelbourne Road, which it is proposed to demolish in order to allow for a new access point to the stadium. I understand the company had this house surveyed and was advised that it was not listed and, indeed, is of insufficient heritage value for listing. Further, it was the opinion of the heritage architect expert consulted that the house has no special architectural merit, as it presented only a veneer of authenticity and did not contribute to the streetscape in a positive manner. I understand that in discussions with Dublin City Council there was no indication to the contrary as regards this issue.</P>
    <P>It seems that recently a number of local councillors, through the local area committee, have objected to the demolition of the house and have intimated they will seek advice and attempt to have this house and the terrace in which it stands listed. This is a matter for the councillors concerned and for Dublin City Council and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the initiative.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The deadline for a decision from Dublin City Council on the planning application is also a matter for the council, although a response to the planning application is due by the end of July.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The dispute between the IRFU and the named football club, as I have indicated previously, is a matter between the IRFU and the club in question. It is clear that ultimately the issues must be resolved by the parties directly involved. Discussions between those parties are still ongoing.</P>
    <P>To date, the project has proceeded on schedule and while no one can say what length of time will be required to obtain planning permission, I am hopeful the planning process will not delay that schedule. I believe a solution will be found to the dispute between the IRFU and Wanderers Football Club and, equally, I am hopeful the local residents will not delay the redevelopment of the stadium. I put my views on the record on a number of occasions that if this project does not go ahead at Lansdowne Road, it might ultimately <Col N="1311"/>result in other, and perhaps less attractive, developments on the site.</P>
    <P>With a view to resolving the dispute between the IRFU and Wanderers Football Club, I may have to intervene in the matter. If I can help, I will do that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>On this record of protected structures, according to <i>The Irish Times</i> the executive manager within the council&rsquo;s planning department stated there could be a legal issue raised by the stadium developers if the councillors added the affected properties &mdash; initially, it was stated Nos. 4 to 70 Lansdowne Road were being determined here and now there is probably only one building which may be preserved. If a legal position will be taken by the stadium developers and also an independent opinion will be sought from the Civic Trust and An Taisce, it must be a cause of concern. Can something be done to alleviate the concerns of the councillors involved or is there any part the Minister can play in trying to overcome a problem which could develop into a long legal action if these houses or, in particular, the house at No. 70 Shelbourne Road, is recorded as a protected structure?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I have given Deputy Wall my Department&rsquo;s perspective. However, a group of councillors operating through the local area committee does not agree with this and they have intimated that they will seek to have the house and the terrace on which it stands listed. Of course, their efforts so far have been unsuccessful, as the council heritage architect agreed the house was not of sufficient heritage value to be listed.</P>
    <P>The council legal executive has taken legal advice on the matter and advised the councillors concerned that they should have the backing of a technical architectural statement before continuing. This group has now asked the executive to commission An Taisce and the Civic Trust to carry out another heritage study and I understand that Dublin City Council is due to respond to this matter on or before Monday next.</P>
    <P>It is not for me to comment on all of these matters other than to say that we are just trying to build a world-class stadium at Lansdowne Road. It seems there are people who, for one reason or another, are seeking to prevent that happening. They should carefully consider the alternative again. The alternative is a concrete jungle, which is what will go into Lansdowne Road if the stadium does not go in. Many of the people actively pursuing objections today may well be sorry in the future that they did not listen now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the problem with this particular house hold up the planning process? Will the council be able to grant planning permission <Col N="1312"/>and at the same time not consider the status of this house?</P>
    <P>Can the city council look for further information at the end of the month or has the time for seeking further information expired? Will the decision, whether or not to grant planning permission, at the end of the month be the final one? That is an important factor because that is the timeframe envisaged by the company set up to provide the stadium. If further information is requested and the process is protracted, the entire project would be thrown off schedule.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I must take it that Dublin City Council will listen to its own heritage architect and determine whether this particular issue should interfere with it in deciding whether to grant planning permission, and what conditions might apply. As far as I am concerned we, or at least the development group, replied to the issues which were raised by Dublin City Council. Those replies were comprehensive. I look forward to a decision from Dublin City Council by the end of this month. If planning permission is granted, I assume an appeal will be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but that has been factored into the timeframe. We remain on course for construction to commence in 2007 and it is estimated to take 29 months. I do not have a crystal ball but every deadline has been met thus far.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 19 and 21 together.</P>
    <P>In July 2005, the Government authorised investigative surveys to be carried out at the George&rsquo;s Dock site to inform further decisions on the development of the theatre there. At my request, the Office of Public Works arranged detailed examination of the site, including archaeological, geotechnical and structural surveys. On the basis of the favourable conclusions emerging from these studies the Government in December 2005 approved the redevelopment of the Abbey <Col N="1313"/>Theatre at George&rsquo;s Dock and agreed that my Department, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, the OPW and the National Development Finance Agency, would examine possible procurement models, including PPP options. KPMG was commissioned to carry out a cost effectiveness study of the proposed relocation of the national theatre under various procurement options. The conclusions of the KPMG study are being evaluated by my Department in consultation with the other agencies to which I have referred and I expect to report back to Government on the issues in the very near future. I am not yet in a position to specify commencement and completion dates.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>What procurement model will be adopted? It is decision time regarding the proposed new national theatre because the existing theatre is outdated and the facilities are very poor. The saga surrounding the provision of a new building must reach a conclusion sooner rather than later. We profess and boast about being a modern country and, therefore, a building that represents the progress we have made, as the Minister has often said, is needed. Further delays cannot be tolerated regarding the procurement model that should be used and a decision should be made. A site has been secured and while a number of people have issues with it, it is generally agreed this is the best location, particularly since the Carlton Cinema site and other sites were not available. A timescale should be set down. What procurement model might be used? What are the expected commencement and completion dates? The Minister stated previously the project would cost &euro;180 million. Is that estimate still valid? Was construction inflation factored into the estimate?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>KPMG has been commissioned to carry out a cost effectiveness analysis of the proposed relocation of the national theatre, the key objective of which was to establish the most effective way to achieve the redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre at George&rsquo;s Dock. In February, KPMG provided an outline of its report, which we made available to the NDFA and the OPW. The outline, <i>inter alia</i>, examines a number of procurement solutions, including a DBFM-PPP structure and traditional procurement assessed against the key procurement objectives of cost effectiveness, value for money, time and design requirements and operational control.</P>
    <P>I cannot outline a timeframe but consultations on the issue are continuing with a view to the circulation of a memorandum to the Government seeking approval to bring the project to procurement stage at the earliest date.</P>
    <P>With regard to the capital cost of redeveloping the theatre based on its current accommodation brief, which is 12,500 sq. m., the estimate is between &euro;150 million and &euro;155 million, using a conventional model, exclusive of car parking. It <Col N="1314"/>is proposed to proceed on the basis that the new theatre will not provide car parking facilities, given that adequate car parks exist within the vicinity of George&rsquo;s Dock.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 11, 14, 342 and 343 together.</P>
    <P>As I have often said, maintaining and growing competitiveness is the major challenge facing the tourism industry. The industry operates in a fiercely competitive environment and faces major challenges if it is to remain on the path of sustainable and well dispersed growth. Tourism policy has been reviewed and re-invigorated following the report of the tourism policy review group in autumn 2003. The challenges facing the industry have been well described and the path towards addressing them laid out in the New Horizons report on Irish tourism policy. New Horizons identified the restoration of competitiveness as one of the greatest challenges facing the industry. It set out a practical action plan with more <Col N="1315"/>than 70 recommendations. Good progress on the implementation of these recommendations was reported on in the final report of the tourism action plan implementation group, which was published in March 2006 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation was closely involved with the work of the implementation group.</P>
    <P>I have welcomed the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation&rsquo;s Report on Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive Position in Tourism, which is an intelligent contribution to the debate on the state of Irish tourism, as it reflects many of the issues and challenges that surfaced in the New Horizons report. The ITIC report puts forward a useful agenda for the tourism industry to lift its game and the various players involved need to give it careful attention. The tourism strategy implementation group, which I have recently appointed, will work with the industry and Departments and agencies to address a number of key areas, in particular, competitiveness, productivity and skills, sustainability, regional spread and product development. ITIC is closely involved with this process.</P>
    <P>As for specific recommendations in the ITIC report on a tourism product and business innovation fund and a soft loan scheme, I will await the outcome of the work of F&aacute;ilte Ireland on its new Tourism Product Development Strategy 2007-2013, which is being finalised by the high level group set up by the body and chaired by Mr. Dan Flinter and which will be a valuable input to the work of my Department on the next national development plan. The tourism agencies continue to monitor Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness as a tourism destination. Overall Ireland is not perceived as an expensive destination to get to but that there are issues about the relative cost of some on-the-ground amenities.</P>
    <P>In 2005, Tourism Ireland undertook a pilot project that focused on benchmarking Ireland&rsquo;s availability on-line against our key competitors in the top four markets &mdash; Great Britain, the USA, France and Germany &mdash; regarding cost availability and choice of flights, hotels and car hire. Overall Ireland is very competitive in these sectors in the on-line arena. F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s visitor attitude survey shows that the area of value, price and good all-round value for money remains an important prerequisite for visitors when considering Ireland as their holiday destination, as does the availability of reasonably priced accommodation and competitively priced air and sea fares.</P>
    <P>The reality is that Ireland is not a cheap or low cost destination. The economy operates on a partnership basis and tourism is a services industry, which relies heavily on labour. Economic and social policy operates on the basis of seeking to ensure those in employment are paid fair wages, which impacts on costs. No one wants to turn back the clock in this regard. Nevertheless better management can secure greater productivity and <Col N="1316"/>more efficient uses of resources employed with a knock-on benefit in operating costs. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a range of programmes to help the industry in this area.</P>
    <P Just="Left">At more than &euro;140 million, Exchequer support for tourism is at unprecedented levels this year. The needs of the industry are increasingly reflected in Government policies and analyses across a wide spectrum. In addition to its economic benefits, tourism plays an important role in supporting the peace process where it is the leading area of North-South economic co-operation. Despite all of the shocks and uncertainties in the international marketplace over the past four years and the destructive nay-saying that is all too common in certain media circles, Irish tourism has managed to weather the storm and continues to grow. The official CSO tourism and travel figures for the first four months of 2006 reflect the healthy state of the industry. Visitor numbers increased by almost 13%. This follows on a record visitor number performance in 2005 with almost 7 million overseas visitors. However, despite the record performance, we cannot be complacent.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The industry, not the Government, delivers visitors. The industry has to aim, at all times, to operate at optimum competitiveness and to seek to deliver value for money and a good visitor experience. The Government has given an unprecedented level of commitment and support for the Irish tourism industry. It is working in partnership with the industry to help it meet its current challenges and will continue to do so in the future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>The report mentioned in the question states an estimated &euro;1 billion is required for the lifetime of the development plan. What is the situation regarding such figures compared with the last development plan? In his press release of June 20 the Minister stated he would call on all players identified in the report to give careful consideration to the actions proposed.</P>
    <P>During the past week the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme on RTE has had a regular investigative spot on tourism. The overall picture is that in many instances local authorities fail regarding signposts and tourist facilities. How can we relate the international marketing worth &euro;325 million to what is required at local level? Local authorities have a major role to play. How does that bill compare with what we spent previously? How will the Minister, local authorities and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government try to improve basic tourist facilities such as signposting and the cost of food? According to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, these issues upset tourists.</P>
    <P>We spent &euro;325 million on marketing and &euro;210 million on developing tourist spots and other products. How will those amounts be related and is it feasible? What is the breakdown for local authorities? A proposal was made regarding development and training involving an amount of <Col N="1317"/>&euro;175 million. A need for training was also mentioned during the debate on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated he must wait for F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s proposals. How realistic are these figures in terms of the national development plan? What connection can be made between the Departments of Arts, Sports and Tourism and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities to implement this package which would give us a competitive edge in tourism?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will answer the final question first. The group established to examine the tourism industry and bring forward specific recommendations made more than 70 recommendations in its final report, New Horizons for Irish Tourism An Agenda for Action. This includes the question of interaction with State agencies, including local authorities, with a view to improving the product which also includes signage.</P>
    <P>The implementation group I subsequently established engaged with the authorities, agencies and Departments concerned with a view to progressing the recommendations contained in the original report. I recently appointed a new implementation group which will not be as intensive as the previous group but which, nonetheless, will monitor progress to ensure the recommendations are implemented.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The previous implementation group had a considerable degree of success and I expect the same level of success from this group. Therefore, a group is in place which has the objective of liaising with State agencies, local authorities and Departments to ensure the recommendations contained in New Horizons for Irish Tourism An Agenda for Action are implemented. It is pointless to have such an elaborate report if it is not implemented. It is a waste of time and money. This report is being implemented. It is good value for money and is not a waste of time.</P>
    <P>Regarding how the request for &euro;1 billion in the ITIC report compares with the past, I imagine during the past ten years between the public and private sectors anything up to &euro;4 billion was spent on building up the Irish tourism product. That is a ballpark figure. The figure mentioned by ITIC may not be achieved in the context of what will be provided in the new national development plan. However, we will seek to have an elaborate tourism policy and strategy and funding for it contained in the plan.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It is important for the outcome of the analysis taking place to be input into the plan before we state precisely what we seek. Our plans will be ambitious and we will seek to improve the product considerably. We do so because we face increasing competitiveness from eastern European countries in the immediate future. If we are to continue with the progress we have made, and I am encouraged by the early results for this year which show a 13% increase, we must continue to <Col N="1318"/>improve and provide a quality holiday experience.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister concerned that according to recent figures, the US market seems to have decreased and the trend of bed night losses in the west seems to be continuing? In that context, the ITIC report specifically mentioned business tourism. At present, one does not pay VAT when one attends a business conference in Northern Ireland. However, one does so in the Republic of Ireland. Will the Minister entertain proposals put forward by the industry for a VAT refund for business tourists who come here? It is a lucrative market and we do not fully capitalise on it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the soft loan proposal, a large number of our tourism products have gone stale. They need upgrading and to be made more interesting, and they require the use of modern technology. Many of them were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s when we did not have the same methods of presenting products and holding exhibitions. Those centres need a grant scheme and they may also need a loan scheme. It should seriously be considered. In 2004 the west coast region had 3.2 million or 3.3 million fewer holiday bed nights than in 1999. How will that be addressed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I stated I was very pleased with the Central Statistics Office figures published earlier this month which showed a double digit growth in overall visitor numbers for the first four months of the year, driven by the British market which represented a growth of 12% or 127,000 visitors, which was quite considerable. The number of European visitors increased by more than one fifth, leading to an additional 97,000 visitors during the same four-month period. It is simply not correct to state the North American market was down for the first four months of the year. In fact, the year to date has shown an increase in the number of North American visitors of 1.7%. It was particularly pleasing that in the last month of the four month period examined by the Central Statistics Office, the increase was a whopping 12.6% from North America.</P>
    <P>These figures overall confirm a pick-up of considerable proportions and even long-haul markets were up by over 3% after a slow start to the year. I am not saying these figures are reflected in every region but we are showing continued strong growth for the first four months of the year. That is not reflective of a stale product or one which people reject. It is the opposite. It is reflective of a product chosen by discerning visitors because of its quality. I have never denied the need to improve that. As I said to Deputy Wall, we will seek to do so through the new national develop<Col N="1319"/>ment plan but we should not talk down our product.</P>

    <sTitle>Farm Waste Management.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I call on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to update the costings to 2006 levels in determining the grant level under the new farm waste management scheme. In raising <Col N="1320"/>this matter I am very conscious of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture and the excellent work being done by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan. I compliment her on her attention to her portfolio. That contribution is recognised by farm leaders and others throughout the country. It is obvious that her negotiating skills and interaction with her opposite numbers at the Council of Ministers and in the Commission are bearing fruit in the best interests of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Government brought forward a new farm pollution grant scheme, which was cleared by the European Commission. That was necessary in the context of the need to put in place a nitrates directive and give farmers an opportunity to meet future stringent regulations regarding farmyard pollution. That is an excellent scheme, with a 60% grant available. I raise this matter because the scheme&rsquo;s grants are based on 2004 costings. I call on the Minister and the Government to update those to 2006 levels. Numerous representations have been made to me by individual farmers and the farm organisations outlining the major gap showing between the grant and the tender prices being received by farmers. In some cases the grant is being reduced to 50%, and I am aware that in some cases it was lowered to 40% and 45%.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that contractors and those in the construction industry generally have an enormous amount of work available to them. For that reason they can price different projects at a very high level. That may be reflected in some cases in the estimated tender prices farmers are getting but, irrespective of that, we must update the way the grant is calculated. The calculation at 2004 levels does not reflect the cost to the individual farmer today or the 60% grant this Government has agreed with the European Commission and the farm bodies to put in place these important measures.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I am aware this issue has been discussed in the social partnership talks. I do not know how far it has gone or whether it can be finalised but I want to add to the debate the concerns of farmers in Roscommon-South Leitrim and the farm organisations in that area with whom I have an excellent working relationship. My raising of this matter should not be viewed in any way as a criticism of the scheme or the excellent work being done by the Minister but it is important that farmers are in a position to take up this scheme. I believe they will take it up if we upgrade the costings to 2006 levels. I make that request to the Minister and her Department.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Finneran for raising this important issue and making such a positive contribution. I am pleased to have this opportunity to clarify the current position regarding the updating of the Department&rsquo;s standard costings for the purposes of grant <Col N="1321"/>payments under the new farm waste management scheme. Deputy Finneran has been in constant contact with the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and myself on this important matter.</P>
    <P>The new scheme was launched by the Department last March to assist farmers to meet the additional requirements of the nitrates directive. The amendments to the scheme included, in particular, an increase in the standard grant rate from the previous 40% to 60%, with 70% being available in the four zone C counties, namely, Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim and Monaghan. I am particularly pleased that the new scheme recognises the special issues arising for farmers in the zone C region as far as compliance with the new nitrates directive provisions is concerned. The new scheme also provides for an increase in the maximum eligible investment ceiling from &euro;75,000 to &euro;120,000 and removes any minimum income requirements from farming from the scheme, so that all small farmers can participate. This latter change was particularly welcomed by me.</P>
    <P>As the current European Union rural development round closes at the end of this year, applications under the scheme must be received by the end of 2006. For this reason, the Department of Agriculture and Food has also agreed to accept applications under the new scheme as soon as application has been made to the relevant local authority for any required planning permission. This administrative change will ensure that all farmers wishing to avail of the revised scheme will be in a position to submit applications by the end of year deadline.</P>
    <P>The financial commitment of this Government to the scheme is substantial. A sum of &euro;43 million has been made available for the scheme in this year&rsquo;s Estimates and up to &euro;250 million has been ear-marked for the scheme over its projected three year period of operation as farmers generally have until the end of December 2008 to comply with this particular element of the new nitrates regulations.</P>
    <P Just="Left">There has been huge interest by Irish farmers in the new scheme since its launch. Over 4,600 applications were received from farmers during the second quarter of 2006, that is, a three month period, compared with just over 3,000 under the preceding version of the scheme during the full calendar year of 2005. These figures, as Deputy Finneran mentioned, confirm that farmers have found the new scheme particularly attractive and that the scheme will have a vital role in ensuring that the required infrastructure is in place on Irish farms to ensure compliance with the nitrates directive by the relevant European Union deadlines.</P>
    <P>As far as the standard costings are concerned, my Government colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, indicated, when launching the revised scheme last March, that the costings used to determine the level of grant payments under the scheme were under <Col N="1322"/>review at that time. The revised costings will therefore be introduced by the Department as soon as this review is completed. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has already given a commitment that the revised costings, when introduced, will be applied to all approvals issued under the scheme since 1 January 2006. Accordingly, farmers can be assured that developments in relation to the cost of materials or labour used in the construction of farm buildings will be taken into account when the grants come to be paid to them under the revised scheme. For reasons of confidentiality, the individual costings have never been made available by the Department to farmers or their advisers.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Finneran that I am confident that the Minister will be in a position to announce the introduction of the revised costings in the very near future. I thank Deputy Finneran for giving me the opportunity to clarify the current position on what is a matter of great importance to farming.</P>

    <sTitle>Schools Building Projects.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry"><NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
	<P>At the heart of the matter in Scoil Ruain, Killenaule, is the frustration being experienced by students, by teachers and by parents. It is the frustration of waiting 20 years for a facility to which they are entitled. The school management is looking for a basic sports facility, a sports hall. Despite many promises, nothing has happened. It is the second term of office of the Government parties and the school authorities, parents and students are still waiting. The school moved into a new building approximately 20 years ago, without a sports hall or an assembly area. To date, this oversight has not been corrected.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is important to note that the school is widely known as one where students and school management work in a spirit of co-operation. The management and staff of the school are very proud of their students and are assured that they can take their students on any trip, foreign or otherwise, in the full knowledge that they will not cause trouble or misbehave. In view of the difficulties associated with discipline and behaviour at post primary level this is a testament to the commitment and respect ingrained in the school&rsquo;s culture.</P>
    <P>The tremendous support from the loyal parents who continue to send their children to the school, despite the fact that there are no indoor sports facilities, must be acknowledged. Parents have such faith in the school and the ability of the teachers and management that the school is seeing the second and third generation of students from many families. This demonstrates the level of belief which the parents and local community have in the school in Killenaule.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the school authorities I extend an invitation to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, to visit the school. The <Col N="1323"/>management has expressed the view to me that it would like her to visit during an assembly time. At present, there is an assembly area in the middle of the school that is used for guest speakers, open evenings, parents&rsquo; night, graduation Masses and other events. Many of the classrooms open on to this assembly area. As one can imagine, this becomes a chaotic scene when the bell chimes and classes pour into an already occupied assembly area. The level of disruption, interruption and pandemonium is unimaginable and inexcusable. Daily routine in Scoil Ruain is difficult for everyone, yet staff and students continue with the daily grind in the hope that one day the promises of the Government might be realised.</P>
    <P>Scoil Ruain is in a disadvantaged area. It is acknowledged that if the school were in a city, facilities and resources would be made available. This is a rural school in Tipperary which feels it is invisible and considered to be off the map as far as resources from the Government is concerned. In effect, the sporting and assembly needs of the school have been ditched and ignored by the Government.</P>
    <P>The school caters for approximately 400 students. All sporting activities take place outdoors regardless of the weather. The students of Scoil Ruain are at a complete disadvantage by comparison with students who have easy access to indoor facilities. On several occasions during the year, students need to travel to use the facilities of other schools. They need to borrow or rent these facilities. On wet and rainy days, there is no physical education, no exercise and no fitness programme in the school. How does this unacceptable omission square with the Minister&rsquo;s health and fitness programme to combat obesity and diabetes?</P>
    <P>If the Government is serious about combating these problems, adequate sporting and assembly facilities must be provided for schools such as Scoil Ruain. Considering the immense financial resources available to the Minister and the unspent funds at her disposal, how can she justify the exclusion of this school from the building programme? I urge the Minister in the strongest possible terms to sanction immediately the necessary funding for the sports hall in Scoil Ruain, Killenaule.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, who is unavoidably absent owing to other commitments. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter of the application for capital funding for Scoil Ruain, Killenaule, County Tipperary. I am happy to be able to outline to him where the project stands in the context of the huge amount of capital works being undertaken by the Department of Education and Science under the schools building and modernisation programme.</P><Col N="1324"/>
    <P>Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task, given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth. Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a sincere determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
    <P>The Government has invested in the largest school building programme in the history of the State. Between 1998 and the end of 2004, almost &euro;2 billion was invested in school buildings and in the region of 7,500 large and small projects were completed in schools, including 130 brand new schools and 510 large-scale refurbishments and extensions. Funding for school building and renovation projects has increased fivefold since 1997. In 2006, &euro;491 million will be spent on school building projects, compared with just &euro;92 million in 1997. The 2006 allocation is, in its own right, an increase of more than 9% in real terms on the 2005 allocation.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, at the end of last year the Department of Education and Science outlined its spending plans for primary and post-primary schools for 2006. With &euro;491 million to be spent on school buildings, there will be over 1,300 projects active in schools all over the country. This significant investment will allow the Department to continue to progress its major programme of school building and modernisation which includes improving equipment needed for new technologies and ICT.</P>
    <P>The school in question applied to the Department of Education and Science for capital funding for the development of a PE hall. The Department fully recognises the crucial role of physical exercise within the school environment and it is committed to funding the provision of PE, general purpose and outdoor play areas in schools as part of the schools&rsquo; capital investment programme. As with any application for capital funding, applications for the provision of PE or sports facilities in existing schools must be considered in the context of all other applications on hand for capital investment, such as applications for new schools, refurbishment projects, extensions, new sites, remediation programmes and so on. This is done in the context of available resources and the published criteria for prioritising school building projects.</P>
    <P>I will briefly explain and summarise these criteria which show the self-evident logic of how projects are selected for inclusion in a school building programme. There are four band ratings under the criteria, with band 1 being the highest and band 4 the lowest in terms of priorities. Band 1 consists of projects for new schools and extensions to schools in rapidly developing areas, accommodation for special needs students, projects for schools that are structurally unsound and <Col N="1325"/>rationalisation projects. Band 2 projects range from major extensions to address mainstream accommodation deficits and extensive to moderate refurbishments to existing schools to maintain the integrity of buildings. Band 3 projects deal with the provision of ancillary accommodation and improvement works for other than special education accommodation. Band 4 includes all other project types, for example PE halls, general purpose rooms, etc.</P>
    <P>Not alone are these criteria open and transparent but they were revised in recent times following consultation with the education partners to ensure that they are tuned to meet the many challenges presenting for the school building programme. These include the needs of rapidly developing areas where little or no accommodation exists, the accommodation requirements for the massive expansion in teacher numbers, the need to cater for both diversity and our special needs pupils, not to mention tackling the historical under investment in our existing school building stock.</P>
    <P>The PE hall project for the school in question been assigned a band 4 rating under the prioritisation criteria. Over the past five years, however, enrolments have fallen at the school by 15%. The Department of Education and Science is revisiting the school&rsquo;s application for the purposes of drawing up long-term projected enrolment. While this will not have the effect of changing the band rating for the PE hall project, it will ensure that the project is properly assessed for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme at the appropriate time.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for agreeing to an impromptu meeting with a delegation last week. I want to discuss the remedial works scheme at Mullaghmatt estate in Monaghan town. There are 170 houses on the estate, half of which are in private ownership and the remainder in council ownership. The estate, which is more than 40 years old, is beginning to show its age and needs a face lift. The remedial works scheme will help to regenerate the estate in that regard.</P>
    <P>A pilot scheme being operated in the estate is nothing short of excellent and people are pleased with the work being done by the contractors. However, an estate committee, which is working towards rebuilding the estate, wants to play a part in the planning process but feels it is being left out of the loop. Much would be gained by giving the committee some form of ownership of the project. The council has passed the contract to the National Building Agency but people on the estate also have ideas for the project.</P>
    <P>Funding is available, to a maximum of 50%, for replacing windows and other refurbishments but private owners will have to pay upwards of &euro;3,000. Many people would consider that small <Col N="1326"/>money but it is a significant expense to many people on the estate. Approximately 70% of the owners whose houses need refurbishment will not apply for funding because they cannot afford the repayments. The people who can afford to pay for refurbishments have already done so. Full use should be made of these funds because it would defeat the purpose if only two out of ten houses in a row installed new windows. People do not desire a patchwork arrangement of that nature.</P>
    <P>The committee is concerned that some of the money assigned for refurbishments will be returned unused and is investigating whether soft loans could made available. Some of the people concerned are unemployed and unable to take up this generous offer. The committee has ideas on progressing the project and is seeking a meeting with the NBA.</P>
    <P>The estate is improving and investors are starting to buy houses in it, which sends out the right type of signal. A visit to the estate would be worthwhile in order to see the work already completed in part one of the project. I urge the Minister of State to allow the committee to become part of the decision-making process.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I acknowledge the Deputy&rsquo;s interest in raising this matter, which was also raised with me by the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith. The Mullaghmatt housing estate in Monaghan town has been designated for funding under my Department&rsquo;s remedial works scheme. I am strongly committed to regeneration and remedial works programmes. The first phase of the Mullmaghmatt redevelopment, which is currently under way, involves the refurbishment of 25 rented houses and some works to six tenant purchased houses at an estimated cost of over &euro;2 million.</P>
    <P>The extensive refurbishment of the rented houses includes the provision of new windows and doors, installation of central heating and associated insulation and rewiring. Effectively, these houses will be brought up to modern standards. I understand work is well advanced on the project and this phase will be complete by the end of August.</P>
    <P>It is normal practice in refurbishment schemes of this size that a pilot or an initial phase is undertaken to test the efficacy of the works proposed. A report is then prepared by the local authority for its own assessment and for subsequent submission to my Department for consideration with regard to progression to further phases. Monaghan Town Council will shortly prepare an evaluation report on the first phase of the regeneration of Mullaghmatt in conjunction with the National Building Agency, which is the council&rsquo;s consultant on the project. The evaluation report will cover a number of issues, including whether the works carried out have adequately addressed the problems presented in the estate and identify <Col N="1327"/>the implications for the remaining phases. The cost effectiveness of the refurbishment works undertaken will also be subject to critical evaluation.</P>
    <P>The extent of tenant satisfaction associated with improvements in the management of the estate will be an important feature of how the overall project will advance. The timeline for the implementation of further phases of remedial works to remaining houses in the estate is a matter to be determined by the town council in conjunction with my Department in light of the outcome of the initial phase of implementation.</P>
    <P>I would like to address an issue that has been raised by the Deputy and others in respect of work on tenant purchased private houses in the estate. It is a condition of the remedial works scheme that tenant purchasers of houses in a remedial works project may be included in a project where it is considered by the local authority that the undertaking of external works to these dwellings is necessary to avoid an unacceptable or incongruous result to the refurbishment of the estate as a whole. Eligible work to tenant purchased houses is confined to the exterior elevation of the houses and would typically include the provision of new windows and doors, replacement of facias and soffits and new boundary walls.</P>
    <P>Tenant purchasers are required under the scheme to contribute 50% of the cost of eligible works to their houses. There are no proposals to alter the terms of the scheme with regard to contributions from tenant purchasers. The Deputy will recognise that these are now privately owned houses. It is a matter for the town council at local level to secure the participation of any private householders on the basis that they make a 50% contribution to improvement works to the front of their houses. I hope the Deputy will acknowledge this is a generous contribution to the rejuvenation of privately owned houses.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I support the regeneration of this particular estate. However, an evaluation of the first phase is necessary in order to ensure that the refurbishment work properly addresses the various problems in the estate before proceeding to the next phase of redevelopment. I will ask the National Building Agency and the town council to report to my Department on their experience of the first phase and their proposals for the further redevelopment of the estate. I assure the Deputy that my Department has supported the redevelopment of this estate.</P>

    <sTitle>Social and Affordable Housing.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Late last year I raised the housing issue in my constituency with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern and his brother and colleague, the Taoiseach. I stated that both should hang their <Col N="1328"/>heads in shame at the publication of the Dublin north central area B, Malahide and Howth housing district statistics. While a large number of families are awaiting housing on Dublin&rsquo;s northside, few houses have been provided under the social and affordable housing programme. The Minister of State appeared rather put out by my comments but the fact is that those figures are a shocking indictment of this Government&rsquo;s record on housing. These figures were revealed at a time of record housing production, some 80,000 housing units were completed last year and 77,000 in 2004. More than 20,000 units were built in my constituency.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I represent many constituents who have been on the housing lists for more than ten years with no hope of accommodation in the last year of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government. The housing list figures released to my colleague Councillor Anne Carter at the end of last year showed that almost 3,000 families were on the social and affordable housing lists for the north central area alone, including the Donaghmede, Artane and Clontarf city council wards. This is approximately 5% of housing applicants in Ireland. There are 1,569 families and individuals on the housing list, including 229 families on the priority list. The number of north central households on the housing transfer list was 871. There were an additional 124 families and individuals on the area B homeless list. The number of applicants for the city council area B affordable housing list is now considerably more than 400. The number of city council housing vacancies for area B is derisory by comparison. In 2003 only 157 vacancies became available for letting and there were only 116 vacancies for households on the transfer list. In 2004 and 2005 available vacancies decreased. This year, the Department has provided funding for only 100 older homes for tenants.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It is extraordinary that thousands of families remain on the housing lists of Dublin North-East and other similar regions when nearly 250,000 houses and apartments have been built since mid-2003. The Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, outgoing city manager, John Fitzgerald, and outgoing county manager, John Tierney, who is the incoming city manager, have failed lamentably in a key objective of any reasonably caring Government, namely the provision of a home for every family and citizen.</P>
    <P Just="Left">All housing policy seems to be directed at facilitating developers and investors rather than the urgent needs of thousands of ordinary citizens. Fingal County housing manager, Mr. Alan Carthy, seems to be solving the lack of accommodation for social and affordable housing by simply removing longstanding housing applicants from the list. I have encountered at least six such cases in recent months and have referred a number of them to the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The personal suffering of many individuals and families on the homeless, housing and affordable <Col N="1329"/>lists is evident to public representatives every weekend. The distress of the applicants removed from the list is palpable. Families are distraught as they go from house to house as private rented tenants supported by rent supplements living at the whim of greedy landlords. Mothers, fathers and children trying to exist in hopelessly overcrowded accommodation, often with elderly parents with serious medical conditions, are living anxious lives as the long years on the housing list pass slowly by.</P>
    <P>Individual men and women, often in their 40s and 50s, who have become homeless are desperately trying to survive in bed and breakfast accommodation or hostel accommodation. They may, as evidenced by some cases I met last weekend, be living on the streets. This is the legacy of the Government of the third richest country on the planet and its ineffectual, inefficient housing policies.</P>
    <P>Last month the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, announced additional funding of &euro;100 million for social and affordable housing. Nevertheless, it is clear that the Government will miss its modest social housing targets despite the extra funding. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 35,000 social and affordable homes were to be completed by the end of this year but on current trends the number of completions will fall well short of this target. My colleague Deputy Gilmore has stated that the Government is spending more money but delivering fewer houses. This is because of the Government&rsquo;s failure to deal with skyrocketing house prices over the past decade.</P>
    <P>None of the 10,000 affordable houses to be delivered under the Sustaining Progress agreement has been delivered. Part V of the Planning and Development Act, which came into operation in 2001, should have delivered 30,000 homes by now. Only 2,000 have been delivered due to this Government&rsquo;s collapse in front of its developer friends when it changed the legislation concerning Part V. The target under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for the voluntary housing sector was 4,000 units but so far the sector has only been permitted to provide 1,400 units a year. More than 44,000 families remain on local authority housing lists and perhaps another 100,000 citizens and their families are completely priced out of the affordable and general housing market. I urge dramatic action on housing, starting in my constituency, which is a microcosm of urban Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wish the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister of State a restful and happy holiday, even though we are not on holiday for most of that time. I wish the same to our valiant staff on another late evening.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for his good wishes for the season ahead. Policy issues on the provision of social and affordable housing may be decided at national level but the detailed <Col N="1330"/>implementation of those policies and the delivery of projects is a matter for the individual local authorities. It is the responsibility of local authorities to assess the need for housing in particular locations.</P>
    <P>In supporting local authorities in their strategies for delivery, this Government has been innovative in its approach to developing policies and ambitious in setting national targets. It ensured strong programmes of social and affordable housing through the provision of substantial resources on a multi-annual basis. In 2006, some &euro;2 billion is provided for investment in social and affordable housing across the country, more than double the expenditure in 2000.</P>
    <P>As a result of the investment in recent years and vacancies arising in the social housing stock, the needs of some 100,000 households have been met over the period 1997 to 2005. This includes more than 18,700 households in the Dublin city area and 3,700 households in the Fingal area.</P>
    <P>Continued increases in the supply of housing has improved access to housing for first time buyers, which is a Government priority. In the Fingal area the overall growth in housing supply in 2004 was 280% higher than in 1996. Further increased output in north Dublin will arise from developments now under way following the provision of the north fringe sewer. In addition to private units, significant numbers of social and affordable homes will become available through Part V. The establishment of the affordable homes partnership to co-ordinate and add impetus to the delivery of affordable housing in and around the capital is an example of the Government&rsquo;s innovative arrangements to deliver affordable housing.</P>
    <P>Building on progress achieved from our investment to date, we announced an increased social and affordable housing programme when launching our new housing policy framework, Building Sustainable Communities, last December. In the draft social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, we have committed to further additional investment in social housing with 27,000 new units to be started or acquired over the period 2007 to 2009. Continued growth is expected in affordable housing, particularly in the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>The main strategy for delivery of the Government&rsquo;s social and affordable housing programme is through the five year action plans for social and affordable housing developed by each local authority. The Government made record financial allocations in 2006 to respond to these action plans, with some &euro;150 million made to the two local authorities mentioned for the main local authority social housing programme, traveller accommodation programmes and remedial works excluding major regeneration projects. The action plans are currently at the midway stage and are being reviewed. We must ensure that local authorities are capable of integrated planning and delivery of social and affordable housing. The Government has put in place the policy frame<Col N="1331"/>work and is making available the necessary resources. Local authorities have a key role in ensuring that action plans are implemented by bringing forward quality projects which respond to local need.</P>
    <P>The Government places great emphasis on building sustainable communities. That is the reason it brought forward a policy framework setting down these principles last year. The principles include building good quality housing, having a good tenant mix and investing heavily in good social integration. Fundamentally, it means building homes in communities where people want to live and enjoy living. I urge local councillors to be aware of these issues and of the importance of progressing this agenda in the course of their deliberations in the council chambers.</P>
    <P>There are few strategic areas in the city council area available for housing. It was extraordinary that the council sold land that could have been used for social and affordable housing to private <Col N="1332"/>interests. That council is in the control of the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and a councillor close to the Deputy was to the fore in progressing the sale of that property to a private investor. I remind the Deputy that a councillor who is well known to the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, was opposed to selling that land to a private investor on the basis that the land should be available for social and affordable housing. Unfortunately, as a result of the Labour Party majority on that council, it was sold to private investors.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 13 and 47 together.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council is a statutory body under my Department&rsquo;s aegis, and is the principal channel through which State support is directed to the Arts. The Council is operationally independent of my Department, but it is understood from the Council that there are 143 works in the collection in question, which were jointly funded under the Arts Council&rsquo;s Joint Purchase Scheme. These works include works by Gerard Dillon, Patrick <Col N="1334"/>Collins, Louis le Brocquy and Basil Blackshaw. These were purchased primarily in the 1960&rsquo;s and 1970&rsquo;s, at a cost to the Council of &pound;7,233. The total cost of these works came to &pound;14,466.71.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council is aware of the potential issues arising from the sale of these works and is in touch with the CEO of the Great Southern Hotel Group in this regard. On my instructions, my Department has also written on the matter to the CEO of the Dublin Airport Authority and has asked for a report on the matter. I understand that potential vendors are obliged to notify such intended sales to the OPW so that first option of such items may be exercised by the state collecting institutions. The Dublin Airport Authority has responded to my Department and has confirmed that it will comply fully with State guidelines in this matter. Furthermore, the DAA has confirmed that it will consult fully with my Department on the issue.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 23 together.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for legislation relating to public rights of way does not rest with my Department. Certain legislation bearing on public rights of way, under the Road Act 1993, is under the aegis of the Minister for Transport and, as the House is aware, the issue of public access to the countryside for recreation purposes is being dealt with by a group established by the Minister for Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor my Department nor any Agencies under my aegis were involved in the case referred to by the Deputies and I am reluctant to get involved in commenting on its merits. I understand that the case at issue was about the alleged existence of a public right of way on a particular piece of land and that the High Court held that there was no such public right of way on two grounds:</P><Col N="1336"/>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>there was little or no evidence to support the contention that this route had been a public right of way and, in fact, the strong weight of evidence suggested that very few &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; or hill-walkers ever used the route in question, and</P>
 <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>there is a long established principle in law that, for a public right of way to exist, the start and finish points of that way have to be on publicly accessible land. There are one or two exceptions to this rule in relation to the finishing point. In this case, however, I understand that the Court held that the route in question was, in fact, surrounded by private land and the start and finish points were not ones to which there was public access by right. It, therefore, failed a basic and long-established test for the existence of a public right of way.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0" Just="Left">I have not been advised that the judgment in question represents a departure from long-established and well-understood principles of law or has any particular implications for tourism. I have not, therefore, discussed the matter with my colleague the Minister for Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs although our two Departments continue to keep in contact on developments relating to rural tourism including access to the countryside.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House, I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland will, in the very near future, launch a major new initiative in relation to the development and promotion of walking tourism, details of which will be made available on its websites.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 46 together.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I am, of course, aware of the submission from the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation in relation to the National Development Plan 2007-2013, a copy of which has been provided to my <Col N="1337"/>Department. Indeed, I met the Chairperson and the Chief Executive of ITIC earlier this week to discuss the submission and other issues.</P>
    <P>Work in relation to the preparation of the next National Development Plan is being co-ordinated by a High Level Inter-Departmental Committee chaired by the Department of Finance. My Department is represented on this group which is overseeing the drafting of the Plan and the preparation of material in respect of the various economic areas involved. As part of a broad consultation process, the Department of Finance has invited submissions from the social partners, including ITIC.</P>
    <P>Tourism is an important economic sector which has had a high level of visibility in the current and earlier such Plans. My objective is to ensure that there is appropriate provision in the next NDP to provide for the necessary future investment in marketing, product development and human resource development and training to help deliver our ambitious targets for the Tourism sector.</P>
    <P>A good deal of preparatory work has already been carried out in relation to the Plan, including a detailed submission from Tourism Ireland on marketing while a major report on a Tourism Product Development Strategy is nearing completion by a group under the auspices of F&aacute;ilte Ireland. The precise levels of funding involved for the different areas will be determined by Government later in the year as the NDP process unfolds.</P>

Mr. Dalton submitted these documents to my Department. Following consideration, these documents were referred to the Comptroller and Auditor General who has recently informed my Department that in order to try to establish the factual position in relation to the issues having a significant financial dimension, he has concluded that an examination by his office is warranted. However, he indicated that he would await the publication of the Dalton Report before finalising the scope of his examination.

	<P>In November 2005 the Government gave its assent to the commencement of phase one of the development of the national sports campus at Abbotstown. The estimated cost of the project is &euro;119m with a 4 to 5 year delivery schedule (2006-2010). The refurbishment of the State Laboratory as the new headquarters for FAI Ireland is taking place and planning and preparation for the main development is currently in progress.</P>
    <P>The inter agency study referred to by the Deputy is in progress and I expect that it will be delivered in the Autumn. This study, once agreed and completed will be a blueprint for the planning process under which the development of facilities at Abbotstown will take place.</P>

	<P>The Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which is administered by my Department, provides grant aid to local authorities in respect of the capital costs of a new swimming pool, a replacement pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool. The closing date for receipt of applications under the current round of this Programme, which now involves some 57 projects, was 31 July 2000.</P>
    <P>A further 8 projects were submitted by local authorities after the 31st July, 2000 but were not valid as they were received after the final date for submission and therefore were not processed. These projects were located in Douglas and Mitchelstown in Cork City and County respectively, Kells and Trim in Co. Meath, Roxboro in Limerick City, Portnoo in Co. Donegal and Cloghran in Co. Dublin. One replacement project in Monaghan was accepted into the Programme after the closing date, as an exceptional measure, because it had to close for safety reasons in 2001 notwithstanding the fact that it was the only local authority pool in the county.</P>
    <P>An Expenditure Review of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme which my Department is carrying out is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date and what changes, if any, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery. On completion of this Review, the question of re-opening the programme will be considered.</P>

	<P>I have no plans at this time to carry out any further review of the tax exemption scheme for artists. The scheme will continue to be of great benefit to artists in Ireland. An adjustable cap of &euro;250,000 on annual tax-exempt earnings has been applied, but this will have no impact whatsoever on the vast majority of artists, who earn well below that amount. The feedback available to me indicates that artists in general very much welcome the retention of the scheme, notwithstanding the adjustments to it.</P>

    <P>The Sport Capital Expenditure Review Report was approved by Government in September 2005 and the recommendations in the report across ten headings have been prioritised in my Department&rsquo;s Business Plan for 2006 which is also available on the website.</P>

     <Quest>and Tourism the measures that he intends to put in place to address the growing imbalance in regional distribution of tourism demand which has resulted in west coast regions having 3,298,000 fewer holiday makers, bed nights in 2004 compared with 1999 and attracting 50 per cent of all overseas holiday maker bed nights in 2005 compared to 75 per cent in 1999; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>CSO statistics for overseas tourism for 2005 show a very positive result both in terms of overseas numbers &mdash; up 6% (400,000 additional visitors) to almost 7 million &mdash; and revenue earnings &mdash; up almost 8% to &euro;3.455 billion (excluding carrier receipts and cross border tourism). On both counts, we are ahead of targets for the year. As global competition intensifies and consumer preferences evolve, these results represent a very robust performance by the sector and confirm how dynamic and responsive the Irish tourism sector is. Performance to date in 2006 is very encouraging. The CSO figures for the first four months of the year show over 2 million visits to Ireland in the period &mdash; an increase of almost 13% over 2005 which is well ahead of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s target of 4.9%.</P>
    <P>It is widely acknowledged within the tourism sector that growing the pure holiday component of the overseas tourism business has proven difficult in recent years, both at a regional and a national level. In 2005, the holiday segment of all overseas travel to Ireland grew by 2.7% in revenue terms, significantly lower than the 8% overall revenue earnings growth. This clearly impacts on the holiday business at a regional level. Both Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are working to help the industry to address the issues behind this trend which is very much a global phenomenon. It is also important to emphasise that the so-called &ldquo;VFR&rdquo; &mdash; visiting friends or relatives &mdash; component of the overall tourism business continues to be of immense strategic importance and grew by over 17% in revenue terms in 2005.</P>
    <P>I also wish to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the home market. The home holiday market is an increasingly important component of the tourism business in Ireland particularly in terms of seasonal and regional spread. Eighty-six per cent of holiday trips and 89% of holiday nights by domestic tourists are now spent outside the Dublin area. This offsets, to some extent, the relative strength of Dublin in the overseas visitors market. In 2005, expenditure on domestic tourism was up across all regions &mdash; albeit at different rates. In the West it grew by &euro;20m which is equivalent to a 9.5% increase and offset the decrease in revenue for overseas visitors for the same period.</P><Col N="1344"/>
    <P>The fact that all regions and sectors are not benefiting to the same extent from our tourism success continues to be a matter receiving attention from my Department and the State tourism agencies as we evolve our tourism policy and programmes. I am confident, however, that the new regional tourism arrangements will enable tourism to grow in the regions to a greater extent than at present, and that the various region specific initiatives introduced this year by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland Ltd will further help to address this situation.</P>

    <P>I concur with the view that the maintenance of the Heathrow slots is of strategic importance for the further development of Irish tourism, particularly to long-haul markets, and my Department has communicated this view in the inter-Departmental fora which have examined the issue of the flotation of Aer Lingus.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Currently, over 4% of staff in my Department are persons with disabilities which exceeds the 3% requirement under the Disability Act 2005. However, all staff transferring into the Department with a view to decentralising to Killarney are recruited through the Central Applications Facility (CAF) conducted by the Public Appointments Service. The protocol for <Col N="1345"/>assigning officers from the CAF was agreed centrally and my Department is complying with this protocol which operates largely on a seniority basis.</P>
    <P>It is possible therefore that, in the short-term, the overall number of persons with a disability employed in my Department may fall below 3%. However, the Deputy may rest assured that, in the longer term, my Department will take all necessary steps to increase the percentage to at least comply with the requirement under the Disability Act.</P>

     <Quest>and Tourism his views on whether it is acceptable that hotels in Dublin, Kildare and counties surrounding the K Club in Kildare should increase rack rates by 25 percent during the period of the Ryder Cup; if so, his further views on whether there will be knock-on effect whereby local businesses put up prices accordingly; his views on whether this will damage Ireland&rsquo;s image to visitors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The approval of hotel and guesthouse accommodation is the responsibility of F&aacute;ilte Ireland. In accordance with the Tourist Traffic Acts, which govern this area, approved accommodation providers are obliged to display their registered charges in bedrooms. These charges are also published in relevant accommodation guides. However, the upper and lower limits on accommodation charges are set by the accommodation provider who can also set charges for a number of time periods. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has no role in this regard. If a guest is charged more than the relevant upper limit there is a formal process that is followed and the matter is investigated. In practice this is very rare and the overcharge has to be refunded.</P>
    <P>I am aware that concerns have been expressed about the risk of excessive prices being charged by certain elements of the Irish tourism and hospitality industry in the context of the Ryder Cup taking place in Ireland. The State Tourism Agencies are being particularly vigilant in this area, and in all of their dealings with the industry are taking the opportunity to encourage a commonsense approach to the pricing of our tourism products. That said, given free market forces, it is not surprising to see some increase in prices as was the case at other Ryder Cup venues. I understand, for example, that when the competition was held in the Belfry, room yields in <Col N="1348"/>Birmingham increased by 36.5% in the period around the competition.</P>
    <P>My Department wrote to the Director of Consumer Affairs last November requesting that a special initiative be undertaken around the time of the Ryder Cup to ensure that price lists in restaurants and public houses are displayed prominently. The Director of Consumer Affairs has informed me that appropriate checks will be carried out.</P>
    <P>I believe that Ireland will deliver value for money during the staging of the Ryder Cup. The vast majority of visitors will have purchased packages that have been priced now for quite some time. Nevertheless, I will continue to raise these issues, as appropriate, in my regular contact with the industry, and in the media, in the build up to the Ryder Cup.</P>
    <P>In particular I would urge all tourism service providers to take a long-term perspective on the benefits of the event. The value of word of mouth publicity cannot be overestimated and we want our visitors to return home with glowing reports about their stay here and confirmation that the hospitality and friendliness for which we are renowned really does exist. More importantly, we want them to be able to say that the golf was excellent, that they received value for money and that they will want to come back again.</P>

     <Quest>and Tourism if, prior to the decision to locate the new Abbey Theatre on George&rsquo;s Dock, the acquisition of Eden House was considered as part of a plan to redevelop the Abbey on its present site; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that Eden House is for sale; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The current combined area of the Abbey and Peacock Theatres is 4950 Sq Metres. The Accommodation Brief for the new Abbey Theatre requires approximately 12,220 Sq Metres. It has long been clear that the existing site would not accommodate the requirements of the Abbey and Peacock after redevelopment. Accordingly, at my request, the Office of Public Works (OPW) investigated the suitability and feasibility of expanding the space available at the existing site by acquiring adjacent properties. OPW concluded in this context that the necessary expansion would require the acquisition of Nos 15-25 Eden Quay. This would have included Eden House (Nos 15-17).</P>
    <P>In 2003, OPW commissioned Hamilton Osborne King to examine the feasibility of these acquisitions. This study concluded that acquiring the various interests in these properties would cost well in excess of reasonable market price and would take a considerable time to assemble. At the time of the report, there were approximately twenty-six interests in these properties on Eden Quay. Ten were investors/owner occupiers and the remaining sixteen were tenants. In addition, eight of these properties were listed buildings under the Dublin City Development Plan. This report concluded that the &ldquo;most practical, economic, and timely solution to re-housing the Abbey would be to move the theatre to a pre-assembled site&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Following careful and thorough examination of a number of alternatives, the Government decided that the Abbey should be redeveloped at a site at George&rsquo;s Dock, which was offered free of charge for this purpose by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA).</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The Arts Act 2003 provides that I, as Minister, may in relation to the performance by the Arts Council of its functions, other than <Col N="1351"/>those relating to funding of the arts, give a direction in writing to the Council requiring it to comply with such policies of the Minister or Government as are specified in the direction. I have never in practice used this power.</P>
    <P>In addition, I, as Minister, may by direction in writing require the Arts Council to establish one or more Special Committees to advise it on such matters relating to the arts as are specified in the direction. Such Special Committees shall comprise:</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>A Chairperson appointed from among the members of the Council by the Minister</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Four ordinary members, two appointed by the Minister and two by the Arts Council</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">Only one such Special Committee has been appointed to date, to advise the Arts Council on the support of the Traditional Arts. The Arts Council is statutorily independent under the Arts Act 2003 regarding its funding of the arts.</P>
    <P el="10"><i>The Irish Film Board:</i></P>
    <P>The functions of the Irish Film Board are set out in the Irish Film Board Act of 1980, and the Board is independent in the discharging of those functions.</P>
    <P>The Arts Act 2003 provides that the Minister may give directions to the Arts Council requiring the Council to comply with specified policies of the Minister or of the Government. However, the Minister has not issued any such direction. The 2003 Act also provides that the Arts Council shall be independent with regard to the funding of the arts.</P>
    <P el="10"><i>Cultural Institutions:</i></P>
    <P>In general, the autonomous National Cultural Institutions such as the National Library of Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland operate a policy established by their Statutory Boards. However, my Department&rsquo;s provision of capital funding to the National Cultural Institutions is provided subject to that funding being expended in accordance with my Department&rsquo;s cultural priorities. Staffing in the National Cultural Institutions is of course subject to overall Government policy in relation to staff numbers.</P>
    <P el="10"><i>Irish Sports Council:</i></P>
    <P>The functions of the Irish Sports Council are provided for under the Irish Sports Council Act 1999 and the Minister approves their Strategy Statement every three years.</P>
    <P el="10"><i>Campus and Stadium Ireland Ltd:</i></P>
    <P>Campus and Stadium Ireland Ltd is in receipt of funding from my Department. I have met the Board of CSID on a number of occasions to discuss policy issues and give directives for example <Col N="1352"/>asking the Board to do the development plan for Abbotstown.</P>
    <P>The National Sports Campus Development Authority Bill 2006 which has recently been considered by the Oireachtas sets out the functions of the National Sports Campus Development Authority that will replace CSID. The Bill provides that the Minister may give general policy directions to the Authority.</P>
    <P el="10"><i>F&aacute;ilte Ireland:</i></P>
    <P>The role of F&aacute;ilte Ireland is set out in Section 8 of the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003. The company has full autonomy in undertaking the functions conferred on it by the D&aacute;il.</P>
    <P Just="Left">National Policy on Tourism is set out in &ldquo;New Horizons for Irish Tourism &mdash; An agenda for Action&rdquo; which was presented to Government and published in September 2003. In keeping with the Government&rsquo;s policy on partnership the agenda was drawn up by a group comprising of experts from across the Tourism industry including the chief executives of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland and the Chairperson of F&aacute;ilte Ireland. In drawing up the policy the group met with 17 key representative groups across the industry,</P>
    <P>The Tourism Strategy Implementation Group monitors progress on the implementation of the policy. The Group advises me on the implementation of the recommendations of the New Horizons report and responds to evolving issues as they arise in the course of the development of the tourism industry in a dynamic international context. It works with the tourism industry and other Government Departments and Agencies to address a number of key areas. Both F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland Ltd are represented on the Group.</P>
    <P>Both my officials and I regularly meet with the management of F&aacute;ilte Ireland to review implementation of Tourism Policy and to discuss issues relevant to the Industry and work with each other to ensure Ireland achieves its full tourism potential. My department keeps F&aacute;ilte Ireland fully informed of Government policy and decisions on matters pertaining to Corporate Governance and the general management of State agencies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P el="10"><i>Tourism Ireland:</i></P>
    <P>Tourism Ireland does not administer any grant schemes. As a North-South Body, it receives funding from both Irish and British Exchequer and policy direction is provided jointly through the North-South Ministerial Council. In practice, this means that my Ministerial counterpart in Northern Ireland and I jointly approve Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s 3 year Corporate and Annual Business Plans as well as our respective funding contributions to support delivery of these plans. The Agreed Programme for Government provides very specific policy direction for Tourism <Col N="1353"/>Ireland&rsquo;s activities. In addition, National Development Plan contains a specific Tourism Marketing Measure in the Productive Sector Operational Programme which describes the objectives, targets and activities which can be supported. More recently, the New Horizons Report on Irish Tourism provides a very clear policy backdrop to Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s marketing activities &mdash; containing as it does, very specific recommendations for action in the tourism marketing area.</P>

	<P>Engagement between the Contracting Authority, the Office of Public Works, and the Provisional Preferred Tenderer, Spencer Dock International Conference Centre Ltd, in accordance with the competition process, is continuing. As I previously informed the House, most recently on 31 May last, these negotiations are detailed and complex and, by their nature, time consuming. Nevertheless, I am assured that the Contracting Authority is pressing to have them concluded as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Assuming that these negotiations prove successful, the next step will be the appointment of the Provisional Preferred Tenderer as Preferred Tenderer. During the Preferred Tenderer phase, the Preferred Tenderer will develop and provide the full range of project documents, which will require review and approval by the Contracting <Col N="1354"/>Authority. I look forward to the timely completion of the next stages and hope to be in a position to bring the matter to Government for final decision in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Subject to the successful completion of the remaining stages of the procurement process and assuming no unexpected developments, I would hope that construction of the National Conference Centre would begin next year and that the Centre would be operational during 2009.</P>

	<P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>All applications received under the sports capital programme are assessed on an individual basis by officials in the sports unit of my Department in accordance with a detailed set of assessment criteria as specified in the guidelines, terms and conditions for the programme, which accompany the application form for the programme. Following the assessment process, each application is given its order of priority within its own county.</P>
    <P>The assessment process takes into account factors such as the existing level of facilities in an area, the number and quality of the applications received, the amount of funding being sought by each applicant and the strategic positioning of major facilities that may be required as well as the most recent Census of Population figures. Every effort is made to achieve a balanced geographical spread of funds throughout the country, while also affording priority to projects in areas of social and economic disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The criteria could be summarised as covering the following:</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds and an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups;</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the extent to which projects increase active participation and result in improved standards of sport;</P>
 <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the financial viability of the project;</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, <Col N="1355"/>schools, the Local Authority and the National Governing Bodies</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">in order to prioritise proposed improvements and facilities. Highest priority is afforded to projects in disadvantaged areas aimed at increasing participation. High priority projects include those which are essential or integral to sports participation or performance, e.g. pitch development, floodlighting, changing rooms and showers.</P>
    <P>In relation to the 2006 sports capital programme, a total of 1,338 applications were received nationally, of which 1,211 were for projects classified as local and 127 as non-local, that is, projects which were categorised as national, regional or municipal and multi-sport.</P>
    <P>I recently announced provisional grant allocations under the 2006 Programme in relation to the local applications totalling &euro;53.745 million to 719 projects and I will be announcing the provisional allocations for the non-local projects in the near future.</P>

     <Quest>the position regarding the implementation of the Civil Registration Act 2004, with particular reference to the creation of two non-statutory advisory committees to which a commitment was given to establish when the Act was commenced.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Statutory responsibility for the administration of the Civil Registration Service in Ireland rests with an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir (Registrar-General). I have made inquiries of an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir regarding the matters raised by the Deputy and he advises as follows: The Civil Registration Service has been engaged in a major programme of modernisation in recent years, the main features of which are:</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the capture and storage in electronic format of all historical paper records from 1845 to date;</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the design, development and implementation of a new computerised registration system; </P><Col N="1356"/>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>organisational reform and</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>reform of the legislation governing Civil Registration to underpin the delivery of a modernised service to meet the needs of a modern society and to facilitate the wider eGovernment agenda.</P>
<P el="5" FLI="0">The reform of the legislation has been completed and the Civil Registration Act, 2004 now provides the statutory basis for the administration of the service. The various sections of the Act are being commenced on a phased basis and progress to date includes the commencement in December 2005 of Parts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 of the Act, which relate to the administration of the service and the civil registration of births, stillbirths and deaths.</P>
    <P>Before the outstanding provisions of the Act can be commenced, a substantial body of work needs to be completed. Currently, the requirements for the commencement of the marriage provisions are being addressed. This entails a significant amount of work including drafting and publication of regulations, guidelines and detailed procedures; establishment of a register of solemnisers in consultation with religious bodies; establishment of a register of approved venues for civil marriages; and the further development of the computer system to facilitate the administration of the new marriage provisions introduced in the Act.</P>
    <P>A dedicated research facility has been established in Dublin to cater for the needs of members of the public and genealogists wishing to carry out family research. Plans are currently being made to relocate the research room to a new purpose-built facility in Dublin city-centre and it is intended that this facility will include electronic access to records. This will greatly improve services to genealogists and other members of the public in carrying out family research. It is intended that the relevant organisations will be consulted as part of this process.</P>
    <P>At the moment, it is vital that all available resources are devoted to working towards the commencement of the remaining provisions of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 and that the processes and procedures established by the provisions commenced in December 2005 are allowed to develop fully prior to review.</P>
    <P>With regard to the creation of the two non-statutory advisory committees on civil registration and family research issues, the Deputy may be aware that it has been decided to transfer the functions of the General Register Office from my Department to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Accordingly, the position in relation to the establishment of these committees will be reviewed in the context of that Department&rsquo;s structures and frameworks in relation to customer consultation and consultative panels.</P>
    <P>Feedback on all aspects of the Civil Registration System is received by an tArd-Chl&aacute;rai<Col N="1357"/>theoir both directly, as a result of the Office&rsquo;s constant interaction with the public through it&rsquo;s Public Research Facility, located at Joyce House in Dublin, and with members of the public, their legal representatives and various groups having an interest in the work of the Office, and indirectly through monthly meetings with Superintendent Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages, who are responsible for the direct delivery of registration services to members of the public. Generally speaking, feedback from members of the public, their legal representatives and genealogists in relation to the services provided is positive. Processes and procedures for dealing with the public are kept under review and revised as necessary within the statutory framework.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that the General Register Office is fully committed, in line with the key principles of Quality Customer Service, which are enshrined in my Department&rsquo;s Customer Charter and in line with customer expectations, to the development and provision of an equitable, high quality, customer friendly and increasingly efficient service to those who wish to avail of its services and that staff at its Offices strive at all times to ensure that these principles are adhered to.</P>

	<P>Adoptions in Ireland commenced on 1 January 1953 with the enactment of the Adoption Act 1952. This Act <Col N="1358"/>has been amended six times since 1952-in 1964, 1974, 1976, 1988, 1991 and 1998. Over this period adoption in Ireland has undergone major change. In 1996, Ireland signed the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption. Ratification of the Convention requires legislative amendment and the designation of a Central Authority.</P>
    <P>A consultation process with people affected by adoption and working in that field was undertaken in the second half of 2003 at the request of the Minister for Children. This included consideration of legislative proposals relating to the ratification of the Hague Convention and issues relating to adoption information and post adoption contact. The Bill currently being prepared will provide, inter alia, for the creation of the Adoption Authority (replacing the Adoption Board) as the Central Authority required under the terms of the Convention to oversee the implementation of the Convention in effecting intercountry adoptions. The Bill will also include miscellaneous provisions concerned with domestic adoption arrangements including putting current administrative information and tracing arrangements on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>The Heads of Bill on the Adoption (Hague Convention Adoption Authority and Miscellaneous) Bill are currently being drafted in the Parliamentary Counsel&rsquo;s Office. It is anticipated that a Bill will be published in Autumn 2006.</P>

	<P>The Office of the Minister for Children was established in accordance with the Government decision of 7th December, 2005 to place the interests of children at the heart of Government and to build on the successes already achieved in the context of the National Children&rsquo;s Strategy. The Office is an integral part of the Department of Health and Children. The responsibilities of the new office comprise the following: the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme &mdash; EOCP (transferred from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform); the new National Childcare Investment Programme which was announced in Budget 2006 as part of the new National Childcare Strategy for the next 5 years; the programmes and activities of the former National Children&rsquo;s Office; policy and legislative work on Child Welfare and Protection (Department of Health and Children); Implementing the Children Act (2001).</P>
    <P>The new Youth Justice Service of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Early Years Education Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Science will be co-located at the new office. The purpose in bringing these various responsibilities together is to maximize the co-ordination of policies for children and young persons and to provide a strong focus at the highest level. The Office of the Minister for Children also maintains a general strategic oversight of bodies with responsibility for developing and delivering children&rsquo;s services.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Children, I hold delegated responsibilities in the Departments of Health &amp; Children, Education &amp; Science, and Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform for those areas appropriate to my brief. In addition, I attend meetings of the Government. This gives a strong voice for <Col N="1360"/>the interests of children and young persons at Cabinet level.</P>

	<P>Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% of all cases and affects mainly middle aged or older people. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing due to a number of factors including the aging population and lifestyle factors such as obesity. It is estimated that <Col N="1361"/>there are approximately 140,000 people with diabetes in Ireland. The majority of patients, particularly those with type 2 diabetes, receive their care in the primary care setting. In this setting, there are obvious benefits of convenience, continuity of care and immediate access.</P>
    <P>Diabetes has been acknowledged as a priority issue and the 2006 HSE Service Plan has identified that current policy guidelines will be translated into specific action plans with the initial focus on the development of a national diabetes service framework. The Department of Health and Children is currently implementing a number of strategies, the health promotion aspect of which is of direct benefit to diabetics. These strategies include the Cardiovascular Health Strategy, the Health Promotion Strategy and more recently the Obesity Strategy. The HSE is treating the matter as a priority. It is currently considering the report of the National Diabetes Working Group and is putting in place a structure to implement its recommendations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 61 together.</P><Col N="1362"/>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services were considered in the context of the work of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy. The Government published the Group&rsquo;s Report entitled &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; on 24th January 2006. Extensive consultation with service users, carers and service providers informed &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;. This included formal submissions, questionnaires, public meetings and an in-depth survey of service users. The findings from the consultative process were published in two separate reports: &ldquo;Speaking Your Mind&rdquo; and &ldquo;What We Heard&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Report proposes a holistic view of mental illness and recommends an integrated multidisciplinary approach to addressing the biological, psychological and social factors that contribute to mental health problems. It proposes a person-centred treatment approach which addresses each of these elements through an integrated care plan, reflecting best practice, and evolved and agreed with service users and their carers. Special emphasis is given to the need to involve service users and their families and carers at every level of service provision. The Report also recommends that interventions should be aimed at maximising recovery from mental illness, and build on the resources within service users and within their immediate social networks to allow them to achieve meaningful integration and participation in community life.</P>
    <P>The recommendations in the Report have been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of our mental health services. In this connection, an additional &euro;26.2 million was made available this year to the Health Service Executive for the further development of our mental health services, bringing the total revenue spend to in excess of &euro;800 million in 2006. The Health Service Executive has recently established an Implementation Group to ensure that the recommendations are realised in a timely and coordinated manner. It is chaired by the National Care Group Manager for Mental Health. In addition, I have established an independent monitoring group to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the Report.</P>

     <Quest>the number of home helps employed in County Sligo and north Leitrim for the years 2003 to 2006; the directive she has issued in relation to the privatisation of the Irish home help services: if she or her officials has had negotiations with a service (details supplied) regarding setting up operations here; the priority steps she has taken to provide proper resourcing to the homehelp service; if she will give a firm commitment that it will not be privatised as there are many hardworking home helps in this country who feel they are not being given a fair deal by the Government; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The number of home helps employed in County Sligo and north Leitrim for the years 2003 to 2006 relates to the management of human resources which is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, additional funding of &euro;150m was allocated to Services for Older People/Palliative Care in the 2006 Budget. Of this, an extra &euro;33m was allocated to the Home Help Service, &euro;30m of which is provided for 2006 and will deliver 1.75m home help hours. &euro;55m was also allocated to home care packages (&euro;30m for 2006 and a further &euro;25m for 2007), with an <Col N="1366"/>additional 2,000 packages to be delivered by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Home care, including the home help service, is delivered through the Health Service Executive in partnership with a range of providers including the Health Service Executive itself, voluntary groups and the private sector. This has long since been a policy in relation to home care. There are no plans to privatise the home help service or give priority to private companies over public or other home care providers, and no directive has been issued in this regard. An initial meeting took place between officials from the Department and the company concerned, regarding the provision of home help services, and this company was directed to liaise with the Health Service Executive.</P>
    <P>The most important factor in delivering home care and home help is not who provides the service, but that an appropriate level of service is delivered in as flexible a manner as possible which is highly responsive to the real needs of the individual, and there is no reason why private providers should not work in partnership with the Health Service Executive to this end, as they have been doing in the past and continue to do.</P>

    <P>The four projects referred to by the Deputy have been approved a total of &euro; 4.5 million in capital grant assistance. These approvals are subject to further development of the proposals and external appraisal by a building specialist. All four groups have been in contact with and are receiving support from Limerick County Childcare Committee. I understand that they are working together to reduce the costs of their projects. I have also met with representatives from the Groups and discussed how they might further progress their projects.</P>
    <P>I am advised that two of the projects in question have submitted applications for additional funding and these requests are currently under appraisal. Each application undergoes a thorough assessment by Pobal, formerly known as Area Development Management Ltd., who administers the Programme. Following these assessments, applications are considered by the Programme Appraisal Committee, before a decision is made regarding funding. The Groups will be informed of the outcome of their request for additional funding in due course.</P>

	<P>The Mental Health Act 2001 provides a modern framework within which people who have a mental disorder and require treatment or protection can be cared for and treated. It puts in place mechanisms by which the standards, care and treatment in mental health services can be monitored, inspected and regulated. Sections 1 to 5, 7 and 31 to 55 inclusive were commenced on the 5 April 2002. The commencement of the other sections of the Act was delayed due to protracted negotiations with the consultants&rsquo; representative bodies which concluded earlier this year. My Department, the Mental Health Commission and the Health Service Executive are preparing for the commencement of the remaining sections of the Act which will take place later this year.</P>

Following this assessment, the application will be considered by the Programme Appraisal Committee, before a decision is made regarding funding and the applicant in question will be informed of the outcome in due course.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish to see the Irish Cervical Screening Programme (ICSP) rolled out nationally by 2008, based on an affordable model and in line with international best practice. Significant preparatory work is well under way involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register. An additional &euro;9m is available to the Executive for cancer services development in 2006, including the continuation of preparations for the roll out.</P>
    <P>As part of my response to the Strategy for Cancer Control, I recently announced my intention to establish a National Cancer Screening Board to amalgamate BreastCheck and the ICSP to deliver both programmes nationally. This will maximise the expertise in both programmes, ensure improved efficiency and develop a single governance model for cancer screening. The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money. All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories and treatment services must be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service.</P>
    <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s questions in relation to services in Co. Mayo relate to the management and delivery of health and personal, social services, which are currently the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The aim of my Department is to promote the development of the treatment capacity of orthodontics in a sustainable way over the longer term. Given the potential level of demand for orthodontic services, the provision of those services will continue to be based on prioritisation of cases based on treatment need &mdash; as happens under the existing guidelines. These guidelines were issued <Col N="1376"/>in 1985 and are intended to enable the Health Service Executive, to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them.

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 152 together.</P>
    <P>Let me say at the outset that there is no embargo on the recruitment of staff in the public health service. Nor does my Department set employment quotas at national level for any grade in the public health service. It is a matter for the Health Service Executive, as part of its management of its employment ceiling, to determine the appropriate staffing mix required to deliver its service plan priorities, including speech and language therapy services. I have consistently emphasised the importance of prioritising the filling of front line vacancies in complying with approved employment levels. I have also emphasised the need to achieve an appropriate balance between clinical and non-clinical posts.</P>
    <P>Approved employment levels for the health service have been adjusted since 2002 in line with Government policy on public sector employment and also to take account of specific policy measures aimed at increasing service levels. My Department is currently in discussions with the Department of Finance and the Health Service <Col N="1397"/>Executive to agree revisions to the health service employment ceiling to take account of service developments, including disability services.</P>
    <P>A priority for the HSE in 2006 is to increase service provision in the area of multi-disciplinary supports to meet obligations to children with developmental delay, in the home, in the community and in other appropriate settings. The investment package will facilitate the recruitment of up to 200 extra therapists, particularly speech and language, occupational therapy and physiotherapy. Due to the current limited supply of these grades it is acknowledged that in the short term recruitment from overseas will be required. The HSE has put in place a project plan for this.</P>
    <P>In regard to the recruitment of speech and language therapists generally, the Deputies will be pleased to note that the Health Service Personnel Census shows a total of 596 wholetime equivalent (WTE) staff at end March, 2006. This represents an increase of 315 WTE staff or 112% since end December, 1997. The number of training places in speech and language therapy has increased by 300% since 2001.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95, 140 and 169 together.</P>
    <P>A breast screening programme is a complex multidisciplinary undertaking that requires considerable expertise and management involving population registers, call/recall systems, mammography, pathology and appropriate treatment and follow up. A programme must be quality assured and acceptable to women who attend for screening. The first phase of the programme is of a high quality and a similar quality in the West and South is essential.</P>
    <P>I have met with representatives of BreastCheck and they are fully aware of my wish to have a quality assured programme rolled out to the <Col N="1400"/>remaining regions in the country as quickly as possible. For this to happen, essential elements of the roll out must be in place including adequate staffing, effective training and quality assurance programmes. I have made additional revenue funding of &euro;2.3m available to BreastCheck to meet the additional costs of roll out. I have also approved an additional 69 posts. BreastCheck recently interviewed for Clinical Directors for the Southern and Western regions and appointments have been made; both will take up their positions later this year. Both are currently undergoing additional training in relation to their roles as Clinical Director. BreastCheck will begin recruiting Consultant Radiologists, Consultant Surgeons and Consultant Histopathologists for both centres this week.</P>
    <P>BreastCheck also requires considerable capital investment in the construction of two new clinical units and in the provision of five additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment. I have made available an additional &euro;21m capital funding to BreastCheck for this purpose. BreastCheck is in the process of short-listing applicants to construct its two new clinical units at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital, Cork and University College Hospital Galway. BreastCheck is confident that the target date of next year for the commencement of roll out to the Southern and Western regions will be met.</P>
    <P>Any proposal received by BreastCheck to support the roll out of its screening programme will be carefully examined to assess the extent to which it complies with existing standards. BreastCheck recently conducted an evaluation of a proposal from a private screening service and concluded that the clinic in question would not be in a position to provide a screening programme in line with BreastCheck standards.</P>

	<P>The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for the following health and social care professionals &mdash; clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Act provides for the inclusion, by Regulation, of additional professions in the proposed system of statutory registration. This section also sets out the criteria the Minister shall have regard to in considering the designation of further professions under the Act. It would be a matter for the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, in the first instance, to advise the Minister on whether a profession should be regarded as a health and social care profession and be considered for regulation under the Act. I favour the programmed and orderly inclusion of additional health and social care professionals in this new statutory framework and I will consider the case in relation to chiropractors in that light.</P>

	<P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to a recommendation contained in a report by consultants who were engaged by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to undertake a review of acute hospital services in the former North Eastern Health Board area. The review, which commenced in March 2006, has recently been <Col N="1404"/>completed and the report has been considered by the Board of the HSE. It concludes that the present system, where five local hospitals deliver acute care to relatively small populations, is exposing patients to increased risks, that it is not serving the community well and is not sustainable. The consultants believe that there is an unprecedented opportunity over the next 10 years to develop a very high quality responsive emergency and planned care service, in line with international standards, by developing local services within existing hospitals and other local centres supported by a new Regional Hospital. The HSE is to establish a North East Steering Group to quickly address the issues that require immediate attention and at the same time develop a longer term strategy to deliver a world class health service during the next 10 years. The Group will have representation from key stakeholders such as clinicians and primary care providers. There will also be a widespread public engagement on the issues highlighted in the report.</P>

The Executive has pointed out that as the switchboard at Rathdown Road covers an extensive range of services and due to the volume of calls coming into it, there would be an occasional backlog of calls from time to time. The switchboard is manned from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each workday including lunchtime and arrangements are in place for unanswered calls to be routed back to the switchboard for further assistance.</P>

	<P>The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 was signed by the President on 23 June 2006. This Act provides a clear legal framework for a scheme to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term care.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) have announced the appointment of a preferred service provider, a consortium comprising of KPMG accountancy group and McCann Fitzgerald solicitors, to administer this repayment <Col N="1410"/>scheme. The consortium has already commenced its preparatory work and intends to launch the scheme publicly in mid-July. The HSE has indicated that the consortium will, within four weeks of appointment, begin to issue application forms and begin notifying approximately 7,600 living patients of the amount of repayment due to them. The HSE has indicated that the details of these repayments have been prepared in advance of the appointment of the company. On submission of an application and receipt of notification of the calculated amount of repayment due, the applicant will have a period of 28 days in which to appeal or reject the calculated amount of repayment due prior to the issuing of money by the HSE.</P>
    <P>Repayments will be made as soon as possible, with priority given to living persons, and provision has been made for repayments to continue up to 2008 . It is anticipated that all repayments will have been completed within this period, however if required the cut off date for receipt of applications can be extended.</P>

	<P>A new Hospital Consultants&rsquo; Contract is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme. It is management&rsquo;s intention that the new contract will be underpinned by the principle of equity. In this context, a position paper outlining proposals on a new employment contract for consultants working in the public health system was tabled by management at a plenary meeting on 26 January 2006. The proposals include a commitment to public sector service alone. The implementation of the proposals tabled by management in relation to the consultants&rsquo; contract will ensure that patients&rsquo; access to care and the speed at which care is delivered will be determined only by clinical need. The HSE-Employers Agency has been attempting to restart the stalled negotiations with the medical organisations for some time, most recently last week. Contact is being maintained with the Chairman, Mark Connaughton, S.C., in an effort to find a basis for a resumption of negotiations.</P>

	<P>The General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme was established under the Health Act, 1970 to provide publicly funded general practitioner services to eligible people. Under the GMS Scheme general practitioners hold one of two contract types i.e. the Fee per Item contract (first introduced in 1972) or the Capitation contract (effective from 1989). These contracts reflect the agreed outcome of negotiations between the Department of Health and Children and the GP representative body, the Irish Medical Organisation. Both contract types contain provisions which were agreed between the parties on a range of issues, including retirement age.</P>
    <P>Under the Fee-per-Item contract it was agreed that a GP might hold the contract up to age 70. The terms of the Capitation contract which was agreed between the parties provides that GPs who entered into contracts on the date of its commencement could hold the contract up to age 70 and in all other cases the GP would hold the contract to age 65. Any changes to these arrangements would require to be agreed between the parties involved and would have to include consideration of all relevant factors, including the pension arrangements for GMS GPs. General Practitioners may, of course, and subject to con<Col N="1417"/>tinued registration with the Medical Council, continue to practice and to treat private patients following retirement from the GMS Scheme.</P>
    <P>A review of the contractual arrangements for the provision of services under the GMS and other publicly funded schemes commenced in October 2005 and is being conducted under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission (LRC). The Government wishes the new contractual arrangements to provide open access to public contracts for all qualified GPs registered with the Irish Medical Council. I am also open to considering whether it would be appropriate to change the present arrangements in relation to the age at which GPs must cease to hold contracts. I have therefore, asked my Department, in conjunction with the Health Service Executive (HSE), to consider this matter in the context of the joint review process being conducted under the auspices of the LRC.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring there is an adequate supply of doctors to meet future national GP manpower needs. Following consultation with the Irish College of General Practitioners, in 2004, it was agreed to increase the number of GP trainee places on GP vocational training schemes nationally from 84 to 150, on a phased basis. I have provided additional funding of &euro;2 million in 2005 and an additional &euro;4 million in 2006 has been provided to the HSE for this measure.</P>

     <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that fewer than fifty percent of parliamentary questions from this office referred by her to the Health Service Executive are replied to within a 20 working day period and before a follow up parliamentary question has been tabled; that interim replies are not issued as a matter of routine when the 20 working day period is exceeded; that the tabling of a follow-up parliamentary question usually prompts an immediate reply from the Health Service Executive, indicating that the delay was not due to inaccessibility of the information sought; if she considers this acceptable; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>My Department has been informed by the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive (PAD) that during the period 1st September 2005 to 30 June 2006 the HSE received 46 questions for direct reply to the Deputy and that considerably more than 50% of these questions were responded to within the 20 working day time frame. The Deputy may wish to have his office contact the manager of the PAD central office at 01-6352505 in regard to its figures on replies issued to him.</P><Col N="1418"/>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s point about follow-up questions, the HSE has assured my Department that responses are issued as soon as the information is gathered and finalised.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Executive is conscious of the need to improve its performance in replying directly to Deputies on matters raised in parliamentary questions, including the issue of interim replies. In that connection the HSE is increasing the number of staff assigned to the PAD&rsquo;s central office and is developing the operation of its area offices. The Deputy will be aware from the recent meeting which the CEO of the HSE arranged with Oireachtas members, that the expansion of the PAD&rsquo;s staffing is part of a range of initiatives by the HSE aimed at enhancing the provision of information to Oireachtas members.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that correspondence has been received in my office from the individual concerned and a reply was issued to indicate that the matter is receiving attention. The correspondence concerned relates to the issue of why student nurses are paid while working on placement in hospitals while student physiotherapists on placement are not.</P>
    <P>Students on the four physiotherapy courses provided in our university sector are required to undergo clinical training for a period of 1,000 hours which is equivalent to approximately 26 weeks, delivered in approximately seven clinical sites at different periods over the four years of the degree programme.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the comparison between the clinical training of nurses and physiotherapists in relation to payment is a valid one. Physiotherapy students are supernumerary while on clinical placements (1000 hours) and are not part of the work force. The clinical training component of the nursing degree is 2300 hours (equivalent to 74 weeks) and is laid down by EU Directive. Clinical training for nurses is more than double that of physiotherapists. In addition, it should be noted that the model for the training of physiotherapists in Ireland (including the clinical component) is in line with best practice internationally.</P>
    <P>It is important to clarify that student nurses are not paid when on supernumerary clinical placements. A continual rostered placement (internship) takes place towards the end of the nursing degree programme. During this period <Col N="1421"/>the student is a paid employee of the health service and receives a salary based on 80% of the staff nurse salary. These students replace staff nurses on an agreed ratio.</P>
    <P>A range of measures have been put in place to support the training of physiotherapists in the past number of years including a new physiotherapy course in the University of Limerick which commenced in 2002 with 25 places. Essential to the successful roll-out of these additional training places was the provision of sufficient, quality clinical placements in physiotherapy. Over the last two years, the Department, along with the Health Service Executive, has worked to put in place the enhanced structures necessary to ensure that students have access to a sustainable, high-quality clinical training model. A national implementation group co-chaired by the Department and including representation from the Higher Education Institutes, therapy professional bodies and professional managers, is in place to address the on-going requirements to source clinical placements in the longer term.</P>
    <P>A significant level of funding, secured by the Minister for Health and Children, totalling &euro;5.18m (including &euro;2.75m announced in the Budget 2006) has been allocated since 2004 for the development of therapy clinical training.</P>

	<P>Inspections of registered user establishments are carried out in accordance with Section 10 of the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, as amended. The Act provides for all registered establishments to be from time to time visited by inspectors for the purpose of securing compliance with the provisions of the Act. Veterinary staff of the Department of Agriculture and Food have acted as inspectors under a long standing arrangement with that Department: however, this arrangement is currently under discussion.</P>
    <P>It is a function of the inspector to report to the Authority (Minister for Health and Children) any case of non-compliance with the provisions of the Act. My Department has received no such notifications in the past four years.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s plan is for a national network of radiation oncology services consisting of four large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital, conditional on their conformity to certain quality assurance arrangements.</P>
    <P>The capital investment involved in providing the national network is estimated at over &euro;400 million, most of which is to be funded through a Public Private Partnership (PPP). There is a significant amount of work to be done in preparation for a PPP. Towards this end, my Department is working closely with the HSE and the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA). The NDFA has assembled a team to progress the financial and procurement aspects and the HSE has appointed a Project Manager to lead on its input. A Clinical Output Specification Group, which includes leading experts in the field, is well advanced in specifying the clinical aspects of the development. Technical advisors will be appointed shortly to advise on the construction and other technical aspects of the project.</P>
    <P>The precise planning of the development at Waterford and at the other locations will be addressed when the output specifications have been drawn up as part of the PPP process. The aim is to have the national network in place in 2011. This is an ambitious target but I am determined that the access to radiotherapy services for people in the Waterford area will be enhanced at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question in relation to the provision of funding for public patients seeking radiotherapy treatment at a private clinic relates to the management and delivery of health and personal, social services, which are currently the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the matter raised.</P>

     <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the difficulties being experienced where nursing home subvention does not match charges being presented by private nursing homes and the delays being experienced by patients who have to lodge an appeal; if she will streamline the system to ensure an automatic top up payment is examined based on the income details supplied with the original application, which is not the case in Waterford at present.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 are administered by the Health Service Executive. There are currently three rates of subvention payable, i.e. &euro;114.30, &euro;152.40 and &euro;190.50 for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum. Additional funding of &euro;20 million was provided for the administration of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme in 2006, bringing the total available budget to &euro;161 million. The &euro;20 million is to support more basic nursing home subventions and reduce waiting lists for enhanced subventions: it is also to bring more consistency to subventions support throughout the country. The Deputy may wish to know that the Nursing Home Subvention scheme was never intended to cover the full cost of a private nursing home bed.</P>
    <P>The HSE has discretion to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual&rsquo;s level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted. The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention, subject to the provisions of the Health Act, 2004. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates. The supports paid by the HSE vary from person to person and region to region, depending on prices for example.</P>
    <P>The recently published Health (Nursing Homes)(Amendment) Bill 2006 is designed to ensure that the existing subvention scheme for private nursing home care is grounded in primary legislation and to help the HSE to implement the scheme on a standardised basis across the country. In addition, national guidelines on nursing home subvention are currently being developed by the HSE to ensure an even and equitable application of the regulations nationally.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE) under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The process of assessment of applicants for inter-country assessment is set out in a Framework for Inter-country Adoption Assessment introduced in 1999 to streamline assessments and to provide a transparent system centred on the child&rsquo;s best interests. Inter-country Adoption applications are received by and assessed by the Health Service Executive and PACT, who are a recognised adoption agency. Assessment involves a number of stages and would generally include an initial assessment, a considerable level of education/preparation work (including an exploration with prospective adoptive parents of the challenges and issues that are likely to arise when undertaking adoption) and a home study assessment. The length of the assessment process can vary between applicants depending on the particular circumstances of each case, bearing in mind at all times the best interests of the child. Applicants found to be suitable to be adoptive parents are granted a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability by the Adoption Board, and may then pursue the adoption of a child abroad with the selected sending country.</P>

	<P>The National Health Strategy <i>Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You</i> was announced by the Government in 2001 to provide vision and strategic direction for the health and personal social services. The Strategy sets out the key objectives for the health system up to the year 2010, which are centred on four national goals:</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Better Health For Everyone</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Fair Access</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Responsive and Appropriate Care Delivery</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>High Performance.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">The Health Strategy is now in its sixth year of ongoing implementation and I do not see a need for a rural health strategy as proposed by Irish Rural Link.</P>
    <P>The Health Act, 2004 sets out in broad terms the performance framework for the Health Service Executive (HSE) which was established on 1st January, 2005, as a corner stone of the Health Reform Programme. As part of the performance framework, the HSE must submit to the T&aacute;naiste, for approval, a Corporate Plan and an Annual Service Plan. The HSE corporate plan for 2005-2008 commits it &ldquo;to develop a consistent approach to access to service throughout the country, based on identified need&rdquo;. The service plan format is currently being revised within the Department. The 2007 Plan will, very specifically, include a section devoted to Consistency and Social Inclusion which is to contain details of initiatives being pursued by the HSE to ensure, amongst other things, a geographical equity in the provision of services.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to assure Irish Rural Link that the achievement of consistency in the standard and range of services available in each region of the country is a key objective of the health service reforms.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, Reach Out &mdash; a National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-2014 was launched in September last. Four levels of action comprise the main body of the Strategy, i.e., general population approach; targeted approach; responding to suicide; and information and research.</P>
    <P>During the two years developing the strategy, wide ranging consultation took place throughout the country to draw on the experience, perspectives and ideas of the key stakeholders and interested parties. This consultation process, combined with continuous monitoring of evidence and best practice, allowed the project team to take both an evidence-based and pragmatic approach in prioritising actions to be undertaken by the various agencies and groups in order to effect real change over the next 5 to 10 years.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the Strategy, the Health Service Executive (HSE) established the National Office of Suicide Prevention (NOSP) to oversee the implementation of the Strategy. The Office has primary responsible for implementing the Strategy and will coordinate suicide prevention activities across the State, consult widely in relation to the planning of future initiatives and ensure best practice in suicide prevention.</P>
    <P>An additional &euro;26.2m development funding has been allocated to the HSE for the further development of our mental health services in 2006. Some &euro;1.2m of this additional funding is specifically for suicide prevention initiatives. In the region of &euro;800m will be spent on mental health services this year. The additional funding will be used to enhance the level and range of multidisciplinary services available to adults and children with mental illness. It will also fund the provision of additional community based mental health facilities, including mental health day centres, day hospitals and community residential facilities.</P>
    <P>Future funding for suicide prevention initiatives will be considered in the context of the annual estimates process.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS), at present, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>
    <P>On its introduction on 1 July 1999, the threshold was &pound;42, and in subsequent years this was increased as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>from &pound;42 (&euro;53.33) to &euro;65 with effect from 1 August 2002</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>from &euro;65 to &euro;70 with effect from 1 January 2003</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>from &euro;70 to &euro;78 with effect from 1 January 2004</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>from &euro;78 to &euro;85 with effect from 1 January 2005.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">The DPS protects against excessive medical costs and significantly reduces the burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. The introduction of the scheme saw substantial growth in the State bill, and the cost of the scheme has risen significantly since its inception in 1999. The threshold was not increased between the scheme&rsquo;s introduction in 1999 and 2002 although the cost of the scheme rose by 73% during that period. The number of claimants under the scheme rose by 40% between 2000 and 2002. As of 31 December 2003, 48% of the eligible population was registered under the Scheme. Only 15% of those registered exceeded the monthly threshold in that year, indicating that the scheme was successfully targeting patients with higher drugs costs. The number of eligible persons for the DPS as at 31 December 2004 was almost 1.47 million representing 36.33% of the population. Government expenditure on the <Col N="1437"/>scheme in that year was &euro;226.83 million, an increase of &euro;22.41 million on the previous year.</P>
    <P>The threshold increases have been in line with Government policy to provide reasonable assistance for patients, within available resources.</P>

	<P>I was notified by letter dated 22 June 2006, of the intention of the VHI Board to increase premiums by an average of 12.5% from 1 September 2006. VHI have highlighted in the notification a number of cost drivers, including the costs associated with an ageing population, increasing drug costs and accelerated technology innovation. VHI state that the proposed premium increase will also finance new benefits and services for its members. I am aware of the level of increases in VHI premiums including 2002.</P>
    <P>Under VHI legislation, the VHI Board is responsible for setting premium rates. The legislation obliges the Board to fix premiums to provide sufficient revenue to meet claims costs and to make provision for reserves. For the financial year ended February 2006, VHI will be reporting a loss of &euro;32.3 million leading to a fall in its reserve ratio. I wrote to the Chairman of the VHI Board at the end of 2005, highlighting the need for the Board to build up its reserves. It is a matter for the VHI Board, to take account of all the key considerations in discharging its responsibilities as regards setting premium levels. The Board states that the increase proposed is the absolute minimum increase required. The premium increase notification is being considered against this background.</P>

The NTPF is used for the purpose of treating public patients who have been waiting longest for surgery. It is not intended to expand the remit of the NTPF to funding the type of treatment referred to by the Deputy.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) is the competent authority in Ireland for the enforcement of EU legislation regarding food derived from Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) &mdash; generally referred to as GM food.</P>
    <P>The authorisation and labelling of GM food within the EU is governed by the GM Food and Feed Regulation (EC No. 1829/2003). The labelling terms &lsquo;non GM&rsquo; and &lsquo;GM free&rsquo; are not defined in EU legislation and are used voluntarily by the food industry. However, the use of these terms is subject to Article 2.1(a) of the General Labelling Directive (2000/13/EC) which stipulates <Col N="1441"/>that labelling must not mislead the purchaser as to the characteristics of the foodstuff and, in particular, as to its nature, identity, properties, composition, method of production and manufacturing.</P>
    <P>By carrying out regular surveys of the food supply, the FSAI monitors the level of compliance with GM food legislation and ensures that only authorised and correctly labelled GM ingredients are on the Irish market: a positive result of the FSAI GM food surveys to date is that while GM ingredients have been detected in a proportion of foods tested, no breaches of the EU GM food legislation have been identified.</P>
    <P>In May of this year, the FSAI published the results of its most recent survey &mdash; the GM Food Survey 2005. In this survey a total of 60 food samples were analysed, with six samples being found to contain low levels of GM at less than the 0.9% labelling threshold provided for in EU legislation. However, three of these samples contained GM soya while carrying the claim &lsquo;made from non GM soya&rsquo; on their label. The UK based company producing these foods has been identified in a number of FSAI surveys as carrying potentially misleading claims relating to non GM status, and despite representations by the FSAI, the problem has not been addressed. As a result, <Col N="1442"/>the FSAI has discussed this issue with the retail trade in Ireland and requested that a long term solution be developed to prevent the persistent misleading of consumers by these products. Ultimately, the accuracy of food labels is the responsibility of the food industry which must ensure that all food labels and claims are accurate so that consumers are not mislead.</P>

	<P>A number of the recommendations contained in the Interim Report of the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol concern a reduction in the exposure of children and adolescents to alcohol advertising, marketing and sponsorship. In response to these, my Department entered into negotiations with the broadcasting, media and drinks industries while at the same time pursuing the development of legislation to restrict alcohol advertising, sponsorship and sales promotions/marketing practices. It was agreed that the industry would respond on an incremental basis. This has resulted in the establishment of Central Copy Clearance Ireland which addresses the issue of the content of advertisements, the development of a Voluntary Code of Practice on Advertising which addresses the issue of placement and the establishment of the Alcohol Marketing and Communications Monitoring Body to oversee the implementation of the Voluntary Code. As the T&aacute;naiste has previously indicated, she will await the Annual Report of the Monitoring Body before deciding on future actions in relation to legislation on this issue. Negotiations with the industry stakeholders are ongoing and will include the issue of sponsorship.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Policy Unit of my Department has also engaged directly with the national sporting organisations. The GAA has, in association with the Unit appointed a dedicated project officer to address the issue of alcohol and drug use. The officer will be responsible for carrying out a number of initiatives including the development of a Code of Conduct for local clubs and a review of drug and alcohol issues arising at club level.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Policy Unit and the Health Service Executive are now entering into discussions with the Football Association of Ireland regarding alcohol related issues.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 and 214 together.</P>
    <P>There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however in practice arrangements are made to provide these services. Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual <Col N="1447"/>health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time. Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over. In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</P>
    <P>I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE. My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service; and this process is well under way with the aim of expediting appropriate agreement at the earliest opportunity.</P>

	<P>Given the importance of securing a supply of chiropodists/podiatrists domestically to match the growth in demand for chiropody services, I am conscious of the need to establish a school of podiatry in the State.</P>
    <P>Although responsibility for the establishment of a school of podiatry will be a matter, in the final instance, for the Department of Education and Science, the delivery of clinical training, which is a significant core component of the course, has been the subject of discussions between officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Science in terms of how best it could be facilitated in an integrated fashion with Health Service Executive (HSE) services. The HSE has submitted its proposals on how to provide the clinical training associated with a podiatry degree programme and these proposals were discussed at the most recent meeting between officials which took place on 21 June. Both Departments are continuing to progress the matter.</P>

	<P>The Government is fully committed to the implementation of the principles contained in the Primary Care Strategy and this includes the development of primary care teams and networks. The implementation process at operational level is a function of the Health Service Executive, whose Chief Executive Officer has identified as a priority the development of multidisciplinary primary care services, both as the appropriate service to meet people&rsquo;s health and social care needs and to complement the services provided by acute hospitals.</P>
    <P>The 2006 Estimate for the HSE includes an additional &euro;10 million in revenue funding to enable the establishment of up to 100 new primary care teams. This will enable the provision of some 300 additional frontline personnel to work alongside GPs in order to provide integrated and accessible services in the community. <Col N="1449"/>Work by the HSE to establish these teams is under way. In planning for the establishment of these teams, the Executive intends to focus where possible on areas of disadvantage and with significant health inequalities.</P>
    <P>The HSE will also, as part of the ongoing restructuring and reorientation of resources nationally, work towards the establishment of primary care networks of health and social care professionals that will include chiropodists.</P>
    <P>Ongoing implementation of the Primary Care Strategy will focus on the reorganisation of the resources already available to the health service and on developing new ways of working in line with the service model described in the Strategy. This whole-system approach to implementation means change will be required in many sectors in the health service, and not solely within primary care. It is within this context that additional resources can be deployed to best effect.</P>

	<P>The new National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) 2006-2010 will provide a proactive response grounded in an understanding of local needs, to the development of quality childcare supports and services, including services for school going children. As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the NCIP and the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme <Col N="1450"/>(EOCP) 2000-2006, which are being implemented by the newly established Office of the Minister for Children. The NCIP builds on the success of the EOCP which will conclude in 2007.</P>
    <P>The need to support the further development of childcare services for children of school going age, including before school, after school hours and during school holidays, is an important objective of both the NCIP and the EOCP. One of the key objectives of the NCIP is the creation of 50,000 additional childcare places, including 5,000 after-school places.</P>
    <P>School Age Childcare was examined in detail by a Working Group of the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee, set up under the EOCP, resulting in the publication of the Report &ldquo;School Age Childcare in Ireland&rdquo;, in June 2005. The Report made a number of recommendations for the development of School Age Childcare to support the childcare needs of parents, including the use of school premises, where appropriate, as a location to develop a quality School Age Childcare service, as well as laying down Guidelines for the delivery of a quality service. It is hoped that its publication and on-going promotion at local level by the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs), will give greater impetus to the development of these important services. A special allocation of funding was made available to each CCC to enable the Committee to organise local conferences aimed at raising awareness of the initiative and the supports that are available.</P>
    <P>Funding is available under the NCIP and the EOCP for the development of childcare facilities, including facilities with a specific focus on school age childcare, subject to qualifying conditions. Grants are available for renovating and upgrading identified spare capacity within a school premises and for the furnishing of such facilities.</P>
    <P>Community not for profit and private sector childcare providers may apply for grant assistance of up to &euro;1 million and &euro;100,000 respectively, towards the capital cost of developing a childcare service in a catchment area where there is a demonstrated need. Key stakeholders have been asked to come forward with proposals for services, shaped around their particular local needs. Schools, groups or individuals interested in applying for school age childcare funding should contact their local CCC.</P>
    <P>Full contact details for the CCCs are available on the OMC website at <i>www.omc.gov.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>Let me say at the outset that there is no embargo on the recruitment of staff in the public health service. Nor does my Department set employment quotas at national level for any grade in the public health service. It is a matter for the Health Service Executive, as part of its management of its employment ceiling, to determine the appropriate staffing mix required to deliver its service plan priorities, including speech and language therapy services. I have consistently emphasised the importance of prioritising the filling of front line vacancies in complying with approved employment levels. I have also emphasised the need to achieve an appropriate balance between clinical and non-clinical posts.</P>
    <P>Approved employment levels for the health service have been adjusted since 2002 in line with Government policy on public sector employment and also to take account of specific policy measures aimed at increasing service levels. My Department is currently in discussions with the Department of Finance and the Health Service Executive to agree revisions to the health service employment ceiling to take account of service developments, including disability services.</P>
    <P>A priority for the HSE in 2006 is to increase service provision in the area of multi-disciplinary supports to meet obligations to children with developmental delay, in the home, in the community and in other appropriate settings. The investment package will facilitate the recruitment of up to 200 extra therapists, particularly speech and language, occupational therapy and physiotherapy. Due to the current limited supply of these grades it is acknowledged that in the short term recruitment from overseas will be required. The HSE has put in place a project plan for this.</P>
    <P>In regard to the recruitment of speech and language therapists generally, the Deputies will be pleased to note that the Health Service Personnel Census shows a total of 596 wholetime equivalent <Col N="1453"/>(WTE) staff at end March, 2006. This represents an increase of 315 WTE staff or 112% since end December, 1997. The number of training places in speech and language therapy has increased by 300% since 2001.</P>

     <Quest>the number of medical card holders in the state in 1997; the number of 2002 and the number in 2006.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The numbers of medical card holders in the state as requested by the Deputy are as follows: 1997, 1,219,852; 2002, 1,168,745; and 2006, 1,187,370.</P>
    <P>The figure shown for 2006 is the most recent figure provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to my Department and refers to the position as at 1 June, 2006.</P>
    <P>The decrease in the number of medical card holders since 1997 can be attributed to a number of factors including the improvement in the econ<Col N="1454"/>omic circumstances of the population resulting in less people requiring a medical card on means grounds. Also the ongoing management and review of the medical card databases by the HSE has resulted in the reduction of the perceived numbers who hold medical cards. The database cleansing exercise undertaken by the then health boards in 2003 in relation to the over 70&rsquo;s medical cards, resulted in the removal of 80,000 cards from the medical card database. These cards included duplicate cards, cards for persons who were deceased or cards for people who had left the relevant health board area.</P>
    <P>The Health Strategy commits to making improvements in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for the medical card and to give priority to families with children. In November, 2004 I set out my priorities for new health initiatives in 2005 including the provision of medical cards to an additional 30,000 people and GP visit cards to 200,000 people. Funding of &euro;60 million has been provided to the HSE for these measures. The two initiatives greatly assist those on low incomes accessing GP services and also help in removing disincentives to people taking up work or progressing to better paying work. In June, 2006, 42,287 more people have medical cards than in January, 2005 (1,145,083).</P>
    <P>In recent years there have been significant improvements to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed. In January 2005, the income guidelines used in the assessment of medical card applications increased by 7.5%. In June 2005, the means test for both medical cards and GP visit cards was simplified. It is now based on an applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child-care and travel to work. I believe that this is much fairer to applicants. In October, 2005 I increased the income guidelines for both medical cards and GP visit cards by an additional 20% and on 26 June, 2006 I again increased the income guidelines for GP visit cards and they are now 50% higher than those used for medical cards.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that such a survey has not been conducted by my Department. In 2004, following consultation with the Irish College of General Practitioners it was agreed to meet short to medium term needs to increase the number of GP trainee places on GP vocational training schemes nationally from 84 to 150, on a phased basis. I have provided additional <Col N="1455"/>funding of &euro;2 million in 2005 and an additional &euro;4 million in 2006 for this measure.</P>
    <P>My Department, the Health Service Executive and the College are in the process of putting in place arrangements to consider the most appropriate way in which to address the longer-term GP manpower and training needs, in the context of such factors as the projected growth of the population, the demographic profile of the GP workforce, the changing nature of general practice and primary care, and future service requirements generally.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Tackling the problems that exist in some of the country&rsquo;s A &amp; E departments is the Government&rsquo;s top priority in health. Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in A &amp; E and do not require admission.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Executive has put in place a number of measures to build on the actions contained in the A &amp; E Action Plan. These include in particular the setting of performance targets for individual hospitals. Over the last three months there has been a consistent improvement in the numbers of patients on trolleys in A &amp; E awaiting admission, when compared to the same period in 2005. In June, for example, there were on average 39% fewer patients on trolleys awaiting admission than in June 2005.</P>
    <P>The numbers of patients who are waiting longer than 24 hours for admission have also decreased. The HSE is continuing to focus on the interim target that no patient will wait longer than 24 hours, with the ultimate target being to ensure that no patient waits any longer than six hours for admission.</P>
    <P>The hospitals are being assisted in achieving their targets by the A &amp; E Task Force which was established by the HSE. The Task Force has focused on those hospitals that have persistent challenges in relation to the delivery of A &amp; E services and has undertaken site visits to those hospitals to identify initiatives that will have a high impact on A &amp; E performance.</P>
    <P>One of the first initiatives to be progressed has been the fast-tracking of admissions beds and other facilities to improve the patient experience by ensuring that patient privacy, dignity and comfort is preserved as far as possible while awaiting admission to an acute bed.</P>
    <P>Tackling the issue of care for older people is an important and integral part of the A &amp; E strategy. We have provided additional intermediate care beds and home care packages to facilitate the discharge in 2006 to date of more than 700 patients who have completed the acute phase of their care. Some 400 additional private nursing <Col N="1456"/>home beds have been provided for those who require long-term care.</P>
    <P>Given the emerging capacity challenges in the private nursing home sector, and having regard to the specific needs of high acuity patients, the HSE is currently examining the possibility of providing a significant number of additional long-term care beds, both in Dublin and elsewhere, at a number of health service locations. All available mechanisms will be used to accelerate the process to allow for the earliest possible introduction of these additional facilities. The initiative is being overseen by a HSE dedicated project team.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving the delivery of A &amp; E services. By adopting a system-wide approach I am confident that the services will continue to be improved, and that those improvements will be sustained.</P>

	<P>Section 49 of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act 1998 provides that the Board or Chief Executive of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) may appoint, in writing, persons to be authorised officers for the purposes of the Act. Authorised officers enforce food law, which is defined within the Act and set out in detail in the FSAI Act 1998 (Amendment of First and Second Schedules) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 320 of 2006). Food law as described within the Order includes several regulations on food labelling and food labelling provisions within many other regulations.</P>
    <P>The FSAI has appointed twenty eight of its own staff as authorised officers under the 1998 Act, which allows them to enforce food law &mdash; including regulations on food labelling. However, the bulk of day-to-day enforcement of food labelling regulations is carried out by the authorised <Col N="1457"/>officers of official agencies &mdash; the Health Service Executive, the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the local authorities and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
    <P>Some of the twenty eight authorised officers within the FSAI are involved in occasional survey work or audits which include checks on food labelling. Audits and surveys have included checks on labelling and traceability of meat and fish, genetically modified food, fruit juice, honey and infant formulae. Such work is usually carried out in conjunction with staff in the official agencies. Depending on the particular audit or survey, FSAI staff involved are drawn from various divisions within the Authority but all have a wide range of other duties apart from checks on food labelling.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government in mid 2004 decided to reform construction procurement to help achieve greater cost certainty, better value for money and more cost effective delivery of public works projects. My Department, with the assistance of the Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC), specialist legal drafters and external technical expertise, has now developed a suite of Standard Forms of Construction Contract.</P>
    <P>The fundamental change in the new construction contracts is the re-balancing of risk to change from existing practice where the State bears a disproportionate level of risk to the situation where capital projects are tendered for by contractors on a fixed price lump sum basis to include identified and appropriate risks. The new draft con<Col N="1460"/>tracts also require contractors to ensure that pay and conditions of employment comply with the law and are no less favourable than the terms of the Registered Employment Agreements for those employees to whom the agreements apply. The new draft contracts also include provisions which give some support to strengthening enforcement arrangements in the construction sector. More generally, the public procurement guidelines issued by my Department, require that all contracting authorities ensure that tenderers have regard to minimum pay and other legally binding industrial or sectoral agreements when preparing bids and that tender documents should have an appropriate reference to this.</P>
    <P>My officials have had extensive and constructive consultations with the construction industry over the last year on the content of the contracts. During this process, there has been very significant movement on the part of the State to help meet the industry&rsquo;s concerns without compromising core policy in this area. Following a very useful exchange of views with representatives of the construction industry in early June, I am aware that there are a small number of outstanding concerns for the industry. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the details at this time. However, let me say that I have listened carefully to the industry&rsquo;s comments and views and I am currently reflecting on the points made with a view to finalising the contracts in the coming weeks.</P>

    <P FLI="0">In addition, two non-Governmental bodies applied to the National Public Procurement Policy Unit of my Department for funding. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions received &euro;15,383 in 2005 for the publication of a document on Public Private Partnerships (PPP) and to support a seminar on PPPs for its members. Another non-Governmental body made an application but this was rejected as the proposal would have resulted in a duplication of training services relating to Public Private Partnerships.</P>
    <P>My Department also operates a scheme to make available, from the proceeds of the <Col N="1462"/>National Lottery, funds to supplement the income of promoters of private charitable lotteries competing directly with National Lottery products. In the period in question, my Department received 35 applications for funding. Three of those were refused, on the grounds that the applicants were not operating a lottery under the provisions of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts on or before 1 January 1997, which is one of the criteria for eligibility. The following table sets out the funding provided to each of the successful applicants in the years 2004 and 2005. No funding has been provided yet this year.</P><Col N="1461"/>

Brochures that provide necessary visitor information are distributed at staffed OPW-managed heritage sites and through the Tourist Information Offices network.

The Office of Public Works is currently preparing tender documents for the appointment of consultants.</P>
    <P>The length of time required to complete a Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Study varies with the extent of the area to be studied and the complexity of the watercourses as well as of the environmental, archaeological and other issues, which have to taken into account.</P>
    <P>I expect that the Rye River Study, which will provide a comprehensive basis for dealing with all of the flood related issues in the sub catchment which includes the towns of Leixlip, Maynooth and Kilcock could be completed within 12 to 18 months.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The operation of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme was reviewed by a special Interdepartmental Review Group. The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Group&rsquo;s Report, published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme. It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries. The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, encompassing the operation of the appeals process and options for the possible future development of the scheme in a series of regulations in 2004 and 2005. The main change arising from these was that an increased number of members could be appointed to the Appeal Board, which facilitated a far greater number of appeal hearings than had been the case prior to the Report&rsquo;s publication.</P>
    <P>In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration. For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to give the income decile analysis requested as the scheme has 10 months to run and in that period the data are subject to a number of variables including for example where participants voluntarily withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to give a definitive answer as to the impact of the SSIA scheme on wealth redistribution. However, some data is available on the income levels of those who are availing of the scheme. The following are the income levels for SSIA holders who were matched with the Revenue income distribution tables, based on the latest information available.</P><Col N="1469"/>

In order to provide an incentive to save for this period, the Government provides a generous 25% top up on savings, in the form of a tax credit.

	<P>Section 128 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (as amended) <Col N="1471"/>charges to income tax the gain made by directors of companies and employees on the exercise of rights granted to them to acquire shares or other assets. Section 128A, which was enacted in 2000, provided for the deferral, subject to conditions, of this tax charge for a period of up to seven years. Section 519 of, and Schedule 12 C to, the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for the waiving of the income tax charge in the case of approved share option schemes.</P>
    <P>The law relating to share options has been amended on three occasions since 2002.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Finance Act 2002 amended Section 128 to take account of the alignment of the tax and calendar years. The filing date for making a return of share options granted or exercised was changed from 30 June to 31 March. In addition, the amendment provided that where a company is not resident in the State but operates here through a branch or agency, the responsibility for making the return of share options granted or exercised will rest on the company&rsquo;s representative in the State.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 &amp; 8 of the Finance Act 2003 abolished, with effect from 6 February 2003, the right to defer payment of the income tax charged in respect of share options. Instead a new section &mdash; Section 128B &mdash; was introduced into the Taxes Consolidation Act to provide that, where an individual exercises an option on or after 30 June 2003, the income tax due under Section 128 in respect of any realised gain must be paid to the Collector-General within thirty days of that event.</P>
    <P>Finally, Section 16(1) of Finance Act 2005 extended the charge to income tax under Section 128 to gains arising from the exercise of share options by individuals who are not resident in the State at the date the option is granted. The legislation is subject to a commencement order and will apply to options granted on or after the date the commencement order is signed. The reason for this is to allow time for consultation with a number of representative bodies with a view to the Revenue Commissioners issuing a Statement of Practice on how the legislation will be applied. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that these consultations are ongoing.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the objective Delivering Major Capital Programmes, the Programme for Government states:</P>
	<P LI="1">Where significant once-off revenues accrue to the state through for example, the sale of <Col N="1472"/>assets or the restructuring of the Central Bank, we will use these revenues to create a National Transformation Fund. This fund, which will be managed by the NTMA, will be used to finance multi-annual infrastructural development programmes.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The proposal to establish a National Transformation Fund was aimed at facilitating the delivery of major capital programmes in a coherent manner while maximising efficiency, value for money and appropriate risk transfer across complex multi-annual programmes. This has been overtaken by events and while a National Transformation Fund has not been established it is clear that the overall objective behind the proposal is being achieved.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of developments since the proposal was made which meet the overall objectives envisaged. These developments include:</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>The multi-annual capital framework</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Transport 21</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>The National Development Plan.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">For some years now, public capital investment under the capital envelopes has been about 5% of GNP. This is around twice the EU average level.</P>
    <?oasys _cl11- ?><P>The introduction of multi-annual capital envelopes in Budget 2004 has progressed and continues to progress investment in infrastructure, thereby ensuring continued economic progress, national competitiveness and better quality of life for the public in general.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to maintaining this level of investment. Under the 2006-2010 capital envelope, some &euro;43.5 billion is being made available, an increase of &euro;7.2 billion on last year&rsquo;s capital envelope.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Transport 21 will deliver &euro;34 billion of infrastructural improvements in the transport sector over the 10 years 2006-2015.</P>
    <P>The next National Development Plan covering the period 2007-2013, which sets out the Government&rsquo;s investment strategy and indicative financial allocations for enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure, human resources, enterprise sector as well as promoting social inclusion will be launched next November.</P>
    <P>Besides these developments it should be noted that monies from the Central Bank and the sale of State assets would be taken in by the Exchequer as Non-Tax Revenue and would therefore be available for investment having regard to the Government&rsquo;s capital investment framework. In this context, the Central Bank restructured its reserves and investment portfolio in the period 2000 to 2003 and the proceeds were paid into the Exchequer as part of the normal payment of surplus income of the Central Bank. This has contributed to the achievement of the sound public finances strategy pursued by the Government.</P><Col N="1473"/>

	<P>The current minimum wage is &euro;7.65 per hour. On an annualised basis, this is equivalent to &euro;15,515 assuming a 39 hour working week.</P>
    <P>The present entry point to income tax under the PAYE system is &euro;15,600 per annum for a single person under 65.</P>
    <P>The position is, therefore, that no employee who benefits from entitlement to the employee (PAYE) tax credit in addition to the basic personal tax credit will be subjected to income tax in 2006.</P>
    <P>However, a small number of persons with income at or below the current minimum wage annualised who do not have entitlement to the employee tax credit are likely to be liable for a small amount of income tax in 2006. This group comprises, essentially, proprietary directors and certain pensioners.</P>

	<P>I understand that the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates specifically to the situation regarding civil servants.</P>
    <P>There are a number of grounds on which a civil servant may be removed from office:</P>
  <P LI="1">(a) Under the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956, the Government may dismiss or discipline an established civil servant for misconduct or fraud. There is a disciplinary code which sets out the procedures under which this action can take place; the Code also provides for an appeal process to allow the officer the opportunity to state a defence. In the case of an unestablished civil servant, dismissal may be decided by the relevant Minister.</P>
    <P LI="1">(b) The Civil Regulation Act 1956 also allows for compulsory retirement on grounds of ill-health at the initiative of the employing Department or Office.</P>
   <P LI="1">(c) Under the 1909 and 1963 Superannuation and Pensions Acts, an officer may be retired early on grounds of organisational efficiency or <Col N="1474"/>effectiveness and receive a pension before the normal pension age.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Before the commencement on 4 July, 2006 of the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005, the termination of employment of an established civil servant was decided by the Government. With the commencement of the Act, the relevant Minister has powers of discipline for the grades of Principal upwards and Secretaries-General and Heads of Office have responsibility for grades below Principal.</P>
    <P>Where a civil servant is working for an agency or board, the chief executive or the board of the organisation would have a role in advising the Minister or Government on the background to the proposed removal from office.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may be aware that the issue of a currency transactions tax (Tobin tax) has been considered in a number of fora, including the informal Ecofin meeting at Liege on 22 September 2001. The Belgian Presidency indicated that it wished to <Col N="1475"/>pursue the matter in the context of a general study to be carried out by the Commission on the issue of globalisation. However, it would be fair to say that most EU Finance Ministers at that time had reservations about the Tobin tax proposal, and believed that it was not clear that a further examination of the issue by the Commission would ensure that satisfactory answers would be given to the many real questions concerning the tax including: the difficulties relating to practical implementation of the tax; its doubtful effect on short-term speculative capital movements; its conflict with the basic tenet of free capital movement in the EU; its disproportionate effect on small business and consumers; the probability that the tax would simply drive participants into other (non-taxable) alternatives; and the negative impact on liquidity in the foreign exchange market. I am of the same view.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, at a formal Ecofin meeting on 16 October 2001, it was agreed that the Commission would carry out a study on globalisation and that this study would examine the arguments for and against a Tobin tax. This study, &ldquo;Responses to the Challenges of Globalisation&rdquo;, was published on 14 February 2002. On the matter of the Tobin tax, the study concluded that &ldquo;while as a source of additional revenue a currency transaction tax may look appealing, its feasibility is, however, not demonstrated&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This issue has also been raised at EU level in 2005 in the context of the financing of development aid but was dismissed by the EU Commission for reasons such as those already outlined.</P>
    <P>As indicated in replies to previous questions on this matter, I do not propose to introduce such a tax as I remain unconvinced of its feasibility.</P>

	<P>Under my Department&rsquo;s Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals in the Public Sector, as amended by my Department&rsquo;s Value for Money Circular Letter of 26 January 2006, all semi-state bodies with responsibility for developing capital projects are required to carry out an appropriate cost benefit analysis of projects costing over &euro;30 million.</P>
    <P>If a semi state company proposes to proceed with such a project on the basis of its cost benefit analysis and if the project is to be funded from Exchequer capital under the multi-annual capital envelopes, the semi-state company concerned is required to submit the cost benefit analysis to the <Col N="1476"/>relevant sanctioning authority for approval to proceed with the project. The sanctioning authority would normally be the relevant Government Department with responsibility for the sector.</P>
    <P>If the semi-state company is a commercial company funding the project from its own resources the cost benefit analysis would include an assessment of the commercial viability of the project. It would be the responsibility of the board of the company concerned to decide whether the project should proceed on the basis of the cost benefit analysis.</P>
    <P>As the responsibility to carry out cost benefit analysis rests with the relevant semi-state company the evaluation unit located within my Department has not and will not carry out a cost-benefit analysis in relation to the project referred to in the question.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I introduced changes in this year&rsquo;s Finance Act to alter the way that stamp duty is charged on combined cards.

    <P>Stamp duty on credit / charge card accounts has existed since 1982 and stamp duty on ATM cards has existed since 1997. Stamp duty on debit cards was only introduced in December 2002.</P>
    <P>The number of credit card and charge card accounts that were liable to stamp duty for 2005 was 1,596,499. In the case of debit and ATM cards, the number liable to stamp duty in 2005 was:</P>

    <P FLI="0">Stamp duty exists on various financial cards in order to provide Exchequer revenue. The stamp duty on cheques, bills of exchange and promissory notes has existed for many years and when electronic means of money transfers were subsequently introduced, stamp duty was gradually extended to these products to ensure that the stamp duty from cheques etc. was not eroded. The stamp duty applies irrespective of the volume of bank transactions made.</P>
    <P>Stamp duties on financial cards are significant contributors to the Exchequer and are in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates generally low.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any other EU Member States imposing taxation on financial cards.</P>
    <P>I do not receive many complaints in relation to this stamp duty given the very large number of financial cards involved.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the Tramore Road phase of the John&rsquo;s River flood relief scheme has a negative cost benefit ratio and the decision was therefore taken to omit this phase from the scheme as it does not meet the basic requirement that a flood relief scheme be economically viable. While flooding of the Tramore Road causes considerable disruption and inconvenience, it is not the only access route between Tramore and Waterford and I could not justify including this phase in the scheme while other cost beneficial schemes to relieve flooding of houses and other property awaited attention.</P>
    <P>The position can be re-considered if the expenditure required to protect the road can be shown to be cost beneficial.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are in consultation with Waterford City Council with a view to advancing the cost beneficial elements of the proposed Waterford Flood Relief Scheme.</P>

I understand that the Committee has completed its review of this issue and has recently submitted its advice which is now being assessed by my Department.</P>
    <P>The Advisory Committee were also asked for advice on the Irish League of Credit Union&rsquo;s proposals for regulatory and legal changes and have recommended certain amendments to the regulatory framework for credit unions under the Credit Union Act, 1997 which can be implemented by Statutory Instrument. The recommendations include increases in the limits that can be held on deposit, increases in the limits for the amount that can be nominated and increases in the limits for small payments on death. My Department in tandem with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is drafting the necessary Statutory Instruments to bring these changes into effect as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent estimated cost of making the home carer tax credit refundable when it is unused is broadly in the region of &euro;42 million annually.</P>
    <P>The estimate of &euro;42 million relates only to the cost of extending refundable tax credits to all those on the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; tax files. If a refundable tax credit system were to be introduced, one would have to consider those who are not on the tax files, such as those who are of employable age but not working, including those on social welfare. This would increase the cost.</P>

    <P>The fees payable to members of State boards depend on the size and complexity of the bodies they govern. In order to determine what level of fee is appropriate, State bodies are divided into four categories, depending on the pay of their chief executives. The level of remuneration of the chief executive is an objective assessment of the relative importance and complexity of the bodies concerned.</P>

	<P>As part of the Decentralisation Programme it is intended that Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSI) will decentralise to Dungarvan, County Waterford. I am informed by OSI that arrangements are proceeding in accordance with their implementation plan. A site has been acquired in Dungarvan by the Office of Public Works (OPW). A detailed plan of the OSI requirements in the new location has been developed and submitted to the OPW for consideration.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the high proportion of credit union savings that are currently invested in banks and other financial institutions. This largely reflects the strong performance of credit unions in attracting savings. It also reflects the highly competitive environment for lending in which credit unions operate.</P>
    <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) contends that the current limits in the Credit Union Act, 1997 on longer-term lending by credit unions are affecting the competitiveness of credit union lending, as credit unions are not in a position to compete with the banking sector in one of the more demand driven areas of the lending market overall. The Registrar of Credit Unions in the Financial Regulator does not favour any change in the lending limits at this time, primarily because of the scope for increased credit risk.</P>
    <P>Given the divergence of views between credit unions and the Registrar in relation to this important issue, I referred the matter to the expert statutory advisory body on credit union matters, the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) requesting their advice as to whether a review of the current limits on longer-term lending by credit unions should be initiated. The recommendation of the Committee is expected shortly.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There are no official figures available for the value of the entire housing stock. There is only limited data available on legal ownership of houses by age profile. The CSO has advised that a 2004 survey indicated that about two thirds of owner occupied houses are owned by persons over 50. This proportion does not include other houses owned by respondents such as holiday homes or houses bought to rent, and the survey does not cover vacant houses. Please note that in households where two people were responsible for the accommodation, the age of the eldest was used.</P>
    <P>There are no data available on the profile of owners of rented dwellings or vacant or holiday homes. However common experience suggests that property ownership rises with age and that it tends to be higher in the older age groups.</P>

	<P>The preparation of the NDP for the period 2007-2013 has been in progress since the Government announcement last August. The plan is due to be launched next November. It is not intended to publish any drafts of the Plan before its publication.</P>
    <P>The Plan will be a high level strategic document setting out the overall investment framework for the next seven years. The Plan will not be a list of projects. Projects will flow over the period of the Plan from the investment framework set out in the Plan.</P>
    <P>The Plan will build on and embrace existing policies in areas such as Transport under T21, Science and Technology under the SSTI, the strategy on higher education already announced by Government and other relevant Government policies, including as appropriate commitments made under social partnership.</P>
    <P>The final structure and content of the plan will ultimately be a matter for Government but I would anticipate that the next Plan would encompass the following key features:</P>
<P el="3"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>An overriding commitment to economic and budgetary sustainability; the investment allocations set out in the next Plan will be dependent on the availability of resources.</P>
<P el="3"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>A commitment to a further major enhancement of our economic and social infrastructure, notably in key areas of Transport, Environmental Services, Social and Affordable Housing, Health, Education, Broadband and Energy.</P>
 <P el="3"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Investment in support of the Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation.</P>
  <P el="3"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Investment in Education at all levels with a particular emphasis on the 3rd and 4th levels in tandem with continued investment in labour force training and lifelong learning.</P>
   <P el="3"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Support for the productive sector including enterprise, agriculture, the marine sector, tourism and services generally.</P>
   <P el="3"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>The promotion of social inclusion.</P>
  <P el="3"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>A substantive investment framework to promote a better balance in regional development in line with the template of the National Spatial Strategy including a framework for development of the Rural Economy.</P>
 <P el="3"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Promotion of better North/South economic cooperation and of the all-island economy.</P><Col N="1498"/>
  <P el="3"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Investment in the environment to promote environmental sustainability accompanied by a general objective that investment in general is compatible with this goal.</P>
 <P el="3"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>The plan will also have a number of horizontal themes as follows:</P>
<P el="3"><?oasys _is1p4- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Balanced regional development through the implementation of the National Spatial Strategy.</P>
   <P el="3"><?oasys _is1p4- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>The all-island dimension.</P>
   <P el="3"><?oasys _is1p4- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Environmental sustainability.</P>
  <P el="3"><?oasys _is1p4- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>The promotion of social inclusion.</P>
    <P el="3" FLI="0">An extensive consultation process has been undertaken. An invitation to make submissions was extended to the Social Partners, Regional Bodies and bodies representing key stakeholders such as the Western Development Commission, the Heritage Council, Comhar and the Combat Poverty Agency. A number of meetings have also taken place with organisations making submissions. A consultation seminar for the Southern and Eastern Region will take place on 20th July next and for the BMW Region on 7th September next. Each Government Department involved was also asked to consult with bodies and agencies within their aegis in order to inform the material submitted by them.</P>
    <P>The ESRI was commissioned to carry out an ex-ante evaluation of the investment priorities for the period 2007-2013. I understand that the evaluation is nearly complete. When finished, it will then be submitted to Government for consideration with publication expected sometime thereafter.</P>

	<P>The rate of stamp duty on cheques is 15c per cheque. The rate of stamp duty on debit cards (laser) with an ATM function (combined cards) is &euro;20 per annum.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I introduced changes in this year&rsquo;s Finance Act to alter the way that stamp duty is charged on combined cards. The stamp duty on a combined card was reduced to &euro;10 per annum where the card is only used for one function (either ATM transactions or debit transactions) throughout the year.</P>

    <P>The VRT rates and bands are reviewed in the annual Budgetary process. For example, in last <Col N="1500"/>year&rsquo;s Budget, I introduced a 50% VRT relief for flexible fuel vehicles and a similar relief was already in place for hybrid electric cars. I have no plans to introduce a general reduction of VRT.</P>
    <P>As for the elimination of VRT over a period of time, I have no plans at present to do so. The European Commission published a proposal for a directive in relation to car taxes in July 2005 which supports the gradual abolition of registration taxes which it believes impacting on the functioning of the internal market. However, the aim of the proposal is that such registration taxes would be replaced by circulation taxes which would have a CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> element.</P>
    <P>At EU Council discussions, Ireland has pointed out that we regard VRT as a national tax that falls within the national competence &mdash; a position shared by several other Member States. Our view is that the mix of taxes, their levels and rates are matters for EU Member States based on legitimate choices.</P>
    <P>Within the EU Single Market, the facility is available for Member States to raise revenue through internal taxation subject to certain provisos such as the following:</P>

    <P el="5" FLI="0">VRT has been examined by the European Court of Justice and has been found to be compatible with EU legislation. Motor vehicle taxes have been a traditional source of revenue in Ireland for decades and provide significant revenue to the Exchequer which is used to fund vital public services. For example, VRT yielded approximately &euro;1,149 million in 2005. As regards the balance of taxation, Ireland has prioritised tax reductions on income earned by employees, in preference to other tax areas, and this policy has helped create record employment levels.</P>

	<P>The National Development Plan/Community Support Framework (NDP/CSF) 2000-2006 set out to ensure that Ireland remained competitive in the global international marketplace and that the fruits of our economic success would be shared more equally at regional level and throughout our society. The Plan is implemented through seven Operational Programmes comprising 30 sub-programmes and 147 measures.</P><Col N="1502"/>
    <P>In the first six years of the NDP (2000-2005) over 44 billion euro has been invested nationwide. Significant progress continues to be made in the implementation of the NDP in the Regions. The latest information indicates that overall gross expenditure in the Border, Midlands and West (BMW) region is running at 12.1 billion euro for the six year period 2000-2005, with the Exchequer component running at 10.7 billion euro. In the Southern and Eastern (S&amp;E) region overall gross expenditure is running at 32.8 billion euro, with the Exchequer element at 28 billion euro.</P>
    <P>The information also indicates that the overall outturn for the NDP is expected to be near to forecast by the end of 2006, but with some over-performance and underperformance of expenditure taking place within the Operational Programmes that support the NDP. However, it is also expected that co-funded measures under the NDP will achieve their full entitlement to Structural Funds in both Regions by the end of 2008, the timetable set out in the Regulations.</P>
    <P>Performance indicators at programme and priority level are included in the Operational Programme documents and at measure (and sub-measure) level in the programme complement documents. The monitoring indicators allow progress to be measured in terms of reaching objectives and targets, the impact and results of expenditure and the progress of the financing plan.</P>
    <P>Each Operational Programme has a Managing Authority which monitors financial and physical output targets. Each Implementing Agency is required to supply physical and financial progress to the Operational Programme Monitoring Committee meetings held in the Spring and Autumn. The Progress reports for these are available from the respective Managing Authorities for the Operational Programmes as set out as follows.</P><Col N="1501"/>

    <P FLI="0">The Operational Programme Monitoring Committee reports include a description of physical progress of each measure for the six month reporting period and since the beginning of the Programme, accompanied by the appropriate table of physical indicators. They also include a standard financial table which provides information of each measure by EU co-financed and non co-financed expenditure, national contributions, EU contribution and private financing.</P>
    <P>These reports are collated and presented to the NDP/CSF Monitoring Committee which is <Col N="1502"/>chaired by my Department. This Committee plays an active role in the monitoring of the NDP/CSF and meets at least twice yearly to review progress being made towards achieving objectives and targets. The Committee is made up of a wide partnership of interests, including implementing Departments, the social partners, sectoral interests, and members of local authorities representing the regional assemblies.</P>
    <P>This Committee reviews the progress being made towards achieving objectives and targets. Monitoring is carried out by reference to physical <Col N="1503"/>and financial indicators at the level of programme, sub-programme and measure but not at project level.</P>
    <P>In addition to the ongoing monitoring, mid term evaluations of the NDP/CSF and of the individual Operational Programmes were carried out in 2003 the purpose of which was to provide an analysis of both progress under the programmes and of developments in the external environment. An update evaluation of the CSF was completed in December 2005 which provided a synthesis of overall CSF progress in both financial and physical terms to end 2004.</P>
    <P>My Department has also recently published a report entitled Progress on the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website or on the NDP website and provides greater detail on the achievements to date under the National Development Plan.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that VAT returns are not compiled in a manner which would allow the yield from particular goods or services to be identified. Furthermore, since it is also not possible to distinguish in VAT returns the amount of VAT charged on the environmental levy under the WEEE scheme, which is included in the consideration for the supply of goods, there is no basis on which an estimate of the VAT collected to date in respect of the levy can be compiled.</P>
    <P>Regarding the application of VAT to the environmental levy under the WEEE scheme, Section 10 of the Value Added Tax Act 1972 (as amended) provides that VAT is chargeable on the total consideration including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges in respect of the supply of goods and services.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 279 and 280 together.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Department of Education &amp; Science that as at 31st December 2005, in excess of 5,500 Section 50 student accommodation units have been certified by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government since the inception of the scheme. Data relating to the number of Section 50 units approved by each third level college is not readily available.</P>
    <P>As regards the manner in which student use (as required by this scheme) is verified on an ongoing basis, I am informed that there are no figures available of the proportion of the 14,000 or so Revenue audits carried out in 2005 that looked specifically at claimants to relief for the construction of student accommodation. Revenue are aware that a number of such claims were examined in the normal course of audit in 2005 and that, in those cases examined, there was no evidence to suggest that the guidelines as regards student use were not complied with or that the relief had been abused.</P>
    <P>However, Revenue have noted recent newspaper reports of claims made by the Union of Students in Ireland that some &ldquo;Section 50&rdquo; apartments are being let to non-students during college terms. I am informed that Revenue have followed up with the person making the claim and will be meeting the USI shortly to discuss their concerns. If there is evidence of abuse in this area, I am assured that Revenue will take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>As regards the value of the tax foregone from section 50 relief, the Deputy will be aware that reference to this relief is included in a report by economic consultants INDECON entitled &ldquo;Indecon Review of Property-Based Tax Incentive Schemes&rdquo; which was prepared in 2005 and published in February 2006. This report was commissioned by the Department of Finance and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website. It includes an estimate of the aggregate gross tax foregone of &euro;214m and other information the Deputy may find useful.</P><Col N="1506"/>
    <P>I should explain that for the tax year 2003 and earlier years, claims for section 50 relief were aggregated in tax returns with other claims and could not be distinguished from the reliefs claimed in respect of different schemes. Accordingly, the specific information on costs for 2003 and earlier years is not available to Revenue. Provisions were included in the Finance Act 2004 to allow this data to be obtained separately for the tax years 2004 et seq.</P>
    <P>Based on the information that has been received and collated to date in respect of the tax year 2004, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a total of approximately &euro;180 million was included in the relevant income tax returns for that year as section 50 claims. This figure would correspond to a maximum Exchequer cost for 2004 of some &euro;75 million in terms of income tax forgone. These figures are preliminary estimates and may change as further returns are processed. I should also point out, however, that Revenue are concerned at preliminary indications that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the 2004 Income Tax returns. Revenue is engaging with the tax practitioner bodies to draw attention to these deficiencies and to rectify them. Revenue has also increased awareness among its own staff involved in processing tax returns of the need to ensure, through closer examination of the returns, that they are correctly completed.</P>
    <P>Data for the tax years 2005 and 2006 is not yet available as the income tax returns for those years are not due for filing until October 2006 and October 2007 respectively.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
     <Quest>if his Department has conducted studies on potential financial and environmental benefit of increased insulation in the domestic property sector; and his views on implementing a grants scheme, similar to the greener homes operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland, aimed at subsidising those homeowners who invest in increased insulation levels for their homes.</Quest>
     <QRef>[27339/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s housing stock is proportionately the youngest and fastest growing in Europe, and therefore Building Regulations, under the mandate of the Department of the Environment, Heritage &amp; Local Government, have represented an important policy instrument for ensuring satisfactory standards of thermal insulation and other energy performance features in new housing stock.</P>
    <P>Approximately half of the national housing stock, or some 800,000 units, was constructed before 1980 and without insulation originally. Today, however, on the basis of the substantial <Col N="1507"/>study conducted for the Irish National Survey of Housing Quality, it is estimated that significant upgrading of the older housing stock has occurred. It also estimated that the average annual rates of upgrading with new windows, wall insulation and roof insulation were 4.2%, 1% and 1.4% respectively. In 2002, across the housing stock as a whole, 76% had wall insulation and 82% had roof insulation of some kind.</P>
    <P>Other studies are providing important baseline information on the profile of energy consumption in the housing stock. Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has published a report &ldquo;Energy Consumption and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> Emissions in the Housing Sector&rdquo;. Such baseline information, while incomplete, is important in informing the assessment of the potential impact of insulation and other technical options for improving the housing stock. A further study commissioned by SEI on a sample of the Irish housing stock, to be published shortly, will give an indication of the actual improvements in energy performance of Irish housing over time arising from, amongst other items, progressive increases in thermal insulation standards at the time of construction.</P>
    <P>The Warmer Homes Scheme, which is part of Sustainable Energy Ireland&rsquo;s Low Income Housing Programme, aims to improve the energy efficiency and comfort conditions of homes occupied by low-income households and provides funding for the provision, by approved installers, of insulation and other energy efficiency measures in around 2,000 eligible homes each year.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Regarding the possibility of introducing a grant scheme for homeowners to subsidise insulation measures similar to the Greener Homes Scheme for renewable energy technologies, different circumstances apply. The Greener Homes Scheme is focused on achieving an early deployment of new, innovative and unfamiliar technologies in the housing sector with a view to stimulating the creation of a viable and active industry. In contrast, the thermal insulation industry is an established and mature sector. No studies specifically directed at the introduction of a grants scheme in this sector have been carried out in recent times.</P>
    <P>However, in the context of effective implementation of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, which includes the aim of stimulating investment by householders in upgrading the poorer performing segments of the housing stock, my Department, in conjunction with SEI will be examining options for maximising consumer response and financial and environmental benefits in this regard.</P>

    <P>The Department has general responsibility, in conjunction with other relevant Departments, for the development of an integrated coastal zone management strategy for Ireland.</P>
    <P>In May, 2002, a recommendation on integrated coastal zone management was adopted by the EU Council of Ministers for the Environment. This called on Member States, inter alia, to draw up a national strategy or strategies for integrated coastal zone management and established a number of broad principles on which such strategies should be based. The Department will continue to pursue the objective of developing a strategy for Ireland having regard to our overall priorities.

	<P>House of Tomorrow is a research, development and demonstration programme with a focus on stimulating widespread uptake of more sustainable energy planning, design, specification and construction practices in the Irish housing market. The aim is to develop capability in the building industry and create a growing network of visible model examples of such superior practices, so as to lever influence across the housing market as a whole.</P>
    <P>To date 84 demonstration projects, comprising 3,900 housing units across all counties, have been approved by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) for funding, as well as a further 23 projects in the fields of research, development, training and international collaboration. It is a condition of the programme that these demonstration projects show an improvement of at least 40% in thermal energy and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> performance standards relative to the Building Regulations 2002.</P>
    <P>SEI&rsquo;s experience with the programme, especially over the past year, shows a growing appetite and capacity in both the house building sector and local authorities to adopt and apply the standards set in this programme. The task of improving building standards is an evolving and progressive one and indeed, proven experience on House of Tomorrow schemes will itself help to drive regulatory change.</P>
    <P>The House of Tomorrow programme itself is subject to frequent review. Since its inception, the <Col N="1510"/>programme has been reviewed and modified three times, the most recent being in January of this year. A further review, taking account of the overall portfolio of approved projects, of experience with completed projects, and of regulatory and market developments, including energy prices, is planned over the next three months.</P>

    <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has published a study on the metering options for Small Scale Renewable electricity and Combined Heat &amp; Power Generation (CHP) in Ireland. The study identified a number of areas which require further analysis including the ability of such processes to secure adequate payment for their exports; connection standards and processes for smaller generators, and the implications of the single electricity market for small-scale electricity generation. SEI is commissioning work to address these issues in 2006 which will inform future policy decisions in this area.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
     <Quest>further to Parliamentary Question No. 368 of 8 November 2005, the position regarding his examination of all recommendations including those relevant to drift netting within the fish industry here made by the Salmon Commission in this regard.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I first announced in March last that I had decided to adopt the recommendations made to me by the National Salmon Commission in relation to the total allowable salmon catch for 2006. This will involve reductions in the quota available to both commercial fishermen and anglers in 2006. In doing so I also reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to fully align with the <Col N="1511"/>scientific advice provided on the management of the wild salmon fishery by 2007. Reductions in the overall fishing effort are required in order to sustain and rebuild salmon stocks nationwide.</P>
    <P>I have also amended the Conservation of Salmon and Sea Trout Bye-law (No. 797, 2004) to restrict the annual angling bag limit to 10 fish per angler for 2006. While the Salmon Commission had recommended a limit of 15 fish per angler, I believe the lower level to be necessary to contain the total harvest by anglers, given that there has been no appreciable reduction in the average angling catch over the past five years and in the interest of balanced treatment of all stakeholders. I have also introduced a new bye-law to provide for the introduction of compulsory catch and release from 1st September in 8 identified fishery districts that are not meeting conservation limits.</P>
    <P>I recognise the considerable efforts made by the commercial fishing industry over the past number of years to build a sustainable fishery and they have endured large cuts in the quotas available to them. I realise that these reductions have caused them difficulty and that full alignment with the scientific advice will likely compound these problems. For these reasons I decided to appoint an independent group to examine the implications of the new regulations for the commercial sector in 2007 and beyond and to make recommendations on the options available to address any financial hardship that may arise.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Group has engaged in appropriate consultation with relevant stakeholders and is expected to present its report to me in September 2006.</P>
    <P>I have also accepted the Salmon Commission&rsquo;s recommendation that measures should be considered to deal with the exploitation of multi-sea winter salmon stocks, including consideration of the length of the angling season. The fisheries managers, having considered the scientific advice, will identify appropriate measures in time for application in spring 2007. The scientists will also be asked to tender advice on the management of sea trout stocks over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The National Salmon Commission&rsquo;s Standing Scientific Committee has indicated that mixed stock fisheries pose particular threats to the status of individual stocks and that fisheries operated in estuaries and rivers are more likely to fulfil national requirements and international obligations.</P>
    <P>In line with this the National Fisheries Managers Executive and the Marine Institute have agreed an expansion of the ongoing Genetic Stock Identification (GSI) project during the coming salmon fishing season, in order to determine the tendency of certain identified inshore fisheries to impact on multiple stocks.</P>
    <P>It is important that decisions to close or to keep open individual inshore commercial fisheries on <Col N="1512"/>the basis of their propensity to capture multiple stocks, particularly stocks that are below conservation limits, would be made on the best available scientific information.</P>
    <P>If the results of genetic analysis show that some estuarine drift net fisheries exploit individual salmon stocks or salmon stocks from a number of rivers in home estuaries, these nets could continue to operate provided the rivers entering those estuaries were above conservation limits.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to undertake a study on the survival of salmon caught and released by different methods of capture in a number of Irish rivers again on the recommendation of the Salmon Commission. This information would be very valuable in providing confidence in the practice of catch and release in Irish rivers. The study will also be important in promoting a proper code of practice for catch and release. Catch and release of salmon by anglers in Ireland will, I understand, become increasingly important as a conservation measure in the coming years.</P>
    <P>These projects should yield important information about the commercial and recreational fishery to guide policy towards restoring salmon stocks in threatened catchments while permitting the harvest of salmon where stocks are abundant.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the independent regulator.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i> lists all service providers offering broadband services in all towns in South Tipperary, and gives contact details for each company, together with prices for the various service levels on offer.</P>
    <P>It has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband, so my Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high speed, open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>

    <P>Twenty-seven MANs are now completed, including Clonmel. The second phase of the programme involves the building of MANs in over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband offering from the private sector. South Tipperary County Council is developing projects in respect of the following towns: Cahir, Cashel, Tipperary and Carrick-on-Suir under Phase Two. The appointment of project managers and works contractors is expected towards the end of this year. Construction on these projects will commence in early <Col N="1514"/>2007, with an estimated completion date of quarter 3 2007.</P>
    <P Just="Left">My Department administers a group broadband scheme which delivers broadband to many underserved areas. Under the second phase of the scheme projects were approved for Fethard, Ardfinnan, Annacarthy, Ballingarry, Ballinure, Clerihan, Ballyneal, Ballypatrick, Ballyporeen, Boherlahan, Burncourt, Cappawhite, Clogheen, Clonoulty, Drangan, Dualla, Gortnahoo, Hollyford, Kilcash, Killenaule, Kilsheelan, Moyglass and Newcastle, South Co. Tipperary.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, a joint industry/Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the Broadband for Schools Programme, which should provide every school in the country with broadband in 2006. This is a crucial strand in the strategy of integrating ICT into teaching and learning, and my Department&rsquo;s wider vision of promoting the use of broadband technologies in local communities around the country. The installation phase is now almost complete, with over 90% of all schools broadband enabled.</P>

     <Quest>if he will provide funding for the redevelopment of Dunmore East Harbour which is expected to cost in the region of &euro;50 million; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>In November 2000 KPMG Consulting undertook a comprehensive technical and socioeconomic review of the infrastructure requirements at Dunmore East in association with Posford Duvivier on behalf of the Department.</P>
    <P>The review concluded that there was a significant need for development at the harbour. The main shortcomings identified in the review were the limited draft at the mouth of the harbour, the <Col N="1518"/>limited extent of the outer breakwater, the limited berthage and siltation difficulties.</P>
    <P>In 2003 Kirk McClure and Morton were appointed by the Department to carry out the preliminary design and an environmental impact assessment for a harbour development project at Dunmore East. They noted that the existing harbour at Dunmore East is currently too small to cater for the number and size of fishing vessels using it. This leads to congestion problems at busy periods when larger vessels can be berthed up to four abreast along the East Pier. The consultants noted that during the summer months smaller vessels can be berthed up to nine abreast along the pontoons at the southern end of the West Wharf. In addition, there is increased demand for sheltered mooring facilities for leisure craft in Dunmore East. The consultants concluded that the present harbour set-up doesn&rsquo;t permit development of this type and therefore is <Col N="1519"/>restricting development of the port and its facilities.</P>
    <P>Following a lengthy public consultation process in 2004 on development options for the harbour, a planning application for a harbour development together with an environmental impact statement were prepared and submitted to Waterford County Council. Planning permission for the development of the Fishery Harbour Centre was received in late 2005.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The cost of providing the new harbour facility is estimated at &euro;50 million. In 2006, &euro;300,000 is provided for further design and &euro;300,000 for site investigation to progress the development. A cost benefit analysis will also be carried out this year. A decision on funding of this project will be made in due course in accordance with the guidelines for Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals in the Public Sector taking into account the amount of funding made available for fishery harbours and overall national priorities.</P>

	<P>Under the Department&rsquo;s Fishery Harbours Development Programme for 2006 funding has been allocated to Mayo County Council for the projects listed below. Two of the projects are being co-funded with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and this Department under the CL&Aacute;R scheme. This scheme is to facilitate minor repairs and safety works on small piers, and slipways in CL&Aacute;R areas, including Gaeltacht areas and islands. The balance of the funding is being provided by Mayo County Council. The question of providing funding for projects in county Mayo in 2007 will be considered in the context of the amount of Exchequer funding available for works at fishery harbours generally and overall national priorities.</P><Col N="1521"/>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 303 and 307 together.</P>
    <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies <Col N="1522"/>operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the independent regulator.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i> lists all service providers offering broadband services in all towns in Mayo, and gives contact details for each company, together with prices for the various service levels on offer.</P>
    <P>It has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband, so my Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high speed, open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
    <P>Twenty-seven MANs are now completed, including Ballina and Kiltimagh. The second phase of the programme involves the building of MANs in over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband offering from the private sector. Mayo is developing detailed route designs in respect of the following towns: Claremorris, Knock and Ballinrobe. The appointment of project managers and works contractors is expected towards the end of this year. Construction on these projects will commence in early 2007, with an estimated completion date of quarter 3 2007.</P>
    <P Just="Left">My Department administers a group broadband scheme which delivers broadband to many underserved areas. Under the first phase of the scheme a project was approved for Clare Island, Inisturk, and Inisboffin, Co. Mayo. This scheme is now fully operational and providing a broadband service. Under the second phase of the scheme projects were approved for Clew Bay, Foxford, Ballyvary, Straide, Charlestown, Ballyhearne, Newport, Kilmeena, Glenhest, Crossmolina, Aghamore, Ballyhaunis, Tooreen, Balla, Kilkelly and Ardagh, Co. Mayo.</P>
    <P>The most recent call for proposals has now closed and I expect to launch further schemes of this nature shortly.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, a joint industry/Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the <Col N="1523"/>Broadband for Schools Programme, which should provide every school in the country with broadband in 2006. This is a crucial strand in the strategy of integrating ICT into teaching and learning, and my Department&rsquo;s wider vision of promoting the use of broadband technologies in local communities around the country. The installation phase is now almost complete, with over 90% of all schools broadband enabled.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his question No 270 of 20th June 2006, in which I referred to the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposal to introduce a regulation designed to assist in the recovery of the stock of European eel (Anguilla anguilla). The EU regulation will require the preparation of management plans for the recovery of eels in river basin districts as defined under the EU Water Framework Directive. It is too early to say what will be the precise content of such plans.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the genetic evidence available at this time suggests that all, or at least most, European eels belong to a single (panmictic) spawning stock, which means that international co-operation is essential if eel stocks are to be effectively managed. The drastically reduced numbers of juvenile eels reaching all western European coastal areas, following their larval trans-Atlantic migration from the Sargasso Sea spawning area, is well documented. Those that arrive in Ireland do so in the period from November to March. They arrive off the coast as a glass eel and subsequently migrate into fresh water between May and September as elver or slightly older bootlace eel.</P>
    <P>The EU Habitats Directive on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora and the Water Framework Directive establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy as transposed into Irish law are each intended, inter alia, to protect, conserve and enhance the aquatic environment where eels spend the significant part of their life cycle. The success of measures for the recovery of the European eel stock depends on close cooperation and coherent action at Community, Member State and local and regional level. Primary responsibility for the implementation of these directives in Ireland is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

	<P>As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply to his previous question in this matter <Col N="1525"/>(5591/05) it was necessary to put the revised proposals received from Waterford County Council for the storm water overflow pipe element of the overall scheme to public consultation and to have the submissions received, together with the County Council&rsquo;s responses to them, examined by the Department&rsquo;s Engineering Division. It was also necessary to put the matter before the Marine Licence Vetting Committee (MLVC), an expert group that advises me on proposals of this nature. As I previously indicated to the Deputy, the issues to be considered by the Committee in this case included possible impacts on fishing and fisheries, as well as possible implications for the navigation channel for the port of Waterford.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the MLVC has examined the issue thoroughly with particular reference to shellfish growing areas downstream from the overflow pipe, and that it has approved draft specific conditions for this revised scheme. These conditions have been notified to the Council.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 313 and 318 together.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a matter of high priority for Ireland, the EU and the United Nations. Since the 2002 Sun City peace accords, major strides have been made in re-establishing a democratic and effective system of government in the DRC. The Transitional National Government and Parliament have operated effectively since 2003. A new Constitution was approved by an overwhelmingly majority in a referendum held in December 2005 and was formally promulgated on 18 February 2006.</P>
    <P>Presidential and parliamentary elections are now scheduled to take place on 30 July 2006. These will be the first multi-party elections in the DRC in over forty years. A total of 33 candidates will contest the presidency while some 260 political parties and over 9,300 candidates will compete for the 500 legislative seats in the new parliament. Over 25 million people out of an estimated potential electorate of 28 million have registered to vote. Successfully conducted elections are absolutely critical to the consolidation of peace and security in the DRC and in the Great Lakes Region as a whole. It is essential that all parties in the DRC should respect the verdict of the Congolese people, when delivered on 30 July, and work together subsequently to further national reconciliation and build a more stable and prosperous country. The international community, including Ireland and its EU partners, is investing <Col N="1528"/>heavily in ensuring that the forthcoming elections are successful, given the major organisational challenge they represent for a country the size of western Europe with extremely poor basic infrastructure and ongoing security problems. The EU and its Member States alone are contributing some &euro;235 million towards the overall cost of the elections which are estimated at well over $300 million. The EU will also deploy a 250-strong electoral observation mission, including two observers from Ireland, to monitor the elections.</P>
    <P>Nationally, Ireland is also actively supporting the electoral process in the DRC. The Government has contributed a total of &euro;1.3 million in support of the DRC elections. The Government has also decided to provide five Permanent Defence Force personnel to serve with the EUFOR RDC mission which the EU is deploying, at UN request, to provide support, if required, to the UN MONUC peace-keeping mission during the electoral period. Ireland also provides three members of the PDF who serve with MONUC.</P>
    <P>The DRC will continue to face considerable challenges in the post-election period and it will be important for the international community to remain engaged in support. Greater progress needs to be made in tackling impunity and establishing an effective system of justice. The DRC government and its armed forces need to continue collaborating closely with MONUC in confronting and removing the threat posed by illegal armed militias in eastern DRC. Particular challenges will be security sector reform and completing the integration of national armed and police forces. The EU is already offering extensive support in this area though the EUSEC and EUPOL ESDP missions. The successful holding of the second Summit of the Great Lakes Conference, now provisionally scheduled for next December in Nairobi, would also help to underpin security in the DRC and throughout the region. A UN Security Council mission visited the DRC last month and raised some of these themes in its discussions with the DRC government and parties.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Up to five million people have died from the direct or indirect consequences of the conflict in DRC since 1998. There are over 1.6 million displaced persons in the country while 80% of the population live below the absolute poverty line. The UN has launched a 2006 Action Plan for the DRC that calls for &euro;570 million in funding for humanitarian programmes. Since 2002 the Government has contributed over &euro;11 million for emergency and recovery activities in the DRC, almost &euro;5 million of which has been provided to date in 2006. This funding is provided via Irish NGOs such as TROCAIRE and OXFAM Ireland and international organisations such as the UN World Food Programme (WFP), UNICEF and UNHCR, not directly to the Government of the DRC. Since Ireland recognises States, not Governments, the issue of with<Col N="1529"/>drawal of recognition from the Government of the DRC does not arise. Officials from my Department meet regularly with representatives from the Congolese community living in Ireland to brief them on Ireland&rsquo;s position in relation to the DRC.</P>

	<P>The Government is very concerned at the increasingly serious situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and especially at the prospect of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. We, and our EU partners, are firmly convinced that this crisis must be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy. The Government has been active in the EU and at the UN in the promotion of a peaceful outcome. Over the past week, we have also maintained direct contacts with the Israeli and Palestinian authorities, through our Embassy in Tel Aviv and the Representative Office in Ramallah, and through their diplomatic representatives in Dublin. We have conveyed the clear message that the kidnapped Israeli soldier should be released immediately and unconditionally, and that all parties should continue to use every diplomatic option to ensure there is no further escalation of the situation in the Occupied Territories. We have called for an end to all violence in the Occupied Territories, including the firing of rockets at Israeli territory. This message has also been conveyed by the EU, both publicly and in private.</P>
    <P>In appealing to all parties to act now with maximum restraint, the Government has expressed its serious concern at the effect of recent Israeli military actions on the already serious humanitarian situation of the Palestinian people, especially the destruction of essential infrastructure. We believe it is essential that the Israeli Government ensures that all military operations are fully in accordance with international law. We, and our EU partners, have also expressed our concern about the detention by the Israeli authorities of democratically-elected members of the Government of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Legislative Council. It remains the clear view of the EU that only a negotiated two-State solution can bring peace and security to the Israeli and the Palestinian people. It is now more important than ever that all parties demonstrate a genuine commitment to the search for such a solution, based on the principles set out in the Quartet Roadmap.</P>

    <P FLI="0" Just="Left">In percentage terms, this represents 3.91% and 4.99% of the total gross budget for Vote 28 in 2004 and 2005 respectively. Funding was provided to a range of non-governmental organisations or agencies under several programmes or initiatives &mdash; (1) the Department&rsquo;s Reconciliation Fund; (2) support for Irish emigrants abroad; (3) raising awareness of EU issues; (4) assistance given to human rights NGOs and to the Irish United Nations Association; (5) projects or actions that support Ireland&rsquo;s objectives under the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the EU; and (6) support for the Irish Cultural Centre, Paris. Details of the funding provided for each of the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 to date are outlined in the following Annexes 1-6. I hope the Deputy will appreciate that, given the depth and breadth of applications received, it is not possible to provide detailed information on the number of applications received and refused across all of the programmes mentioned above. However, all successful applicants were selected for support on the basis of their meeting the prescribed criteria of the specific programme or funding in question.</P>
    <P>Under Vote 29, Irish Aid, the government&rsquo;s official aid programme, funds a wide array of non governmental, civil society organisations, Irish and non-Irish, including missionaries in their development work. This work includes provision of basic needs, emergency assistance and the promotion of human rights and governance. The annual report for the aid programme in 2004 includes a full list of all organisations funded and the amounts involved. In 2004, NGO and civil society funding amounted to &euro;89.9 million or approximately 23% of the aid funding under the control of my Department.</P><Col N="1531"/>
    <P Just="Left">The Irish Aid annual report for 2005 will be published in due course and will include the full list of funded organisations. It is estimated that &euro;117million, 24.9% of the aid funding under the control of Irish Aid, was expended on NGOs in <Col N="1532"/>that year. In 2006 to date approximately &euro;94 million has been expended through NGOs. I have arranged for Irish Aid&rsquo;s 2004 Annual Report to be forwarded to the Deputy, as well as the 2005 Annual Report, when published.</P><Col N="1531"/>

	<P>On 18 December 2002, the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Draft Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT). Ireland, along with other EU partners, fully supported the draft Optional Protocol and worked for its adoption at the UN General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. The object of the Protocol is to establish a system of regular visits undertaken both by an independent international body and by national bodies to places of detention with a view to preventing torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The international body is to be a subcommittee of the UN Committee Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment. At the national level, States may maintain, designate or establish one or several bodies for the prevention of torture at the domestic level. As regards our signature of the Optional Protocol, with a view to subsequent ratification, the Minister for Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform informed the D&aacute;il on Tuesday, 8 November 2005 that he is reviewing national legislation to ascertain whether legislative <Col N="1556"/>changes would be required before signature and ratification of the Optional Protocol. I understand that he has commenced consultations with other Government Departments and Bodies, including the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science, in relation to arrangements for the inspection of institutions for which they are responsible.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of appropriate accountability mechanisms for the activities of the police and security services is of particular importance. Specifically in the context of the decision of the British Government to transfer primacy for national security matters in Northern Ireland to MI5 from 2007, the Government shares concerns that have been raised, including those recently expressed by the Oversight Commissioner for policing. In his latest report, the Oversight Commissioner confirmed that the primary institutions of policing &mdash; the Policing Board, the PSNI and the Police Ombudsman &mdash; have largely accomplished the implementation of Patten and have demonstrated their ability to fulfil their governance and accountability mandates. However, with regard to the envisaged primacy role of MI5, he expresses concern that this might diminish the robust accountability mechanisms currently in place and might affect the ability of the Police Service to combat organised crime effectively.</P><Col N="1557"/>
    <P>I raised this issue with the Secretary of State, Peter Hain MP at the meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in May. The British Government indicated that it is prepared to discuss further with the political parties in Northern Ireland and with the Irish Government the exact details of how the new arrangements will work in practice. Discussions have also taken place between my officials and their British counterparts with a view to ensuring that adequate accountability mechanisms remain in place, and that the Police Ombudsman continues to have jurisdiction over the actions of police officers seconded to MI5. Protocols are currently being agreed between the office of the Ombudsman and the security service to facilitate this. In the context of the current political process, the two Governments are making every possible effort to ensure the restoration of devolved institutions to Northern Ireland by 24 November. The Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair jointly set out a detailed programme of work to this end on 29 June, including provision for discussions with the parties on support for, and devolution of, policing. This will be an important opportunity for the political parties in Northern Ireland to raise their concerns on the issue of MI5 primacy and appropriate accountability mechanisms. With regard to the person mentioned, the PSNI have stated that they will begin proceedings to request his extradition from the United States.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I refer the Deputy to my replies of 30 May, 14 June and 29 June 2006 to Questions on this matter. I remain concerned about this case, which has been raised with the Israeli authorities by our Embassy in Tel Aviv. The Embassy is continuing to monitor the situation closely, in co-operation with the Embassies of other EU Member States. The person concerned was arrested on 23 May 2005, and on 16 June 2005 the Israeli authorities ordered his administrative detention for six months. This order was renewed for a further six months in November, but reduced to four months on review in December 2005. On 20 March 2006, the detention was renewed until 20 July. An appeal against the renewal was turned down on 10 May. I understand that the final stage of this appeal process is being heard by the Israeli High Court today. The Government, and our EU partners, have serious concerns about the practice of administrative <Col N="1558"/>detention in Israel and the Occupied Territories. We are working to ensure that they are addressed in the EU&rsquo;s continuing political dialogue with Israel. Most recently, our concerns about administrative detention were raised at the meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council which took place in Luxembourg on 13 June. In direct contacts with Israel, and in co-operation with its EU partners, the Government continues to raise its concerns about the human rights implications of Israeli security policies and the need to ensure full compliance with international law.</P>

	<P>Four bodies come under the aegis of this Department. Two of these, namely, the Advisory Board for Irish Aid and the Development Education Advisory Committee are funded under Vote 29 (International Cooperation) as part of the Irish Aid Programme. In 2006, their budget allocations are &euro;1.2million and &euro;25,000 respectively. The D&iacute;on Committee is an advisory committee to the Irish Government on the welfare of Irish people in Britain. With the exception of the Chair and Secretary, who are serving in the Embassy of Ireland in London, the Committee members serve in a voluntary capacity. While there is no specific budgetary allocation for the D&iacute;on Committee, the Department of Foreign Affairs covers the administration expenses that arise from the Committee&rsquo;s activities, including the travel and accommodation costs of Committee members.</P>
    <P>The Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange (Fulbright Commission) is a statutory body established under the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1991. Under the Programme, awards are made annually, through open competition, to post-graduate students and post-doctoral scholars and to established leaders of professional, academic and artistic excellence who are recognised in their fields. The Irish and US governments both financially contribute to the operation of the Fulbright Commission. This year&rsquo;s grant-in-aid to the Commission is &euro;254,000 and is funded under Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs).</P>

	<P>During the period in question, two task forces were created to inform specific areas of the work of this Department. Both have since completed their work and reported back to the Department. In December 2002, the then Minister of State, Mr. Tom Kitt, set up a Task Force on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to provide advice regarding how best to integrate ICT across the Irish Aid programme. The Task Force comprised twenty representatives from the private sector, academia, development NGOs, Enterprise Ireland and the Departments of the Taoiseach, Communications and Foreign Affairs. Mr. Aidan Eames was appointed as its chair. The Task Force met seven times and had additional meetings with representatives of the private sector, NGOs and Civil Society. Members of the Task Force undertook familiarisation visits to Uganda and Tanzania and to the World Bank in Washington. The Task Force presented its report in December 2003. A number of ICT activities are now being funded by Irish Aid, and ICT and development will also be reflected in the forthcoming White Paper on development cooperation.</P>
    <P>The Task Force on Policy regarding Emigrants was established by my predecessor in December 2001 to recommend a coherent long-term policy approach to meeting the needs of Irish emigrants. Its terms of reference required that special consideration be given to pre-departure services, services for emigrants abroad and services for emigrants considering returning to Ireland. Particular emphasis was placed on addressing the needs of vulnerable emigrants. The Task Force operated from December 2001 until it presented its Report &mdash; &lsquo;Ireland and the Irish Abroad&rsquo; &mdash; to my predecessor in August 2002. Since then, significant progress has been made on initiatives which benefit our Irish community abroad.

    <P>My Department is aware of two Irish nationals awaiting deportation from the United States. These people are currently being held by the US authorities and are being provided with consular assistance by the Consulates in New York and San Francisco. The US Department of Homeland Security advises that there were 446 Irish nationals deported from the United States between 1997 and 2005. Of these, 302 are, we believe, likely to have arisen from immigration offences. To date in 2006 the Department is aware of 16 Irish nationals who have been deported from the US. I would like to stress that there is no evidence of any particular targeting of the Irish undocumented in the US. I should also <Col N="1561"/>emphasise that the Embassy in Washington and our network of Consulates are, of course, available to offer assistance in all consular cases.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my answer given on Thursday 29 June 2006 regarding the African Union (AU) initiative on political dialogue with Zimbabwe. Since then, I understand that former President Mkapa of Tanzania has been appointed mediator. The Zimbabwean Government failed to co-operate with President Chissano&rsquo;s efforts and, in 2005, refused even to facilitate a visit by Mr. Tom<?oasys _jy ?>Nyanduga, an earlier appointee to the post. This attitude is highly regrettable. Nonetheless, I fervently hope that this new attempt will yield positive results. I note that UN Secretary General Annan met with President Mugabe on the occasion of the AU summit in Banjul, The Gambia on 1-2 July. They agreed that President Mkapa should be given time and space to do his work. The Government, with our EU partners, will continue to work with all those in the international community seeking to promote democratic change in Zimbabwe. I would encourage the AU and its member States to continue to use what influence they have to urge the Zimbabwean government to alter its current failed policies and move to a path of internal dialogue and peaceful, democratic change in Zimbabwe. Senior officials from my Department availed of recent political consultations with South Africa in Pretoria on 22-23 June to outline the serious concerns which we have regarding Zimbabwe.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Ireland has committed approximately &euro;16 million in aid to Zimbabwe since 2002. Despite the difficult operating environment, we will continue to deliver assistance directly to those most in need, through a broad range of civil and aid organisations. I also welcome the increased engagement by the UN Security Council and the efforts of Secretary General Annan and his <Col N="1562"/>Humanitarian Co-ordinator, Jan Egeland, to highlight the serious humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe. Funding support of &euro;11,527,000 has been provided for humanitarian operations in Zimbabwe since 2002. This funding has been provided to a number of Non-Governmental Organisations, including Concern, Goal and Tr&oacute;caire, as well as United Nations organisations working to alleviate humanitarian suffering in that country. Zimbabwe is also one of the countries most affected by HIV/Aids with an estimated 25% of the population infected. Life expectancy has fallen below 40. Since 2002 Ireland has provided &euro;4.5 million to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, through partnerships with aid agencies and civil society organisations.</P>

    <P FLI="0">Advertising undertaken by this Department typically includes advisory notices on public opening hours over holiday periods, changes in passport application procedures and fees, employment opportunities that arise in the Department from time to time, as well as public information notices relating to developments in the European Union or in regard to Ireland&rsquo;s official Development Aid Programme. The Department uses a wide range of national newspapers, both daily and Sunday publications. The choice of particular newspapers to be selected on each occasion is dependent on a number of factors, including the specific context and subject matter, the target audience and, of course, value for money considerations. The placing of official notices and Departmental advertisements is the subject of tender arrangements organised for all Government Departments by the Government Supplies Agency. The firm which holds the current contract is Brindley Advertising Ltd.</P>
    <P>From 2003 to date, the Department has produced or contributed to the production of several videos, television programmes and DVDs for the purpose of informing and educating citizens about overseas development assistance and about the European Union. Details of the various productions are as follows:</P>
    <P el="10"><i>The European Union</i></P>
    <P>The Communicating Europe Initiative (CEI) funded the production of one media series and a number of DVDs/Videos in 2003 and 2004. All of these were produced with the intention of informing viewers about the nature and role of the European Union. In 2004, the CEI allocated &euro;21,725.66 to the National Forum on Europe for the development of a DVD entitled &ldquo;Towards a Constitution for Europe&rdquo;. It also provided &euro;19,374.15 as part-funding for the production of a DVD entitled &ldquo;The Day of Welcomes&rdquo; containing highlights of the ceremonies marking the enlargement of the EU at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in on 1 May 2004. In 2003, the CEI provided &euro;23,493.54 towards the production costs of the National Forum on Europe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Journey of Discovery&rdquo; educational video which examined EU enlargement, the institutional make-up of the EU and the debate on the future of Europe. In addition, the CEI provided funding of &euro;86,999 towards the production of &ldquo;Europe &mdash; How are You?&rdquo;, a TV series which addressed enlargement, EU institutions and the debate on the future of Europe. VHS copies of these programmes were circulated to every secondary school in the country.</P>
   <P el="10"><i>Overseas Development Assistance</i></P>
    <P>Irish Aid has co-funded two TV documentary series entitled Far Away Up Close, which were broadcast on RTE in 2005 and 2006 respectively. The programmes, produced independently by Animo Television, were designed to give Irish <Col N="1564"/>people an introduction to how their tax money is being spent on development programmes around the world. They looked at Irish Aid programmes in the areas of HIV/AIDS, recovery assistance after conflicts, food security and support for civil society. To accompany the series, there was a dedicated website with further information on the topics and themes covered in the TV programmes. The cost of the programmes was &euro;311,711 in 2004 and &euro;293,367 in 2005.</P>
     <P el="10"><i>White Paper Promotional Video Presentation</i></P>
    <P>As part of the preparation of the Government White Paper on Irish Aid, a series of public meetings were held around the country during the second half of 2005. A short video presentation was prepared and shown at the beginning of each of the meetings. The video was produced by Animo Television using footage from the Far Away Up Close programmes and cost &euro;20,146.</P>
   <P el="10"><i>Simon Cumbers Media Challenge Fund</i></P>
    <P>The purpose of the Simon Cumbers Media Challenge Fund (named after Simon Cumbers who was tragically shot while filming for the BBC in Saudi Arabia in June 2004) is to financially assist journalists, media organisations and development practitioners in producing feature media pieces on themes relating to international development.</P>
    <P>Over the last three years, the funding awarded was as follows:</P>
    <P LI="1">2003 &euro;130,170</P>
    <P LI="1">2004 &euro;193,360</P>
    <P LI="1">2005 &euro;121,604</P>
    <P el="10"><i>Development Education</i></P>
    <P>The Development Education Grants scheme provides funding, in two annual rounds, to approximately 70 organisations working in education. Development education activities funded under the grant scheme include, on occasions, the production of audio visual material of a general development nature. An annual budget of &euro;4.54 million has been allocated for Development Education in 2006. Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that, in addition to visual media productions, the Department has for many years supported the Worlds Apart documentary series on RTE radio which covers the issues and challenges facing developing countries.</P>

However, officials in my Department recently met with the person to discuss his case and to offer him every possible consular assistance. The person, who previously resided in the United States, has stated that he is on hunger strike in protest at his perceived victimisation by the US justice system. Following from this meeting and at the person&rsquo;s request, officials from my Department contacted the US authorities to ascertain what, if anything, could be done to assist this person. We await a response from the US authorities. I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to do everything possible to assist this person.</P>

	<P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis. 1,338 applications for funding under the 2006 were received by my Department, including one from the organisation in question. All were evaluated against the programme&rsquo;s assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. Following this assessment, the organisation in question was unsuccessful and this decision together with a copy of the assessment conducted on the application, was conveyed by my Department to the organisation in a letter dated 13 June 2006. I intend to advertise the Sports Capital Programme for 2007 later this year and it will be open to the club in question to re-apply if they so wish.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My Department is responsible for the administration of three major grant programmes &mdash; the Sports Capital Programme, the Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Scheme (ACCESS) and the Local Authority Swimming Pools Programme. Of these the first two programmes attract a significant number of applications from non-governmental agencies and organisations. All unsuccessful applicants receive a letter of notification from the Department. In addition, my Department makes allocations to projects of strategic importance to non-governmental agencies and organisations in the sports, arts and culture sectors. The following tables contains details of the non-governmental agencies and organisations to which my Department has provided funding from 2004 to date. Details of the bodies that receive allocations under the Sports Capital Programme are available on the Department&rsquo;s website. In relation to grants provided to other major sporting bodies, in 2006 I have made an allocation of &euro;65,000 to the IRFU for completion of works on Lansdowne Road due to fire damage. In 2005 I allocated funding to some of the National Governing Bodies in respect of their equipment requirements, to a range of regional and national projects as well as additional funding to a number of projects previously allocated funding that year, as follows: Pearse Stadium &euro;1.5m; Limerick Gaelic Grounds &euro;1m; Salthill Devon FC &euro;1m; DCC &mdash; Irishtown Stadium &euro;930,000; An R&iacute;ocht A.C. &euro;625,000; Irish Amateur Boxing Association &mdash; National Stadium &euro;500,000; Basketball Ireland &euro;500,000; Markievicz Park, Sligo &euro;400,000; Bunclody AFC &euro;400,000; Tennis Ireland &mdash; National Development Centre &euro;330,000; Athletic Association of Ireland &euro;209,278; Ennis Town Council Lees Road Centre &euro;200,000; Duneske Leisure Centre, Cahir &euro;200,000; Football Association of Ireland &euro;150,000; Irish Amateur Rowing Union &euro;125,141; Mayo Association Football League &euro;100,000. An allocation of &euro;85,000 was also made to the FAI in respect of development works at Derry City FC. In 2004, I made allocations of &euro;100,000 towards development at Mosney for the Community Games and of &euro;650,000 to the Olympic <Col N="1567"/>Council of Ireland towards the provision of a new headquarters. I also allocated &euro;33,014 as an <Col N="1568"/>additional allocation to the NUIG Galway Regional Sports Centre.</P><Col N="1567"/>

	<P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme allocates funding to sporting and to voluntary and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis. All applications received under the programme are assessed on an individual basis by my Department in accordance with a detailed set of assessment criteria as specified in the guidelines, terms and conditions that accompany the application form for the programme. The assessment process takes into account factors such as the existing level of facilities in an area, the number and quality of the applications received, the amount of funding being sought by each applicant and the strategic positioning of major facilities that may be required as well as the most recent Census of Population figures. Every effort is made to achieve a balanced geographical spread of funds throughout the country, while also affording priority to projects in areas of social and economic disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In relation to the 2006 sports capital programme, a total of 1,338 applications were received nationally, of which 1,211 were for projects classified as local and 127 as non-local, that <Col N="1570"/>is, projects which were categorised as national, regional or municipal and multi-sport. I recently announced provisional grant allocations under the 2006 Programme in relation to the local applications totalling &euro;53.745 million to 719 projects and I will be announcing the provisional allocations for the non-local projects in the near future, for which five applications were received from Kildare. Of twenty-eight applications from County Kildare for local projects this year, seventeen were provisionally allocated funding totalling &euro;1.41 million. My Department has written to the remaining eleven applicants enclosing a copy of their assessment and explaining why they were unsuccessful on this occasion, in order to assist with any future applications which they might submit. Ten of these applicants failed to meet basic minimum qualifying conditions as outlined on the application form and the guidelines, terms and conditions of the Programme.</P>
    <P>There was a significant reduction in the number of applications from Kildare this year, which was down 25% on the number in each of three previous years, 2003, 2004 and 2005. The Deputy will appreciate that the Programme can only respond to the applications received from any particular county in any particular year. A reduced number of applications, taken with the quality of those applications and the scale of the projects which apply, affects the overall level of funding allocated to a county. Nevertheless, I should point out to the Deputy that sports capital funding to County Kildare amounts to &euro;59 per capita since 2003 and the national average over that time is &euro;60 per capita. Indeed, since 1998 a total of over &euro;23.4 million in sports capital funding has been allocated to County Kildare. This means that the county, currently with 4.19% of the population, has been allocated 5.22% of the <Col N="1571"/>total national funding since 1998. I am satisfied that County Kildare has been treated more than fairly in the administration of the Sports Capital Programme and I believe that the Deputy will agree with me that the funding provided has made a major difference to the range and quality of the sports facilities available throughout the county.</P>

	<P>The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations and, in certain circumstances, schools and colleges, throughout the country. Projects must be of a capital nature and be directly related to the provision of sporting and physical recreation facilities.</P>
    <P>Applications to the programme from primary and post-primary schools and colleges must be made jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must as a minimum demonstrate that the local community will have significant access to the proposed facility when it is not being used by the school or college itself. In this regard, the significant access is a requirement for a minimum of at least 30 hours a week throughout the year.</P>
    <P>Under the 2006 sports capital programme, some 30 applications involving schools were received and following consultation with the Department of Education and Science, grants totalling &euro;1.4 million have been allocated in respect of 12 of these projects. My Department has commenced work on the development of a sports facilities strategy that will advocate a planned approach to the provision of sports facilities at both local and national level. An inter-agency steering group has been established to oversee this work. It includes representation from the Department of Education &amp; Science. One of the key areas being examined as part of this strategy is community access to school facilities. This relates to both optimising usage by local communities of existing school facilities outside school hours and how this Department might provide funding to planned sports halls in schools to enhance the facilities where necessary to facilitate a wide range of sports.</P>
    <P>However there are clearly genuine concerns within schools relating to issues such as security, insurance and running costs which can be barriers to facilitating community access which will need to be addressed. Where schools benefit from <Col N="1572"/>funding to enhance their facilities on the basis of the wider benefit to the local community, there needs to be a mechanism to ensure that this access is provided and maintained into the future. It is expected that work on this strategy will be completed later this year.</P>

	<P>The ACCESS Scheme, which ran from 2001, allocated capital grants of &euro;45.71m for the development of 44 arts and cultural facilities around the country. ACCESS was a follow on to the CDIS programme that ran from 1994 to 1999 and under which some &euro;26 million was allocated to 38 projects. In the coming weeks I will announce details of a scheme to succeed ACCESS. Once details are announced, applications will be invited by public advertisement. Applications, including any received from community-based theatres, will be considered on their merits in line with Guidelines which will be published in advance. &ldquo;Revenue&rdquo; or current support for arts venues is a matter for the Arts Council.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 336 and 344 together.</P>
    <P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, is the primary means of providing capital funding for sports facilities to clubs and voluntary and community organisations in every county throughout the country. The Programme is advertised on an annual basis. Since 1998, the Government has provided unprecedented levels of capital funding for sporting infrastructure throughout the country, a total of &euro;448.56 million has been <Col N="1573"/>allocated to 5,642 projects developed by sporting and community organisations. In 2005, almost &euro;63.24 million in sports capital funding was allocated to 644 projects. Of this amount, &euro;14.95 million has been drawn down to date. I recently announced the allocation of &euro;53.745 million to 719 projects categorised as local under the 2006 Sports Capital Programme. I will be making a further announcement of allocations under the 2006 Programme to projects categorised as national, regional and municipal/multi-sport in due course. The Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which is also administered by my Department, provides grant aid towards the capital costs of a new swimming pool, a replacement pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool. While my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual capital envelope has been approved for the period 2006-2010, individual subhead allocations have been agreed in respect of 2006 only. Pending final agreement of the 2007 provision, I am not yet in a position to state how much funding will be available for allocation under the above capital programmes in 2007. A total of &euro;67.724 million has been provided towards payments for sports capital grants and &euro;32.3 million for local authority swimming pool grants in my Department&rsquo;s 2006 Estimates.</P>

	<P>Campus and Stadium Ireland <Col N="1575"/>Development Limited, the company charged with developing the Sports Campus project, have drawn up a detailed proposal for the development of the sports campus at Abbotstown in a series of phases. Planning work for Phase One of the Development Control Plan is already underway and will provide a National Field Sports training centre, catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey; a National Indoor Training Centre which will provide world class training facilities for over 30 Governing Bodies of Sport; accommodation for sports men and women; sports science and medical facilities; all-weather synthetic pitches for community use; and renovation of existing buildings to cater for needs identified by sports bodies. Funds for the delivery of the project have been provided in my Department&rsquo;s capital envelope for 2006-2010. The estimated cost of the project is &euro;119m with a 4 to 5-year delivery schedule (2006 to 2010). An amount of &euro;9.5m has been provided in the Vote of my Department for work on the project during 2006. The National Aquatic Centre, the first facility developed on this site, was completed in 2003 at a capital cost of &euro;71m.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for marketing the island of Ireland overseas as a tourism destination rests with Tourism Ireland Limited. Tourism Ireland is a North-South body, established under the Good Friday Agreement. It is jointly funded by the Irish and British Exchequers &mdash; to the sum of &euro;64m this year. Significant additional resources were secured for Tourism Ireland in 2005 and again this year, to improve the effectiveness of its marketing programmes overseas. In particular, these resources enabled the company to undertake extensive research, in consultation with the trade and industry, aimed at reviewing the effec<Col N="1576"/>tiveness of the destination brand &mdash; Tourism Brand Ireland &mdash; the suite of communication and marketing materials which underpin its destination campaigns in overseas markets. In December 2005, I launched a new, three-year, &euro;50m global destination campaign for Tourism Ireland which reflects Ireland&rsquo;s core strengths. It also responds to a clearly identified need among potential visitors for more information about what a holiday in Ireland might involve. This campaign has been rolled out in key markets and the initial feedback has been positive. In terms of the overall performance of the sector, 2005 figures show overseas visitor numbers increased by 6% to almost 7 million and a significant rise in revenue &mdash; up almost 8% to &euro;3.455 billion, excluding carrier receipts. On both counts, the 2005 targets were exceeded. Against a backdrop of intense global competition and constantly evolving consumer preferences, these results represent a good performance by the sector and underline the significant return which Tourism Ireland achieves from its investment in overseas marketing.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The targets set for 2006 are to grow overall visitor numbers by 4.9% and revenue by 6.7%. The latest overseas visitor data from the CSO cover the first four months of 2006. This shows that the number of overseas visitors to Ireland increased by 12.7% in the year to April &mdash; well ahead of target. This strong level of growth was spread across the main markets, with Britain up 12%, Europe up over 20%, North America up almost 2% with &ldquo;Other&rdquo; markets up over 3%. While the experience of various international shocks in recent years teaches us to be prudent in our expectations and the most recent data only relate to the early part of the season, I note that the trade, in general, is looking forward to the remainder of the year with a stronger sense of optimism than for some years past.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including foreign workers. The Inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to foreign workers in exactly the same manner as they do to other Irish workers. Accordingly, the Labour Inspectorate does not record its cases in a format that would facilitate the statistics requested.</P>
    <P>For the avoidance of doubt Section 20 of the Protection of Employee&rsquo;s (Part-Time) Work Act, 2001 provides that all employee protection legislation on the Statute Book in Ireland applies to workers posted to work in Ireland in line with Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 16 December 1996.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the 2001 Act also provides that all employee protection legislation applies to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence, who has entered into a contract of employment that provides for his or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a contract of employment. Thus all Employment Rights Legislation applies to migrant workers engaged to work in Ireland under a contract of employment.</P>
    <P>In instances where foreign workers are paid less than Irish workers for comparable work and there are no other relevant differentiating features, it may be appropriate to refer the matter to the Equality Authority for consideration under Equality Legislation.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Currently, the level of Irish trade with Ukraine is relatively small. Irish exports to Ukraine were only &euro;23.7m in 2005, however this was an increase of 49% on 2004 figures. At the same time, Ukrainian exports to Ireland increased by 161% to &euro;8.6m between 2004 and 2005.</P>
    <P>Despite the low level of trade, Enterprise Ireland has, on average, personnel &ldquo;in-market&rdquo; in Ukraine every five to six weeks to support the endeavours of Irish companies seeking to establish a foothold in that country. This approach builds on an awareness raising seminar on the Ukraine market, held in Dublin in June 2005, and culminated in my leading Ireland&rsquo;s first ever Trade Mission to Ukraine last month. This Trade Mission attracted 21 Irish companies and organisations and resulted in over 100 buyer and partner meetings brokered by Enterprise Ireland with Ukrainian counterparts.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland has, over the past 18 months, built up a substantial network of Ukrainian contacts and support resources, and has focused its efforts on sectors such as IT and Telecoms, Financial Services and Banking Systems, Education, Medical Devices and Agricultural Machinery, which have been identified as markets likely to generate the most opportunities in the short to medium term for Irish industry. Linkages have been developed with local trade and business associations and with private contractors, to provide logistic support for Enterprise Ireland clients when they visit the Ukrainian market. Enterprise Ireland has also recently launched a Russian language website to promote Irish indigenous industry and the Irish economy in the former Soviet Union, and it is readily accessible as a valuable information resource for the large section of the Ukrainian population who are native and second language Russian speakers. In addition, I am aware that a number of private Irish companies and organisations are actively promoting Ukraine for production and manufacturing relocation purposes, which, though outside the remit of Enterprise Ireland, is another indicator of increased Irish Ukrainian economic interaction.</P>
    <P>Aside from Enterprise Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) has established a relationship with the State Committee of Ukraine for Technical Regulation and Consumer Policy (DSSU), and are expected to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the DSSU later this year, in the field of Standardisation, Conformity Assessment and Metrology.</P>
    <P>Irish investment in Ukraine increased significantly in 2006, with a number of high profile transactions that will further increase Irish confi<Col N="1586"/>dence in the Ukrainian market. Discussions have been ongoing for some time to conclude a Double Taxation Agreement, which would significantly reduce the barriers to international business and trade between Ireland and the Ukraine.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, aware of and support the efforts of the Ireland/Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group in fostering and developing better political, social and business ties between Ukraine and Ireland. The activities of this group in encouraging closer links with Ukraine are very welcome.</P>

	<P>I understand from the most recent statistics available from the Central Statistics Office that there are 253,800 people employed in the construction industry. I do not have details according to work category within the sector.</P>
    <P>The assignment of previously announced additional Labour Inspectors was completed in November 2005. That brought the complement of serving Inspectors to 31 Officers. The current complement of inspectors provides for a ratio of one inspector for each 8,200 workers in the construction industry. However, the Deputy will be aware that Labour Inspectors carry out their duties in all sectors of the economy. A major package of measures has been agreed by the parties at the recent Partnership negotiations, including the establishment of a new, statutory Office dedicated to employment rights compliance and a trebling in the number of Labour Inspectors.</P>
    <P>The primary function of the Labour Inspectorate is to seek compliance and rectification of any breaches identified, including payment of any arrears due to employees. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and seek redress for the individual/s concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Successful prosecution <Col N="1588"/>can be dependent on adequate support from witnesses. In the past two years one employer in the construction sector was prosecuted for a breach of Employment Rights legislation. I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that there are approximately 85,000 sub-contractors currently operating in the construction industry.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of job creation in North Tipperary is a day-to-day issue for the enterprise development agencies of my Department, namely IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and the North Tipperary County Enterprise Board and is one in which I have no direct function.</P><Col N="1589"/>
    <P>IDA Midwest region consists of Counties Clare, Limerick, North Tipperary and North Kerry. The attractiveness of North Tipperary for inward investment has to be seen within a regional context, and particularly by reference to Shannon airport, its proximity to Limerick and Cork and to its location along the corridors of Limerick/Dublin and Cork/Dublin. The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) provides a framework for the achievement of this goal. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s regional strategy reflects the NSS, with an emphasis on the gateway and hub locations. In addition IDA actively promotes the County town of Thurles. IDA is committed to the development of North Tipperary and is actively promoting the County for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), as part of an integrated Mid West region. IDA has six supported companies in North Tipperary, employing 717 in December 2005.</P>
    <P>In moving North Tipperary to a more knowledge based economy, IDA Ireland is partnering with educational institutions in the region, in particular University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology and Tipperary Institute, in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment particularly in added value activities, such as R&amp;D, corporate services, shared services, supply chain management, treasury management, etc.</P>
    <P>Both IDA Ireland and Shannon Development are members of the Thurles Marketing Group which was established in 2002 with a view to developing a pilot marketing initiative in North Tipperary as part of the implementation of the County Economic and Cultural Strategy 2002-2012. The focus of the marketing initiative is &ldquo;to promote Thurles as a location for business investment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Initiatives undertaken by Shannon Development include the development of the Tipperary Technology Park in Thurles, one of a network of five such Parks in the region. There are currently four businesses operating out of the Park in areas such as Software Development, Marketing, IT and Health &amp; Safety. Shannon Development and North Tipperary Enterprise Board also operate offices in the Park. Three further companies occupy the larger expansion spaces on the park. From a base of zero in 2002 there are currently over 80 people employed on site across 8 companies. In addition Shannon Development continues to support the existing industrial base in Thurles.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development has a 51 acre Business Park in Lisboney, Nenagh and the Company is marketing this as an attractive investment location and demand for sites is buoyant. The private sector is also responding to the increasing demand and currently a 30,000 sq.ft. Advanced Technology Unit is under construction at Stereame, Nenagh. This development was promoted and encouraged by Shannon Development and was supported under the BES scheme. This <Col N="1590"/>facility (due for completion this month) will add to the attractiveness of the town as an investment location.</P>
    <P>The Company is also working to ensure that North Tipperary has a world-class telecommunications infrastructure. This initiative is promoted by Shannon Broadband, a Shannon Development initiative established in partnership with the Local Authorities in the region.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Tipperary North County Enterprise Board (CEB) was set up in 1993 as a source of support for the micro-businesses sector. The role of the Board is to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and an enterprise culture in North Tipperary. This is done through both direct financial assistance and non-financial assistance. Subject to certain eligibility criteria enterprises may qualify for support in the form of feasibility, employment and capital grants while there is also a broad range of non-financial supports available such as mentoring, business advice and management development and training. While such non-financial supports may not directly generate jobs in an enterprise they contribute positively to the wider objective of building an enterprise culture which, in time, can result in job creation without direct financial assistance from the State. Employment in the enterprise development agencies in North Tipperary for each year since 2002 is set out in the following table. IDA Ireland and Tipperary North County Enterprise Board do not break down employment figures by location.</P>

	<P>The assignment of previously announced additional Labour Inspectors was completed in November 2005. That brought the complement of serving Inspectors to 31 Officers. The increase in staffing represents almost a doubling of the number of Labour Inspectors in the last 2 years.</P>
    <P>A major package of measures has been agreed by the parties at the recent Partnership negotiations, including the establishment of a new, statutory Office dedicated to employment rights compliance; a trebling in the number of Labour Inspectors; greater coordination among organisations concerned with compliance; new requirements in respect of record keeping; enhanced employment rights awareness activity; the introduction of a new and more user friendly system of employment rights compliance; increased resourcing of the system; and higher penalties for non-compliance with employment law.</P>
    <P>As agreed in the Partnership negotiations, the number of Labour Inspectors will be progressively increased from 31 to 90 by end-2007, as part of an initiative to increase the staffing resources of the Employment Rights Bodies generally. Inspectors will be specially selected and trained and will be deployed on a regionalised basis. In addition, the new Office will be provided with legal, accounting and other administrative support to ensure its effective functioning.</P>

	<P>The Work Permit section of my Department took a decision to refuse this application on the basis that it is not for a highly paid or highly skilled job. Since the accession of the 10 new member states employers should look to the wider EU in the first instance to source labour needs that are not highly skilled or highly paid. The Work Permit Section is in a position to consider issuing a work permit in respect of this individual under the new Spousal Work Permit Scheme. An official from the work permit section <Col N="1592"/>has written to the employer seeking additional information for the application to be processed.</P>

	<P>Primary responsibility for policy in relation to equal pay is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Addressing the factors behind the gender pay gap is, however, a multi-faceted task involving a number of Government Departments. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment undertakes the following actions.</P>
    <P>The National Framework Committee on Work/Life Balance Policies, which is chaired by the Department, undertakes a range of activities to raise awareness and encourage the provision of work/life balance arrangements at the level of the enterprise. The committee&rsquo;s activities include the provision of financial assistance to organisations, information dissemination activities, seminars, and research activities.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the national minimum wage has also had an impact in addressing the gender pay gap. In this regard, I accepted the Labour Court recommendation and increased the minimum wage to &euro;7.65 per hour with effect from 1 May 2005. Furthermore, the new Social Partnership agreement provides for a further adjustment to the minimum wage with effect from 1 January, 2007.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Expanding the Workforce&rdquo;, which is run by F&Aacute;S, is aimed at proactively encouraging women to return to work. The initiative facilitates women returnees by ensuring that training is provided in a flexible manner and is tailored to meet business requirements and skills needs of employers.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions and Enterprise Ireland has responsibility <Col N="1593"/>for the development of indigenous industry. Both Agencies work in close co-operation with one another and are actively working with a range of other bodies, including county development boards, private developers, educational institutes and F&Aacute;S towards maximising the potential of individual areas and counties for new investment and expansion projects.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is acutely aware that overseas investors not alone bring high wage jobs to individual regions and areas but also have knock-on benefits in other sectors such as supply, distribution and transport, thus creating further investment/employment opportunities for local people in the immediate vicinity and surrounding areas.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The availability of indigenous support services capable of sustaining their investment is an important issue for overseas investors, with potential investors regularly inquiring about the availability of indigenous services that are international in focus. In this context it is also an important ingredient for IDA Ireland in both marketing sites at local level for new investment or presenting a case to existing investors for expansion projects.</P>
    <P>While it would not be appropriate for IDA Ireland to engage in marketing an individual company&rsquo;s products or services, the Agency can and does make overseas investors aware of the availability of products and services that may be of interest or necessary to sustain the potential investment and where the investor so requests IDA Ireland can also facilitate introductions. Ultimately it is the investor who decides on where to locate, including where to visit as a potential location and what services or products he or she wishes to source locally to support the enterprise.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are currently in discussion on the issue of allowing each other preferential access to each other&rsquo;s company information systems. This will facilitate development of a more effective ability to identify opportunities for developing relationships at various levels between Indigenous and Foreign owned companies.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland actively assists companies from all over the world to create business relationships between potential buyers and Irish suppliers. The Agency also provides support for strategic alliances, product licensing, collaborative research and joint ventures, and is actively endeavouring to maximise interactions between global buyers and suppliers in a number of ways including:</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">
<?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Meeting and consulting with potential customers and building an understanding of their purchasing requirement, including provision of free confidential support services to meet those requirements</P>

	<P>The promotion and facilitation of industrial development is a day to day matter for the industrial development agencies and relevant county enterprise boards, and not one in which I am directly involved.</P>
    <P Just="Left">IDA Ireland informs me that it continues to market South Tipperary as a potential location for new foreign direct investment, in order to secure new investment and additional jobs for the region. In marketing South Tipperary, IDA Ireland is focused on attracting overseas companies in the services and knowledge based industries, including advanced manufacturing. Key sectors of focus for IDA in the region are international services, healthcare and pharmaceuticals.</P>
    <P>IDA&rsquo;s strategy for South Tipperary is to concentrate future economic development in Clonmel and to develop the town as a first-class location for overseas investment. This strategy has been agreed with the South Tipperary County Development Board. IDA has purchased c. 50 acres of land in the Ballingarrane Estate in Clonmel to develop a Business and Technology Park. The future development of the Ballingarrane Estate will be a key asset in attracting overseas investment into the county. Recent significant investments by IDA supported companies in the region include Guidant in Clonmel and Alza in Cashel. I understand from IDA that Guidant will be looking to recruit circa 200 staff per annum over the next five years.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Enterprise Ireland continues to encourage investment and foster job creation in Tipperary South. Enterprise Ireland job creation activity is focused on the creation of new jobs, through supporting entrepreneurs, setting up new high potential start-up companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level, through support of research in companies and third level institutions.</P><Col N="1595"/>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland continues to work with companies in its portfolio to assist them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation, in order that they can compete on world markets. In addition to direct finance, Enterprise Ireland has a range of service offerings to encourage the set up of high tech, high opportunity, indigenous enterprises including business and marketing advice, mentoring, product development etc as well as incubation space.</P>
    <P>As part of its regional development role, Enterprise Ireland works with other agencies in South Tipperary to develop the business infrastructure. Enterprise Ireland infrastructural projects include Community Enterprise Centres, which foster the development of micro enterprises, which in turn can grow into larger enterprises. Enterprise Ireland approved support of &euro;702,547 under its CEC Schemes to Community Enterprise Centres in Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel and Tipperary town. All of these centres are operating at almost full capacity.</P>
    <P>The South Tipperary County Enterprise Board (CEB) is pro-actively involved in the development of indigenous enterprise in the region. In 2006 Tipperary South CEB received a total budgetary allocation from my Department of &euro;766,995 (which is a 6.1% increase over the 2005 allocation). This has enabled South Tipperary CEB to be actively involved in the economic development of County Tipperary and to ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development throughout the locality. In the first half of 2006 South Tipperary CEB has made available in excess of &euro;250,000 to 12 micro businesses in South Tipperary with the potential to create 25-30 jobs.</P>

	<P>Funds are in place to address the requirements to which the Deputy refers. I am informed by F&Aacute;S that its High Support Process (HSP) is a flexible process designed to assist F&Aacute;S Employment Services Officers (ESOs) in implementing a range of responses to meet the needs of individuals who are experiencing major employability barriers in progressing from unemployment to employment in the open labour market. HSP budget for 2006 is &euro;950,000.</P>
    <P>Under the HSP a total of &euro;2,500 per person is available to ESOs to source the relevant interventions such as counselling, supplemental training, etc. It is a multi-agency, case-conferencing approach where F&Aacute;S ESOs and Department of Social and Family Affairs (DSFA) Job Facilitators, in conjunction with a number of other agencies such as Health Services Executive, Local Employment Services, Vocational Educational Committees, Probation and Welfare Services, etc. source agreed supports for individuals based on identified barriers.</P>
    <P>The HSP is available to:</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>individuals referred through the Employment Action Plan (EAP) who would benefit from this intervention</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>ex-Job Initiative (JI) participants or current participants who wish to explore alternative training and/or employment options</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>any individual presenting and identified in need of &lsquo;high support&rsquo; such as those experiencing homelessness, individual made redundant, ex-offenders, members of the traveller community, disabled people, etc.</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition to the HSP, F&Aacute;S also operates a &lsquo;Customised Training Fund&rsquo; which has a budget of &euro;1,261,000 for 2006. This fund was set up to provide flexibility in responding to the identified training needs of jobseekers. In situations where an individual, during the course of a guidance interview with a F&Aacute;S ESO, identifies a specific &lsquo;specialised&rsquo; training need that cannot be met by F&Aacute;S, or where there would be an unacceptable delay before the next scheduled F&Aacute;S course is due to start, this fund may be used to &lsquo;purchase&rsquo; the required training. In certain circumstances the fund may used to offer group support or individual counselling. The cost of training is set at &euro;635 to &euro;1,270 per individual.</P>
    <P Just="Left">As part of F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s guidance process, both HSP and the Customised Training Fund are available <Col N="1597"/>to individuals experiencing employability barriers to use for appropriate training, etc. Consequently, there would appear to be no need for a &lsquo;third&rsquo; fund to meet such needs.</P>

A number of Task Forces were established between 1997 and 2001 in response to job losses in particular areas. However, the practice of creating such Task Forces changed after the establishment of County Development Boards, as the Boards were seen to be best placed to oversee any additional response required to job losses over and above the work of the Industrial Development Agencies under the auspices of my Department.</P>
    <P Just="Left">In addition, while it is not strictly a task force, and is therefore not listed in the following table, there is currently an Inter-Departmental Group, under the chairmanship of the Secretary-General of my Department, which is considering a broad range of issues relevant to the future development of Co.

Finally, in the time available, my Department cannot provide the details of the exact period of existence for each of the Task Forces established to address particular job losses, however, each would have had a life span of an average of 12 months.</P><Col N="1597"/>

	<P>At present there are 7 vacant properties in Waterford on which IDA Ireland has long term lease agreements. All these premises are located in the Waterford Industrial Estate. These leases, which are 35-year leases, were entered into between 1983 and 1989. The outstanding balance of the leases is 11 years on average. The outstanding amount due on the balance of the leases is &euro;5,195,810. It is hoped that a number of these properties might be occu<Col N="1604"/>pied or redeveloped during the period, which would have the potential to reduce this amount.</P>

	<P>State support for enterprise and job creation is channelled through the industrial development agencies. Both EI and IDA are actively promoting and encouraging new investments and jobs for Counties Laois and Offaly and are also working with existing clients in the county with a view to helping them expand and or move their activities up the value chain. In the period from 2000 to 2005 agency-assisted firms created a total of 2,883 new full time jobs in Counties Laois (735) and Offaly (2048). In addition the County Enterprise Boards have created a total of 449 jobs in Laois and 421 in Offaly over the same period.</P>
    <P Just="Left">IDA Midlands Region consists of Counties Laois, Longford, Offaly, Westmeath and Roscommon. The locations of emphasis for IDA in these counties are the NSS Gateway Towns of Athlone, Tullamore, and Mullingar. In addition IDA actively promotes the County towns of Portlaoise, Longford and Roscommon. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for the Midlands Region is:</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>To progress the development of a knowledge economy, in order that the Region <Col N="1605"/>can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment.</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>To work with the existing client base in the Counties and to expand their presence in the various Counties;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>To provide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>To work with Local Authorities and relevant infrastructure providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure to the various Counties.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0" Just="Left">IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions in the Region, in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment. IDA is also working with F&Aacute;S to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needed by those already in the workforce who are interested in upskilling.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland has a wide range of supports for start up companies. As part of its strategy launched in May 2005, Enterprise Ireland is working more intensively with High Potential Start-ups (HPSUs) at their initial start up phase in order to accelerate their growth, help build management capability, provide direct financial support, provide business advice and mentoring and assist HPSUs through its overseas network to develop their exports.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Community Enterprise Centres provide a much needed business infrastructure and incentive for small new company start-ups in disadvantaged areas. Working in partnership with the local community, Enterprise Ireland has approved over &euro;469,000 in support of the development of Laois based Community Enterprise Centres. This includes capital support of over &euro;400,000 towards the Mountmellick Development Centre for Phase One, which is completed and fully occupied, and for Phase Two on which construction commenced in May 2005 and is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>In January 2006, I was pleased to announce the extension of the Enterprise Ireland Community Enterprise Centre Scheme, which will provide &euro;7m of Capital funding in the period 2006-2008. Under this competitive scheme, Portarlington Enterprise Centre was approved &euro;400,000 for an expansion to its existing centre. This first phase of this Centre is fully occupied.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The South West area of Offaly comes within the remit of Shannon Development which has provided Capital support towards the development of Community Enterprise Centres in Ferbane and Kilcormac. The company is also involved with Local Authorities in the Region, in working to ensure the development of world-class telecommunications infrastructure in the region including Broadband facilities. Broadband area networks have been approved for Nenagh, Roscrea/Birr, Templemore and Banagher. Shannon Development Company is an active <Col N="1606"/>member of a broad based marketing initiative &mdash; &ldquo;Invest in Offaly&rdquo; which actively promotes the attractiveness of the agency owned Birr Technology Centre and the wider South West Offaly area to potential investors.</P>
    <P>The County Enterprise Boards (CEB) provide a source of support in these counties for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer, providing a single point of contact at local level for new and established small businesses. Subject to certain eligibility criteria, enterprises may qualify for support from the CEBs primarily in the form of capital and feasibility grants. The development of entrepreneurship in Laois and Offaly is being achieved not just by direct grant aid to businesses but also through the provision of a range of other important business supports such as mentoring, business training and business advice.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the Development Agencies in Laois and Offaly, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of these counties.</P>

The Deputy should be aware there are a few cases where it is not possible to enforce a determination of the EAT or the Labour Court where, for example, the employer, as a company, is no longer a legal entity i.e it is dissolved, or is in liquidation, or legal searches show that the employer has no discernible assets. Four cases were referred to the Chief State Solicitors Office for the institution of legal proceedings. Two of these cases were resolved without a court hearing.</P>

There is a number of routes where my Department pays for independent services in respect of the free travel scheme operated by more than one operator.</P>
    <P>My Department has contract arrangements with some 90 private operators participating in the free travel scheme at an expected cost of &euro;4.35m during 2006. Payments are made to the participating private operators of the scheme for an initial 12 to 18 months on the basis of discounted fares forgone following which time the rate of payment is fixed subject to review by survey.</P>
    <P>My Department pays the CIE Group centrally in respect of the free travel scheme. The apportionment of payment between the three constituent companies, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus, is a matter for the CIE Group to determine. Payment rates are based on historical surveys of usage indexed by subsequent approved fares increases and by expansions of categories of clients eligible under the free Travel scheme. It is expected that payments in the region of &euro;48.5 million will be made to CIE during 2006.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 376 and 385 together.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. All carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass. It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person&rsquo;s pension. People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a <Col N="1609"/>country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme applies to travel within the State and point to point cross border journeys between here and Northern Ireland. The Programme for Government contains a commitment to a scheme of all-Ireland free travel for pensioners resident in all parts of the island of Ireland. The scheme will enable pensioners resident here to travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in Northern Ireland. Likewise, pensioners in Northern Ireland will travel free of charge on services in this State.</P>
    <P>Discussions in relation to the introduction of the proposed all-Ireland free travel scheme have taken place between officials from my Department and their counterparts. Discussions have also been held at ministerial level, and the matter was raised by the Taoiseach with the Prime Minister. I am also meeting the Commissioner this week to further explore the issue.</P>
    <P Just="Left">There have been a number of requests and inquiries in relation to the extension of entitlement to free travel in Ireland to Irish born people living outside Ireland, or to those in receipt of pensions from my Department, particularly in the UK, when they return to Ireland for a visit.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department met with European Commission officials in April in an effort to clarify the legal issues involved. In the past few weeks the Commission&rsquo;s response to the issues raised at that meeting has become available and is currently being examined by my officials.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 377 and 389 together.</P>
    <P>Prior to April 1979, each individual worker liable for social insurance deductions was given a unique social insurance number, regardless of marital status, and this was the key identifier for recording of social insurance contributions deducted in respect of their employment(s).</P>
    <P>The social insurance number was replaced by the Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number which was then used for both social welfare and PAYE purposes. The management and allocation of numbers remained primarily the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners and, at that time, it was the practice to link the records of spouses using the same RSI number but with an additional character (&ldquo;w&rdquo;) to enable their employment and contribution details to be recorded separately. Therefore, while there was a similarity between the numbers, the recording of social insurance and other relevant details was maintained on the basis of two distinct records. Quality control measures were put in place to ensure that contributions received on behalf of a person were not inadvertently updated to the records of his or her spouse. Procedures were also introduced to rectify any errors or omissions that might occur from time to time.</P>
    <P>Since June 2000, following the introduction of the current Personal Public Services (PPS) number, my Department has sole responsibility for the PPS number registration process. The PPS number is a unique reference number for all dealings with Government Departments and public bodies and the Department is committed to the highest standards of control in the allocation of numbers and the maintenance of accurate records into the future. I would like to mention that, if the Deputy is aware of any specific case where there is concern over the recording of contributions, I will arrange to have the matter investigated on receipt of the relevant details.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The rates of contribution payable in respect of various insurable employments are set out in the following table. During that period, the rates of contribution or &lsquo;stamp&rsquo; payable were not calculated as a percentage of earnings, but rather paid on a fixed rate. Contributions payable under the Social Welfare Acts, the Occupational Injuries Act, the Redundancy Payments Acts and the Health Contributions Act were payable by means of an adhesive stamp to be fixed to the social welfare insurance cards of employees. Different rates of contributions applied to public and civil servants, women and outworkers, amongst other. The rate of contribution shown as follows refers to a stamp which would have been payable by a man who was employed under a contract of service, or apprenticeship, and was either engaged in manual labour, or his employment was below the remuneration limit for insurability. The remuneration limit was removed with effect from 1st April 1974.</P>
    <P>The employer was liable for the occupational injuries contribution, but social insurance and redundancy contributions due were divided between the employer and the employee. The health contribution was payable by the employee. During this period, the social insurance fund was subvented annually from the exchequer to meet the cost of benefits and pensions payable.</P>

	<P>The Respite Care Grant is payable automatically to recipients of Carers Allowance, Carers Benefit and Prescribed Relatives Allowance, and in cases where a Constant Attendance <Col N="1613"/>Allowance is in payment in respect of the person being cared for.</P>
    <P>Budget 2005 extended entitlement to the Grant to all full-time carers irrespective of means or contribution record but subject to certain conditions relating to the provision of full-time care and attention. A section was set up in my Department to process applications from people in this newly entitled category.</P>
    <P>This section currently has a staff of 15, made up of 1 Assistant Principal, 1 Higher Executive Officer, 5 Executive Officers (4 posts) and 8 Clerical Officers. 2 of the Executive Officers work reduced hours and share one post. The total number of whole time equivalent posts allocated to the Respite Care Grant Scheme is 14.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the conditions for receipt of a fuel allowance from my Department is that the claimant&rsquo;s heating needs are not covered under a Deed of Transfer. In October 1987, the person concerned transferred his holding to his son under such a Deed. This legally binding document obliged the son to provide for the heating needs of his parents.</P>
    <P>In April 2006, the Deputy wrote to my Department enclosing correspondence from the pensioner&rsquo;s solicitors to the effect that his son had never supplied his parents with domestic fuel. Following investigation of the matter by a social welfare inspector, my Department is satisfied that the son is in employment and is therefore capable of providing fuel to his parents as required by the Deed. On this basis, the person concerned is not eligible for the fuel allowance.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The person concerned had been in receipt of unemployment assistance since 1987. Following a review, a Deciding Officer disallowed his unemployment assistance claim from 28 December 2005, on the grounds that he was not genuinely seeking, or available for work. The person concerned appealed this decision. However, the Appeals Officer was not satisfied that he had made sustained efforts in genuinely seeking work and accordingly disallowed his claim.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The person concerned re-applied for unemployment assistance on 2 June 2006. His claim is currently with the social welfare inspector for investigation. Upon completion of inquiries a <Col N="1614"/>decision will be made and he will be notified of the outcome. Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
     <Quest>if he will undertake a complete review of the free travel pass scheme, in conjunction with the Department for Health and Children and introduce a voucher system which will enable people living in rural isolated areas to avail of transport such as taxis to transport them to hospital outpatient appointments and admission, and so on; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[27375/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. All carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass. It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person&rsquo;s pension.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of private contractors providing services under the scheme operate in rural areas, including those in the Rural Transport Initiative. The underlying feature of the scheme is the use of spare capacity on these transport services. I am always willing to consider applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.</P>
    <P>Various alternatives to the existing system, including the use of vouchers, have been examined. A study, &ldquo;A Review of the Free Schemes,&rdquo; published in 2000 under the Department&rsquo;s programme of expenditure reviews concluded that a voucher type system, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys, would be extremely difficult to administer, open to abuse and unlikely to be sufficient to afford an acceptable amount of travel. This position remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>The issue of access to public transport in rural areas is being addressed at present through the Rural Transport Initiative, which is being managed by Pobal, formerly Area Development Management (ADM) on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport. My Department contributed &euro;500,000 to the initiative in 2004, &euro;750,000 in 2005 and is contributing &euro;850,000 for the <Col N="1615"/>initiative in 2006, to ensure that free travel passholders continue to have access to community based transport services. I will continue to review the operation of the free travel scheme with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.</P>

     <Quest>the non-Governmental agencies or organisations his Department has provided funding to in 2004, 2005, and 2006; the amount of funding provided to each in each year; the number of applications for funding submitted to his Department in total; the number of these applications which were refused; the reason for same; the percentage of his Department&rsquo;s overall annual budget such funding equates to; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The principal programme through which my Department provides funding to voluntary and community groups is the scheme of Grants for the Development and Promotion of Information and Welfare Rights. The purpose of the scheme is to enable my Department to contribute towards the funding of a number of nationally-based information organisations, including those involved with advice to emigrants. It also provides once-off funding to non-statutory <Col N="1616"/>information providers towards the cost of specific projects.</P>
    <P Just="Left">An amount of &euro;1.142m, representing some 0.01% of the overall estimate for my Department, was allocated under the programme in each of the years 2004 and 2005 to 27 and 19 organisations respectively. In 2006 &euro;1.362m has been made available to my Department for the scheme. Details of the applications received and the organisations funded in each of the years 2004, 2005 and to date in 2006 under the scheme are set out in the following table.</P>
    <P>From time to time my Department administers special schemes of grants to support specific initiatives in relation to promoting social inclusion by voluntary and community organisations. In 2005, the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament and the European Anti Poverty Network (EAPN) Ireland received &euro;740.55 and &euro;21,000 respectively for initiatives relevant to the E.U. social inclusion programme for community action to encourage co-operation between member states in combating social exclusion.</P>
    <P>In 2004, an additional allocation of &euro;950,000 was provided to my Department in the Budget for a special awards scheme for local voluntary and community groups to mark the 10th anniversary of the United Nations International Year of the Family. Under the scheme some 800 groups received once off funding for initiatives celebrating the role of the family. A letter will issue to the Deputy shortly with the detailed information requested in relation to the scheme.</P><Col N="1615"/>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>An oral hearing for the person concerned was arranged for 3rd May 2006. However, the person concerned did not attend the hearing. She telephoned the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 4th May 2006 and said that she had not received the letter of notification as she had moved address. She undertook to write in giving details of her new address.</P>
    <P>As no letter was received, the Appeals Officer has deemed the case to be withdrawn. If the person concerned forwards her new address to the Social Welfare Appeals Office her appeal can be re-opened.</P>
    <P>Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>To qualify for credited Social Insurance contributions while unemployed (unemployment credits) a person must be available for full-time employment, capable of work and must be genuinely seeking work.</P>
    <P>A Deciding Officer disallowed the unemployment credits application of the person concerned from 29 May 2006, on the grounds that she is not genuinely seeking work.</P>
    <P>It is open to the person concerned to appeal this decision and a form for this purpose may be obtained from her Local Social Welfare Office. Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in <Col N="1620"/>relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.

     <Quest>the average waiting period for an oral hearing in the context of social welfare appeals; if he is satisfied that such waiting period affords an acceptable level of service to appellants; if he will take steps to ensure that appeals requiring oral hearing will be dealt with more expeditiously; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The average length of time taken to deal with all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of an oral hearing) by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2005 was 20 weeks. However, if allowance is made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time falls to 13 weeks.</P>
    <P>The processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process including the submission by the Department of Social and Family Affairs of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further examinations by the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors in certain sickness related cases, and the holding of oral hearings which are currently afforded in two out of every three cases determined by Appeals Officers.</P>
    <P>Circumstances can arise, normally outside of the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, which can have the effect of unduly prolonging the time taken to process appeals. For example, delays can occur where the appellant furnishes new evidence which requires investigation at a late stage in the proceedings or where an adjournment of an oral hearing may be sought by the appellant or his or her representatives.</P>
    <P>An oral hearing is granted at the discretion of the Appeals Officer usually in circumstances where there is a conflict in the evidence presented by both parties or where an oral hearing is requested by the appellant in order to present his or her case adequately. Given the logistics involved in organising oral hearings, the average length of time is increased by about 8 weeks where an oral hearing is involved.</P><Col N="1621"/>
    <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office deals with about 14,000 appeals on an annual basis and the processing time in relation to oral hearings is kept under constant review. The nature of the service provided is judicial and the procedures in place for determining appeals are designed to ensure that each case receives full and satisfactory consideration. Consequently, improvements in processing times must be achieved in a manner which is consistent with justice being seen to be done and the need to ensure that every appeal is fully investigated and determined on all its circumstances.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 390 and 397 together.</P>
    <P>Pay related social insurance (PRSI) was extended to self employed people from 6th April 1988, as class S PRSI. Class S benefits cover Widow or Widower&rsquo;s Contributory Pension, Orphan&rsquo;s Contributory Allowance, Old Age Contributory Pension, Maternity Benefit, Adoptive Benefit, Bereavement Grant and Old Age Contributory Pension. In the case of old age contributory pension, a person must satisfy certain qualifying conditions. These conditions include that a person must have: (1) entered into insurable employment before age 56; (2) at least 260 weeks full-rate contributions paid; (3) a yearly average of at least 10 contributions recorded (taking paid and credited PRSI Contributions into account) from 1953 or from the date of entry into insurance (whichever is the later) to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age, in order to qualify for the maximum rate a yearly average of 48 contributions is required; and (4) paid all liabilities to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of PRSI.</P><Col N="1622"/>
    <P>For pension qualification purposes, class S self employment contributions are treated like any other full rate social insurance. The statistics available relate to the numbers of people who fail to qualify on the general grounds listed above. These general reasons do not identify people by reference to their class of employment, and accordingly, the specific statistics requested cannot be supplied.</P>
    <P>With regard to class S refunds, a 53% pension element refund of PRSI paid by self-employed contributors may be payable where:</P>
  <P el="3"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the contributor was aged 56 or over when they paid class S PRSI for the first time and were not insured at an earlier date as an employee, and the contributor does not have an entitlement to either a contributory or a non contributory pension, and</P>
   <P el="3"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the contributor has no outstanding liability with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">To date, 3,412 such refunds have issued from my Department.</P>
    <P>Information on PRSI Refunds is available from my Departments PRSI Refund Section, 2/3 Parnell Square East, Dublin 1 or from the Self Employment and Voluntary Contributions Section, Social Welfare Services, Cork Road, Waterford and from the Department&rsquo;s Freedom of Information (FOI) guidelines which is available on the website, <i>www.welfare.ie</i> and in the Information Leaflet SW 74. A copy of the guidelines in this regard was recently forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Where a self-employed person is refused an old age contributory pension, they are normally advised to contact the Revenue Commissioners to establish their correct PRSI liability for the period of their self employment. They are also given the option of applying for an old age non contributory pension.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
     <Quest>if he will consider allowing persons who are in receipt of both the disability benefit and the blind pension continued payment <Col N="1623"/>of both when they reach the age of 66 years in view of the financial hardship that immediate loss of one of these payments causes; if he will have the matter reviewed with a view to providing continued payment in view of the problems incurred by the disability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[27676/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The qualifying conditions for the payment of Disability Benefit are that a person is under 66 years of age, unfit for work due to illness and satisfies the PRSI contribution conditions. Persons over the age of 66 are not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts at a class reckonable for Disability Benefit purposes and the age limit for receipt of Disability Benefit is thus 66 years.</P>
    <P>There is a general rule in the social welfare code whereby a person who is entitled to more than one income maintenance payment at any one time may only receive one of these payments. However, there are some exceptions to this rule which includes the treatment of persons in receipt of Blind Pension.</P>
    <P>A person in receipt of a blind pension aged less than 66 years who has sufficient PRSI contributions may also be eligible to receive disability benefit, unemployment benefit, maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, or health and safety benefit. Alternatively, they may concurrently receive widow or widower&rsquo;s pension or one parent family payment. However, once a person reaches 66 years of age, only one payment may be made.</P>
    <P>The payment rate of Blind Pension increases at age 66 years or over from a maximum personal rate of &euro;165.80 per week to a maximum rate of &euro;182.00, with increases per week for qualified adults and/or dependants. This payment rate is equivalent to the rate of Old Age (Non Contributory) Pension. If the person qualifies for payment of the Old Age Contributory Pension, this is paid at a higher rate. Entitlement to extra benefits such as the Free Travel Pass and Household Benefits Package also applies to these payments.</P>
    <P>In cases of exceptional need, assistance is available under the Supplementary Welfare scheme, administered by the Health Services Executive.</P>
    <P>As part of the Social Welfare Budget package 2006, I am introducing a standard State (Non-Contributory) Pension, with effect from September, which will replace the Old Age Pension and, for recipients age 66 and over, will replace Blind Pension, Widow/er&rsquo;s Pension, One Parent Family payment, Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Allowance and Prisoner&rsquo;s Wife Allowance. The new scheme will provide a standard non-contributory pension with an increase in the means disregard from the current level of &euro;7.60 per week to &euro;20 per week which will mean that a single person, <Col N="1624"/>with no other means will be able to have up to &euro;35,000 in capital and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate. A specific earnings disregard of &euro;100 per week is also added which is intended as an initial incentive to encourage longer work amongst older people. I will continue to keep the issue raised under review and for consideration in the context of the wider budgetary package.</P>

    <P FLI="0">There have always been procedures in place in my Department to address situations where a person feels that an injustice has occurred arising from a deciding officer&rsquo;s decision. Before any decision is made by a deciding officer to raise an overpayment of pension against the estate of a deceased non-contributory pensioner, the next-of-kin are given an opportunity to provide any new facts or fresh evidence regarding the case. If, on re-examination of the case the deciding officer makes a decision which results in an overpayment of pension, the next-of-kin have the right to seek a review of that decision. The next-of-kin also have a legal right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office if they are not satisfied with the deciding officer&rsquo;s decision.</P>
    <P>Where appeals are lodged against deciding officer decisions, the facts of each case are independently examined by an appeals officer and a ruling is given based upon the particular circumstances which apply in each case. As the circumstances in each case appealed are rarely similar, the ruling that is given in any one case does not necessarily provide a basis for making decisions in relation to other cases.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the particular case raised by the Deputy, the appeals officer considered, in the light of the circumstances of the case, that there were very reasonable grounds that the decision should take effect from the date of the pensioner&rsquo;s death and that the overpayment which occurred was not refundable.</P>
    <P>In seeking to recover an overpayment of pension from the estate of a deceased pensioner, my <Col N="1626"/>Department normally deducts from the value of the estate any funeral and legal expenses which were incurred by the next-of-kin in finalising the affairs of the deceased. The question of such a deduction did not arise in this case in that there were sufficient assets to cover such expenses apart from the amount of the overpayment assessed.</P>
    <P>Under Social Welfare legislation it is possible for a pensioner to appoint an agent who will cash his/her payment book at a nominated post office if the pensioner is unable to do so for whatever reason. In circumstances where a pensioner enters into a long-stay residential care centre, it is not uncommon for him/her to apply to my Department for the director of nursing of the centre to be appointed as an agent for this purpose. In addition, the pensioner has the right to rescind the agency arrangement at any time or to appoint another person as the agent.</P>
    <P>Pension payments made under an agency arrangement as outlined above are not, per se, taken into account when my Department is reviewing the means of a deceased non-contributory pensioner. Instead, my officials seek to establish the full extent of the assets which were owned by the pensioner during the period when he or she received their non-contributory pension. This is then compared against the means which the pensioner declared to the Department during the same period. If a discrepancy between the two arises, this may result in the person being overpaid on his or her pension and this would be recoverable from any estate at the time of death.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department who deal with estates cases are not paid a performance related bonus on the lines outlined in the question. I am satisfied that deciding officers operate to a very high standard in their interpretation and administration of the legislation in this area and in carrying out their duties generally.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The living alone allowance or living alone increase as it is now known, is an additional payment of &euro;7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone. It is also available to people under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes. The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone.</P>
    <P>The living alone increase is a targeted measure aimed at a particular group of pensioners. However, the policy in relation to support for pensioners has been, for many years, to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pen<Col N="1628"/>sion rather than focusing on payments such as the living alone increase. This approach ensures that resources are used to improve the position of all pensioners.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to increasing the level of the basic State pension to &euro;200 per week by 2007. Further significant progress towards achieving this target was made in Budget 2006, which provided for increases in pensions of up to &euro;14 and &euro;16 per week. The maximum rate of the old age contributory pension is now &euro;193.30 per week with the non-contributory pension paid at &euro;182 per week, whereas two years ago, the corresponding rates were &euro;167.30 and &euro;154.</P>

	<P>Where both members of a couple are claiming social welfare payments and one or both of the claimants is in receipt of unemployment assistance, farm assist or pre-retirement allowance their combined payments cannot exceed the amount which would be payable if only one person was being paid with an increase for a qualified adult dependant, where appropriate. In this situation one or both of the payments would be limited to ensure that the relevant household rate of payment would not be exceeded. The removal of the limitation for the approximately 3,400 cases affected would have a direct cost of &euro;6.60m in a full year.</P>
    <P>The removal of the limitation would also provide an incentive to all those for whom qualified adult allowance is currently in payment to claim UA in their own right, subject to satisfying the genuinely seeking work condition, which in the majority of cases would result in an increase of &euro;55.80 per week. This development would have significant implications, both in terms of increased cost and live register numbers as it would apply (subject to means assessment) to qualified adults of working age across a range of schemes in addition to those currently affected by the limitation rule. There are a total of 57,400 payments in this grouping, with additional potential costs estimated at up to &euro;163m per annum if there was full take-up.</P>
    <P>My department has recently published a Government discussion paper: Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents. Under these proposals for reform of income support arrangements for lone parents and low income families, a new parental allowance for all low income families with children under a specified age would replace both the current one-parent family payment and the social assistance qualified adult allowance. In these circumstances no limitation would apply where a parental allowance recipient cohabits with a person in receipt of a social assistance payment, e.g. unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Lifting limitation for this limited period of time would have the effect of increasing household income in such situations by up to &euro;58 per week, recognising the higher costs associated with care of young children. It would also assist in addressing the problem of poverty among children in low income families. Any proposal to abolish the limitation rule in full could only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of competing priorities.</P>

     <Quest>the cost of introducing retrospective credits for all women who have lost out on cover due to the Civil Service marriage bar.</Quest>
     <QRef>[27777/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In general, the social insurance class <Col N="1631"/>paid by those affected by the marriage bar was a modified rate which now gives coverage for widow(er)&rsquo;s and orphan&rsquo;s pensions and occupational injury benefit, bereavement grant and carer&rsquo;s benefit only. This class reflected their occupational pension position and general contract of service at that time. Accordingly, even if they had continued in employment, contributions paid at this class would not have entitled them to an old age pension under the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>That said, in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensure that as many people as possible can qualify for pensions in their own right, a number of measures have been introduced over the years which make it easier for people to qualify for pensions. These include the reduction in the yearly average number of contributions required for pension purposes from 20 to 10 and the special half rate pension based on pre-53 insurance contributions. Pro-rata pensions are also available to allow people with mixed rate insurance. This set of measures is of particular benefit to women who may have less than complete social insurance records due to working in the home.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that approx 88% of women aged 65 years of age are at present receiving social welfare support, either in their own right or as qualified adults on the pension of their spouse or partner.</P>
    <P>In addition, the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, which was introduced in 1994, is intended to mitigate the effect of periods spent on caring duties when a person&rsquo;s insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent on caring duties to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s insurance record is being averaged to assess entitlement for contributory pension purposes. However, it must be borne in mind that the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions for pensions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied. Accordingly, the scheme will not benefit someone whose social insurance record includes only modified rate contributions.</P>
    <P>It is not, for a number of reasons, possible to estimate the cost of providing pensions to persons affected by the marriage bar. Some of those affected may have returned to the workforce and have become eligible for a social welfare pension on foot of such employment or may already be receiving social welfare support as non-contributory pensioners or as qualified adults on the pension of their spouse or partner.</P>
    <P>I will continue to look for ways, within the current social welfare structure, in which the needs <Col N="1632"/>of older people who are at present outside the social welfare pensions system may be addressed further.</P>

     <Quest>the reason a person in receipt of widow&rsquo;s pension must forfeit that payment in order to claim carer&rsquo;s allowance; if he will consider disregarding widow&rsquo;s pension for claimants of carer&rsquo;s allowance; if the current carer&rsquo;s allowance means test discriminates unfavourably against widows; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The carer&rsquo;s allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual. This ensures that resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one person. Persons qualifying for two social welfare payments always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>According to Census 2002 there are over 48,000 people providing personal care for over 4 hours per day and of these just over 2,400 are widowed people. There are currently over 26,800 people in receipt of either carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit. It is likely that a proportion of the balance is in receipt of another social welfare payment, including widow(er)&rsquo;s pension.</P>
    <P>In Budget 2006, I provided for a significant increase in the rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance. From January this year, the rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance increased to &euro;200 per week for carers aged 66 years and over. This rate of payment may be higher in many instances than the rate of widower(er)&rsquo;s pension payable to a person. Such a person who is providing full time care and attention to a person who requires such care may be entitled to receive this higher rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance. I would urge any person in this position to make enquiries with my Department.</P>
    <P>In addition, from June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care regardless of their income. Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding unemployment assistance and benefit, are entitled to this payment subject to meeting the full time care condition. This arrangement was introduced to acknowledge the needs of carers especially in relation to respite. Provision was made in Budget 2006 to increase the amount of the respite care grant from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,200 from June.</P>
    <P Just="Left">In line with other social assistance schemes, a means test is applied to the carer&rsquo;s allowance so as to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. This means test has been eased significantly over the years, most notably with the introduction of the disregards of spouses&rsquo; <Col N="1634"/>earnings. Following Budget 2006, since April, a couple with two children can earn up to &euro;32,925 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance. The same couple will be able to earn up to &euro;54,400 and receive the minimum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance as well as free travel, the household benefits package and the respite care grant.</P>
    <P>Complete abolition of the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance would cost an estimated &euro;140 million in a full year. The view of some support organisations is that if this level of resources were available, it would be more beneficial to carers if it were invested in further increases to carers allowance and in the type of community care services which would support them in their caring role, such as additional respite care facilities, more home helps, public health nurses and other such services.</P>
    <P>I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me. Those recommendations involving additional expenditure can only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

     <Quest>the amount which was spent in his Department for the years 2005 and from January 2006 to date for media purposes or advertising; where the money was spent, that is, national papers, provincial papers, RT&Eacute; radio, local radio and so on; the amounts spent on a yearly basis for each of the previous three years; and if money was spent on videos, for promotional, educational or advertising purposes.</Quest>

	<P>My Department uses a mix of advertising media including national and provincial newspapers, radio and television, information leaflets, fact sheets, posters and direct mailshots to ensure that people are aware of their social welfare entitlements and are notified about improvements and changes affecting their payments and services. The amount spent on advertising in any one year is determined by the number of specific advertising campaigns which are undertaken.</P>
    <P>To date in 2006, my Department has spent over &euro;340,000 on advertising which comprised of &euro;177,000 on print advertising and &euro;163,000 on broadcast media. Print media expenditure comprised of &euro;58,000 on national newspapers, &euro;103,000 on provincial newspapers and &euro;16,000 on posters. Broadcast media expenditure amounted to &euro;101,000 on television advertising, &euro;17,000 on national radio advertising and &euro;45,000 on local radio advertising. The principal element of the expenditure incurred to date this year related to the Family Income Supplement entitlements awareness campaign which resulted in a <Col N="1635"/>significant increase in the numbers of new applications.</P>

    <P>The total amount spent by my Department on advertising in 2005 was over &euro;300,000 of which &euro;240,000 was on print media comprised of &euro;130,000 on national newspapers and &euro;110,000 on provincial newspapers. Approximately &euro;60,000 was spent on electronic display advertising. Two major information campaigns were undertaken in 2005; the first was on the Respite Care Grant scheme and the second was a general advertising campaign carried out across credit unions throughout the country, which highlighted the range of social welfare benefits, schemes and services available.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on advertising, both print and broadcast media, for the previous three years, was in the region of &euro;1.3m in 2002, &euro;0.286m in 2003 and &euro;0.475m in 2004.</P>
    <P>Expenditure in 2002 covered a wide range of my Department&rsquo;s schemes and services and included specific campaigns such as promotion of the Farm Assist Scheme, the introduction of the Euro, promotion and awareness of the Personal Public Service Number and an information campaign in relation to improvements in the 2003 Budget. Costs of &euro;80,000 were incurred on the production and transmission of a video in relation to the Farm Assist campaign.</P>
    <P>Most of the advertising expenditure in 2003 arose in connection with general advertising regarding office closures, staff vacancies, etc., and a Budget information campaign.</P>
    <P>Two information campaigns were undertaken in 2004. The first campaign promoted the Carers Benefit scheme and the second campaign alerted people coming up to pension age that they should apply for their pension at least three months before they reach pension age. Advertising is a key part of my Department&rsquo;s information strategy to ensure that people are aware of and claim their social welfare entitlements.</P>

This Forum was attended by social partners, organisations representing lone parents and the unemployed, representatives of Government departments and <Col N="1637"/>State agencies who will be responsible for the implementation of the proposals in the discussion paper and members of the Oireachtas. At the Forum, I heard the views of each organisation on the proposals including their comments on the proposed parental allowance and invited them to make a formal written submission setting out those views. I also briefed the Oireachtas Committee on Social Affairs and debated the issue in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Since the Consultative Forum, I have received submissions from a number of the organisations representing lone parents and have met with these organisations.</P>
    <P>I have received a considerable number of representations from individual lone parents during the consultation process. Officials from my Department have indicated their willingness to meet individual lone parents in cases where this has been requested.</P>
    <P>The Government will listen closely to the views expressed and will give very serious consideration to them. As soon as I am convinced that we have reached conclusions that are fully workable and equitable, it will be my intention to bring forward proposals for legislation in the course of this year.</P>

    <P FLI="0">The cost of ECS for non resident children currently in receipt of Child Benefit in 2006 is approximately &euro;105,000. The cost of ECS payments to these children in 2007 is estimated at &euro;420,000. My Department acts as agent for the office of the Minister for Children in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 8,500 Child Benefit claims on hand yet to be processed. The majority of these claims (almost 90%) are from Polish nationals working in Ireland but whose family reside in Poland.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks when processing such claims it has been found that a significant number of customers have either left Ireland or have had their families join them here. As a result they will either be paid under domestic legislation or will only qualify for the payment of Child Benefit and ECS for the period of their employment in Ireland. It is too early yet to accurately establish the extent of this development, but it will influence the overall amounts of benefit payable for non resident children.</P>

	<P>The Back to Education Allowance or BTEA is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.</P>
    <P>The BTEA is not payable to people pursuing post-graduate qualifications because people with a primary degree are already in possession of a third level qualification and their academic qualifications should impact positively on their employment prospects. However those wishing to take up a Higher Diploma (H.Dip) in any discipline or a Graduate Diploma in Primary School <Col N="1639"/>Teaching may claim BTEA as a post-graduate qualification is necessary for employment in their case.</P>
    <P>The conditions of the scheme focus it towards people who most need additional training or qualifications in order to gain a foothold in the labour market. In the circumstances, I have no plans to extend the BTEA scheme to persons pursuing other types of postgraduate courses at this time.</P>

    <P>The Government&rsquo;s Ports Policy Statement, which I launched in January 2005, aims to better equip the port sector and its stakeholders to meet national and regional capacity and service needs.

The Policy Statement sets out a framework to ensure that capacity needs are identified, planned and progressed in a coordinated manner.</P>
    <P>As part of this process, in September 2005, my Department appointed a firm of consultants expert in this field, Fisher Associates to help determine whether the anticipated capacity requirement to 2014 and beyond can be efficiently and adequately met through the successful advancement and implementation by the port sector of some combination of the various proposals currently under development in the sector.</P>
    <P>Submissions outlining proposals for new capacity were received from the following ports on the east coast: Greenore, Dublin, Drogheda and Rosslare. Submissions were also received from ports at Cork, Shannon Foynes and Waterford.</P>

	<P>It is a requirement for the registration and entry into service of new motor vehicles in the European Union that they have type-approval in accordance with Directive 70/157/EEC as amended by Directive 1999/101/EC, which sets down the per<Col N="1641"/>missible sound levels and exhaust systems for motor vehicles. Vehicle in-service standards are specified in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 which requires vehicles to be fitted with a silencer or other device that is suitable and sufficient for reducing to a reasonable level the noise caused by the escape of exhaust gases from the engine. Article 85 of these Regulations prohibits the use in a public place of a vehicle which causes excessive noise.</P>
    <P>An examination of the silencer to assess its effectiveness in reducing noise is part of the NCT. It is an offence to use in a public place a vehicle which causes excessive noise. Enforcement of the law in this regard is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

In accordance with section 25 (2), the decision made by the Minister under section 25 (1) is final.</P>
    <P>Services provided by private bus operators are licensed under the Road Transport Act, 1932.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Road Transport Act, 1932 provides the legislative basis for entry to the public transport market by private bus operators. In accordance with this <Col N="1642"/>legislation, private bus operators apply to my Department for Passenger Licences to operate coach and bus services within the State.</P>
    <P>There are three types of passenger licences issued: Annual Continuous Licence (operates all year round); Annual Seasonal Licence (operates for the season to which it relates i.e. a school or college service, a tour, etc.); Occasional Licence (issued for a specific event i.e. a concert, a sporting event, race week etc.)</P>
    <P>In the period since 2002, some 575 licences for new passenger licences for regular scheduled services or amended bus services have been issued. In addition to issuing new Annual licences, each year my Department processes applications for new Occasional passenger licenses for once off events. My Department also processes amendments to existing annual passenger licenses which in turn can lead to a new licence being issued if the amendments are substantial.</P>
    <P>As well as new licences, my Department is also required to process applications for the renewal of existing Annual Passenger licenses which fall due for renewal on the 31st August (Seasonal licences) or the 31st October (Continuous licences) each year.</P>
    <P>There are currently 364 Annual Continuous Licenses that fall due for renewal on 31st October 2006 and 253 Annual Seasonal Licenses, the majority of which will fall due for renewal on the 31st August, 2006. In addition, to date this year 33 Occasional Licenses have been issued.</P>
    <P>Based on the above data and taking into account the licences which may not be renewed or are withdrawn by private bus operators, there are between 600 and 650 valid passenger licences currently in operation.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Road Transport Act, 1932 provides the statutory basis for regulating the provision of public bus services by private bus operators in Ireland. Operators are issued annual passenger licences in accordance with the provisions of the Act for the services that they provide on a regular basis. The Act also provides for the issuing of occasional licences for once off occasions such as major sporting events, concerts etc. There are between 600 and 650 passenger licences currently in operation.</P>
    <P>In the case of occasional passenger licence applications for a once-off event e.g. hurling final, these applications are processed immediately provided that all the appropriate documentation is in order.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to say with certainty the length of time it takes to process an annual passenger licence application. Applications are generally dealt with on a first come, first served basis. However, pressing or exceptional circumstances can be taken into account in determining the order in which applications are dealt with as for example in the case of &lsquo;time bound&rsquo; applications e.g. services for school or college services or tours that are required to start by a certain date.</P>
    <P>The processing time for applications can vary for a number of reasons, such as the complexity of the application, the number of prior applications on hand, lack of prompt responses from relevant third parties contacted for their observations on the proposed service, and where relevant information is not provided by the applicant, such as a valid Road Passenger Transport Operators Licence, current Vehicle Insurance Certificates, Public Service Vehicle Licences or approvals for proposed bus stops from the Garda. In addition, in some circumstances, while the preliminary work may have been completed on a particular application, a final decision cannot be made until other relevant applications received prior to it have been finalised.</P>
    <P>The continuing increase in the number of licence applications from private operators and notifications of proposed new or amended bus services from Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus <Col N="1644"/>received in my Department has also impacted in the determination of licence applications generally.</P>
    <P>My Department regularly reviews ways in which to improve the administration of the 1932 Act in so far as resources permit. Recent innovations include the standardisation of renewal dates for licence applications and the provision of guidance notes on the various licensing processes. In addition, the Department is engaged in a project to upgrade IT systems in the bus licensing area to increase efficiency and the speed with which applications are processed.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It has long been recognised that the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, is in need of significant reform so that the legislative provisions better reflect the realities of modern transport services. The reform programme for the public transport market that I am pursuing will address these needs. My proposals include provision for independent regulation, and the introduction of a new legislative basis for the award of bus route licences that will be applied in respect of all operators. In the meantime, my Department will continue to promote improvements in the administration of the bus licensing service based on the principles of due process and fair procedures.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 429, 437 and 463 together.</P>
    <P>I have given a public commitment to modernizing the regulatory framework governing public transport, not just in Dublin, but nationally.</P>
    <P>In advancing the regulatory agenda, discussions have taken place with the key stakeholders, including the CIE Companies and the Unions. These discussions form part of a process of engagement that will facilitate and inform the determination of the appropriate structure for the new framework and supporting legislation.</P><Col N="1645"/>
    <P Just="Left">This process is also being informed by the work of the team which I appointed to make recommendations on the remit, structures and human resource requirements of the proposed Dublin Transport Authority. I have received the report of the team and I expect to bring my proposals in the matter to Government in the near future. It is also my intention that these proposals deal with a reorganization of the corporate governance arrangements within CIE with the objective of allowing greater independence to the boards of each of the operating subsidiaries. However, establishing Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann as a separate independent entity does not form part of these current proposals.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently considering an application from Dublin Bus for funding for 200 additional buses to be delivered in 2006 and 2007. The application is being considered in the context of Transport 21, the bus network review completed recently by Dublin Bus and the bus market reform process. I expect to make a decision on the application in the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads, including the M50, is vested in the National Roads Authority (NRA) under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000).</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, in January of this year, the NRA decided to replace the West-Link toll on the M50 by a single-point free flow toll in 2008. The installation of free flow tolling is a crucial element of the M50 upgrade which is underway at present.</P>
    <P>In that context, the NRA will bring forward specific proposals for the single-point free flow toll arrangement for consideration later this year. At this stage, I would not wish to pre-empt the content of those proposals.</P>

However, in November last year I secured agreement with the US authorities on transitional arrangements for Shannon in the context of proposals for an EU/US &lsquo;open skies&rsquo; agreement. At that time, I sought and received assurances from Aer Lingus that, in the context of a level playing field for the airline and its competitors, it would maintain the current level of transatlantic traffic with regular year round scheduled services between Shannon and Boston and New York. I did not request or receive these assurances in writing from the company. As the Deputy will be aware the discussions on a new EU/US &lsquo;Open Skies&rsquo; agreement are ongoing.</P>

    <P>The current position regarding the Western Rail Corridor is that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has submitted detailed business proposals to my Department relating to Phase 1 (the reopening of the Ennis to Athenry section) and Phase 2 (re-opening of the Athenry to Tuam section). These proposals have been assessed in my Department and I hope to make an announcement in the matter as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In addition, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is working with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, to agree arrangements and funding under the CL&Aacute;R Programme for the preservation of the alignment from Claremorris to Collooney.</P>

	<P>Provisions for imposition of a weight restriction on large vehicles entering a public road are set out in Article 17 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 (SI No. 182 of 1997). It is a matter for each local authority to determine if, and where, such restrictions should apply in its area.</P>
    <P>Article 17 operates as imposing a restriction on entry to the specified road as opposed to an outright prohibition on entry. This policy is required to cover circumstances where it is necessary for a large vehicle (of a weight that exceeds whatever threshold is indicated on the regulatory sign) to enter a road if this is necessary solely for the purpose of gaining access or egress from premises accessible only from that road.</P>
    <P>The regulation operates in such a way that a vehicle such as, for example, the driver of an oil tanker delivering heating oil or a large furniture removal/delivery truck, is legally permitted to pass the regulatory weight restriction sign if the premises on the road that they were delivering to could only be accessed from that entry point.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the driver of a large vehicle such as a truck or a passenger coach that passed <Col N="1653"/>the regulatory sign and used that road as a through traffic route as a shortcut, etc would be in breach of Article 17.</P>
    <P>The offence of contravening article 17 is not scheduled in the Road Traffic Act 2002 to be a penalty point offence. Penalty points offences are targeted at offences that are based on road safety considerations. It is not intended to schedule the Article 17 offence to be a penalty point offence and the policy consideration behind this is that since access to the road is permitted in limited circumstances the issue of large vehicles being on the road is not of itself a road safety issue.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I extended the fixed charge system from 3 April 2006 to a wide range of non-penalty point offences including the offence of contravening Article 17. Enforcement is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a driver who breaches Article 17 is now liable to be issued with a fixed charge notice to pay &euro;60 within 28 days or pay &euro;90 within the following 28-day period.</P>
    <P>If a fixed charge payment is not received the Garda bring a prosecution to court where a person, shall be liable, on summary conviction:</P>
<P LI="1">(a) in the case of a first offence to a fine not exceeding &euro;800</P>
<P LI="1">(b) in the case of a second offence, or a third or subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 and</P>
<P LI="1">(c) in the case of a third or subsequent offence which is the third or subsequent offence in any period of twelve months, to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding 3 months or to both fine and imprisonment.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The Road Traffic Bill 2006 provides that the &euro;800 fine be increased to &euro;1,000 and that the fine amounts of &euro;1,500 referred to be increased to &euro;2,000. These measures should pose a greater deterrent against breach of Article 17.</P>

     <Quest>the progress which has been made in implementing Transport 21 in South Tipperary since the plan&rsquo;s official launch.</Quest>
     <QRef>[27599/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Transport 21 was launched in November 2005 and a number of projects related to South Tipperary are now under way. The National Roads Authority (NRA) has allocated a total of &euro;43.2 million to South Tipperary County Council to progress the national roads programme in 2006. The upgrade of the N8 Cashel to Mitchelstown scheme (which forms part of the South West Corridor that links Limerick and Cork to Dublin) to motorway standard began in March this year. The funding will also allow a number of schemes to progress through various stages of planning. These <Col N="1654"/>include: N24 Carrick-on-Suir By-Pass; N24 Clonmel to Cahir By-Pass (Rathkeevin); N8 Cashel to Mitchelstown; N24 Bansha/Tipperary /Oola By-Pass; N24 Cahir to Bansha; The N8 Cullahill to Cashel scheme is due to begin construction later this year with an expected completion date of 2009.</P>
    <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has begun to renew track on the Limerick Junction-Waterford line which serves Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel, Cahir and Tipperary stations. This track renewal work and related improvements to signalling, level crossings and fencing will improve the operational safety of this line and will reduce the journey times.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

     <Quest>if schools outside designated CL&Aacute;R areas are automatically entitled to flashing amber warning lights outside primary schools; and if not, the reason therefor.</Quest>
     <QRef>[27601/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of road traffic signs, including the flashing amber warning lights in the vicinity of schools, is a matter to be determined by each road authority under section 95 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961. An automatic entitlement to have any particular type of traffic sign provided at any location does not arise.</P>
    <P>The allocation of funding under the CL&Aacute;R programme is administered by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in relation to physical, community and social infrastructure measures in the relevant designated areas.</P>
    <P>I am aware that funding under the CLAR programme has been allocated in the past year to local authorities towards the provision of traffic warning signs at specified schools in designated areas but this provision does not give rise to an entitlement for a funding programme for the corresponding measures in other areas.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) has been the statutory body responsible for the delivery of a multi-operator system of integrated public transport ticketing using smartcard technology. The RPA were introducing the system on a phased basis in line with international experience, initially in the Dublin area, and in consultation with public transport providers.</P>
    <P>As part of the phased introduction of smartcard-based integrated ticketing, Morton&rsquo;s Coaches, in conjunction with the RPA and as a &lsquo;proof of concept&rsquo;, successfully launched smartcards on its services in April 2004. Another step was taken in March of last year with the launch of smartcards on Luas services. The Luas smartcard deployment continues to help in obtaining important feedback from passengers and provide operational experience for the next stage of integrated ticketing. In excess of 11,000 smartcards have been purchased to date for use on Luas services.</P>
    <P>Following an inconclusive procurement procedure in 2005, the RPA, in consultation with the different State and private transport providers, presented proposals to my Department in January 2006. My Department has now com<Col N="1663"/>pleted an examination of these proposals and has also considered the recommendations of an independent high-level Review of the project and the recommendations of a Peer Review initiated in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines on the management of major ICT projects.</P>
    <P>Arising from these considerations, I am now in the process of putting in place enhanced governance arrangements for the completion of the project. These arrangements will include the establishment of a Project Board with responsibility for delivering the project. The Project Board will comprise senior representatives of the main transport stakeholders. One of the immediate tasks of the Project Board will be to report to me with revised timelines for the delivery of the project.</P>

	<P>I received the report of the Dublin Transportation Authority Establishment Team on the 28th of March. I had asked the Team to: make recommendations on the establishment of a transport authority for the Greater Dublin Area, addressing the remit of the authority, its powers, structure, organisation and human and other resource requirements and such other matters as the Team considered appropriate; give advice on the content of legislation required to establish the proposed authority on a statutory basis; and make recommendations on what interim arrangements should be put in place pending the enactment of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Significant work has been undertaken by my Department in the interim in relation to the legislative measures required to establish such an Authority on a statutory basis. It remains my intention to submit the matter to Government for decision in the near future and I expect to be in a position to publish legislation as soon as is practicable following that decision. It would clearly not be appropriate to outline details of my proposals for the new Authority pending consideration of the matter by the Government.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos 459 and 460 together.</P>
    <P>At the outset I should say that overall responsibility for the planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) and the local authorities concerned. In the case of the Dublin Port Tunnel, that authority is Dublin City Council.</P>
    <P>The latest indications from Dublin City Council and the NRA are that the main construction and installation work in the Tunnel is expected to be completed shortly with the Tunnel opening to traffic in the Autumn. However, in the interest of public safety, the exact opening date will be contingent on satisfactory completion of the testing and commissioning of the tunnel&rsquo;s operational and safety features, including the training of operational and emergency staff.</P>
    <P>Traffic management in general is a matter for the appropriate local authority. In this instance, the traffic management and control arrangements that will apply following the opening of the Dublin Port Tunnel are a matter for Dublin City Council.</P>
    <P>My Department is keeping in touch with all stakeholders, including Dublin City Council, to ensure that a co-ordinated strategy is developed for the opening of the Tunnel. Dublin City Council&rsquo;s Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) Management Strategy is an important part of this process.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s formal role will be to put in place the necessary regulations regarding traffic and related matters to support the strategy. This work is underway and will be completed in good time before the opening of the Tunnel.</P><Col N="1665"/>
    <P>I understand from the NRA that the estimated cost of the Tunnel remains at &euro;751 million, which has been the estimate for some time.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is the Managing Authority for the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme (ESIOP), which is one of the programmes being assisted by the EU under the cur<Col N="1666"/>rent National Development Plan. The sectors of the Operational Programme for which bodies under the aegis of my Department have responsibility are national roads and public transport. The most recent information on the physical outputs in relation to the indicators for each of these sectors is included in the ESIOP Progress Report on Implementation to end 2005. In this regard, I wish to advise the Deputy that a copy of the report may be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website: <i>www.transport.ie</i>. Details of the original targets are contained in the original Programme Complement, prepared in relation to the ESIOP, which may be viewed on the National Development Plan website, <i>www.ndp.ie</i>.</P>
    <P>In relation to maritime transport, funding is available under the Seaports Infrastructure and Capacity Submeasure of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The objective of the Seaports Measure is to provide grants for the commercial ports sector for new infrastructure needed for growth where deficiencies have been identified/projected and also for upgrading existing infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure for 11 projects is projected to be &euro;86.32 million, of which &euro;24.70 represents grant aid. To date, grant aid expenditure is &euro;14.533. Two projects have already been completed. A number of projects will continue to the end of 2006, with a projected remaining grant aid expenditure of &euro;10.06.</P>
    <P>As the programme remains ongoing, the final outputs from the projects cannot yet be quantified, but the Department will carry out a review of progress against targets at the closure of the programme. The Department reports, on a bi-annual basis, to the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly and the Border, Midlands and Western Regional Assembly in respect of performance indicators, based on the number of projects completed, the number of ports improved and the volume increase in tonnage from the projects.</P>

	<P>EU law on maximum weights and dimensions for vehicles is set out in Directive 96/53/EC. Under that Directive, which has been fully implemented by Ireland, a Member State may not prohibit the use, in its territory, of vehicles from another Member State which comply with the authorised maximum weight and dimension limits set down in the Directive.</P>
    <P>The Directive specifies four metres as the limit value for vehicle height. Consequently, provided a vehicle registered in a Member State is four metres or less in height, every Member State must permit that vehicle to operate on its territory. A Member State may, however, prescribe a higher limit on its territory.</P>
    <P>There is currently no height limit for goods vehicles in Ireland. However, I am considering the introduction of a height limit for vehicles taking account of the wide-ranging submissions received arising from the public consultation on the matter last year. I expect to make a decision in this matter shortly.</P>
    <P>In the event that it is decided to introduce a statutory height restriction for vehicles, it will be necessary to submit the draft Regulations to the European Commission for consideration and for referral to other Member States in accordance with the Technical Standards and Regulations Directive (Directive 98/34).</P>

	<P>Provisions for imposition of a weight restriction on large vehicles entering a public road are set out in Article 17 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 (SI No. 182 of 1997). It is a matter for each local authority to determine if, and where, such restrictions should apply in its area.</P>
    <P>Article 17 operates as imposing a restriction on entry to the specified road as opposed to an outright prohibition on entry. This policy is required to cover circumstances where it is necessary for a large vehicle (of a weight that exceeds whatever threshold is indicated on the regulatory sign) to enter a road if this is necessary solely for the purpose of gaining access or egress from premises accessible only from that road.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I extended the fixed charge system from 3 April 2006 to a wide range of non-penalty point offences including the offence of contravening Article 17. Enforcement is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a driver who breaches Article 17 is now liable to be issued with a fixed charge notice <Col N="1670"/>to pay &euro;60 within 28 days or pay &euro;90 (being 50% greater) within the following 28-day period.</P>
    <P>If a fixed charge payment is not received the Gardai bring a prosecution to court where a person, shall be liable, on summary conviction:</P>
<P LI="1">(a) in the case of a first offence to a fine not exceeding &euro;800</P>
<P LI="1">(b) in the case of a second offence, or a third or subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 and</P>
<P LI="1">(c) in the case of a third or subsequent offence which is the third or subsequent offence in any period of twelve months, to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding 3 months or to both fine and imprisonment.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">The Road Traffic Bill 2006 provides that the &euro;800 fine be increased to &euro;1,000 and that the fine amounts of &euro;1,500 referred to be increased to &euro;2,000.</P>

<Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>On 5 May 2006 I made Regulations entitled the European Communities (Compulsory Use of Safety Belts and Child Restraint Systems in Motor Vehicles) Regulations 2006 transposing into Irish law Directive 2003/20/EC relating to the compulsory wearing of safety belts and child restraint systems in motor vehicles.</P>
<P>Essentially, the Directive provides that:</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>where safety belts have been fitted they must be worn,</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>children under 3 years of age may not travel in a car or goods vehicle (other than a taxi) unless restrained in an appropriate child restraint,</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>children aged 3 years or over who are under 150 centimetres in height and weighing less than 36 kilograms must use an appropriate child restraint when travelling in cars or goods vehicles fitted with safety belts,</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>children over 3 years of age must travel in a rear seat in vehicles not fitted with safety belts,</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>rear-facing child restraints must not be used in seats protected with an active frontal air-bag, and</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>child restraint systems must conform to the standard for these systems set down in the <Col N="1671"/>relevant EU type-approval directive or UN-ECE Regulation for such systems.</P>
<P el="5" FLI="0">The Directive permits children to travel without child restraints in the rear of small public service vehicles (taxis, hackneys and limousines) if appropriate child restraints are not available. Given that child restraint systems come in five separate weight classes, it would be unreasonable to expect small public service vehicles to always have the appropriate child restraint available in their vehicle. For that reason, in making the regulations to transpose the Directive into Irish law the option in the Directive permitting children to travel without child restraints in the rear of small public service vehicles was reluctantly exercised.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the legal position, it would be my desire that owners of small public service vehicles would endeavour to provide child restraints in so far as it is practicable to do so. It is my intention to write to the Commission for Taxi Regulation requesting that he engage with the industry with a view to devising guidelines on best practice in relation to the carrying of children as passengers in small public service vehicles.</P>

    <P>In line with the NSS, the central theme of Transport 21 is the connectivity of all regions with each other. One of the objectives of Transport 21 is the improvement of a number of national secondary routes including the N52 from Dundalk to Nenagh and the N80 from Moate to Enniscorthy. The construction of the N6 Kinnegad to Athlone which is a major interurban scheme is underway for completion at the end of 2008.</P>

	<P>The CL&Aacute;R Programme, which was launched in October 2001, is a targeted investment programme for rural areas. In April this year, I extended the areas covered by the Programme and as a result, it now covers over 726,700 people in 23 counties.</P>
    <P>Under the CL&Aacute;R Non-National Roads Measure, which was co-funded with the Department of the Environment, Heritage &amp; Local Government, local authorities had the option to install flashing amber safety lights at primary schools within the original CL&Aacute;R areas. In this context, CL&Aacute;R funding in the amount of &euro;310,850 was approved for 17 local authorities in respect of 73 sets of lights, between 2002 and 2004.</P>
    <P>In 2005, I introduced a fully funded Flashing Amber Safety Lights measure for schools under CL&Aacute;R and all proposals received from the local authorities in the original CL&Aacute;R areas were approved at a total cost of just over &euro;1.7m for 242 schools. Any residual projects in the original areas, which may have been inadvertently omitted by the local authorities in the first round, can continue to be submitted.</P>
    <P>Further to this, in May 2006 I announced that funding of &euro;3m for 2006/2007 is being made available for the provision of Flashing Amber Safety Lights at all primary schools in the extended CL&Aacute;R areas that do not already have them.</P>
    <P>This measure is fully funded under the CL&Aacute;R programme and all the relevant local authorities have been asked to submit proposals for 2006. In this regard, my Department is currently examining proposals received and announcements will <Col N="1673"/>be made in due course. As this is a CL&Aacute;R Scheme it is confined to CL&Aacute;R areas. </P>

     <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
     <Quest>if top up <Col N="1674"/>grants for third level education will be available to all students in County Laois under funding provided from his Department under the LDSIP programme or other programmes for the 2006 and 2007 academic year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P Just="Left">Payment of education grants to third level students, including the Millennium Partnership Fund for Disadvantage, is a matter in the first place for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. I am informed that under the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP), some funds at local level are allocated to supplement the Millennium Partnership Fund for Disadvantage. The Deputy will be aware that at present the LDSIP is area based and does not cover the entire county of Laois.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that my intention is to establish integrated local delivery structures for local development programmes and rural development programmes, which will be capable of delivering programmes such as the LDSIP on countrywide basis, which will, in turn, enable the consideration of the payment of top up grants to students based on circumstances rather than the areas where they reside.</P>

     <Quest>further to Parliamentary Question No. 455 of 30 May 2006, if in view of the fact that his Department now pays the full rate of QAA, it will not now pay a full child dependent allowance rate; the cost of implementing such a measure; if he will review the current policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 476, 477 and 483 together.</P><Col N="1675"/>
    <P>Currently, there is provision for 2,500 participant places and a further 125 supervisor positions on the Rural Social Scheme RSS). Table 1 sets out the geographical spread of both participants and supervisors currently employed on the Scheme. The total figure (2,496) includes 112 supervisors currently employed on the RSS.</P>
    <P>Table 2 provides the geographical spread of applications for the Scheme which have been refused participation, along with the reasons for those refusals. The table also outlines the number of RSS participants who have been refused an extension to their contract under the RSS, along with the reasons involved.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the 2,500 participant places will be filled in the autumn. An amount of &euro;43.322m has been provided for the RSS this year. While no decisions have yet been made regarding funding for the Scheme, or the number of places that will be available, in 2007, I can assure the Deputies that I will be keeping this matter under close review over the coming months.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Social Welfare code, one of the qualifying conditions for entitlement to the full rate child dependant increase is that there must also be an entitlement to an increase for a qualified adult dependent. Therefore, any RSS participant currently entitled to, and receiving, an increase for an adult dependent is also receiving the full rate child dependent increase. If no QAA is paid only the half rate child dependent allowance is payable as previously. </P>

    <P>Funding for community radio stations is a matter in the first place for the stations themselves. I am informed that some funding has been made available for community radio stations under the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme and the Community Development Programme. The decision to fund such operations rests with the relevant Area Partnership or Community Partnership Company or the Community Development Project within the parameters of the programme being delivered. The possibility of funding for community radio under the Community Services Programme also exists. </P>

	<P>Entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme are calculated using the average number of animals (hectares in the case of Arable Aid Schemes) on which payment was made in the 2000 to 2002 reference years, multiplied by the 2002 payment rate.</P>
    <P>The person named submitted an application on 29 October 2004 for consideration of his circumstances under the 2nd tranche of the Force Majeure/Exceptional Circumstances measure of the Single Payment Scheme. The person named was subsequently advised that his application was deemed unsuccessful on the grounds that the circumstances outlined did not fulfil the force majeure criteria laid down in Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.</P>
    <P>The person named has recently submitted an application to appeal this decision to the Single Payment Appeals Committee. A formal letter detailing the outcome of the Committee&rsquo;s deliberation will issue to the person named within the coming weeks.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>In March I announced my intention to move to a more open market system for transferring milk quotas, which will come into effect on the 1st April 2007. I made this decision because the current restructuring model will not meet the future needs of the industry and a more effective response is required in order to meet future competitive pressures.</P>
    <P>My Department and I are progressing with the ongoing consultation process on the detailed arrangements to give effect to my decision. This has comprised of meetings with the relevant farm organisations and with representatives of the milk-processing sector and individual co-ops. The issue of future milk quota policy has also been discussed with the participating farm organisations at the partnership negotiations.</P><Col N="1685"/>
    <P>I will shortly bring forward more detailed proposals on the design of an appropriate transfer mechanism. Further consultations will take place before finalising the new system, and the operational details will be announced in good time to allow for all parties concerned to make appropriate plans before the start of the 2007/2008 milk quota year.</P>
    <P>The concerns of all dairy farmers are being considered in this process, including those with leased quota.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

     <Quest>the position in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary in relation to their entitlement to sugar beet compensation.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The compensation package negotiated as part of the agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime contains three elements.</P>
    <P>The first element is the compensation to beet growers of up to 64% of the reduction in the minimum price for beet. This compensation, which will be incorporated in the existing Single Payment Scheme from 2006, is worth approximately &euro;123m to Irish beet growers over the next seven years. My Department is currently working on the inclusion of the sugar beet compensation in the 2006 Single Payment Scheme. The task of establishing the number of additional entitlements for each producer is almost complete. The number of additional entitlements established for the person named, following the processing of the amendments submitted by him, is 4.86 entitlements. Work will shortly commence on establishing the additional amount of compensation to be added to the Single Payment. When this work is complete, the number of additional entitlements and amount due to farmers will be incorporated in their existing entitlements and Single Payment. Payment under the 2006 Single Payment Scheme will commence, in accordance with the provisions of the relevant EU Regulations, on 1 December 2006.</P><Col N="1686"/>
    <P>The second element of the compensation package is the restructuring aid covering the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota. In Ireland&rsquo;s case, this would be worth up to &euro;145m. The restructuring aid, as provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006, is subject to the submission by the processor of a detailed restructuring plan for the industry following consultations with the beet growers. The Regulation also provides that at least 10% of the restructuring aid shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors in order to compensate for losses resulting from factory closure under the restructuring scheme. That percentage may be increased by Member States after consultation of interested parties provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured. In that context, my Department in May issued an open call for submissions which will be subject to scrutiny by Indecon International Economic Consultants, who have been appointed by the Government to provide me with independent expert advice on matters relating to the implementation of the restructuring aid. A final decision on the percentage will be made shortly having regard to the independent expert advice and following the recent publication of the Commission Regulation laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the restructuring aid.</P>
    <P>The third element of the package is the diversification aid, worth almost &euro;44m in Ireland&rsquo;s case, which would be drawn down in the framework of a national restructuring programme to be prepared and submitted to the Commission by the end of the year.</P>

	<P>&euro;18.6 million in modulated funds is available this year. I have decided that this funding should be used in 2006 as a top up payment under the compensatory allowance scheme. Farmers in the disadvantaged areas, which account for 75% of the country will, therefore, benefit from a once-off payment under the scheme this year. Payments will commence in September and will involve some 100,000 beneficiaries.</P>

	<P>I propose to take questions 494 and 497 together.</P>
    <P>Under the new EU Rural Development Policy Framework an advisory service providing advice to farmers on meeting cross-compliance requirements, which are compulsory for those receiving direct payments, must be introduced in Member States by 1 January 2007. The service will provide advice on meeting statutory European requirements in relation to the environment, food safety, animal and plant health and animal welfare. Participation by farmers is voluntary but priority must be given to those receiving more than &euro;15,000 annually under the Single Farm Payment.</P>
    <P>The body/bodies selected to provide the service must have the appropriate resources in the form of qualified staff, administrative and technical facilities and advisory experience. Detailed arrangements, including the level of fees to be charged, for the provision of the service will be considered in the context of the new rural development programme which is being drawn up for the period 2007-2013.</P>

     <QRef>[27531/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Botulism is not a notifiable disease under the Diseases of Animals Acts. However, samples from animals may be submitted for testing to my Department&rsquo;s Central Veterinary Laboratory or Regional Veterinary Laboratories at the discretion of a Private Veterinary Practitioner or on request by a herd owner through a Private Veterinary Practitioner.</P>
    <P>Bovine Botulism can be contracted through contact with contaminated decomposing organic material such as poultry litter which contains poultry carcass material when spread on land grazed by cattle. In relation to the case referred to by the Deputy, the position is that my Department received reports in early May 2006 of a suspected botulism outbreak involving animals on two farms. Investigations carried out to date by my Department into the spreading of litter in the area have not established a definitive origin for the litter. Laboratory records show that two animals were submitted for postmortem from one of the herds concerned in the context of botulism. Post mortem examinations on these animals revealed no significant findings. Samples of feed and drinking water submitted by the owner as well as abomasal and ruminal contents collected at post mortem examination were frozen and retained in the Regional Veterinary Research <Col N="1691"/>Laboratory for further testing for botulinum toxin at the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory.</P>
    <P>In addition, a blood sample was submitted from the same herd, to rule out certain other conditions which could be linked to the clinical signs presented. Test results did not show any evidence of such conditions. The Animal By-Products Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002) allows poultry litter to be applied to land under certain conditions. Under this Regulation, the manager of a poultry unit is obliged to remove any carcasses from poultry litter and to send these to an approved plant for rendering.</P>
    <P>In May 2006, and in previous years, my Department wrote to dairy processors advising them about this issue and asked them to distribute to their producers an information/advisory note entitled &ldquo;Good Farming Practice with regard to Spreading Poultry Litter on Land&rdquo;. Poultry processors were also circulated with a similar information/advisory note. An &ldquo;Information Note on Botulism for Veterinary Practitioners&rdquo; and &ldquo;Instructions for Practitioners when dealing with Suspected cases of Botulism on Farm&rdquo; were also circulated to Private Veterinary Practitioners. Copies of an information/advisory note entitled &ldquo;Good Farming Practice with regard to Spreading Poultry Litter on Land&rdquo; are available to farmers from District Veterinary Offices. My Department also published, in the farming press, a notice to farmers on the spreading of poultry litter on land and the precautions which should be taken.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, my Department&rsquo;s veterinary staff has held meetings with the industry to raise awareness on the issue. I believe that the poultry industry is well aware of the issues with regard to their obligations on the safe disposal of litter and carcass material in accordance with EU Regulation 1774/2002. Indeed, sections of the industry have been very proactive in dealing with this issue and have adopted good practice procedures.</P>
    <P>My Department will be undertaking random inspections on poultry producers&rsquo; premises to ensure that the necessary procedures are being followed. Where there is evidence that this is not the case, the Department can require that all poultry litter from those premises be sent for rendering.</P>

The task of establishing the number of additional entitlements for each producer is almost complete. Work will shortly commence on establishing the additional amount of compensation to be added to the Single Payment. When this work is complete, the number of additional entitlements and amount due to farmers will be incorporated in their existing entitlements and Single Payment. Payment under the 2006 Single Payment Scheme will commence, in accordance with the provisions of the relevant EU Regulations, on 1 December 2006.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Categories A &amp; D. Category A caters for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died by 16 May 2005 and who had leased out his/her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000-2002. Category D caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year.</P>
    <P>It should be noted however that the rules governing the Single Payment Scheme stipulate that an applicant who is found to be eligible under more than one category in the Reserve may only receive an allocation of entitlements under whichever category is most beneficial to him/her. <Col N="1693"/>My Department requested additional information from the person named. On receipt of the additional information requested this case will be examined and a formal letter setting out my Department&rsquo;s decision will issue to the person named.</P>
    <P>If he is dissatisfied with my Department&rsquo;s decision in relation to the National Reserve, he then has the opportunity to appeal this decision to the Independent Payment Appeals Committee.

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 503, 510, 511 and 516 together. The compensation package negotiated as part of the agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime contains three elements.</P>
    <P>The first element is the compensation to beet growers of up to 64% of the reduction in the minimum price for beet. This compensation, which will be incorporated in the existing Single Payment Scheme and will be payable from 2006, is worth approximately &euro;123m to Irish beet growers over the next seven years.</P>
    <P>The second element of the compensation package is the restructuring aid covering the econ<Col N="1694"/>omic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota. In Ireland&rsquo;s case, this would be worth up to &euro;145m. The third element of the package is the diversification aid, worth almost &euro;44m in Ireland&rsquo;s case, which would be drawn down in the framework of a national restructuring programme to be prepared and submitted to the Commission by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Regarding the second element, the restructuring aid provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 is subject to the submission by the processor of a detailed restructuring plan for the industry following consultations with the beet growers. The Regulation also provides that at least 10% of the restructuring aid shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors in order to compensate for losses resulting from factory closure under the restructuring scheme. That percentage may be increased by Member States after consultation of interested parties provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured. In that context, my Department in May issued an open call for submissions which will be subject to scrutiny by Indecon International Economic Consultants, who have been appointed by the Government to provide me with independent expert advice on matters relating to the implementation of the restructuring aid. Those who made submissions were subsequently invited to a series of consultation meetings to afford them the opportunity to make any supplementary points regarding their submissions. This consultation process is separate from any consultations engaged in by the processor. A final decision on the percentage will be made shortly having regard to the independent expert advice and following the recent publication of the Commission Regulation laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the restructuring aid.</P>
    <P>The timescale for implementing the restructuring aid is very tight where, as in Ireland&rsquo;s case, restructuring takes place in the first year of the new regime. The Council Regulation requires that the application for restructuring aid must be made by the processor by 31 July 2006. The application must include a detailed restructuring plan for the industry. A decision on the application must then be made by the Member State by 30 September 2006 at the latest. It is my intention that the restructuring aid will be implemented in a fair and equitable manner and strictly in accordance with the relevant EU regulations.</P>

	<P>An application under the 2005 Single Farm Payment Scheme was received from the person named on 13 May 2005. Under EU legislation, in order to draw down his or her full Single Payment, an applicant must declare an eligible hectare to accompany each entitlement. In this case 42.98 entitlements had been established during the reference period with a unit value of &euro;205.55 giving a gross amount of &euro;8,834.54. As the person named declared 40.61 hectares of eligible land on the 2005 application form, the net amount due to him in 2005 was &euro;8,096.97. However, the payment which issued to the person named on 16 December 2005, &euro;1,963.08, was net of the following sums, which fell due to be recouped: &euro;5,153.22, in respect of penalties under the Arable Aid Scheme, and &euro;980.67 in respect of penalties under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the 2003 Arable Aid Scheme, the person named declared 6.86 hectares of arable silage; however, following a field inspection, no arable silage was found. The person named was, therefore, deemed to have over-claimed by 100%. Under the 2004 Arable Aid Scheme, the person named declared 7.60 of arable silage; however, again following field inspection, no arable silage <Col N="1696"/>was found and the person named was deemed to have over-declared by 100%. Following an appeal by the person named, the proposed penalties were confirmed. These are the appropriate penalties that must be applied as per the governing EU regulations.</P>

	<P>The task forces listed below have been set up on issues relating to my Department.</P>
    <P el="10">1. <i>Government Taskforce on Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD)</i></P>
<P>During the 2001 outbreak, a Government Task Force was established at an early stage to address the question of inter-Department/inter-agency coordination. The Task Force was chaired by An Taoiseach or, in his absence, by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and met early each day during the active part of the campaign and, subsequently, as required. The role of the Task Force included mobilisation of resources and the implementation and coordination of appropriate measures. The Task Force received up-to-date briefings on the position from the Minister/DAF and from other ministers, departments and agencies on issues within their areas of responsibilities. It is envisaged that a similar Task Force will be established in the event of any future threat of FMD to the island of Ireland</P>

<P>In response to the threat posed by the spread of avian influenza and the need to coordinate the development of a robust range of contingency measures, a Government Taskforce on Avian Influenza was established earlier this year. It is chaired by the Minister for Agriculture &amp; Food and, apart from this Department, includes senior representatives from the following Departments/ Agencies</P>

<P el="10">3. <i>Task Force on Agricultural Education &amp; Training</i></P>
<P>The Task Force was established in November 1999 to examine the training needs of agriculture in the context of a changing economic and social environment and to make recommendations, where appropriate, to address those needs. The report was presented to the Minister and published in July 2000.</P>
<P>There were ten members including the Chairman. The Chairman was a former Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp; Rural Development and the other members included representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp; Rural Development, ICMSA, Teagasc, IFA, Waterford Institute of Technology, Macra na Feirme, F&Aacute;S, Farm Apprenticeship Board and the Association of Private Agricultural and Horticultural Colleges.</P>
<P el="10">4. <i>The Beef Task Force</i></P>
<P>The Beef Task Force was set up in November 1998. The remit of the group was to examine and make recommendations on the future of the Beef Industry by drawing up a strategic plan of action <Col N="1699"/>for the sector covering the complete range of activities from on-farm production to processing and marketing.</P>
<P>There were 17 members on the Force, these included representatives from the Department of Agriculture, the IFA, the Irish Meat Association, ICMSA, ICOS, An Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland, SIPTU and Teagasc. The Task Force reported on the 17th June 1999.</P>
<P el="10">5. <i>The Mushroom Task Force</i></P>
<P Just="Left">The task force was set up in December 2003 to arrive at a consensus on the major issues facing the mushroom sector and to devise a timebound action plan to address those issues in order to secure the future viability of the sector. The task force published its report in May 2004. A Review Group has met four times to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the report.

 <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
 <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
 <Quest>the level of compensation available to sheep farmers in the Nephin Beg area, Newport, Co. Mayo as a consequence of having to take sheep off the mountains due to ecological and environmental damage; if her attention has been drawn to the different levels being proposed for those who are currently in the REP scheme <Col N="1700"/>and for those who are not; the level of payments; her views on whether different rates of payment create an inequality for sheep farmers on the same mountain range; the action she will take to rectify this; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
 <QRef>[27891/06]</QRef>
</Qst>

<Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>All hill sheep farmers in REPS are paid in accordance with their REPS contracts. The REP Scheme Terms and Conditions provide that REPS farmers must comply fully with Commonage Framework Plan requirements and consequently no further REPS payments are due for destocking.</P>
<P>The question of additional benefits for actions over and above the requirements of the Commonage Framework Plans is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I am aware that because of a European Court of Justice judgment, that Department is introducing additional management requirements in the Owenduff/Nephin Beg complex and that my officials have given advice on an appropriate level of payment to REPS farmers to compensate them for the actions now required of them that are not covered by the REPS payment.</P>
<P>The question of additional benefits for actions over and above the requirements of the Commonage Framework Plans for farmers not in REPS is also a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I have met farmers from the area concerned and they outlined their position to me in detail. I have since conveyed the views of this group to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

	<P>The Teagasc National Farm Survey shows that on 78% of farm holdings the farmer and/or spouse have some source of off-farm income be it from employment, pensions or social assistance. This is not the same as saying that 80 per cent of farm holdings are part-time. The same survey indicates that 62% of farms (defined by Teagasc in terms of labour units) were part-time. By contrast, the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office indicate that by their measurement (farm work is not the sole occupation of the farm owner) that 42% of farms in the State were defined as part-time. The growth of part-time farming is not unexpected. For some time, farmers have been choosing to maximise their incomes through a combination of farming and off-farm employment. This Government is committed to maintaining a core of competitive, full-time farmers, while at the same time providing an economic environment which enables smaller scale producers to avail of both on and off-farm opportunities to secure their future. Full-time farmers <Col N="1702"/>are looking to the new flexibility offered to them under decoupling to develop and intensify their commercial farm enterprises while many small-scale producers are finding that combining farming with off-farm employment is an effective way to ensure the viability of their holdings.</P>
<P>This Government is focused on ensuring that farming families have the best possible options available for them to stay on the land. That may mean as full-time farmers, if their farm size and resources are sufficient, and if they choose that option. Alternatively it may be through the combination of on-farm and off-farm income, which many small-scale producers are finding as the best route to a viable life on the land. This Government is committed to supporting and encouraging our farm families in whichever option they choose. The approach by this Government, and my own approach within CAP and WTO negotiations, is in keeping with this commitment.</P>

	<P>Increased grant-rates under the Farm Waste Management Scheme were introduced by my Department with effect from 24 March last as follows: (a) a new standard grant-rate of 60%, with 70% being available in the four Zone C counties (Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim and Monaghan) for both animal housing and slurry storage. The previous standard grant-rate for <Col N="1703"/>such work was 40%; (b) increase in the maximum eligible investment ceiling from &euro;75,000 to &euro;120,000 per holding; (c) introduction of a new 40% grant-rate for specialized equipment with specific environmental advantages subject to a maximum eligible investment of (i) &euro;80,000 in the case of decanter centrifuge systems and dry feeding systems for pigs, and (ii) &euro;40,000 in the case of specialized slurry spreading tankers and related equipment; (d) increase in the maximum eligible investment for standard mobile equipment from &euro;11,000 to &euro;15,000 with the grant-rate remaining at 20%. The price of steel used in the construction of farm buildings grant-aided under the Scheme is taken into account in my Department&rsquo;s Standard Costings which are used to determine the grants payable under the Scheme. These Costings are currently under review. Pending the outcome of that review, my Department&rsquo;s current Standard Costings are being used. I have already confirmed that the revised Costings, when introduced, will be applied to all approvals issued under the Scheme since 1 January 2006.</P>

<P>Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, manufacturers and importers of farm plastics, that is, silage bale wrap and sheeting, are required to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market or alternatively to contribute to and participate in compliance schemes to recover the waste in question. The Irish Farm Film Producers Group, IFFPG, is currently the sole approved body in Ireland for the purposes of implementing a compliance scheme for the recovery of farm plastics waste.

<Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The current negotiations on a new WTO Agreement, which cover a broad trade liberalisation agenda, have been under way since they were launched in Doha in November 2001. Significant progress towards concluding an agreement was made in the Framework Agreement which was reached in August 2004 and at the Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005. A further WTO Ministerial meeting, held from 29 June to 1 July in Geneva, failed to make progress on outstanding issues. The Director General of the WTO has now been requested to undertake intensive and wide-ranging consultations over the coming weeks with a view to facilitating agreement on these issues by the end of July. Given the wide divergences which exist between the positions of the main negotiating partners, such agreement will be difficult to achieve.</P>
<P>In accordance with the Doha mandate, among the aims of the negotiations is to reduce substantially the levels of support and protection for agriculture. A new agreement will determine the levels of support which can be provided to EU agriculture, both domestically and on exports, as well as the level of tariff protection which can be applied to imports. This in turn affects the nature and level of competition which EU producers, processors and exporters will face on EU and third country markets. The WTO negotiations represent a major challenge therefore for the future of the CAP and Irish and European agriculture.</P>
<P>While I am committed to securing a new WTO agreement, at the same time, I am determined that this will not prevent Ireland from enjoying the benefits of a CAP and EU rural development policy that protects the agriculture and food sector and which underpins the viability of rural communities. Accordingly my objective is to ensure that any new WTO agreement can be accommodated within the terms of the recent CAP reforms and that further reform will not be required. This represents the limit of the EU Commission&rsquo;s negotiating mandate as agreed, and endorsed on several occasions, by the Council of Ministers.</P>
<P>I will continue to take an active role in the negotiations and to work with like-minded Member States in seeking the best possible outcome for Irish and EU agriculture. My specific priorities are On domestic supports, to ensure that the EU&rsquo;s system of decoupled direct payments to farmers continue to qualify as non-trade-distorting payments under the so-called WTO Green Box and so remain exempt from reductions under the new round, On Export Subsidies, to ensure that full parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidies is undertaken by all WTO member countries, as agreed in the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, and to secure the most flexible phasing-out arrangements for EU export refunds, On Market Access, <Col N="1705"/>to retain the maximum possible level of protection against increased imports into the EU, especially in sectors in which Ireland has particular interests, through minimising tariff cuts, establishing sensitive product status where necessary and through the continuation of an effective Safeguard Clause.</P>

 <asker>Mr. Lowry</asker>
 <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
 <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
 <Quest>her views on the number of farmers awaiting payment under the 2005 single farm payment scheme in each county; the most common reason for delay in making payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
 <QRef>[27898/06]</QRef>
</Qst>
<Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The following table sets out the number of farmers in each county whose payments under the 2005 Single Payment Scheme had issued by 5 July 2006. The number of applications with outstanding problems, which must be solved prior to payment, is also set out. Payments are continuing to issue to farmers as their applications are processed to completion, in accordance with the EU legislation governing the Single Payment Scheme. Under this legislation, Member States may commence payment under the Single Payment Scheme on 1 December of the year of application, with payments being fully processed by the following 30 June. My priority in 2005, the first year of this new Scheme, was to maximize the number of payments to eligible applicants by the earliest date possible of 1 December and I am satisfied that this was achieved. Since then, it has been my absolute priority to ensure that the issues that are holding up the remaining cases are resolved with the applicants concerned and that payments are made without undue delay. To this end, I have arranged that payments issue on a very regular basis, as soon as the problems with the outstanding cases are resolved.</P>
<P>In common with the coupled schemes, which the Single Payment Scheme replaced, delays in processing can be caused by many factors, including incomplete application forms, errors on applications and discrepancies highlighted following computer validation, which must be resolved via correspondence with the applicant. In many cases, payment could not be made because applicants did not submit an application to transfer the Single Payment entitlements, with lands, by way of inheritance, gift, lease or purchase. Many of these applications were only received after my Department made direct contact with the farmers in question, during recent weeks, and some have yet to be submitted. In other cases, over-claims on commonage lands need to be resolved before any of the claimants concerned can be paid. Similarly, cases where given parcels are subject to dual-claims must also be resolved, before any of the parties concerned can be paid.</P><Col N="1706"/>
<P>It will be noted that the sum of the cases paid and those awaiting payment differs from the figures supplied in the reply to previous questions. As explained, these differences are accounted for by cases, which previously had no entitlements, being awarded entitlements following the processing of applications under the Inheritance, Force Majeure etc measures of the Single Payment Scheme, which were recently submitted to my Department.</P>

 <Quest>if she intends to establish a scheme for the planting of willow and other biomass crops; if she will include a facility to assist with the purchase of harvesters and chippers; if she further intends to increase the rate of the energy crop payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
 <QRef>[27994/06]</QRef>
</Qst>
<Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Plans for the introduction of a scheme to support the planting of willow are at an advanced stage, but will require EU approval. I am also aware of renewed interest among some producers in growing &lsquo;miscanthus&rsquo; as a feedstock for bioenergy purposes. My Department has received a number of proposals for the introduction of establishment grants for miscanthus and these are currently being considered.</P>
<P>In relation to biomass harvesting machinery, such as harvesters and chippers for processing of forest biomass, plans to introduce a special scheme of supports are also at an advanced stage. Again, the introduction of any such scheme will require EU approval.</P>
<P>Currently, support for the growing of energy crops is provided by way of the Energy Crops Scheme which was introduced under the reform of the CAP. Under this scheme, energy crops may qualify for aid of &euro;45 per hectare provided they are intended primarily for use in the production <Col N="1711"/>of biofuels and electric and thermal energy produced from biomass. In addition to this scheme, set aside land can be used for a variety of non-food uses including the growing of crops for energy purpose and will therefore qualify to activate set-aside entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme. The EU has agreed that sugar beet will be eligible for aid under the scheme and may also be grown as an energy crop on set aside land. The aid of &euro;45 per hectare available under the Energy Crops Scheme has proven not to be sufficiently attractive in itself to stimulate the growing of such crops. For this reason at the February Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting I called for a review of the premium and I am pleased to say that the EU Commission has undertaken to review the operation of the scheme.</P>

	<P>My Department is the competent authority in Ireland for the enforcement of EU legislation regarding genetically modified (GM) animal feed. The authorization and labelling of GM feed is governed by the GM Food and Feed Regulation (EC No.) 1829/2003. The labelling terms non GM and GM free are not defined in EU legislation and are terms that are used voluntarily by the feed industry. However, these terms are subject to general labelling requirements of animal feed which stipulates that labelling must not mislead the purchaser as to the characteristics of the feedingstuffs. I have not been engaged in any discussions at EU level on amending this Regulation and I am not aware of any proposals to do so.</P>

	<P>Following the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme last year, farmers now have the freedom to choose whatever farming <Col N="1712"/>enterprise is most appropriate to their circumstances. Under the agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime, the Single Payment Scheme is being extended to cover sugar beet compensation. The sugar reform agreement also provides for the introduction of aid for diversification measures in the event that sugar beet production completely ceases. This aid, worth almost &euro;44m, would be drawn down in the framework of a national restructuring programme. Under the Commission implementing regulation, which was published recently, Ireland will be required to provide a restructuring plan to the Commission by the end of this year.</P>

 <QRef>[28089/06]</QRef>
</Qst>
<Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation of the Nitrates Directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Minister, Deputy Roche, sent proposals to the European Commission in May for amendments to the Regulations he had made in December 2005 giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme. The new proposals, which the Minister has outlined publicly, were developed in conjunction with my Department and with the input of Teagasc. They address a range of important issues identified by submission and raised by the farming bodies.</P>
<P>There have since been direct discussions and other contacts between officials of the two Departments, Teagasc representatives and the European Commission. I understand that those discussions are now close to being concluded successfully. I am satisfied that the outcome will be of major benefit to Irish farmers, in that the changes being discussed with the Commission will provide them with greater flexibility in complying with fertiliser limits and simplify certain aspects of the Regulations.</P>
<P>Once the discussions on the Regulations are concluded, my priority is to proceed with negotiations on a derogation to allow certain farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kgs of organic nitrogen per hectare. The derogation proposal was given an initial presentation to the EU Nitrates Committee in December 2005 and there were bilateral discussions with the Commission in January, but no further progress was possible while the Regu<Col N="1713"/>lations were under review. The proposal will have to be discussed further at future meetings of the Nitrates Committee before approval can be obtained.</P>

 <Quest>the controls to be put in place in order to support the Irish beef industry against the threat of imports from developing countries; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
 <QRef>[28090/06]</QRef>
</Qst>
<Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the current WTO discussions in the Council, I have pressed very strongly the non-trade aspect of market access, which I regard as a crucial element in the overall negotiations. I have taken every opportunity to remind the Commission of the importance of equivalence in standards, particularly in relation to all exporting countries, including Brazil.</P>
<P>As a member of the EU and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Ireland is in a position to avail of opportunities for trade that are essential for the development of our open economy. Membership of these organizations also brings reciprocal trade obligations. All imports into the EU must come from third countries or areas of third countries that have been approved by the EU authorities for export to the EU.</P>
<P>I fully support the policy that animal products imported into the EU from Third Countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, EU Member States. In this context I have been in direct contact with the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr Markos Kyprianou concerning the sanitary rules applying to the import of livestock products, especially beef, into the European Union.</P>
<P Just="Left">The Commissioner has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants. He has pointed to the adoption of safeguard measures in relation to imports, for example in the matter of dealing with the risk to the EU of the spread of high pathogenic avian influenza, in the finding of residues of unauthorised substances in poultry meat and in the quick and proportionate protective measures applied to imports of beef as a result of the recent outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), demonstrating the Commission&rsquo;s primary objective of maintaining the high sanitary status of the Community and respecting the EU&rsquo;s commitment under the WTO Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS agreement).</P><Col N="1714"/>
<P Just="Left">An EU Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) inspection to evaluate animal health and public health control systems, traceability and certification procedures in place in Brazil was carried out in September of last year. In December the FVO completed a second mission that year to evaluate the control of residues and contaminants in live animals and animal products, including controls on veterinary medical products in that country. The FVO recently published its findings following a period of consultation with the competent Brazilian authorities. These reports, as well as all previous FVO reports on inspection of third countries&rsquo; controls for export, may be accessed from the EU Commission&rsquo;s website.</P>
<P Just="Left">The reports comment on the structure, organisation and tasks of the Competent Brazilian Authorities and have listed a number of recommendations to the authorities to address deficiencies, some of which are of long standing, recorded in the course of the FVO audits. The Commission has confirmed to my Department that the action plans in question have now been received and that they are being assessed by the FVO. The FVO will report on its assessments to the European Commission and, where action is considered necessary to ensure the safety of food and the protection of consumers and animals in the EU, that appropriate proposals would be formulated and submitted to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on which My Department is represented.</P>
<P Just="Left">I have more recently brought to the attention of the Commission the findings of an Irish delegation of farmers and journalists who visited the meat producing regions in Brazil and my Department is seeking assurances from the Commission that the FVO will undertake further missions to Brazil to evaluate the implementation of its action plan. At a recent meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health where the matter was again raised by Ireland, the Commission indicated to Ireland that an FVO mission is being planned to take place some time before the end of the summer.</P>

 <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
 <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
 <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that only approximately 3 percent of the Border, Midlands and Western Regions is not included in the disadvantaged areas, but that a significant portion of this is in Laois and Offaly; if she plans to address this issue;; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
 <QRef>[28095/06]</QRef>
</Qst>
<Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the possible extension of Ireland&rsquo;s Disadvantaged Areas to include the Border midland Western region was raised with the European Commission in 2003 <Col N="1715"/>and in early 2004. The Commission cautioned however, that a formal request for an extension of the Disadvantaged Areas could lead to Ireland being asked for justification as to whether or not all if its existing areas classified as Disadvantaged continue to meet the criteria.</P>
<P>In mid 2004 the Commission published a draft Regulation on Rural Development which included a new Disadvantaged Areas definition concentrating on significant natural handicaps, notably a low soil productivity or poor climate conditions and where maintaining an extensive farming activity is important for the management of the land. The proposals did not mention the current criteria such as low productivity (as measured by farm incomes) and percentage of the working population in farming.</P>
<P Just="Left">Following negotiations at the Council of Ministers the Council agreed on 20 June 2005 a new framework for rural development for the period 2007-2013 which provided for the maintenance of the existing arrangements for Disadvantaged Areas until 2010. Before then, the Commission will present a report and proposals to the Council concerning the future payments system and designation of these areas. The question of extension of the Disadvantaged Areas to include all Border Midland Western regions in Ireland can be considered in the context of that review.</P>

<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are no fixed speed cameras in operation in the Garda Districts of Clonmel, Cahir and Tipperary town. Portable speed laser equipment is used by Garda personnel to detect speeding offences and a GATSO mobile unit operates within the areas referred to.</P>
<P>I am further informed that in the Tipperary Garda Division, as in every Garda Division, certain areas are identified as collision prone locations. This information is incorporated into <Col N="1716"/>the collision prevention programme whereby An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in conjunction with the local authority, examines each location from an enforcement and engineering perspective. This location may then require action on the part of the local authority or increased enforcement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
<P>Statistics are not compiled in such a way as to establish the number of speed checks conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the areas referred to, and it would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources to collate the information requested.</P>

<P>The small claims limit was subsequently increased from &euro;1,269.74 to &euro;2,000 with effect from 7th February 2006 (SI 4 of 2006). While I am satisfied that the new limit is appropriate, the matter will be kept under review in my Department.</P>

	<P>At the outset I should advise the Deputy that the Public Appointments Service (PAS) is responsible for the administration of the application process as well as Stage 1 (aptitude testing) and Stage 2 (interview) of the Garda recruitment process. Stage 3, which includes a medical examination and physical competence test, is administered by the Garda authorities.</P>
<P>However, I can advise the Deputy that the Garda authorities have informed me that a file regarding the person referred to is currently being processed and it is anticipated that the file will be finalised shortly. I am further informed that some applications from the 2004 competition are still being processed.</P>
<P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. The first group of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and the second such group did so on the 8th of June. Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.</P>

    <P>I have been further informed that the personnel strength of the Carlow/ Kildare Division as at 30 June, 2006 was 361 (all ranks).

In addition, I would point out to the Deputy that the Division&rsquo;s resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.

	<P>The person concerned was granted a C visit visa to enter the State for a period of three months. It now appears that she is seeking an extension of her permission to remain in the State.

    <P>A wrap-around information sheet accompanies every visa application form. That sheet makes it clear to the applicant that, in general, persons granted visas for particular purposes are not permitted to remain in the State for any purpose other than that for which the visa was granted.

He or she is also required to declare that the information supplied is correct and complete.</P>
    <P>A C Visa is granted for visits of less than 90 days.

    <P FLI="0">In addition, I would point out to the Deputy that the Division&rsquo;s resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
    <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. The first group of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and the second such group did so on the 8th of June. Further tranches of approximately <Col N="1726"/>275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of North Tipperary will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 554 to 556, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 295 of 1 February, 2006. The extensive Garda review of the case was substantively completed in March 2005, at which point I received an interim report from the Garda authorities. Nothing has emerged as a result of that Garda review which would justify the holding of an inquiry, public or private, into the murder. I caused this and other information to be communicated in writing to both the solicitor acting on behalf of the victim&rsquo;s family and directly to a family member in October and November 2005, respectively. I do not propose to publish or otherwise release the interim Garda report.</P>
    <P>In relation to the outstanding matter of a mutual assistance request made of the British authorities, this has not yet been executed. However, I understand that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been in direct contact with the Police Service of Northern Ireland and that the Garda authorities anticipate that all information sought will be made available in due course. I have already given a commitment to the family&rsquo;s solicitor and a family member that I will be in further contact with the solicitor as soon as all additional information is available and has been assessed and a final Garda report submitted to me.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Garda investigation into the murder remains open and that any further lines of inquiry arising from new information from whatever quarter will be actively pursued by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government remains committed, in close co-operation with the Finucane family, to seeking to secure the holding of a full public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane. Moreover, the Government remains concerned about persistent reports of collusion between security forces and paramilitaries in Northern Ireland, and these issues are consistently raised with the British Government.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 which has been passed by both Houses makes specific provisions in relation to attacks on emergency workers. Section 185 of the Bill amends section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 in order to apply the existing offence of assaulting or obstructing a peace officer (or any person assisting them) to other emergency workers. Section 185 of the Criminal Justice Bill expands the current definition of &lsquo;peace officer&rsquo; which is a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Defence Forces or prison officers acting in the execution of their duty, to include members of the fire brigade and ambulance personnel in order to put them on the same footing as, for example, the Garda&iacute; and give them the same protection.</P>
    <P>In addition the Bill further amends section 19 in order to create specific offences of threatening, assaulting, resisting, wilfully obstructing or impeding doctors, dentists, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, other health service workers and any persons assisting them in or at a hospital.</P>
    <P>The penalties in relation to an offence under section 19 of the 1994 Act are also being increased. The maximum penalty on indictment for assault or threats to commit assault will be a fine and/or 7 years imprisonment, up from 5 years. The penalty on summary conviction will be a fine of up to &euro;5,000 (currently &pound;1,000) and/or 12 months imprisonment. With regard to the offence of wilful obstruction or impeding health service workers the maximum penalty on summary conviction will be a fine of &euro;2,500 (currently &pound;500) and/or 6 months imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Although the law already provides for a range of assault type offences, for example, under the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, I believe the special demands of acting in an emergency situation necessitate explicit statutory protection for this essential group of workers and those assisting them. That is why I brought forward my proposals to extend the existing offences relating to assaulting or obstructing peace officers to other workers providing emergency services. I am pleased that the Houses have agreed my proposals. I intend to commence these provisions without delay once the Bill has been signed by the President.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in recent times there have been three incidents of a particularly serious nature involving attacks on emergency personnel. These incidents are being actively investigated by the Garda authorities, and a person has been arrested and charged in respect of one of these incidents.</P>
    <P>In October 2000 Garda&iacute; met Dublin Fire Brigade personnel regarding the issue of Garda response to fire brigade personnel under attack or threat of attack. This resulted in an action plan being drawn up to ensure a rapid and effective response to deal with incidents where Dublin Fire Brigade personnel find themselves under attack or threat of attack. I am assured by the Garda authorities that there is a good working relationship between the Garda authorities and the Dublin Fire Brigade service, with immediate assistance and support provided to the service when requested.</P>

     <Quest>if he has given due consideration to extending the retirement age for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 60; if he accepts that such an approach would provide an additional pool of experienced officers at little cost because of deferment of pension costs; and if he now proposes to make this change.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The current position is that members of ranks in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na up to and including Inspector, who were recruited to the Force prior to 1 April, 2004, must retire at 57 years of age. Members recruited after that date may serve until 60, subject to an annual check after the age of 55 on fitness to serve.</P>
    <P>In the context of the establishment of a Garda Reserve, I have said that I see merit in considering an increase in the retirement age of pre-2004 members of Garda, Sergeant and Inspector ranks from 57 to 60 to facilitate the supervision and mentoring of reserve members by members of those ranks. I will be discussing this with the Commissioner in finalising preparations for the establishment of the Reserve.</P>

    <P FLI="0">This represents an increase of 61 (or 20%) in the number of Garda personnel assigned to the Waterford/ Kilkenny Division during that period.</P>
    <P>In addition, I would point out to the Deputy that the Division&rsquo;s resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units.</P>
    <?oasys _dc14- ?><P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a <Col N="1736"/>priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P><?oasys _dc0- ?>
    <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to <Col N="1737"/>14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. The first group of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and the second such group did so on 8 June. Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Waterford/Kilkenny Division will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

	<P>One entity established under my Department&rsquo;s aegis since 1997 was described as a taskforce &mdash; the Youth Justice Taskforce.</P>
    <P>The remit of the taskforce was to: examine the scope for rationalising and restructuring the State&rsquo;s youth justice services; carry out an analytical review and scoping exercise, nationally and internationally; consult with relevant Departments, Government Agencies and Non-governmental bodies; examine developments at national and international level with a focus on youth crime and appropriate interventions; make recommendations for any reforms for the delivery of a seamless service in the youth justice area.</P>
    <P Just="Left">In October 2004 the Government endorsed a joint initiative by myself and the Minister for Children to set up an internal project team to review the Irish youth justice system which was to report by Summer 2005. The team was headed by Ms. Sylda Langford, now Director General of the Office of the Minister for Children, and comprised a small number of officials from my Department. The taskforce completed its work <Col N="1740"/>and submitted its report in 2005. Following examination of its recommendations by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and a subsequent submission to the Government, the report was published in January 2006.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also wish to refer to previous Parliamentary Questions regarding working groups and other such groups, for example, Parliamentary Question Number 305 of 17 May, 2005.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the number of cases handled by the Probation Service from 2000 to date in 2006 are as set out in the tables. The Deputy should be aware that the statistics for 2005 are subject to review due to refinements and upgrading currently underway on the case tracking system of the Probation Service. The final outturns for 2005 are expected to be confirmed in the coming weeks. The Deputy should also be aware that the figures for 2006 to date are provisional.</P><Col N="1739"/>

	<P>Neighbourhood Watch was established in 1985 as a crime prevention measure for urban areas. There are approximately 2,600 Neighbourhood Watch schemes in operation throughout the country. Since its establishment, the Garda authorities have sought to encourage the active participation of the public in Neighbourhood Watch by encouraging and supporting communities to establish and maintain such <Col N="1742"/>initiatives. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been a strategic partner in driving and supporting Neighbourhood Watch through its Community Relations Section and local Garda management, and has deployed Crime Prevention Officers and Liaison Garda&iacute; to assist schemes.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are approximately 30 active Neighbourhood Watch schemes in Waterford City, which cover most of the city. All of these schemes are actively supported by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 436 to 443, inclusive and 445 and 446 together which were answered on 20 June 2006 in which I advised that I had established a new Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime in March 2005 to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future and to disburse funding for victim support measures.</P>
    <P>I take it that the request to me to reconsider the funding application submitted by the Missing in Ireland Support Service for &euro;71,000 as mentioned in the question refers to the funding application made by that organisation to the Commission for the Support for Victims of Crime rather than to any application made to me or my Department.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the Commission received a funding application in April 2005 from Missing in Ireland Support Service for &euro;71,600 to establish, <Col N="1745"/>staff and operate a helpline for missing persons. After careful consideration of the application the Commission decided to offer funding of &euro;25,000. However, this offer was rejected by the Missing in Ireland Support Service. No request was made to the Commission from Missing in Ireland Support Service to reconsider the funding allocated in 2005. The funding allocation from the Commission for 2005 was fully allocated in that year. It should be borne in mind in this context that the Commission is charged with funding support services for victims of crime, and that, while some persons who are missing are crime victims, most are not.</P>
    <P>I am also advised that the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime in April, 2006 invited applications from organisations providing services to victims of crime, for a funding allocation for 2006. It was open to the Missing in Ireland Support organisation to make such an application. I am advised that no application has been received by the Commission to date.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I understand that although the closing date for applications has passed, if the Missing in Ireland Support Service organisation wished to make a late application and make a case for the allocation of some funding for 2006 from the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime, any such application would be carefully considered on its own merits by the Commission.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the Commission is entirely independent in the performance of its functions and I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment or intervene in any way with a decision taken by the Commission in relation to the allocation of funding.</P>
    <P>As indicated in an earlier Parliamentary Question No. 701 of 23 March 2006 it remained open to Missing in Ireland Support Service to make an application to my Department for assistance if it so wished. As I understand it no request for funding by Missing in Ireland Support Service has been made to my Department to date. If my Department is approached with a good business case and tight financing proposals, the proposal will be carefully considered on its merit.</P>

Two of the remaining recommendations, i.e. that remand inmates be kept separate from convicted inmates, and that St Patrick&rsquo;s be replaced with a new building which has proper open space, playing fields, activities and regimes suitable for the age group, will be achieved through the development of the proposed new prison complex at Thornton, County Dublin.</P>
    <P>The remaining four recommendations relate to the opening of the new workshops and the B Division facilities. An enhanced industrial staffing structure for the newly refurbished workshops has been agreed. The agreed structure comprises of an Industrial Manager, four Industrial Supervisors and twelve Assistant Industrial Supervisors. Arrangements to fill the posts in question are now in train. The Industrial Manager has already been appointed while the four Industrial Supervisors will be in position shortly. Of the twelve Assistant Industrial Supervisors, three are already in place. The remaining vacancies will be filled by way of internal competitions over the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 597 and 601 together.</P>
    <P>Castlebar is one of the 17 remaining locations nationwide which form part of the Garda CCTV programme. As part of this programme 17 Garda Town Centre CCTV Systems will be implemented in the following locations: Athlone, Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Kinsale, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght, Tullamore and Waterford City.</P>
    <P>As I indicated previously I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of this CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard. I believe that the answer is to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the Garda authorities are currently finalising a comprehensive and detailed Request for Tender (RFT) for the outsourced service provision of these 17 Garda CCTV systems, including Castlebar. Once finalised, this RFT will be subject to a peer review process by the Department of Finance. My Department and the Garda authorities have consulted with the Department of Finance with a view to preparing for the required peer review process in respect of this procurement. Following the successful con<Col N="1748"/>clusion of this review it is intended to issue the Request for Tender.</P>
    <P>My ambition is to have a Garda CCTV system operating in Castlebar and in the other 16 locations at the earliest opportunity, subject to compliance with relevant procurement legislation and procedures.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy of the current policy regarding family reunification. He will be aware that at present there is no specific legislation governing family reunification for migrants who are not refugees. There is a set of administrative procedures in place for non-refugees. There was a review of the provisions regarding family reunification for migrant workers in February of this year and the current arrangements for the processing of such applications are as follows: a non-EEA national who is not visa required and is working in the State on an employment permit or under the work authorisation scheme may apply for family reunification (spouse, minor child) immediately; a non-EEA national who is visa required and working in the State under the Working Visa Scheme may apply for family reunification (spouse, minor child) <Col N="1750"/>immediately; a non-EEA national who is visa required and is working on an employment permit and working in an occupation included in the working visa/work authorisation scheme may apply for family reunification (spouse, minor child) immediately; a non-EEA national who is visa required and is working in the State on an employment permit may apply for family reunification (spouse, minor child) on condition that he/she has been working here for at least 12 months and is likely to remain so for a similar period, i.e. the work permit has been renewed. The earnings criteria which apply to such applications are detailed on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
    <P>Data is not currently collated in a manner which would allow my Department to provide definitive figures in this area. I will be considering the issue of family reunification in the context of the forthcoming Immigration and Residence Bill. Work is at an advanced stage in INIS on the delivery of a number of major IT projects which will substantially enhance the area of data collection.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to any outcomes under provisions in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 which allow for the reporting of family law court proceedings and for persons approved for such purposes to attend and be present at family law court sittings.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the Court Service, in the context of its proposal to commence family law reporting arrangements on a pilot basis in a selected number of High, Circuit and District Courts, has recently invited proposals from suitable persons for the provision of family law reports, judgments, trends and other statistical information in those courts. I look forward to reports etc being made available in due course.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I relaxed the in camera rule on 1 July 2005 by making the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 (Section 40(3)) Regulations 2005 (S. I. No. 337 of 2005) which allow certain classes of persons to attend family court sittings, subject to Ministerial approval, in order to draw up and publish reports. Approval is subject to certain safeguards including a requirement that the parties to a case or any relevant child would not be identifiable. Under the scheme, I have already approved several persons engaged in family law research who were nominated by a body specified in the Schedule to S.I.

	<P>Under section 16 of the Data Protection Act 1988, certain categories of data controller are required formally to register with the Data Protection Commissioner. This requirement currently applies to public representatives who retain sensitive personal data relating to identifiable individuals. However, section 16 of the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003 makes provision for revised registration requirements. In particular, it provides that registration will not apply to categories of data controller specified in regulations to be made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform following consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I have recently approved the drafting of new registration regulations and they are currently being prepared by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. They will provide, inter alia, that candidates for and holders of elective political office who process personal data for the purpose of electoral activities or for the purpose of providing advice or assistance will be exempt from registration.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 19 December, 2002 and applied for asylum. Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, she was informed by letter dated 8 September, 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her. She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order. Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
    <P>This person&rsquo;s case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement). I expect the file to be passed to me for decision in due course.</P>

    <P>It is a requirement under this scheme that each applicant is the parent of an Irish child born before 1 January 2005. The first named person did not provide evidence of being the parent of an Irish born child. On this basis, his application for permission to remain in the State under the IBC/05 scheme was refused. The first named person was notified of this decision on 14 November 2005. When the first named person&rsquo;s immigration status is being reviewed, he will then have an opportunity to make representations as to his continued presence in the State.</P>

	<P>The first named applicant arrived in the State on 10 July 2003 and applied for asylum on 11 July 2003. She was granted refugee status on 14 September 2004. The second named applicant arrived in the State on 8 November 2003, applied for asylum on 11 November 2003 and was granted refugee status on 12 August 2004. Both persons applied for certificates of naturalisation on 28 January 2005.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that an applicant for naturalisation must have one year&rsquo;s period of continuous residence in the State before the date of the application and a total amounting to four year&rsquo;s residence in the State in the eight year&rsquo;s preceding that period.</P>
    <P>Section 16(g) of that Act provides that I may, in my absolute discretion, waive the statutory conditions in certain circumstances, including where the applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. In considering applications under this provision, I am generally disposed to waive two years of the normal residency requirement, thereby requiring such applicants to have been resident in the State for three years at the time of application. The calculation of the three year period commences from the date the applicant arrived in the State to seek refugee status.</P>
    <P>As there were no circumstances apparent in either application which would lead me to depart from the general policy outlined above, I decided to refuse the applications based on the fact that the applicants were not in the State three years at the time of the application. The reason for my refusal was disclosed to the first and second named applicants in the letters of 22 November <Col N="1759"/>2005 and 19 October 2005 respectively informing them of my decision.</P>
    <P>Assuming that both individuals have been resident in the State continuously since their arrival here in 2003, the first named person will have the necessary residency on 11 July 2006. The second named person will have the necessary residence on 8 November 2006. If the two persons concerned decide to submit new applications in the future, any such applications will be considered against the statutory and administrative provisions in operation at the time the applications are submitted.</P>

    <P>As part of an investigation into this matter the daughter was interviewed in 2005 when it was concluded that she was in fact more than 18 years of age at the date of application.</P>
    <P>A conclusion was reached therefore that the person previously approved for a visa could not have been a minor daughter of the person concerned at the date application for family reunification. Without substantial new information I see no reason to review this decision.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I would refer the Deputy to my Replies to Dail Questions Nos. 244 of 25 May 2006 and 180 of 22 June 2006.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the person concerned is that she has failed to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, as she is legally obliged to do, and, as such, she is currently residing illegally in the State.</P>
    <P>In the interests of clarity, I wish to emphasise again that the person concerned is not being returned to her country of origin, Rwanda, but rather is being transferred to the United Kingdom where she previously lodged an asylum application. In accordance with the Dublin II Regulations, and to uphold the integrity of the asylum and immigration processes in this State, it is entirely appropriate that the person concerned should be transferred to the United Kingdom to have her asylum claim determined there.</P>
    <P>In relation to the medical and protection needs of the person concerned, it can hardly be argued that the United Kingdom&rsquo;s welfare, medical and social protection systems are inferior to ours or that any international protection she requires cannot be provided by the authorities in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Given the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns for the medical condition of the person concerned, I can assure the Deputy that her transfer to the United Kingdom will be handled with sensitivity and care. Indeed, if the Deputy has up to date information on the medical status of the person concerned, my Officials will be happy to pass on any such medical reports to the authorities in the United Kingdom, prior to her transfer, so that her medical needs can be taken fully into account in the context of her transfer to the United Kingdom. Furthermore, if necessary, I would be happy to provide the person concerned with medical escorts during her journey.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s contention that the person concerned left the United Kingdom and returned to Rwanda, such information should <Col N="1761"/>have been presented to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which is the determining body in the context of cases falling within the terms of the Dublin II Regulation, prior to that Office&rsquo;s determination in the case of the person concerned. It might be noted that when the person concerned was asked in her Applicant Questionnaire if she had ever travelled outside of her country of origin before, she answered &lsquo;No&rsquo;. Equally, in responding to the question as to whether she had applied for refugee status anywhere else, she answered &lsquo;No&rsquo;. Clearly these responses reflect a lack of truthfulness on the part of the person concerned as she had previously claimed asylum in the United Kingdom on 4 March 2003, albeit under a different name and date of birth. The Deputy might wish to note that my role, and the role of my Department, in the Dublin II process is to effect transfers on the basis of determinations made by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The decision to transfer the person concerned to the United Kingdom to have her asylum claim examined in that State is in strict accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation and, as such, it is my intention to have this transfer effected at an early date.</P>

    <P Just="Left">The Deputy can be assured that My Department fully recognises the key role of physical exercise within the school environment and continues to respond to the need to improve PE facilities for all pupils attending primary and post-primary schools. The provision of such facilities is an integral part of the design process for new school buildings or where an existing school building is undergoing major refurbishment.</P>
    <P>In primary schools new PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as part of any major building programme. Regarding specific sports equipment grants, in recent years, my Department has provided in excess of &euro;5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools specifically for this purpose to enable them to provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Such materials and equipment would normally have a useful life of several years.</P>
    <P>Schools may use their general capitation funding to support the implementation of curricula including Physical Education. Also, all primary schools with permanent recognition receive an annual Minor Works Grant from my Department. Each school gets a standard rate of &euro;3,809 together with a per pupil rate of &euro;12.70. Special Schools and schools with special classes receive an enhanced per pupil rate of &euro;50.80 It is open to school management authorities to use this devolved grant for the purchase of equipment, including physical education equipment, provided it is not required for more urgent works.</P>
    <P>Primary schools that establish a class for special needs pupils receive a once-off grant of &euro;6,500 <Col N="1763"/>per class to purchase equipment, including physical education equipment, that they feel best meets the needs of the pupils attending the class.</P>
    <P>My Department also considers applications for additional grant aid for such equipment where schools can demonstrate that the minor works grant funding is insufficient for this purpose.</P>

	<P>The Home/School/Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) is a major mainstream preventative strategy targeted at pupils at risk of not reaching their potential in the educational system because of background characteristics which tend to affect adversely pupil attainment and school retention. The scheme is concerned with establishing partnership and collaboration between parents and teachers in the interests of children&rsquo;s learning. It focuses directly on the salient adults in children&rsquo;s educational lives and seeks indirect benefits for the children themselves.</P>
    <P>Currently, 370 local co-ordinators are assigned to 309 primary and 204 post primary schools in disadvantaged areas to work with school staff, parents and relevant community agencies in advancing the educational interests of children. Each co-ordinator acts as a link between home and school, encouraging parents to become more involved in their children&rsquo;s education. The co-ordinator organises locally based activities aimed at encouraging greater contact between parents and teachers and liaises with local voluntary and statutory groups in the area. A Co-ordinator usually services more that one school in an area. The total cost of the HSCL scheme in 2005 was in the region of &euro;21.9 million.</P>
    <P>Under DEIS, the new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, HSCL services will be extended to the 200 post primary and 320 urban/town primary schools, serving communities with the highest concentration of disadvantage, that do not currently have the service. The whole rationale behind the new DEIS programme is to ensure that the most disadvantaged schools benefit from all of the available supports.</P>

    <P>Targeted early childhood education provision is a key element of the School Support Prog<Col N="1766"/>ramme (SSP) under the new action plan for educational inclusion DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), which provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage. As a result of the identification process, 840 schools have been invited to participate in the new Programme. These comprise 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools.</P>
    <P>The objective in relation to early childhood education is to concentrate actions initially on those children aged from three up to school enrolment, who will subsequently attend the 180 urban/town primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities. My Department will work in partnership with other departments and agencies to complement and add value to existing childcare programmes in disadvantaged communities, with a view to ensuring that the overall care and education needs of the children concerned are met in an integrated manner. The Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education will provide advice on the future development and direction of pre-school measures for children in disadvantaged communities and the findings of a number of evaluation reports on Early Start prepared by the Education Research Centre will be taken into account in this regard.</P>
    <P>In December 2005, the Office of the Minister for Children was established to maximise the co-ordination of policies for children and young people and will have a range of functions previously under the Departments of Health and Children; Justice Equality and Law Reform; and Education and Science. A new Early Years Education Policy Unit has been established within my Department and will be co-located with the Office of the Minister for Children. This Unit will oversee the preparation of plans for phased implementation of the early childhood education dimension of DEIS in the targeted school communities, starting in the next school year, and this will be pursued within an overall strategic policy framework developed by the Office of the Minister for Children.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary source of information on retention available within my Department is the Post-Primary Pupil Database. Cohort analysis of the pupil records on this database allows for monitoring of retention through the publicly-aided second-level school system. To date, two retention reports have been published covering four cohorts of students &mdash; those who entered <Col N="1767"/>second-level education between 1993 and 1996. Of those students who entered in 1996, 94.6% of them sat the Junior Certificate examination. When adjustments were made to account for departure to private institutions, the Leaving Certificate retention rate for the 1996 cohort of students was 81.3%.</P>
    <P>As regards those who complete the Junior Certificate but who depart from second-level education prior to the Leaving Certificate, the available statistical evidence indicates that the increasing range of further education and training opportunities available for these students is having a positive impact. Data provided by Eurostat show that the educational profile of 20-24 year olds in Ireland has improved steadily over the last five years, as increasing opportunities have been made available in the further education and training sector. By 2005, according to the latest Eurostat figures, a provisional estimate of 86.1% of 20-24 year olds had attained upper second-level education (or equivalent), up from 82.4% in 2000. This indicates that there has been an increase in the proportion of young people with at least the Leaving Certificate or equivalent. Indeed, the level of educational attainment of Irish young people is ahead of the EU average on that measure.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken a number of initiatives in recent years to encourage more of our young people to finish school, including the setting up of the National Education Welfare Board and the provision of extra supports for those at risk of dropping out through the School Completion Programme and Home School Community Liaison Scheme. Also, under the new action plan for educational inclusion (DEIS initiative) which I launched in May 2005, extra resources are being provided to schools serving the most disadvantaged communities to help them to improve their retention rates.</P>
    <P>This Government has pursued a dual strategy of both encouraging more young people to finish school and ensuring much greater second chance and further education opportunities for those who left school early. This kind of strategy ensures that young people are empowered to achieve their full potential, be that by sitting the Leaving Cert or by pursuing qualifications through other pathways such as Youthreach or FAS apprenticeships which may be more appropriate to their individual interests. Thus, it is important that the Deputy appreciate that looking at just the level of retention in the formal school system is not a fair assessment of the educational attainment of our young people</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, in its advice submitted to me in April 2005, recommends that the practice of standardised testing which is currently well established in primary schools should be built upon and that all pupils should be tested in literacy and numeracy at the end of first or beginning of second class and at the end of fourth or beginning of fifth class.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the NCCA&rsquo;s advice since I believe that standardised testing, carried out on a systematic basis, has great potential to enhance the quality of teaching and learning for our students at classroom level, and to provide valuable information for parents about their children&rsquo;s learning. However, to reap the full benefits of standardised testing, it is essential that a range of supports are put in place for teachers and parents in advance of introducing a requirement on schools to conduct tests.</P>
    <P>In that context, the NCCA is preparing guidelines which will assist schools in developing and implementing a policy on assessment practice in classrooms and on reporting to parents. These will be available during the 2006/7 school year.</P>
    <P>The NCCA is also developing guidelines in specific subjects which will provide teachers with information on what to assess in individual subjects of the Primary School Curriculum and how to use assessment information to plan for children&rsquo;s future learning in that subject.</P>
    <P>A national report card for recording and reporting data on pupils&rsquo; attainment to parents is also being developed by the NCCA. This will be piloted in a number of schools in 2006/7 and available to all schools in the following year. Significant funding to support the initiative has been provided for in the 2006 Estimates.</P>
    <P>My Department is making ongoing progress in exploring potential implementation models, including dates, for the introduction of the requirement in schools. Another key consideration is how the in-service needs of teachers with regard to standardised testing can best be met. My intention is that we will proceed carefully but as quickly as possible to ensure that the recommendations proposed by the NCCA are implemented in a way that has positive benefits for children, parents, teachers and the system as a whole.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas including the impact of inward migration and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</P>
    <P>In planning for school provision to meet these demands my Department has adopted an area based approach which involves a public consultation process involving all interested parties. This leads to the production of a blueprint for schools&rsquo; development in an area for a timeframe of approximately ten years. The exercise recently completed on the N4-M4 corridor is an example of this and the rapidly developing areas of north Dublin, south Louth, east Meath will be examined this year. This structured process will ensure a more proactive approach to school planning than had been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>Apart from the area development planning process my Department is also proactively engaged with local authorities on a continual basis in relation to specific areas. This is being done through improved contacts and communication protocols to ensure that the Department is better alerted about new and expanding residential areas and afforded an opportunity to ensure appropriate zoning provision for educational purposes.</P><Col N="1771"/>
    <P>For example in the case of the Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) at Adamstown my Department is working closely with South Dublin County Council and the developers to produce an integrated solution to education and community facilities that matches the delivery of new housing. Under the SDZ arrangements there is a requirement that schools are in position ahead of or in line with demand, and I think it is one that should be adopted by other planning authorities in relation to major new housing schemes.</P>
    <P>My Department is working particularly closely with Fingal County Council to develop a joint approach to the timely provision of schools in an area of the country subject to extremely rapid development. This work is likely to provide innovative approaches to partnership which I believe can be used to advantage across the country in future.</P>
    <P>My Department prioritises school buildings for rapidly developing areas. This is achieved by assigning them a band one priority rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects. Whenever possible, my Department implements a standardised design model or a design and build process to fast track delivery of the buildings themselves. Not alone does this result in speedier delivery of projects but it also achieves savings in design fees and land use arising from the use of the two storey design. Among schools completed using one of these processes is Griffeen Valley in Lucan which was completed in a 13 month timeframe.</P>
    <P>The level of work being done under the schools building programme is at an all-time high. While increased investment is a central reason for this &mdash; &euro;500m this year alone &mdash; radical changes in how projects are planned and managed have also made a major difference in ensuring that provision is delivered in line with or ahead of demand.</P>

     <Quest>the procedures which are in place to assist primary schools in dealing with substantial numbers of new Irish pupils for whom English may not be their first language; her views on whether there may be a case for English as a foreign language in some such schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>Ensuring that all children get the support that they need to do well at school is a major priority for this Government. In order to ensure that children whose first language is not English can succeed at school, my Department gives additional support to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional temporary teacher posts or portions of teacher posts.</P><Col N="1772"/>
    <P>The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of non-English speaking students enrolled. Recent years have seen a significant rise in the number of language support posts being provided by my Department. In the 2005-06 school year, 563 whole-time equivalent language support teachers were in place at primary level and 263 whole-time equivalent teachers were in place at second level to support such pupils, representing an investment of &euro;47 million.</P>
    <P>This compares to 149 and 113 teachers respectively in the school year 2001/02. Thus, there has been a four-fold increase in language support teachers at primary level in just 4 years.</P>
    <P>So the Government has been increasing resources in this area in line with rising demand. However, this is a relatively new area and as such must be kept under review to ensure that children are getting the support that they need and that this support is proving effective in helping them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently reviewing the supports available to schools to support children whose first language is not English. In that context we are particularly looking at the pressures on those schools that have a great number of children whose first language is not English.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that two weeks ago I met with officials in London to discuss their experience of meeting the needs of non-English speaking students. I also visited two London schools to look at their policies in action. I was particularly interested to learn about which strategies have been successful in terms of engaging with these children&rsquo;s parents as I am conscious that language difficulties are just one aspect of this issue.</P>
    <P>As with all children, the interest that their parents show in their education is so important and so it is crucial to find ways of empowering them to get involved. Issues that have arisen in the context of the review include the different expectations of parents of different nationalities and the fact that the child may be in the only English speaker in the household. In relation to the latter issue, the Deputy may be interested to know that a DVD explaining the primary school system for parents was produced in several different languages earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Other issues that have arisen in the context of the review include the current cap on the number of language support teachers available to a school and on the length of time for which an individual student can access language support. I am delighted to be able to inform the Deputy that the draft new Social Partnership Agreement includes the provision of an extra 550 language support teachers by 2009 and the reform of the current limit of two additional teachers per school. This major increase in investment will make a big difference to schools.</P>

     <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Galway has been deemed ineligible for a higher education grant in respect of their course in human rights law run by the National University of Ireland, Galway in conjunction with Queens University Belfast; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The three Third Level Student Support Schemes, administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees on behalf of my Department, offer financial assistance to eligible students attending approved third level courses. Students entering approved courses for the first time are, generally speaking, eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>
    <P>Under the Free Fees Initiative, my Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses in the <Col N="1776"/>State, which must be of at least two years duration, at an approved college. Where a candidate is pursuing an approved course at Postgraduate level in an institution listed as an approved institution for the purpose of my Department&rsquo;s Higher Education Grant Scheme and VEC Scholarship Scheme the Awarding Body may award a full or part grant in respect of the candidate&rsquo;s lecture fee subject to the terms of the Scheme.</P>
    <P>My Department has examined the details of the course which the person is attending to determine whether or not an application could be considered for assistance under the 2005 Higher Education Grant Scheme.</P>
    <P>My Department is aware that the first semester of the LLM Human Rights Cross Border course is completed in Queen&rsquo;s University, the second in NUI Galway and the third can be spent in either Queen&rsquo;s University or NUIG. The person the deputy refers to chose to remain in NUIG for the third semester. However, my Department understands that all fees are paid to Queen&rsquo;s University who in turn make a payment to NUIG in respect of the period of study there.</P>
    <P>The residency requirement, under the prescribed provisions of the 2005 Higher Education Grant Scheme, requires in the case of an independent mature candidate the candidate to have been ordinarily resident in the administrative area of the Local Authority from the 1st October 2004. The person to whom the Deputy refers has confirmed to my Department and to Galway County Council that she resided in Scotland for the past number of years. Accordingly she is not eligible to be considered for a Higher Education maintenance grant in the state.</P>
    <P>The particular clause which applies in this case is Clause 4.1.2 of the 2005 Higher Education Grant Scheme which states as follows: &ldquo;Candidates who are E.U. nationals and who do not satisfy the residency requirement are eligible to apply for a means-tested fees only grant in respect of approved courses in the Republic of Ireland, provided they have been ordinarily resident, for a purpose other than wholly or mainly to receive full-time education, in an E.U. Member State from 1 October, 2004. Such candidates shall apply to the Local Authority in which the college they propose to attend is situated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As the course is effectively a Queen&rsquo;s University, Belfast course, to which the fees are payable, it does not meet the criteria of an approved course in this state for the purposes of Clause 4.1.2.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I can assure the Deputy that the matter of finance is not the reason why the relevant sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004 relating to Individual Education Plans (IEPs) have not yet commenced.</P>
    <P>While many sections of the Act have already commenced, the remaining sections cannot come into effect without the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) having an opportunity <Col N="1778"/>to present an implementation report to my Department, which it must do by October 2006. This plan will enable me to decide on the commencement of the remaining sections of the Act, including the sections related to IEPs.</P>
    <P>As provided for in the EPSEN Act, an education plan for each individual pupil with special educational needs will become mandatory when the relevant sections of the Act are commenced. In preparation for this, the NCSE has drawn up guidelines on the IEP process and these guidelines were published on 20th June last. The guidelines present a checklist of the essential elements required for an IEP for a child with special education needs as envisaged by the EPSEN Act 2004.</P>
    <P>These guidelines will provide advice and assistance to schools, teachers and parents on devising and implementing IEPs. It is expected that schools will use these guidelines to draw up school policies and procedures in relation to IEPs in advance of the mandatory requirement for them.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Because of the way in which data are collected from schools it is not possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy in relation to nine-year olds.</P>
    <P>The most recent information on class sizes in primary schools for County Kildare is for the 2005/2006 school year and is as follows:</P>
<P LI="1">Classes of up to 9 &mdash; 0 pupils;</P>
<P LI="1">Classes of 10 to 19 &mdash; 990 pupils;</P>
<P LI="1">Classes of 20 to 24 &mdash; 3761 pupils;</P>
<P LI="1">Classes of 25 to 29 &mdash; 10437 pupils;</P>
<P LI="1">Classes of 30 to 34 &mdash; 6351 pupils;</P>
<P LI="1">Classes of 35 to 39 &mdash; 531 pupils;</P>
<P LI="1">Classes of 40 or over &mdash; 0 pupils.</P>
<P FLI="0">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in primary school staffing in recent years. Next September there will no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. Not only is the average class size in our primary schools down to 24, but there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
    <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support <Col N="1779"/>than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school. Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</P>
    <P>As you know all schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007/2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
    <P>So, as I have pointed out the general rule in the current school year is that at least one classroom teacher is provided for every 29 pupils. Furthermore, the actual average class size nationally is 24.</P>
    <P>It is important to appreciate that there are a number of different reasons why a particular school may have a large class in a given year. Reasons why there are large classes include a significant fluctuation in enrolments from one year to the next and/or a decision by the school principal not to have multi-grade classes.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the reason why there is a large class in a particular school one year, it should be noted that in the majority of cases this is not the situation in the following year. In the main, the same schools do not have large classes year after year and so the same children are not in large classes year after year.</P>
    <P>Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is often because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. I appreciate that splitting classes may not always be an option for a particular school, because for example there might be a large group in junior infants and a small group in sixth class and so on. But where it is possible, I believe that principals should consider the benefits of having smaller multi-grade classes as against having large differences in class sizes at different levels in the school.</P>
    <P>This Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to improving staffing in our primary schools by hiring thousands of extra teachers in recent years and we will continue to make progress on this issue.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas including the impact of inward migration and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</P><Col N="1782"/>
<?oasys _fc ?>
    <P>In planning for school provision to meet these demands my Department has adopted an area based approach which involves a public consultation process involving all interested parties. This leads to the production of a blueprint for schools&rsquo; development in an area for a timeframe of approximately ten years. The exercise recently completed on the N4-M4 corridor is an example of this and the rapidly developing areas of north Dublin, south Louth, east Meath will be examined this year. This structured process will ensure a more proactive approach to school planning than had been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>Apart from the area development planning process my Department is also proactively engaged with local authorities on a continual basis in relation to specific areas. This is being done through improved contacts and communication protocols to ensure that the Department is better alerted about new and expanding residential areas and afforded an opportunity to ensure appropriate zoning provision for educational purposes.</P>
    <P>For example in the case of the Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) at Adamstown my Department is working closely with South Dublin County Council and the developers to produce an integrated solution to education and community facilities that matches the delivery of new housing. Under the SDZ arrangements there is a requirement that schools are in position ahead of or in line with demand, and I think it is one that should be adopted by other planning authorities in relation to major new housing schemes.</P>
    <P>My Department is working particularly closely with Fingal County Council to develop a joint approach to the timely provision of schools in an area of the country subject to extremely rapid development. This work is likely to provide innovative approaches to partnership which I believe can be used to advantage across the country in future particularly in the area of shared community facilities.</P>
    <P>My Department prioritises school buildings for rapidly developing areas. This is achieved by assigning them a band one priority rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects. Whenever possible, my Department implements a standardised design model or a design and build process to fast track delivery of the buildings themselves. Not alone does this result in speedier delivery of projects but it also achieves savings in design fees and land use arising from the use of the two storey design. Among schools completed using one of these processes is Griffeen Valley in Lucan which was completed in a 13 month timeframe.</P>
    <P>The level of work being done under the schools building programme is at an all-time high. While increased investment is a central reason for this &mdash; &euro;500m this year alone &mdash; radical changes in how projects are planned and managed have also made a major difference in ensuring that pro<Col N="1783"/>vision is delivered in line with or ahead of demand.</P>

     <Quest>the reason rural areas of County Mayo have not been included in the current DEIS programme in view of the continuing deprivation there; the reason these changes occurred; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The new DEIS programme will be of huge benefit to schools in Mayo. I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is important to make sure that schools serving the most disadvantaged communities get all the extra support possible and will welcome the extra resources that DEIS will provide for Mayo schools. I can assure the Deputy that there is no reason for schools that haven&rsquo;t been identified for the new programme to worry as they will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils. Not one of these schools has been told that they will lose any resources as a result of DEIS.</P>
    <P>DEIS is designed to ensure that schools serving the most disadvantaged communities benefit from the maximum level of support available. Over the years, no less than 8 separate schemes for disadvantaged primary schools have been put in place. Some schools were benefiting from just <Col N="1784"/>one or two of these and others were benefiting from more. The DEIS initiative is designed to ensure that the most disadvantaged schools benefit from a comprehensive package of supports, while ensuring that others continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</P>
    <P>59 rural primary schools in Mayo have been invited to benefit from resources available under the new programme. Nearly 20% of all the rural schools invited to benefit from the new programme nationally are in Mayo.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the extra supports being made available will be of great value to those primary schools in Mayo which, based on the information submitted by their principals, have been selected to benefit from the new programme.</P>
    <P>While the whole rationale behind the new programme is to ensure that the most disadvantaged schools benefit from all of the available supports, schools that are benefiting from pre-existing schemes will keep the extra resources &mdash; financial and human &mdash; that they are getting under these initiatives for the 2006/07 school year. After that they will continue to get support in line with the level of socio-economic disadvantage among their pupils.</P>
    <P>In relation to how schools were identified to benefit from the new programme, this process was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate. In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried out by the ERC in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved.</P>
    <P>The analysis of the survey returns from primary schools by the ERC identified the socio-economic variables that collectively best predict achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools for participation in the School Support Programme. The variables involved were: </P>
<P LI="1">% unemployment</P>
<P LI="1">% local authority accommodation</P>
<P LI="1">% lone parenthood</P>
<P LI="1">% Travellers</P>
<P LI="1">% large families (5 or more children)</P>
<P LI="1">% pupils eligible for free books.</P>
<P FLI="0">In the case of second-level schools, the Department supplied the ERC with centrally-held data from the Post-Primary Pupils and State Examinations Commission databases.

	<P>Discussions on the implementation of the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term) Act, 2003 in the education sector are continuing with the assistance of a facilitator. The discussions include representatives of the Departments of Education &amp; Science and Finance, the management authorities of schools and the Institutes of Technology and the teacher unions.</P>
    <P>One of the more significant provisions of the legislation relates to the use of successive fixed term contracts. Essentially a fixed term employee can be employed by his/her employer on two or more continuous fixed term contracts, the aggregate of which must not exceed four years. Where any term of a fixed term contract purports to contravene this provision, that term shall have no <Col N="1788"/>effect and the contract concerned shall be deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration (C.I.D.).</P>
    <P>Agreement was reached in October, 2005 to issue contracts of indefinite duration (C.I.D.s) to fully qualified primary school teachers with four years successive temporary teaching service at 1 September, 2005, unless objective grounds had been set out at renewal of temporary contract. All schools were circularised by my Department with this information at that time.</P>
    <P>In June, 2006 it was decided that this agreement would also comprehend post primary qualified teachers as recognised by the Teaching Council (B.A. and H.Dip) and receiving incremental salary, with more than four years successive teaching service in a primary school and where no objective ground existed. 55 such teachers working in full-time temporary posts in primary schools at 1 September, 2005 were identified as eligible for C.I.D.s. having regard to their entitlements under the legislation.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are currently underway in my Department for a circular to issue to all schools outlining the further agreement reached on issues related to the implementation of the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term) Act, 2003.</P>

	<P>The funding to assist students in attending Irish summer college courses is being disbursed as follows in 2006:- Under the scheme for payment of tuition grants to Irish Summer Colleges, which is administered by my Department, grants are paid to Colleges based on course attendance. The estimated expenditure in 2006 is &euro;1,175,000.</P>
    <P>My Department also administers a separate scheme for trainee teachers in the Colleges of Education who are required to attend a three week course in the Gaeltacht as part of their teacher training programme. Grants are paid to the Irish Colleges based on the attendance of these students. It is estimated such grants will cost in the region of &euro;825,000 this year.</P>
    <P>Under Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge, which is administered by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, grants are paid to Gaeltacht households who accommodate Irish students while they attend recognised Irish courses in the Gaeltacht. The estimated overall expenditure in 2006 is &euro;4,250,000.</P><Col N="1789"/>
    <P>Under my Department&rsquo;s Rules for the payment of grants to Irish Summer Colleges, provision is made for the payment of grants in respect of students between 8 and 18 years of age attending approved Irish courses in colleges outside the Gaeltacht. The colleges are privately run institutions and the age group for which courses are provided is a matter for the individual colleges concerned. In practice, most courses cater for pupils in the secondary education age group.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy wishes to get information on the courses provided by individual colleges, I would suggest that he contacts Comhchoiste na gCol&aacute;ist&iacute; Samhraidh (CONCOS), Baile an Fheirt&eacute;araigh, Tr&aacute; L&iacute;, Co. Chiarra&iacute;. CONCOS is a federation of 42 Irish Summer Colleges both inside and outside the main Gaeltachta&iacute;, as well as Residential Colleges in the provinces.</P>

	<P>My Department has not formally requested support therapies for the person in question under Section 40 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is now operational.

    <P>My officials have liaised with the NCSE in relation to the child referred to by the Deputy. <Col N="1791"/>The NCSE has advised that it has not received any application for assistance with the application in question. It is open to the parent(s) to contact the relevant SENO who can assist in accessing an appropriate educational placement for the child. Contact details for the relevant SENO may be sourced from the NCSE at (046) 9486400. Alternatively, these details may be accessed on the NCSE website at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>In 2004 there were 21 Speech and Language Therapy graduates and 32 graduates from Occupational Therapy. The figures for the 2005 graduates are not yet fully available.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, in May 2002 my Department approved the provision of 175 additional therapy training places to tackle shortages of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists as identified in the report &ldquo;Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists&rdquo;, which was undertaken by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates in 2001.</P>
    <P>Within this provision there was an increase of 75 places on new courses in Speech and Language Therapy and an additional 75 places on new Occupational Therapy courses. These increased intakes will result in a significant increase in the number of Speech and Language Therapists graduating from the third level sector. I have attached a chart detailing the number of students enrolled on these courses. Future entrants are expected to be in line with these numbers.</P><Col N="1791"/>

     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>the directive she has issued in relation to the appointment of a concessionary teacher in a school (details supplied) in County Sligo in view of the fact it will have up to 90 pupils in 2006 and 2007 and in 2005 and 2006 it had four teachers with an enrolment of 78 pupils; <Col N="1792"/>if she will give a firm commitment that a teacher will be appointed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a <Col N="1793"/>staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools. The relevant circular (0023/2006) issued to all schools in March 2006.</P>
    <P>The enrolment in the school referred to by the Deputy on 30th September 2005 was 78 pupils, which warrants a staffing of Principal plus 2 mainstream posts for the 2006/2007 school year. It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in Circular 0024/2006 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools). Hard copies of this circular have been issued to all primary schools.</P>
    <P>Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
    <P>The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operations of the Independent Appeal Board.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism receive an education appro<Col N="1794"/>priate to their needs, preferably through the primary and post primary school network.</P>
    <P>My Department supports an eclectic approach to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods can be applied specific to the needs of individual pupils. Provision in this regard in County Kerry includes pre-school/early intervention special classes for children with autism, special classes for children with autism attached to special and mainstream schools plus a range of supports for pupils with autism integrated in mainstream classes. No application has been made to my Department to establish an ABA unit for autistic pupils in County Kerry.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

     <Quest>the number of State funded early education places; and the way these have increased in the past five years.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Early Years Education in Ireland covers the period from birth to six years. Almost all five year olds and half of four year olds attend junior infant and senior infant classes in primary schools. Provision for children below the age of four is targeted at specific groups.</P>
    <P>Outside of junior classes in primary schools, my Department&rsquo;s main role in the area of early childhood education encompasses pre-school provision for children from disadvantaged areas, for traveller children and for those with special needs.</P>
    <P>The Early Start pre-school project operates in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk. There are 1,680 places in these centres. Although the Early Start project itself has not been extended in recent years, targeted early childhood education provision is a key element of the School Support Programme (SSP) under the new action plan for educational inclusion DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), which provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage. The objective in relation to early childhood education is to concentrate actions initially on those children aged from three up to school enrolment, who will subsequently attend the 180 urban/town primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities. My Department will work in partnership with other departments and agencies to complement and add value to existing childcare programmes in disadvantaged communities, with a view to ensuring that the overall care and education needs of the children concerned are met in an integrated manner. A strong emphasis will be placed on adding value to the work of other providers by embedding quality early learning within childcare provision. The Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education will provide advice <Col N="1795"/>on the future development and direction of pre-school measures for children in disadvantaged communities.</P>
    <P>My Department currently funds 46 pre-schools for Traveller children. With an increasing emphasis on integrated provision, there has been no increase in the number of separate pre-schools for Traveller children in recent years.</P>
    <P>In the special needs sector, there are currently 15 pre-school classes for children with autism located throughout the country. The number of such classes has increased from three in 2001. In addition to this, 12 stand-alone autism facilities that provide an applied behavioural analysis (ABA) model of response to children with autism cater for a number of children of pre-school age &mdash; there were 3 such facilities in place in 2001 and approval has been given for the establishment of a further two facilities. My Department sanctions home tuition grants for children with autism who are of pre-school age and for whom a home educational programme is considered appropriate &mdash; grants for some 380 such children are currently in payment, costing in the region of &euro;7m per annum. While it is not possible to confirm the number of pre-school age children with autism in receipt of home tuition grants in 2001, I can confirm that there has been a substantial increase in the number of such grants sanctioned in recent years. In a small number of cases, my Department allocates funding to service providers to assist them in providing an educational component to pre-school age children in Child Educational Development Centres (CEDCs) and some &euro;300,000 per annum is currently provided in this regard. This funding arrangement was initially sanctioned in 2002.</P>
    <P>The bulk of pre-school places in the country are financed by the Office of the Minister for Children and previously by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has provided unprecedented levels of funding for childcare in recent years. &euro;499.3m has been allocated to the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) 2000-2006. The original target of 28,000 new childcare places has already been exceeded and it is anticipated that some 41,000 places will have been created by the time the programme finishes.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children also provides grants to childcare groups, including to community groups in areas of social and economic disadvantage.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>if she has introduced a programme on enterprise for all pupils; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>One of the principles underpinning the <Col N="1796"/>Primary School Curriculum is that the child&rsquo;s higher order thinking and problem solving skills are developed. Through the curriculum the child is encouraged to observe, to ask relevant questions, to recognise the essence of a problem, to suggest solutions and to make informed judgements. These skills are fundamental to engendering enterprise in our young people.</P>
    <P>At second level, students taking the Transition Year option, the Leaving Certificate Vocational programme and the Leaving Certificate Applied are provided with specific opportunities to acquire enterprise skills. These programmes place a strong focus on action learning, community-based approaches, personal development and teamwork. Students also engage in work experience.</P>
    <P>Typically, Transition Year students engage in mini-company activities whereby they plan, develop and manage a mini enterprise or organise a major event such as a trade fair or fashion show. Teamwork, multi-disciplinary learning, interpersonal and communications skills, planning, evaluation, and mastery of business concepts are all part of this process. Approximately, 25,000 students take the Transition Year annually.</P>
    <P>One of the Link Modules within the Leaving Certificate Vocational programme is on Enterprise Education. This is externally assessed and the results can be used for CAO points purposes. In 2005, the Link Modules were taken by 14,281 candidates.</P>
    <P>The Tasks carried out by students taking the Leaving Certificate Applied to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they have acquired are also externally assessed.</P>
    <P>The Leaving Certificate Business syllabus has a strong focus on enterprise. The syllabus covers marketing and starting a business, the domestic and international environment, handling conflict, enterprise skills and their application to different situations. In 2005, Leaving Certificate Business was taken by 20,502 candidates.</P>
    <P>In the context of the future development of senior cycle, I have also asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to design, as an exemplar, a short course in enterprise education, building on the existing Links Modules. I have also requested that a review be undertaken of all Leaving Certificate subjects to embed key skills such as critical thinking and working with others and to add a second assessment component, where it does not already exist, to ensure that the objectives of the syllabuses are well assessed.</P>

	<P>On the 1 February 2006 the T&aacute;naiste and I published the report of the Fottrell Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education and Training. In addition the T&aacute;naiste published the report of the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Group. These reports represent the most significant review of medical education and training ever undertaken in Ireland and are aimed at responding to the needs of a changing health system and ensuring that medical education in Ireland is sufficiently resourced and developed to maintain our reputation for producing quality doctors into the future.</P>
    <P>Among the recommendations of the Fottrell Group was that a graduate stream of entry to medicine be introduced and that all graduates of honours Bachelor degree programmes should be eligible to apply. It has been decided that graduate entry will be open to such graduates of all disciplines. The provision of a graduate entry stream is an important development in reducing pressures on aspiring medical students who until now have effectively had one chance of entry, based on their Leaving Certificate performance. This will allow students to make a decision to enter medicine at a more mature age and should result in a more diverse range of entrants into the profession.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular school year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. This staffing schedule for the 2006/07 school year is outlined in Primary Circular 0023/2006 which was issued to all primary schools.</P>
    <P>As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007/2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
    <P>Major improvements have been made in primary school staffing in recent years. Next <Col N="1798"/>September there will no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools compared with 2002. Not only is the average class size in our primary schools down to 24, but there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
    <P>So, as I have pointed out the general rule in the current school year is that at least one classroom teacher is provided for every 29 pupils. Furthermore, the actual average class size nationally is 24.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, some schools do have classes with more than 30 children in them. It is important to appreciate that there are a number of different reasons why a particular school may have a large class in a given year. Reasons why there are large classes include a significant fluctuation in enrolments from one year to the next and/or a decision by the school principal not to have multi-grade classes.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the reason why there is a large class in a particular school one year, it should be noted that in the majority of cases this is not the situation in the following year. In the main, the same schools do not have large classes year after year and so the same children are not in large classes year after year.</P>
    <P>Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is often because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. Indeed, I often find that when I look into why a particular school has a class of 35 in a particular grade, the answer is because there is another class in the same school with a much lower than average number of pupils in it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that splitting classes may not always be an option for a particular school, because for example there might be a large group in junior infants and a small group in sixth class and so on. But where it is possible, I believe that principals should consider the benefits of having smaller multi-grade classes as against having large differences in class sizes at different levels in the school.</P>
    <P>The enrolment of the school referred to by the Deputy on 30th September 2005 was 261 pupils, which warrants a staffing of Principal plus 9 mainstream posts for the 2006/2007 school year. The school will also have two permanent learning support resource posts and the services of a temporary shared learning support resource post based in the school.</P>
    <P>For the current school year, 2005/06, the number of mainstream posts in the school was reduced by 1 compared to 2004/05. However, this reduction in staffing was offset by the creation of the second permanent learning support resource post and the temporary shared learning support resource post referred to above. There have been no further posts allocated to the school in the last five years apart from these two additional posts.</P><Col N="1799"/>
    <P>This Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to improving staffing in our primary schools by hiring thousands of extra teachers in recent years and we will continue to make progress on this issue.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Caretaking staff in schools are employed by the individual school authorities. My Department provides funding under two separate schemes towards the cost of employing these staff. One scheme is the 1979 scheme for the employment of full-time caretaking staff in primary schools. Under this scheme my Department meets the full cost of pay. The person in question is employed as a caretaker under the 1979 Scheme.</P>
    <P>My Department has recently introduced a superannuation scheme for caretaking staff employed under the 1979 scheme. The Superannuation Scheme provides that membership will be effective from 1 September 2001 in the case of eligible caretakers in service at that time. Membership terminates at the end of the school year in which the caretaker reaches age 65. Caretakers who had already reached age 65 prior to 1 September 2001 are not eligible for membership of the Scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme is a contributory scheme and ongoing deductions from pay of eligible personnel commenced with effect from 7 March 2006. Arrears of contributions are payable in respect of the period from 1 September 2001 to the date ongoing deductions commenced, or the date membership ended if earlier. Eligible staff will be notified in due course of the arrears due in respect of that period. In accordance with standard public service arrangements, there is also provision for reckoning service given prior to 1 September 2001 subject to verification of the service concerned and payment of the appropriate contributions.</P>
    <P>Eligible personnel and school authorities were informed of the introduction of the superannuation scheme prior to the commencement of deductions from pay. A circular setting out further details regarding the superannuation scheme, including the provisions for payment of arrears of contributions, is being prepared and will be issued shortly.</P><Col N="1800"/>
    <P>The person in question was eligible for membership of the scheme until 31 August 2002 &mdash; the end of the school-year in which he reached age 65. He has continued in employment until recently in a non-pensionable capacity. Subject to the payment of appropriate contributions in respect of his reckonable service, he will be eligible for pension with effect from the date of his retirement in 2006. A Retirement Gratuity will also be payable based on his annual rate of pay on his last day of reckonable service on 31 August 2002. Contributions owing to the scheme may be paid by deduction from the Retirement Gratuity.</P>
    <P>The 1979 scheme is being phased out. It has been superseded by an extensive grant scheme now referred to as the Ancillary Services grant. The Ancillary Services grant provides funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. The Scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives Boards of Management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Staff engaged by schools under the Ancillary Services grant are paid by the managerial authorities of the schools and are non-pensionable.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As has previously been advised to the Deputy catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post-primary education in the late 1960&rsquo;s and were determined following consultation with local educational interests. In particular in cases such as Schull where a new postprimary school is established in an area where previously there was none, it has been the practice as part of the discussions and arrangements concerned with the establishment of the school to review the existing adjacent catchment areas in order to establish the appropriate catchment and feeder primary schools for the proposed new post-primary school.</P>
    <P>My Department has been unable to locate any records of those discussions but will pursue the matter to establish if any records are held locally either by the school or the VEC committee.</P>
    <P>In any event it is evident that since the inception of the Schull post-primary school that school transport has not been provided on the basis that <Col N="1801"/>the Dunbeacon Goleen is within the Bantry catchment area.</P>
    <P>My Department will write directly to the Deputy with any information obtained from its further inquiries in relation to any records that may exist of the discussion held at the time.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Information on participation in full-<Col N="1802"/>time third-level education is not available in the exact format requested by the Deputy. However, the following tabular statements contain extensive and very relevant information on the subject of access to higher education by individual county and by postal districts within Dublin for 1998 and 2004. These data are derived from a recently published HEA report entitled &ldquo;Who Went to College in 2004? A National Survey of New Entrants to Higher Education (2006), O&rsquo;Connell, Clancy and McCoy&rdquo; and the 1998 data are taken from the earlier studies on access to higher education by Prof. Patrick Clancy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy might note that these data refer to admission rates to higher education rather than participation rates per se. The admission rate to higher education is defined as the flow of new entrants to higher education divided by the population at typical age of entry to higher education (i.e. 17 to 19 years).&rdquo;</P><Col N="1801"/>

	<P>The specific information requested by the Deputy relating to the level of special needs teachers at primary level in the City and County of Waterford is not readily available in my Department. I can confirm however that there are currently 189.89 whole-time equivalent special needs assistants (SNAs) employed in schools in Waterford and a total of 7,241.02 whole-time equivalent SNAs employed nationwide, up from 300 in 1998.</P>
    <P>I can confirm also that at primary level there are now approximately 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>At second level approximately 1,654 whole time equivalent additional teachers are currently in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. Of these 1,654 teachers, 35.87 whole time equivalents are based in second level schools in Waterford. In addition, there are 532 whole time equivalent learning support teachers in our second level schools nationwide.</P>
    <P>Applications for special educational needs supports for the 2006/2007 school year are now being processed by the special educational needs organisers (SENOs). The SENOs will convey their decisions on the applications directly to the schools as soon as this process has been completed. Responsibility for the recruitment and employment of the relevant staff rests with the individual school authorities and will be determined by the level of need.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is examining the practicalities of providing such information in relation to individual classes in specified numbers of <Col N="1808"/>schools. A reply will be forwarded to the Deputy on completion of that examination.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in primary school staffing in recent years. Next September there will no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. Not only is the average class size in our primary schools down to 24, but there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
    <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
    <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</P>
    <P>As you know all schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007/2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
    <P>So, as I have pointed out the general rule in the current school year is that at least one classroom teacher is provided for every 29 pupils. Furthermore, the actual average class size nationally is 24.</P>
    <P>It is important to appreciate that there are a number of different reasons why a particular school may have a large class in a given year. Reasons why there are large classes include a significant fluctuation in enrolments from one year to the next and/or a decision by the school principal not to have multi-grade classes.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the reason why there is a large class in a particular school one year, it should be noted that in the majority of cases this is not the situation in the following year. In the main, the same schools do not have large classes year after year and so the same children are not in large classes year after year.</P>
    <P>Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is often because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that splitting classes may not always be an option for a particular school, because for example there might be a large group in junior infants and a small group in sixth class and so on. But where it is possible, I believe that <Col N="1809"/>principals should consider the benefits of having smaller multi-grade classes as against having large differences in class sizes at different levels in the school.</P>
    <P>This Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to improving staffing in our primary schools by hiring thousands of extra teachers in recent years and we will continue to make progress on this issue.</P>

	<P>My Department provides a range of supports to second level school management to enable schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs. The supports in question include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, there has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>At second level, approximately 1,654 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 532 whole time equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,102 whole time equivalent special needs assistants (SNAs) in our second level schools.</P>
    <P>The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. Pupils attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1st October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special <Col N="1810"/>Educational Needs Act 2005. The Council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities/ special needs.</P>
    <P>The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities/special needs.</P>
    <P>The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following:</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level;</P>

  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p6- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">Under the new arrangements, the Council, through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it. My Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of all children including those with special needs.</P>
    <P>The provision of speech and language therapists and other health related supports is a matter for the Health Service Executive.</P>

    <P>In addition, my Department&rsquo;s Teacher Education Section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs. This involves a major expansion of the range of post-graduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to support schools staff locally.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides direct contact and services to children and young adults who need the support of an Educational Psychologist.</P>
    <P>NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</P>

    <P FLI="0" el="5">Not all assessments involved full cognitive 1Q assessments. The figures relating to the period 2002/2003 to 2004/2005 may be subject to some changes in the context of the information review exercise to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>In 2004, NEPS was also involved in a verification process of over 5,000 children for additional resources prior to the appointment of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and prior to the new general allocation model put in place for schools in the context of additional teaching resources.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above figures, in excess of 15,000 children were assessed under the SCPA scheme since its inception in 2001 to the end of the calendar year 2005.</P>
    <P>The numbers and grades of professional staff currently employed in NEPS is as follows:</P>
<P LI="1">Acting Director &mdash; 1</P>

<P LI="1">Senior Psychologist &mdash; 50</P>

<P LI="1">Psychologists &mdash; 3</P>
<P LI="1">Total &mdash; 122.</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">This total includes 1 psychologist serving with another Section in my Department. Also, a number of these posts are filled on a work-sharing basis. The Public Appointments Service recently concluded a new recruitment competition for the appointment of Educational Psychologists to NEPS. Regional panels have been established to allow my Department give greater priority in filling vacancies to areas with the <Col N="1814"/>greatest need. It is expected that a further 9 psychologists will be in place before the end of 2006.</P>
    <P>NEPS psychologists are assigned to schools on the basis of total school population, the geographical distribution of schools and on the basis of a weighting given to schools designated as disadvantaged. Therefore, the number of schools allocated to a psychologist in a highly urbanised area will differ from the number of schools allocated where there is a wide dispersal of small schools. In that context, an average figure is not meaningful. In urbanised areas the range in the number of schools can vary typically from 15 schools to 20 schools. In a rural area the range will vary between 25 and 40. These figures do not take into account psychologists availing of work sharing schemes where the numbers of schools are allocated accordingly.</P>

    <P>Under the provisions of the Education Act, 1998, the board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school. In general, the Board has the responsibility to ensure that the school operates efficiently and effectively and also has responsibilities in relation to the action of its employees.</P>
    <P>The board, as manager of the school must manage the staff in the school and intervene when it considers necessary to resolve matters relating to the actions of its employees. The Board of Management is the employer and has similar powers to any other employer. I should clarify that my Department is not the employer of teachers and therefore does not have an employer/employee relationship with the teachers in a school. My Department cannot therefore perform functions which are proper to the Board in relation to the management of the teaching staff of the<?oasys  _jy ?>school.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific case referred to by the Deputy, the position is that, on 13th March, 2006, the Patron of the school dissolved the Board of Management and, with my approval, appointed a single manager to manage the school for a period of six months in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Education Act 1998. I am aware that the single manager in this instance is making strenuous efforts to address the difficulties at the school.</P>

	<P>As part of the expansion of the devolved scheme for primary school building works, a grant of &euro;150,000 was sanctioned in March 2005 to enable the management authorities of the school in question to extend and refurbish their school.</P>
    <P>Devolving funding to school management authorities allows them to have control of their projects, assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction and can also deliver better value for money.</P>
    <P>The Schemes are not structured on the basis that the Department funding must be supplemented by local fundraising. They do however allow a school to supplement the funding from local resources if they so wish. The critical element is that with devolved authority the school must set the scope of works to match the funding allocated. The Department does not define the precise works to be carried out. A school can make choices within the budget allocated.</P>
    <P>Setting the scope of works is the critical first step. Clearly where a school has a known level of resources apart from the Department funding or knows its capacity to raise additional resources it is open to that school to extend the scope of works to include additional facilities. However if the scope of works is not set appropriately from the outset based on the budget available there is a risk that the school will be faced with a funding gap when the project is at construction.</P>
    <P>The choices to be made within these devolved schemes rest with the school and that is the cornerstone of any policy of devolution. The school authority knows the budget and must decide what it is capable of building with that budget. The time to identify a problem is at the outset before entering any contract. Schools can raise with my Department any site specific problems or unusual planning stipulations that impose additional costs and these will be examined. Otherwise schools must reduce the scope of intended works so as to remain within budget.</P>
    <P>A school does not have to accept the invitation to participate in a devolved scheme and instead be considered for inclusion in the mainstream school building programme in line with the project&rsquo;s priority band rating.</P>
    <P>The management of school in question recently submitted an appeal to my Department for additional funding which was considered by the Appeals Board. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the funding allocated to the School was increased and the School informed of the decision.</P>

	<P>There are two primary school in the Carrigtwohill area &mdash; a boys&rsquo; and a girls&rsquo; primary school. The Patron of both schools has advised that both boards of management have agreed to amalgamate the schools. In order to determine the accommodation requirements of the amalgamated school the long term projected staffing on which the accommodation needs will be based, has to be determined. Officials in the School Planning Section are engaged in this process at <Col N="1819"/>present and will consult with the school authorities before a final determination is made. Factors which will be considered in arriving at the long term projected staffing include current and projected enrolment, demographic trends and the likely impact of ongoing and proposed housing developments in the area.</P>
    <P>When this assessment is complete a decision will then be made on how best to provide for the accommodation needs of the amalgamated school. As the Deputy will appreciate, in the interest of obtaining best value for money, my Department must give due consideration to the possibility of utilising one of the existing buildings before pursuing a greenfield site option. In order to inform this decision a technical inspection of both existing school sites and buildings will be undertaken by my Department to establish which, if either, building would be suitable as a host for an amalgamated school.</P>
    <P>As part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing liaison with local authorities in order to plan for educational provision, Cork County Council was requested, in the context of the Special Local Area Plan for Carrigtwohill to reserve a three acre site for a primary school in the area. While there are no immediate plans to acquire a site, it is likely that it will be required for the provision of a primary school in the coming years. The situation is being monitored on an on-going basis, having regard to existing overall provision in the area.</P>
    <P>My Department is aware that an association under the auspices of Educate Together is planning to seek recognition for a new multi-denominational school in the area in the coming years. There are established criteria and procedures for groups seeking recognition for new primary schools and any application from the patron body concerned will be considered in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that adequate primary education provision is being planned for the area over the coming years.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe that school facilities should be available to the community outside of school hours &mdash; whether for childcare, for adult education courses or as somewhere for local community groups to meet &mdash; provided this is feasible.</P>
    <P>Indeed, my Department issued a circular to the trustees, boards of management and principals of <Col N="1820"/>primary and voluntary secondary schools in March 2005 encouraging them to make their facilities available to local community groups outside of school hours.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind, however, that the State does not in fact own the vast majority (more than 95%) of our schools. Most would be owned by the religious. They are owned by their trustees and managed by their boards of management, whose right it is to decide on the use of school facilities outside of school time, subject to the terms of any existing lease on the property.</P>
    <P>Many schools already make their premises available to the local community outside of school hours and schools profit from the improved relationship with the wider community. Good relations between the school and the community can be beneficial when it comes to seeking placements for work experience, outlets for community service or when schools seek to access local services and expertise.</P>
    <P>While my Department does not operate a specific national scheme for the provision of after-school projects, it supports a range of programmes which target additional resources at pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in order to facilitate their full participation in the education system.</P>
    <P>82 projects (108 Post Primary schools and 302 Primary schools) participate in the School Completion Programme, which aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. Each project site must devise a collaborative programme of in-school and out-of-school actions, which provide after-school, holiday time, home, family and community supports to enhance the young person&rsquo;s readiness to benefit from education.</P>
    <P>Measures under DEIS the new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) range from pre-school interventions, supports for tackling children&rsquo;s literacy problems, reduced pupil teacher ratios, increased capitation grants, measures to tackle early school leaving and strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community.</P>
    <P>As a result of the identification process, 840 schools, serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage, have been invited to participate in the new School Support Programme. These comprise 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools.</P>
    <P>School Completion Programme services will be extended to all 320 urban/town primary schools and 200 second level schools participating in the SSP not already benefiting from these services.</P>

	<P>As I indicated to the Deputy in the D&aacute;il last night the School Completion Programme is a very successful programme targeted at children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. It is targeted at those in danger of dropping out of the education system or those who may have already dropped out. It is a broadly based programme which is cross-community and cross-sectoral. It works between the primary schools and the second level schools and involves the community to ensure the maximum participation by as many people as possible. It generally targets four to 18 year olds who are both in and out of school to ensure the best outcome for them.</P>
    <P>There are currently 82 School Completion Programme (SCP) sites in 21 counties (108 post primary schools and primary schools) with 53 second level schools in the Stay in School Retention Strand (SSR) of the School Completion Proramme in 17 counties. The sites for participation were selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of the pupil retention rates at second level using the Department&rsquo;s post primary pupil database. This analysis also identified their main feeder primary schools.</P>
    <P>&euro;24.7 million has been allocated to the School Completion Programme for 2006.</P>
    <P>The programme referred to by the Deputy provides general support for almost 1,600 primary students and approximately 600 post primary students. Intensive targeted supports are provided for 201 primary students and 52 post primary students. In addition it also caters for 6 pupils who are out of school in &lsquo;the School Group&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>The Local Management Committee has submitted its Retention Plan for 2006-2007 to my Department. The Retention Plan outlines all of its proposed activities for the coming year including the estimated cost of retaining the support for the six pupils who are out of school.</P>
    <P>&euro;402,000 was allocated to the programme in 2005/2006. In addition to this a further &euro;35,000 <Col N="1822"/>was allocated by the Drug Task Force on a once off basis. That is on top of extra supports which the schools in the programme avail of such as home school, community liaison, resource teachers, as well as additional capitation and lower pupil teacher ratios.</P>
    <P>The programme&rsquo;s funding allocation for 2006/2007 is currently being considered in my Department in the context of available resources for the rest of the programmes around the country. The local management committee will be notified directly on the matter.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the SSP was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate. As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the SSP. These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools. I am delighted to say that 833 of the schools invited to join the new programme accepted the invitation. <Col N="1824"/>Schools that did not qualify for the new programme will keep the extra resources they are getting under pre-existing schemes for the 2006/07 school year and after that they will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils. A review process has been put in place for both primary and second-level schools. The review process applies only to those primary schools that participated in the ERC survey in May 2005 and only to those eligible second-level schools for which data were available from the relevant databases. The closing date for receipt of review applications was Friday, 31st March, 2006. The school referred to by the Deputy has submitted a review application. The review process is nearing completion and the review group will shortly be making recommendations to my Department in the case of each school that has sought a review after which each school will be written to as regards the outcome of their application.</P>

	<P>In the current school year, of the 1749 permanent and temporary qualified teachers appointed for the first time at primary level, 189 are male. I am aware of the decreasing numbers of males entering the teaching profession, and it is an issue that is of concern to me. I believe that it is important to attract more men into teaching for a number of reasons, not least of which is the positive role models that teachers provide in children&rsquo;s lives and the desirability of having both male and female role models in our schools. During the current school year I launched a promotional campaign aimed at encouraging more men to consider primary teaching as a career choice. Studies have shown that decreasing numbers of men are applying to become primary school teachers, both in Ireland and across the developed world. The first phase of the Men As Teachers and Educators campaign has seen newspaper and radio advertisements highlighting the key attributes and strengths of primary school teachers. The campaign is seeking to remind parents, students, teachers, guidance counsellors and all those thinking about career options about the valuable and rewarding work undertaken each day in our primary schools. I hope this campaign will make young men take a look at the valuable contribution they can make through a career as a primary school teacher.</P>

	<P>Following a fire at the school to which the Deputy refers, the insurance proceeds were used by the management authority for the rental and installation of a significant amount of temporary accommodation, re-instatement works and for the upgrading of external areas. The temporary accommodation in question is of a very high quality and has a long life span. Consequently, the Department purchased it outright. It was made clear to the school&rsquo;s management authority at that time that this accommodation, combined with the re-instatement works, would be expected to meet the schools accommodation needs for the foreseeable future. Since the fire in 2001, my Department has invested almost &euro;1m in the school buildings for roof repairs, an upgrade of its gas system and for certain demolition works for health and safety reasons. Notwithstanding this level of investment, I stated publicly on a number of occasions that the provision of a new building for the school is not off the agenda. This project has been assigned a Band 2 rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects. Progress on the project is being considered in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme from 2006 onwards.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an open and transparent process in place for the recognition of new primary schools. As part of the process, the New Schools Advisory Committee (NSAC), which is an independent body, assesses all applications for recognition against published criteria. These criteria include: There must be evidence that: The proposed school meets a need that cannot reasonably be met within existing provision.</P>
    <P>The local community is consulted in advance.</P>
    <P>The patron has been registered as such by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>A board of management will be appointed in accordance with the requirements of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>The Rules for National Schools will be complied with.</P><Col N="1826"/>
    <P>The proposed school has a minimum initial enrolment of 17 junior infants and a minimum projected enrolment of 51 pupils for the third year of operation.</P>
    <P>All pupils are at least four years of age on 30th September of the year in which the school is due to commence operation.</P>
    <P>In accordance with section 10(2)(<i>e</i>) of the Education Act 1998, Proposed interim school accommodation must comply with the Planning and Development Act, 2000, the Planning and Development Regulations: 2001, the Building Regulations 1991 to 1997 (including the Building Control Regulations) and the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations: 2001 and any modifications, statutory instruments or orders made in accordance with these Acts.</P>
    <P>
<?oasys _dc28- ?>The school will follow the Primary School Curriculum of the Department of Education and Science.
<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
    <P>The school will employ recognised primary school teachers. The NSAC&rsquo;s annual programme of work culminates in a report to the Minister with recommendations on the granting or otherwise of recognition in individual cases. Appeals against a refusal to grant recognition can be made to an independent Appeals Board.</P>
    <P>With regard to the application for the recognition of a new school for Edenderry for next September, this application was processed through the independent process which I have outlined. Having assessed the application, the NSAC recommended that recognition be refused and this decision was upheld by the Independent Appeals Board. My Department acknowledges the need for extra primary provision in Edenderry and it will be assessing this need within the framework of the recommendation of the N4/M4 Area Development Plan which was published last year following widespread public consultation.</P>

	<P>Local authorities are responsible for the provision of road traffic signs on non-national roads. However, in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government to put in place a new 5 year plan to ensure that non-national roads are properly signposted, my Department introduced a new Regional Roads Signposting Programme for non-national roads in 2003. It is proposed that directional signposts on all significant junctions on all <Col N="1832"/>regional roads in county council areas will be upgraded under the programme. To the end of 2005, grants totalling &euro;2,767,800 were paid to local authorities under the Programme and in 2006 a sum of &euro;6.64 million has been allocated under the Programme. Progress under the scheme is a matter for the relevant local authority. Local authorities may also use discretionary improvement and block grants provided by my Department towards the cost of providing signposting on non-national roads. In 2006, the discretionary improvement grant allocation to county councils is &euro;24.27 million and the block grant allocation to City, Borough and Town Councils is &euro;15.51 million.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 734 and 735 together.</P>
    <P>As indicated in reply to Question No. 438 of 13 June 2006, my Department has recently met with Galway City Council to discuss their Action Plan for Social and Affordable Housing. A Review Statement is currently being finalised by Galway City Council: this will update detailed targets for numbers of social housing units to be provided by the local authority over the coming years. In relation to Question No. 437 of 13 June 2006, the information promised on the number of local authority housing schemes sanctioned and under consideration by my Department from the beginning of 2004 has been supplied to the Deputy by letter of 22 June 2006. In addition to the local authority projects, my Department has 14 projects under the voluntary and cooperative sector social housing programme for Galway City over the above period, with 50 units to be yielded by these projects. Proposals for the acquisition or construction of affordable housing do not require to be submitted to my Department for specific prior approval; consequently the question of awaiting my Department&rsquo;s sanction for these proposals does not arise. Information on activity, including units in progress and proposed, under the various social and affordable housing schemes in each local authority area is published in my Department&rsquo;s Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library and also on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The Low Cost Safety Improvement Works scheme of grants for non-national roads was introduced by my Department in 2000 as an extension of the scheme operated on national roads under the auspices of the National Roads Authority (NRA). The NRA assesses applications for grant assistance under the non-national roads scheme on behalf of my Department. The criteria for grant approval are based on accident data, inspection of sites, locations showing demonstrable hazard and discussions between the local authority and the NRA.</P>
    <P>The following table gives details of grant payments from 2000 to 2005, and allocations for 2006, to local authorities under the scheme and details of the number of projects in receipt of funding:</P>

	<P>The following table details the funding by my Department to non-governmental agencies or organisations in 2004, 2005 and 2006. For 2005, the most recent full year, the total funding provided was &euro;3,448,018, which comprised 0.45% of my Department&rsquo;s current budget for the year. The data does not include substantial capital and other funding provided by my Department under schemes which are administered by local authorities with involvement of voluntary bodies, e.g. voluntary housing projects.</P><Col N="1840"/>
    <P Just="Left">To date my Department has received 234 applications for funding for the 3 year period. 9 of these have been refused of which 6 have been redirected to other Departments where funding may be available. Of the other 3 that were refused, 1 was on the basis of there being no funds available under the Environment Fund for that particular initiative in 2005 and the other 2 refusals where as a result of the organisations failing to meet the required criteria.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 739, 746 and 753 together.</P>
    <P>The Lower Liffey Valley Sewerage Scheme has been approved for construction in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007 at an estimated cost of &euro;31 million. The scheme, which includes the expansion of the Leixlip waste water treatment plant and the upgrading and improvement of the wastewater collection systems in Leixlip, Kilcock, Straffan, Celbridge and Maynooth, also includes measures to eliminate odours from the existing collection system in Leixlip&rsquo;s main street.</P>
    <P>In May 2005 I approved Kildare County Council&rsquo;s proposals to proceed with work on an advance section of the scheme at Straffan, which I understand is now completed. Kildare County <Col N="1843"/>Council&rsquo;s Contract Documents for the major elements of the scheme are under examination in my Department and a decision will be conveyed to the Council shortly. Approval of the Contract Documents will enable the Council to invite tenders for the carrying out of the works.</P>

     <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the serious anomaly in the ratio of local authority staff to population in Counties Kildare and Meath in the Great Dublin Area which respectively have one local authority staff member for every 200 people in County Kildare and one local authority staff member for every 215 people in County Meath; his views on whether these counties saw the largest growth in population in the State between 1996 and 2002 at 21.4 per cent and 22.1 per cent respectively compared to the State growth in population of 8 per cent; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that in counties such as Kerry there is a local authority staff member for every 124 people, Cavan a local authority staff member for 124 people, Clare a local authority staff member for every 123 people; his views on whether the pressures of population growth in County Kildare and County Meath <Col N="1844"/>require him to lift the public service recruitment embargo in these local authority areas in view of the demands from the public for services; and if he will discuss this matter with the Department of Finance.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Under Section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, it is a matter for the manager of each local authority to make such staffing and organisational arrangements as may be necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he/she is responsible. However, managers must have regard to Government policy on the control and regulation of numbers in the public sector, including local authorities, which was announced in the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s Budget statement of 7 December 2005. Local authority staffing overall increased by over 25% in the period 1997 to 2003, and there were significantly higher percentage increases in Kildare and Meath County Council staffing levels over the same period. I am keeping the overall position in the local government sector under regular review, in consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 747 to 752, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>Management of public drinking water supplies is the responsibility of the local authorities, which have a range of instruments and measures available to them to produce and conserve sufficient stocks to meet anticipated needs. New infrastructure projects including water conservation works, are approved for funding under my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme mainly on the basis of priorities identified in regular assessments of needs undertaken by local authorities, at my Department&rsquo;s request, as an input to the overall strategy for meeting public water supply and waste water requirements. The latest assessments were carried out in 2003 and the resulting <Col N="1847"/>priorities have been taken into account in the framing of subsequent phases of the Water Services Investment Programme. The current phase of the Programme, which sets out my Department&rsquo;s investment strategy for the years 2005 to 2007, including details of all approved schemes and the associated funding, is available in the Oireachtas Library. Information in relation to other scheme proposals may appropriately be sought from individual local authorities.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have recently been asked by my Department to produce updated water services needs assessments and to review their infrastructural priorities in light of economic, demographic and other developments, including housing, that have taken place since the previous assessments were completed in 2003. These assessments will identify requirements for additional water production, treatment, storage or distribution capacity and will inform future phases of the Water Services Investment Programme. In addition, should there be an urgent <Col N="1848"/>need to expedite an individual proposal in response to particular circumstances new schemes may be added to the Programme at any time.</P>
    <P>Some &euro;3.7 billion will be spent under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 on the provision of water services infrastructure. A total of 334 water services schemes were completed under the Water Services Investment Programme in the period 2000 to 2005.</P>
    <P>Information regarding households whose water supplies are provided by local authorities is available in Table 13 of Volume 13 of the 2002 Census of Population published by the Central Statistics Office, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. Details of public water supply schemes completed in the period 1996 to 2005, which have produced additional drinking water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.1 million, are set out in the following tabular statement. The increase in storage capacity over the same period was sufficient to meet the requirements of a population of over 1.6 million. </P><Col N="1847"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 754, 755 and 794 together.</P>
    <P>Capital funding is available through my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme to <Col N="1854"/>approved voluntary housing bodies to provide accommodation to meet special housing needs, such as elderly, homeless or persons with disabilities and may include accommodation for victims of domestic violence. My Department&rsquo;s involvement with the scheme relates primarily to the provision of funds for eligible projects. To date 4 projects have been approved under the scheme for victims of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>The administration of the scheme and the certification that particular projects comply with the terms of the scheme is the responsibility of the appropriate local authority. An application for funding for such a project has not yet been received by my Department from Kildare County Council.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The 101 local authorities which have adopted the Barcelona Declaration, as advised to my Department by the National Disability Authority (NDA), are included in the table below. The NDA intends to write to each of the outstanding local authorities to determine whether further adoptions of the Declaration have taken place. Implementation measures are a matter for the individual local authorities.</P>
    <P>As required under the Disability Act 2005, my Department&rsquo;s sectoral plan will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas no later than 28 July 2006. It will set out national objectives and guidelines for access to local authority public buildings, services, facilities, amenities, and information. Each local authority will be required to draw up an implementation plan within nine months of the statutory approval of the sectoral plans by the Houses of the Oireachtas, on the basis of a detailed accessibility audit. The implementation plans, drawn up in consultation with organisations representing people with disabilities, will set out a programme of actions to give effect to the commitments and objectives contained in the 2005 Act, in order to promote and pro-actively encourage equal opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economic, social and cultural life of the community.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 761 and 762 together.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Electronic Voting concludes in its Second Report on the Secrecy, Accuracy and Testing of the Chosen Electronic Voting System, which was presented and published on 4 July and circulated to members of the House, that it can recommend the voting and counting equipment for use at elections in Ireland, subject to further work it has recommended, but that it is unable to recommend the election management software. The Commission makes it clear that many of its recommendations involve only relatively minor modifications or additions to the system and that it is likely that alternative election management software could be developed at a reasonable relative cost; however, the report does not provide specific costings in this regard.</P>
    <P>In response to the report, I have indicated that I intend to propose to Government the establishment of a Cabinet Committee, which I will chair and which will consider the report and other assessment work in detail; report to the Government on the full implications of the Commission recommendations; consider the composition of a peer review group (drawn from international electoral reform bodies and the IT industry) to supervise any software redesign work; report to the Government on confidence building measures; and identify any other improvements that might be built into the system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Commission&rsquo;s view regarding local storage arrangements for the electronic voting equipment. Now that the Commission has examined the issue and reached its conclusion, work will be advanced to bring the voting machines to a central location. It would not be <Col N="1859"/>appropriate to comment at this stage on detailed costs that might be involved in the buy-out of leases given the commercial considerations involved.</P>

	<P>Information on the total number of local authority playgrounds is not available in my Department. However, Service Indicators in Local Authorities 2004, published last year by the Local Government Management Services Board, reported on performance across 42 indicators covering the broad range of local authority activities. Two of the indicators relate to playgrounds and these enable comparisons to be made across local authorities on their performance in this area. Specifically, the indicators show the number of children&rsquo;s playgrounds per 1,000 population provided directly by the local authority; and facilitated by the local authority. Copies of this publication are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Ready, Steady Play: A National Play Policy, which was published in 2004, provides a framework for the development of public play facilities in Ireland, with the overall aim of ensuring that children have access to a range of quality play opportunities to enrich their childhood. As part of the implementation of this policy, my Department provided over &euro;2 million in grant aid to County and City Councils in respect of 32 new or refurbished playground projects under the Local Authority Playground Grants Scheme 2004. In 2005, a further &euro;2 million was allocated to local authorities for the development of playground facilities, in particular to meet the cost of purchase and delivery of playground equipment. I expect to announce details of further funding for such facilities in 2006 in the near future.</P>

	<P>Planning authorities currently require the provision of at least one childcare facility for each 75 dwellings in a new housing area, in accordance with the Childcare Guidelines for Planning Authorities published in April 2001. Under the Planning and Development Act 2000 planning authorities have extensive powers to provide or facilitate the provision of childcare facilities in their functional area, through appropriate strategic planning through the development plan, the setting of appropriate conditions on planning permissions and the use of development contributions to pay for the capital cost of community facilities. I am satisfied that these powers, used proactively, will facilitate an adequate supply of childcare places through the planning process. Accordingly, I do not propose to amend the Act in this respect.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 766, 770 and 776 together.</P>
    <P>Single persons who are unable to provide housing for themselves from their own resources are entitled to apply for social housing which is provided by either a local authority or a voluntary housing body. While it is a matter for individual local authorities to decide on the allocation of houses to single persons and other categories on their waiting lists in accordance with their Schemes of Letting Priorities, my Department continues to advise local authorities of the need to provide a reasonable mix of dwellings suited to the different kinds of households already on waiting lists and to plan their future programmes taking account of the estimated size and type of households likely to be seeking housing in the future.</P>
    <P>In December 2005, the Government launched a new Housing Policy Framework: Building Sustainable Communities which outlines key principles underpinning housing policy and investment over the coming years. Substantial increased investment in social and affordable housing is outlined in the framework amounting to close to &euro;4 billion in Exchequer capital spending over the period 2006 to 2008. The Government have committed in the draft social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, to further additional investment in social housing with 27,000 new units to be started or acquired over the period 2007 to 2009. It is envisaged that these new units will be delivered through a combination of local authority social housing, voluntary and co-operative sector social housing programme and long-term contracts for new supply under the Rental Accommodation Scheme.</P>
    <P>Further households will benefit from the full implementation of the Rental Accommodation Scheme involving contractual arrangements with landlords for existing properties transferring from rent supplement. Over the same period it is expected that some 17,000 units of affordable housing will be delivered.</P>
    <P>As a result of the various social and affordable housing measures the needs of some 60,000 new households will be met over the period 2007-2009. The housing policy framework also proposes a package of reforms to improve equity, efficiency and effectiveness. The focus is on improving community participation, improving services to ensure personal choice, autonomy and responsibility. The overall impact of these measures will impact positively on waiting lists for social and affordable housing.</P>
    <P>The affordable and shared ownership schemes benefit low income house purchasers and those households having difficulties securing loans from financial institutions. Last year some 2,700 transactions were completed under these initiatives <Col N="1862"/>and it is anticipated that increased output levels will be achieved in 2006.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 767 and 775 together.</P>
    <P>During the period 1992 to 1999, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) carried out a nationwide survey of radon gas in domestic dwellings. The survey involved the measurement of radon in some 11,000 houses nationwide. Based on the results of this survey, the RPII estimated that some 91,000 houses nationally, equivalent to about 7% of the national housing stock, have radon concentration levels in excess of 200 Becquerels per cubic metre (Bq/m3). This is the National Reference Level adopted by Government in respect of houses, and is the level above which it is recommended that radon remediation works should be considered.</P>
    <P>The RPII&rsquo;s website &mdash; <i>www.rpii.ie</i> &mdash; contains a comprehensive map which shows the location of High Radon Areas throughout the country, i.e., areas where 10% or more of the houses are estimated to have radon levels in excess of the National reference Level. County radon maps and survey results can be viewed also on that web-site by clicking on the county by name.</P>
    <P>Of the approximately 30,000 houses tested to date by the RPII for radon, some 200, or about 1%, had radon concentrations in excess of 800 Bq/m3, a level considered by RPII as extremely high. Such householders are strongly urged by the RPII to undertake immediate radon remediation measures on their house.</P>
    <P>The Government, largely through the RPII, has for many years now committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to highlighting public awareness of radon and the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to high radon concentrations. Householders, particularly those in high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake radon remediation works where necessary.</P>
    <P>Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by my Department called Radon in Buildings &mdash; Corrective Options and which is available on my <Col N="1863"/>Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>. The RPII has also issued guidance entitled Understanding Radon Remediation &mdash; A Householders&rsquo; Guide. This is available on the RPII website, as is a list of companies who can provide a radon remediation service and can offer specific advice and recommendations.</P>
    <P>In June 1997, my Department introduced upgraded building regulations which required all new buildings, including new houses, which commenced construction on or after 1 July 1998 to incorporate radon protection measures at the time of construction. In October 2004, my Department published an updated edition of Technical Guidance Document C on Part C of the Building Regulations (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing on or after 1 April 2005. This new guidance document is aimed at ensuring that the 1997 radon protection measures are carried out more effectively.</P>
    <P>On the question of grant assistance, and as stated in reply to Questions Nos. 82 and 98 of 13 June 2006, increasing the awareness of the public is considered to be a more effective approach than the provision of State financial assistance schemes to householders for radon testing of their homes or for radon remediation works. Such schemes of assistance are not operated by the majority of EU Member States. It would be difficult for a demand-led scheme of domestic radon grants to ensure appropriate and cost effective targeting of remedial action. Furthermore, such a scheme could require very significant public expenditure and administrative resources. The testing of houses for radon is a relatively straightforward, non-invasive and inexpensive (approximately &euro;50) process.</P>
    <P>As is clear from the above, considerable resources are being expended by Government on promoting public awareness of radon. Government efforts and resources, together with the RPII, will continue to focus on highlighting public awareness of radon and on improving information to householders and employers so as to enable and encourage them to address monitoring or remedial requirements effectively and economically.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>House prices are not determined solely by the cost of building, but by the interac<Col N="1864"/>tion of supply and demand in the market. The revised system of levying development contributions under the Planning and Development Act 2000 has not affected the level of supply, as is demonstrated by the fact that housing output reached a new record level of almost 81,000 in 2005. This very large increase in housing output has helped to restrain house price increases in the face of continuing very strong demand pressures and increased mortgage lending.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to prioritise effective action to maintain current high levels of supply in the housing market and in particular, will accelerate measures to assist those who cannot access affordable housing without assistance. A key component of this strategy is ensuring a supply of serviced land for housing which the development contribution system helps to fund. If developers were not required to contribute part of the cost of servicing the land that they use to build houses, servicing new land would become more difficult or an even greater burden would fall on taxpayers.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Details in relation to the number of social houses built each year are set out in my Department&rsquo;s Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas library, and also on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>. The majority of these units are built on land in the ownership of the local authority. Social housing units are now also being acquired by local authority from development through arrangements under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2004. The bulletins <Col N="1865"/>also provide information on activity by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector. Some of these developments would be on land provided by the local authority, but it is not possible to specify the extent of such arrangements.</P>
    <P>A number of State lands have been identified as part of the Affordable Housing Initiative. While the primary objective is to deliver increased output of affordable housing on the State lands provided to the Affordable Housing Initiative, the development of the lands may also include a mix of private, social and voluntary and co-operative housing to ensure good integration of tenures. The exact mix is a matter for the relevant local authorities in developing the land, and I understand, for example, that the plan for the Clonakilty and former Magee Barracks (Kildare) sites envisage such a mix.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and the provision of any waivers in respect of those charges, is a matter for the relevant local authority where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges. My Department has no statutory function in the determination of waste charges and waivers and it is not proposed to establish a national waiver scheme in respect of waste collection charges.</P>
    <P>However, in order to assist low income households, I have asked local authorities to engage with commercial waste collectors with a view to agreeing on a scheduling of payments, that is a pay-as-you-go system, rather than a periodic lump sum payment.</P>
    <P>The issue of waste charges has been raised in the context of social partnership. In this context, my Department engaged last year with the Department of Social and Family Affairs to explore the issues involved. However, these discussions did not identify a role for the social welfare system in providing income support in relation to waste charges.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 774 and 782 together.</P>
    <P>In December 2005, the Government launched a new Housing Policy Framework: Building Sustainable Communities which outlines key principles underpinning housing policy and investment over the coming years. Substantial increased investment in social and affordable housing is outlined in the framework amounting to close to &euro;4 billion in Exchequer capital spending over the period 2006 to 2008.</P>
    <P>The Government has committed in the draft social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, to further additional investment in social housing with 27,000 new units to be started or acquired over the period 2007 to 2009. It is envisaged that these new units will be delivered through a combination of local authority social housing, voluntary and co-operative sector social housing and long-term contracts for new supply under the Rental Accommodation Scheme.</P>
    <P>Further households will benefit from the full implementation of the Rental Accommodation Scheme involving contractual arrangements with landlords for existing properties transferring from rent supplement. Over the same period it is expected that some 17,000 units of affordable housing will be delivered. As a result of the various social and affordable housing measures the needs of some 60,000 new households will be met over the period 2007-2009.</P>
    <P>The main strategy for delivery of the Governments social and affordable housing programme is through the local authority 5-year Action Plans for social and affordable housing. The Action Plans, now at their midway stage, are currently being reviewed. The reviews are focussing on examining how targets have been met in the first two years of the plan and on incorporating any adjustments required for the remaining years of the plan, in light of performance including expected 2006 outputs, and the results of the recent Housing Needs Assessment.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the reviews will ensure that local authorities continue to have a framework for the integrated and cohesive planning and delivery over the coming years of specific social <Col N="1867"/>and affordable housing measures based on their relevant housing strategy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 777 and 784 together.</P>
    <P>There is currently a total of 43.5 staff working in the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), which also receives support from staff in my Department but is currently in the process of a transition to a fully stand-alone operation. The PRTB has also engaged a panel of 175 mediators and adjudicators to assist with its dispute resolution functions. An increased provision of &euro;3.707 million is available to fund the PRTB&rsquo;s administration and services in 2006, compared with an outturn of &euro;1.737 million in 2005.</P>
    <P>Statutory responsibility for the registration of tenancies and the provision of information relating to this and other aspects of the private rented sector rests with the PRTB under the Act. Requests for information relating to the PRTB&rsquo;s business may appropriately be directed to the Board at Canal House, Canal Road, Ranelagh, Dublin 6. My Department maintains close ongoing contact with the PRTB regarding progress on the implementation generally of the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. An update on the number of registration applications processed by the PRTB is provided to my Department generally on a monthly basis.</P>

     <Quest>the progress to date in compiling a comprehensive register of land owned by local authorities as recommended by the Committee of Public Accounts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no plans to produce a register of all local authority lands, and there was no formal recommendation by the Public Accounts Committee to undertake such a task. Given the range of purposes for which local authorities may own land, and the continuous changes in their land holdings which arise through, acquisitions, disposals or development, it would be impractical for my Department to establish and keep updated a comprehensive register of land owned by each local authority. However, the new accounting and financial management system in place in local authorities provides for the creation of asset registers for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the crucial importance of local authorities planning ahead to ensure that they have sufficient land available to meet the requirements of their Social and Affordable Housing Action Plans. In that regard, my Department has written to local authorities emphasising the importance of engaging in a process of active land management on an ongoing basis. Information received as part of that exercise, although not fully complete, indicates that, at end-2005, local authorities had access to land capable of supporting the delivery of some 43,000 social and affordable housing units.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is estimated that at the end of 2005 the number of local authority rented dwellings without central heating has been reduced to less than 30,000 units as a result of the central heating programme introduced by my Department in 2004, which provides funding for the installation of central heating in existing local authority dwellings which lack such a facility. I notified local authorities of their 2006 capital allocations under this programme of almost &euro;32 million in January, 2006, which will enable central heating facilities to be installed in more than 6,000 local authority dwellings in 2006. My Department will continue to support this important programme with capital funding.</P>
    <P>Cases of households without a hot water facility have not been brought to the attention of my Department. However, any such cases will be dealt with through the implementation of the central heating programme.</P>

	<P>Policy as regards development on national roads has been consistent for many years; it was developed in <Col N="1876"/>consideration of the need to protect the safety of road users, as well as the substantial investment in national roads. The policy was restated recently in my Department&rsquo;s Draft Development Management Guidelines, which are expected to be issued in final form before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>These Guidelines state that, as a general policy, the location of new means of access to national primary roads, or residential, commercial, industrial or other development dependent on such means of access should not be permitted except <Col N="1877"/>in areas where a speed limit of 30-40 m.p.h. applies or in case of infilling, in the existing built-up areas. It is also stated that the same considerations apply to national secondary roads.</P>
    
<P>Under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, the National Roads Authority must be consulted in relation to all planning applications where the proposed development would involve the formation or widening of an access to a national road &mdash; except in a built up area &mdash; or where it might give rise to a significant increase in the volume of traffic using a national road.</P>
    <P>Any submissions made by the NRA on a planning application must, as with all submissions, be taken into account by the planning authority in making its decision. It is open to the NRA, as it is to any person or body who made a submission, to appeal the decision of a planning authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
    <P>The system in place as regards development on national roads is fair and transparent. It is not proposed to introduce amending legislation in this area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 783 and 809 together.</P>
    <P>Under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), local authorities are providing accommodation for certain recipients of SWA rent supplement who have been assessed as having a long-term housing need. The RAS is an additional housing option and eligible persons can indicate their preference to be accommodated by local authorities under the RAS or social housing, or to be considered under both.</P>
    <P>Over 1,200 cases have been transferred to RAS since the initial transfers in September 2005. Of these cases some 160 cases have been transferred in Waterford City and County. A further 770 households which were recipients of Rent Sup<Col N="1878"/>plement have been provided with local authority housing.</P>
    <P>In addition, 6,000 prospective RAS households have had their cases reviewed. Work is ongoing on interviewing tenants, the inspection of properties and meeting and negotiating with accommodation providers. The aim is to have 5,000 cases transferred to the RAS by the end of the year. The total cost of the scheme to date is &euro;2.48m of which &euro;1,592,000 has been spent in the current year. Some &euro;19 million has been provided to support the implementation of the scheme in 2006.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the scheme will accelerate as local authorities procure new accommodation through the development of new public private partnership (PPP) arrangements and through partnering arrangements with the Voluntary and Cooperative Housing sector.</P>

    <P>In the first quarter of 2006 under Part V, 184 affordable and 167 social houses were acquired. In the same period, there were 21,894 private house completions, many of which would not have been subject to Part V e.g. of this total over 5,600 were one-off units and exempted from Part V. Other exemptions include social and affordable schemes or smaller developments of 4 units or less or built on unzoned land or with planning permissions granted prior to the introduction of Part V.</P>
    <P>Total output under Part V amounted to 1,371 units in 2005 compared to 591 units in 2004. I am satisfied that Part V is operational in all planning authorities and that output is gathering momentum as evidenced by the statistics.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 790 and 824 together.</P>
    <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 549 of 5 July 2006. The position is unchanged. With regard to the attachment of planning conditions requiring management companies in housing developments, a survey in late 2005 showed that planning authorities do not generally attach planning conditions regarding management companies in the case of conventional housing estates, that is, estates of houses with their own gardens. They might do so only in exceptional circumstances, for example to maintain shared private facilities such as sewage treatment. The 2000 Planning Act contains explicit provisions regarding the responsibility of planning authorities for the taking in charge of such estates.</P>
    <P>My Department has advised planning authorities that it is not appropriate to attach planning <Col N="1881"/>conditions requiring management companies to maintain the roads, services, etc., in the case of traditional type housing estates. However, as I have stated previously, the related issues of planning conditions regarding management companies and taking in charge can be complex, particularly in the newer mixed estates which contain apartments, duplex houses and terraced houses, with shared facilities such as car-parking and gardens exclusively for the development. Genuine questions arise as to whether it is appropriate that all facilities on these estates, which may include high specification paving and landscaping, should be taken in charge and maintained at public expense. Many of these facilities are replacing the traditional gardens, which, in a conventional housing estate, would fall to be maintained by the residents rather than the local authority.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present updating the residential density guidelines following on the publication of the Housing Policy Framework: Building Sustainable Communities, last December. It will be appropriate to examine further the issues of taking in charge and management companies in this context.</P>

     <asker>Mr. Bruton</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
     <Quest>the areas to which the producer responsibility initiative for waste recovery has been put in place.</Quest>
     <QRef>[27659/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>A key component of waste management policy in Ireland in recent years has been the development of producer responsibility initiatives (PRIs). Such initiatives are in line with EU and national policy on waste management which is firmly grounded on the internationally recognised waste management hierarchy which prioritises respectively waste prevention and minimisation: increased levels of reuse, recycling and biological treatment; energy recovery; and finally, utilising landfill as the last resort for residual waste that cannot otherwise be recovered. This approach is reflected in my Department&rsquo;s policy statements Changing Our Ways (1998), Delivering Change (2002), and Taking Stock and Moving Forward (2004).</P>
    <P>Successful PRIs are already operating in Ireland in the areas of packaging, farm plastics, and waste electrical and electronic equipment. I recently signed regulations for a further producer responsibility initiative in relation to an EU Directive on end-of-life vehicles and work is ongoing in developing a producer responsibility initiative for waste tyres.</P>
    <P>While the concept of producer responsibility is well embedded in waste management policy and <Col N="1882"/>practice there is a need to build on this experience with regard to the contribution which it can make to waste prevention and the reduction of negative environmental impacts. Extended Producer Responsibility involves the assignment of increased responsibility to the producer and provides producers with a direct financial incentive to incorporate environmental considerations in the design of products. It deals not just with the waste phase, but addresses upstream issues in relation to resource selection and product<?oasys _jy ?>design.</P>
    <P>This focus on design is already incorporated in EU legislation on End-of-Life Vehicles and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) Directives, all of which are now transposed in Irish law.</P>
    <P>Also relevant is the overall National Waste Prevention Programme currently being developed and implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and which involves the development of waste prevention and minimisation strategies aimed at reducing negative environmental impacts. The EPA have been allocated an initial budget of &euro;2m to fund the Programme.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>An effective basis for addressing our waste management responsibilities has been put in place through my Department&rsquo;s policy statements Changing Our Ways, Delivering Change (1998), and Taking Stock Moving Forward (2004); through statutory waste management plans (largely prepared on a regional basis), and the comprehensive regulatory framework now in place in relation to waste.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s approach is based on the internationally recognised waste management hierarchy of prevention/minimisation, significantly increased levels of recycling, energy recovery and, finally, utilising landfill as the last resort for residual waste that cannot otherwise be recovered.</P>
    <P>A key priority currently is the development and roll out of a National Waste Prevention Programme. A Core Prevention Team was established in 2004 in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and drive the Programme. The Core Prevention Team is in the process of developing baseline studies as part of the initial phase of the Programme. The five-year programme also envisages mandatory waste and material audits, waste prevention pilot schemes <Col N="1883"/>etc. The initial budget for the National Waste Prevention Programme is &euro;2m.</P>
    <P>A key component of the waste management system in Ireland has been the development of producer responsibility initiatives. In recent years, successful producer responsibility initiatives have been introduced in the areas of packaging waste, waste electrical and electronic equipment and farm plastics.</P>
    <P>I recently made regulations for a further producer responsibility initiative in relation to an EU Directive on end-of-life vehicles. These initiatives are based on the promotion of waste prevention and minimisation objectives. Work is also underway in developing producer responsibility initiatives for waste tyres and for newsprint.</P>
    <P>Waste prevention and minimisation has also been actively promoted in the Race Against Waste campaign. The media campaign has focused on the prevention of waste and the need to reduce, reuse and recycle and aims to turn awareness on waste issues into action to reduce the amount of waste being sent to landfill.</P>
    <P>The campaign has also worked closely with Environmental Awareness Officers in all of the local authorities, who work locally with householders, schools, businesses and community groups. It has encouraged communities to minimise, recycle and compost their waste through the national Tidy Towns competition&rsquo;s Race Against Waste module.</P>
    <P>In addition, waste prevention targets for biodegradable waste were recently set out in the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste. The projections of biodegradable waste arising in future years in the Strategy are based on an expectation that the waste prevention initiatives outlined above will yield benefits in reducing the quantity of biodegradable municipal waste which would be generated in their absence.</P>

    <P>The report of the Working Group which was established to review the management of dog breeding establishments was submitted to me on 7 September 2005. The report contained a number of recommendations, including in relation to the introduction of statutorily enforceable standards for the dog breeding industry in Ireland, and proposed the introduction of a registration system for dog breeding establishments. However, three of the members of the Working Group disagreed with the main recommendations and submitted three separate minority reports.</P>
    <P>On 30 May, I announced my intention to proceed with implementation of the majority recommendations of the Working Group.

	<P>The Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 require the owner or other person in charge of a dog to ensure that the dog at all times wears a collar bearing the name and address of the owner on an attached plate, badge or disc. The regulations contain penalties for non-compliance with this requirement or for defacing or rendering illegible the above particulars. These arrangements followed consideration of all practicable options for ensuring identification of dogs, including that of micro-chipping, and are being kept under review.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Working <Col N="1886"/>Group which was established to review the management of dog breeding establishments comprised representatives from a cross section of relevant organisations. Regrettably, no woman was among the representatives nominated by these organisations, and in view of the urgency of advancing the work the group as constituted was mandated to proceed.</P>
    <P>There were two separate public consultation processes associated with the review. As part of its deliberations, the working group itself invited submissions from interested persons and bodies by way of public notice in the national newspapers. In addition, following receipt of the group&rsquo;s report, an advertisement inviting submissions was also placed in the national newspapers by my Department. The responses received included many submissions from women and I am satisfied that all interested persons had adequate opportunity to make their views known to me.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In law, the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority. It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the co-operation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a package of measures, to be implemented over the coming months, aimed at assisting local authorities to improve the Register. The measures include the use of Census enumerators or other temporary personnel to support local authorities in preparing the next Register. I am also prepared to make increased, ring fenced financial resources available to local authorities this year to update the Register.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate an early start to the local authority campaigns in respect of the 2007/8 Register, my Department has distributed stocks of registration forms to the authorities and they have been asked to proceed with their campaigns as soon as possible. The Electoral Act 1992 requires that the draft Register is published not later than 1 November each year.</P>

	<P>Local authorities undertake statutory assessments of housing need every three years. The most recent assessment of need for social housing was undertaken by local authorities in March 2005 indicated that there were 43,684 households on local authority waiting lists compared with 48,413 in March 2002 &mdash; a decrease of almost 10%. The previous assessment of housing need undertaken in March 1999 indicated that there were 39,176 households on local authority waiting lists. A breakdown of the 2005 assessments by local authority is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i> while the 2002 and 1999 assessments are available in the September Quarterly Housing Statistics Bulletins for the respective years, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas library.</P>

	<P>The details requested in relation to the budgetary allocation in 2006 for the organisations operating under the aegis of my Department and which receive all or a significant part of their funding from the Exchequer are set out in the following table. Some further and more detailed information is contained in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2006 published by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Information on the funding of organisations under my Department which do not receive budgetary allocations from the Exchequer, e.g. the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the Housing Finance Agency, the Local Government Computer Services Board, the Local Government Management Services Board and the National Building Agency are contained in the Annual Reports and Audited Accounts of such bodies which are in the Oireachtas Library or available directly from the organisations concerned.</P>
    <P>Local authorities receive substantial funding from the Department under a wide range of programmes. Payments are made to local authorities in some cases on the basis of definitive allocations for the year or in some cases on the basis of claims for recoupment having regard to indicative <Col N="1888"/>allocations notified to them. Many payments are made on the basis of claims for recoupment on approved projects independent of any system of annual allocations. Details of adopted revenue budgets of local authorities are available from the local authorities and are collated retrospectively and published by my Department. The most recent publication &ldquo;Local Authority Budgets 2004&rdquo; is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

These assessments are the Councils&rsquo; most up to date and complete statements to my Department of their water and sewerage infrastructure proposals.</P>
    <P>The assessments were taken into account in the framing of subsequent phases of my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme, including the most recently published Programme for 2005 to 2007 which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have recently been asked by my Department to produce new assessments of needs and to submit the results to the Department by 31 July 2006. This will afford Waterford County and City Councils an opportunity to identify any additional infrastructural needs in their <Col N="1892"/>areas as an input to future phases of the Water Services Investment Programme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 811 and 822 together.</P>
    <P>To address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic, designated facilities are being provided this year on a temporary basis by local authorities where farmers may deposit stockpiled farm film plastic and silage wrap. This is operating on a pilot basis in the first instance in counties Galway, Clare, Mayo, Offaly and Waterford. This service is free to the farmer and funding to assist the local authorities is being made available from my Department through the Environment Fund. As collections under the Pilot scheme are still under way in a number of pilot areas data on the volume collected is not yet available in my Department. It is planned to roll out this service to other areas after the initial trial, which will assist in determining the quantities of plastic likely to be recovered for recycling under this initiative.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Article 9 of European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste provides that packaging may not be placed on the market within the European Union unless it satisfies the provisions of the Directive i.e. it complies with the essential requirements on the composition and the reusable and recoverable nature of packaging as provided for in Annex II of that Directive. In this regard, Annex II of the Directive explicitly provides that packaging shall be designed, produced and placed on the market in such a way as to permit its reuse or recovery, including recycling and composting.</P>

    <P>Under article 18 of the Directive, Member States are prohibited from impeding the placing on the market of packaging which satisfies these essential requirements. The essential requirements of packaging are transposed into national law under the combined provisions of article 24, and the Third Schedule, of the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003, as amended, <Col N="1894"/>which provides that a person may not supply packaging or packaged products to the Irish market unless the packaging concerned complies with essential requirements as to its nature and composition.</P>
    <P>The regulations impose obligations in relation to the recycling of backdoor waste on all producers participating in the placing of packaging on the Irish market. In addition, major producers i.e. those who have an annual turnover in excess of &euro;1 million and who place more than 25 tonnes of packaging on the Irish market, have additional responsibilities with regard to the recovery of packaging waste from their customers. Major producers are required to take steps individually to recover their packaging waste (i.e. self-compliance) or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes set up to recover packaging waste.</P>
    <P>Repak Limited was established by Irish industry in 1997 to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste with a view to achieving Ireland&rsquo;s packaging waste recovery and recycling targets under the Directive and is the only such approved compliance scheme in Ireland. Repak membership income is used to subsidise the collection of packaging waste from both the household and commercial sectors.</P>
    <P>While Repak&rsquo;s primary role is to support the recycling of packaging waste, the fee structure applicable to its members &mdash; which is related to the type and amount of packaging placed on the market &mdash; reflects the polluter pays principle and directly incentivises the minimisation and reuse of packaging by producers. In addition, article 4(5) of the regulations expressly provides that account shall not be taken of packaging destined for reuse for the purpose of determining whether or not a producer is a major producer &mdash; this similarly provides a direct incentive for producers to introduce systems to promote the reuse of packaging.</P>
    <P>In the light of the comprehensive regulatory regime in place for packaging waste, Ireland has enjoyed considerable success in recent years in meeting targets for the recovery and recycling of this significant waste stream. Data from the Environmental Protection Agency shows that the 25% target for 2001 set under Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste was achieved and also that, with 56% recovery of packaging waste in 2004, Ireland has exceeded the 2005 recovery target of 50% set under the Directive.</P>
    <P>Typically, deposit and refund schemes have been used in a number of countries as a vehicle to promote the use of refillable / reusable packaging. Successful deposit and refund schemes operating internationally are generally located in those countries where there has been no break in the continuity and cultural tradition of deposit <Col N="1895"/>and refund arrangements. This is not the case in Ireland and there would now quite likely be significant costs involved in re-establishing deposit and refund arrangements here. The cost of storage for returned items either by retail outlets or in automated reverse vending machines (which redeem refunds to consumers based on the type and number or weight of containers deposited in the receptacles concerned), the additional transport movements and the costs associated with collecting returned items from the substantial number of authorised collection points that would be required, together with other ancillary costs and demands associated with operating deposit and refund systems, are issues that would have to be taken into account in assessing the adoption of such an approach in Ireland.</P>

	<P>Under the National Litter Pollution Monitoring System, full details of which are available on <i>www.litter.ie</i>, local authorities carry out surveys to determine the extent, main causes and composition of litter pollution in their areas.

The data also enables local authorities to provide more effective litter management planning for their areas and ensure optimum allocation of resources to tackle litter pollution.</P>
    <P>Under the system, the extent and severity of litter pollution is measured using a Litter Pollution Index (LPI), of 1 to 5 as follows:</P>
    <P LI="1">1. Unpolluted or litter free</P>

   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances. The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges. I do not consider it appropriate to propose a departure from the existing statutory provisions which recognise the local nature of waste management services.</P>
    <P>However, in order to assist the elderly and other households with lower incomes, I have asked local authorities to engage with commercial <Col N="1898"/>waste collectors with a view to agreeing on a scheduling of payments (i.e. a phased pay-as-you-go system) rather than a periodic lump sum payment.</P>

	<P>The EU Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) allows producers to show the cost of recovering and recycling &ldquo;historic&rdquo; waste i.e. waste arising from electric and electronic products put on the market before 13 August 2005. These costs are referred to as Environmental Management Costs &mdash; or EMCs. They are not imposed by, or remitted to, the Government, but are paid by producers to the two collective compliance schemes operating in Ireland, WEEE Ireland and the European Recycling Platform. As schemes are operating under the responsibility of the producers, information on the revenue collected to date is not available in my Department.</P>

	<P>It is not proposed at this stage to make solar water heating systems mandatory in new houses. However, I intend to keep this option under review in the light of growing experience with the voluntary use of this technology in Ireland. To date, over 1,000 applications for grant assistance towards installation of solar water heating have been approved by SEI under the &ldquo;Greener Homes&rdquo; and &ldquo;House of Tomorrow&rdquo; schemes.</P>
    <P>The amended Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) of the Building Regulations set a maximum permitted CO

	<P>I refer to the May 2006 edition of Technical Guidance Document (TGD) L on how to comply with the amended Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) Building Regulations 2005, a copy of which has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Section 1.1. of TGD L provides for the use of a revised energy performance assessment methodology for new dwellings &mdash; the Dwellings Energy Assessment Procedure (DEAP). Full details of DEAP were published by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) on 29 June 2006 and can be viewed on the website for implementation of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive &mdash; <i>www.sei.epbd.ie/deap</i>.</P>
    <P>Under DEAP, the energy performance of a dwelling will be expressed in terms of &mdash; (1) Carbon Dioxide emissions generated by space heating, ventilation, water heating and lighting- kgCO
<?oasys _cf8- ?>2
<?oasys _cf1- ?>/m
<?oasys _cf7- ?>2
<?oasys _cf1- ?> per annum; and (2) Energy required to provide space heating, ventilation, water heating and lighting &mdash; kWh/m
<?oasys _cf7- ?>2
<?oasys _cf1- ?> per annum.</P>
    <P>New dwellings will, with effect from 1 January 2007, be required to have a building energy rating (BER) which will reflect the energy performance of the dwelling. The precise scale is still being developed. The proposed BER Certificate will be finalized and published by the end of August.</P>
    <P>The Non-Domestic Energy Assessment Procedure (NEAP) to assess the energy performance and rating of more complex new Non-Domestic Buildings will be developed and published by the end of 2007.</P>
