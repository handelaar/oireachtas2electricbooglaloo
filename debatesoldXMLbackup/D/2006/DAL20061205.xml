	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 16, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>On 20 October I attended the informal meeting of EU Heads of State or Government in Lahti, Finland and the working dinner that followed with the President of the Russian Federation, Mr. Vladimir Putin.  The meeting in Lahti was not a full European Council and did not, therefore, adopt formal conclusions.  However, it provided a useful forum where the Heads of State or Government could discuss in depth the key areas of innovation and energy.  We also had shorter discussions on the position in Darfur and on immigration policy.  While I had no formal bilateral meetings in Lahti, I did have brief discussions with a number of my colleagues including the President of Cyprus, Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos and Prime Minister Blair.  The meeting with President Putin was timely and the European Union spoke with one voice on energy and the need for Russia to more actively address human rights <Col N="1799"/>issues.  I have received a draft agenda for the European Council meeting on 14-15 December.  The Council will deal with enlargement including the absorption capacity of the European Union, justice issues, innovation and energy, and external relations.</P>
        <P>I travelled to Brussels on 8 November for a meeting with the College of European Commissioners.  In advance of the meeting, I had a short <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso.  Following the meeting with the College of Commissioners, I also attended a working lunch hosted by President Barroso.  Our discussions were very useful and constructive.  I underlined to the Commission the absolutely central role the EU has played and continues to play in Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social transformation.  We discussed the current state of play in respect of the draft European constitution.  We also had a useful exchange on competitiveness and I explained the Irish Government&rsquo;s position on Aer Lingus, stressing the necessity, in our view, of competition in the Irish market.  I briefed President Barroso on the situation in Northern Ireland.  In response, President Barroso informed me that the Commission had been following the situation in Northern Ireland closely.  He expressed his hope that all parties would give their support to the St. Andrews Agreement and he extended an invitation to the nominees for First Minister and Deputy First Minister to visit Brussels after 24 November.  I also thanked the Commission for supporting official and working language status for the Irish language.</P>
        <P>On 29 November, I travelled to Brussels to address a plenary session of the European Parliament.  In my address to the European Parliament, I underlined the importance of the constitutional treaty to the future of Europe.  I outlined what I feel are the greatest challenges facing Europe including competitiveness, globalisation, external relations and the need for Europe to connect better with its citizens.  My address to the European Parliament has been laid before both Houses.  In addition to addressing the Parliament, I had an informal meeting with the Irish MEPs, from North and South.  I also had a very good meeting with President Borrell.  We touched on current issues of Irish interest, including according official and working language status for the Irish language from January.  I had a useful lunch with representatives of the various parties in the Parliament.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>What view has the Taoiseach articulated in respect of the increasing danger due to the attenuation of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons treaty?  The review of the treaty has been postponed until 2010, with serious consequences with regard to North Korea and Iran.  Has the Taoiseach articulated the Irish view and what is the EU response to it?</P><Col N="1800"/>
        <P>The EU Vice President, Mr. Franco Frattini, stated that immigration and terrorism will be the two main issues on the European agenda for the foreseeable future.  He stated it would be necessary to spend &euro;272 million between now and 2013 to protect European borders.  At the recent European People&rsquo;s Party, EPP, meeting it was made clear that this is a serious problem no European country can deal with alone.  Last year the Dutch sent back 17,000 people and this year some 25,000 people were arrested attempting to enter Greece.  A similar figure applies to Malta and the Spanish Government of Zapatero has legalised several hundred thousand people, principally from North Africa, since 2004.  With the population of Africa doubling within the next 20 years, no European country could deal with even a small percentage of that population deciding to migrate.  We welcome immigrants to our country and the role they play in the development of our economy and its services.  What is the view of immigration?  What progress has been made on a comprehensive, clear and practical EU policy on immigration?</P>
        <P>The Copenhagen criteria were adopted by the EU regarding the entry of Turkey.  At this stage entry cannot become an eventuality unless criteria are agreed and accepted on both sides.  Are we putting off the decision day when Turkey, as a secular state, refuses to recognise Cyprus?  This is a clear problem.  A conclusion on Turkey&rsquo;s entry will not be reached until the problem is solved.  This matter was discussed at the recent Heads of Government meeting.  What was the outcome and what view did the Taoiseach articulate as the Irish Prime Minister?  What is his view on whether this will become a reality?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There were three questions on non-proliferation.  We were disappointed and spoke quite clearly about the lack of progress to date.  We are one of the countries that has pushed this issue recently and we have reiterated the Irish position.  It was not discussed at the Lahti meeting and it will not be discussed at next week&rsquo;s meeting.  It has been discussed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, a number of times and we will continue to outline our position on it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s comments on immigration are correct as it is an enormous problem, particularly for the Mediterranean countries.  The numbers that came in to small countries such as Cyprus and Malta this summer have been very large, and that has created significant problems for them.  There are plenty of policies, co-operative agreements and memorandums of understanding across the Community on how these matters work, but as the Deputy is aware, when people arrive and come into the system, an attempt must be made to deal with them.  These countries are bound by the Geneva Convention 1951 and other protocols, but that does not take from the pressure that will continue to be felt by them.</P><Col N="1801"/>
        <P>There are long-term goals that we play a part in, such as the significant resources we put into ODA in helping countries in Africa, but as long as there are so many conflicts and problems there, the huge pressure will not be reduced.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has visited Darfur twice this year and has lent his voice to solving many of the problems in Africa.</P>
        <P>Countries have pledged to work together but the Spanish decision clearly creates pressure for other countries in the region which do not take the same view.  Such countries have made their own assessment.  Italy, for example, made a number of decisions that were outside the normal European position, but there are continuing efforts in the European Council, particularly the justice affairs council, to get everybody to work together.  There will not be a totally coherent policy when some countries are being hit by such a level of immigration.</P>
        <P>We dealt with the issue of Turkey during the Irish Presidency of the EU when the UN initiative had come about, and I remained close to the issue for that reason.  I discussed it earlier and reported to the House previously about discussions with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel.  At her bequest I spoke to Tassos Papadopoulos, whom I have spoken to a number of times since.  We spoke again last Friday by telephone.  In our view, Turkey must redouble its efforts in pursuing its reform agenda, which it has been told to do and which it should do.  The main stumbling block currently is the implementation of the Ankara Protocol and if a solution is not found urgently, I fear the negotiations will head for trouble, which I have made clear.  I expect the issue will be discussed in depth at the December European Council meeting.</P>
        <P>I have been sympathetic in recent years towards President Papadopoulos, who has been under much pressure.  It is not just another issue in Cyprus, it is enormously important for the Cypriot people.  On the day I was with the Commission four weeks ago, it had issued its paper and the Deputy will be aware of the effort made since with a number of chapters and in trying to keep the issue going without a total collapse.  It will be difficult to proceed without a collapse.  Although the Finnish Presidency has worked extremely hard on this, President Papadopoulos will not take a soft option.  The original intention was for this to be discussed at a foreign affairs meeting and that agreement would be reached, but I do not believe that will happen.  I believe it will end up on the table at the European Council and President Papadopoulos will take a tough line.  His position is the Ankara Protocol is not agreed.  Where do we go?  His position as he sees it, and as we supported during the Irish Presidency, is that if Europe does not stand by one of its own members, which is the issue, he will take a tough line and he has contacted colleagues in his campaign on this.</P><Col N="1802"/>
        <P>Deputy Kenny knows from his group that others take a different view.  The European pro-Turkey lobby will take its line to smooth a way of continuing the process.  We are in for a lively session on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>At the main discussions or in any of the side meetings did the Taoiseach discuss with the EU Heads of State the practice which disturbed many people in the EU in recent times of the CIA and US intelligence agencies kidnapping individuals and bringing them to the Guantanamo gulag or other places to be tortured?  Recently, the Taoiseach was quoted in the Irish press as stating that last St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, &ldquo;I was sat closer to him than you are to me now&rdquo; in reference to President Bush.  He also stated, &ldquo;I looked at the great&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is clear.  The Taoiseach stated, &ldquo;I looked at the great President Bush&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not arise.  The Deputy is making a statement.  It is not appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree.  I object to any attempt to thrust greatness on President Bush, the man responsible for one of the biggest disasters in our time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to return to the questions before us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is that the Taoiseach stated he looked at President Bush, and asked him whether he could be sure to be sure that so-called &ldquo;extraordinary renditions&rdquo; did not involve this country.  He was assured this was the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is on Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Ireland was part of the European Union the last time I looked.  It is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, Deputy.  Does the Deputy have a question that is relevant?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>This must be one of the most meaningful glances in the history of the State in the sense that an entire abuse of civil rights, which involved the European Union&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question relative to the questions before us?  The questions deal with a meeting of European Heads of State.  If the Deputy has a question I will hear <Col N="1803"/>it.  If not, I ask him to resume his seat and allow Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in to contribute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is really intolerable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It may well be.  However, the Standing Orders&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry.  The Ceann Comhairle is intruding into the body of my question which is relevant, appropriate and in order.  I asked the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair will decide whether it is in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in order.  I can read Standing Orders for myself.  I asked the Taoiseach whether he discussed with EU leaders at the meeting the involvement of countries of the European Union in extraordinary renditions.  Is that in order?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That part of the question is in order.  Going on to make a Second Stage speech is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not make a Second Stage speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy began one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I might as well come in with an algebraic formula and put it in front of the Taoiseach if we are not allowed to utter a single word outside of the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s extremely narrow definition of what is in order.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach think, and is there any suggestion, that within the European Union, which claims to be a zone where human rights are respected, there should be a common position in absolute opposition to this so-called &ldquo;extraordinary rendition&rdquo;?  What is the view of other leaders in the European Union with regard to certain countries co-operating with the kidnapping of individuals and facilitating it?</P>
        <P>Regarding the discussions between the EU and President Putin, what assurances, if any, were given on the human rights inside Russia of members of opposition groups, trade unions, journalists who are routinely murdered and the people of Chechnya who are brutally repressed?  What is the basis of the understanding of the relationship between the EU and Russia in respect of what this regime is allowed to do?  I know the recent suspicions about the death of Alexander Litvinenko had not come to light at that stage, but it is all part of a process.  What did President Putin say to the Taoiseach in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the first matter, extraordinary rendition was not discussed at the recent meetings.  It was raised this time last year <Col N="1804"/>by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the General Affairs and External Affairs Council.  The EU wrote to the Americans.  Following this, the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, visited Europe and gave assurances.  I reported on the previous meeting on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day to the House at the time.  </P>
        <P>In respect of the situation in Russia and the meeting with President Putin, the matter attracted quite considerable attention at the European Council because the journalist had been killed in the preceding few days.  There was a common EU position on the issue.  The European Commission intends to open negotiations on a new legal framework to govern EU-Russia relations which will supersede the current partnership and co-operation agreement, which expired on 30 November.  It has been agreed to roll over the existing agreement and that more time is needed for discussions.  A number of issues are covered in this.</P>
        <P>The death of Anna Politkovskaya has again highlighted civil and human rights.  There are considerable tensions surrounding this issue.  If one asks me whether President Putin satisfied everybody on this issue, the answer is that he takes quite an aggressive line with European leaders on this issue.  He continually does so at meetings, defends his position and denies any involvement by any Russian state sources in any killings, interference with the press or others involved.  This is the standard answer.  It generates a substantial amount of tension at all of the meetings.  This tension is increasing, regardless of the recent event, because almost every time a meeting is held, some other litany of actions has happened.  As Deputy Joe Higgins rightly pointed out, only some of these events are publicised here.  A considerable number of business people, chairmen of major organisations, journalists and human rights advocates have been executed in one form or another in the recent past.  This issue is not only raised at meetings with President Putin but also at meetings held every six months with the Presidency.  Each Presidency in turn meets President Putin.  He gives his stated answer and that is as much as I can say about the matter.</P>

	<P>Did the meeting of the European Council in Finland discuss the services directive?  Is the Taoiseach aware that the directive, despite the fact that it has been amended somewhat, remains a very bad deal for workers in Ireland and throughout Europe?  Is he aware that employers are in a position to sell services throughout the EU with very few restrictions applying, yet can employ workers at the lowest possible wage return and with very poor conditions applying?  </P>
        <P>We thought we had seen and heard some of the worst examples in the Irish Ferries affair.  However, is the Taoiseach aware of the example of the Norfolk Line freight ship that serves between Heysham and Dublin on which workers <Col N="1805"/>are receiving as little as &euro;2 per hour?  Can he explain why he and his Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Fair enough.  If the issue has not been addressed at the most recent meeting, maybe the Taoiseach will explain it to us, given the real concerns of Members.  Will it be on the agenda of a future meeting of the European Council?  Will the Taoiseach seek to address it in the context of these abuses?</P>
        <P>Did the European Council discuss or will it address the proposed use of EU battle groups, to which this Government has now clearly committed itself, clearly against our stated policy of neutrality?  Does the Taoiseach agree this merits serious address at the European Council meeting, not least in the context of the statement by the Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, regarding what the battle groups represented to him?  Let there be no mistake that this issue merits very serious address.  Has the Taoiseach raised the issues concerning the services directive and the battle groups or engaged thereon with others in attendance at the European Council meeting?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first questions, the matter was not discussed at the meeting of the European Council.  The Parliament&rsquo;s compromise and the modification to which it has agreed have moved on and have received strong support in the Parliament.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have the second highest, if not the highest, minimum wage.  The legislation we had worked out with the social partners is under preparation.  The first part of it was put to the Government today.  Separate units are working on two other parts and we are committed to the arrangements we came to.  I hope the services directive will find its way into the various policy initiatives by the Commission over the months ahead.</P>
        <P>The EU battle groups were obviously not discussed at the recent European Council meeting but we are going to participate.  Participation will be based on the triple-lock mechanism.  Training will commence in 2007 with a view to commencement in 2008.  It will be on the basis which the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, puts before the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach envisage the European treaty being put to the people in 2007?  A recent address by him, if I read it correctly, warned against the unravelling of the constitution and the cherry-picking of elements thereof.  What is his current assessment of the prospects of success regarding the existing document?  What is his assessment of the attitude of other member states, particularly France and the Netherlands?  Notwithstanding this, does he believe we are likely to have a referendum on the matter next year?  Is it possible to maintain the Irish position of opposing changes to the document and, at the same time, rationally expecting the peoples of France and Holland to approve the same document they already rejected?  Is it not inevitable that, after the French referendum, there will have to be some changes if the document is to be successful?</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Consider the meeting with President Putin regarding the energy crisis and the fact so much of our gas supply is from Russia.  After that meeting, the Taoiseach referred explicitly to the informal meeting with President Putin.  What is his view of the outcome of that meeting regarding a guarantee of supply to EU member states, particularly this one?</P>
        <P>I presume the issue of enlargement and a migration document will be discussed at the December summit in Brussels.  How does the Taoiseach see enlargement in the case of Turkey?  Has the climate changed, having regard to recent developments in respect of the terms with which it was to comply?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not expect the Netherlands or France to accept the EU constitution exactly as it is.<b></b> If they wish to, these states could have protocols written and attached as addenda to the constitution to cover the points they coherently argue created difficulties for them.  They would get agreement for this.  The European Parliament and Council would be open to supporting that position.  Some said it should not be called a constitution but a revision of treaties.  However, it was called a constitution because that was the wish of the former French President who chaired the convention.  Therefore, it was a French position.</P>
        <P>Having been involved in the process and the convention, one could simplify the document.  If one was doing it again, one could take sections out that would not radically alter the document.  There are several things one could do to simplify it.  If there was a will in the Netherlands and France to do this, it would be possible.  Support is available to deal with it.</P>
        <P>When he was here, President Borrell told me &mdash; he said it previously also &mdash; that the countries which had not yet ratified the constitution, Ireland, Denmark, Sweden and perhaps Portugal, should go ahead and have a referendum anyway, even though we know it will be changed in either <Col N="1807"/>a minor or substantive way.  I do not think that will happen in any country, as there has to be certainty before all of the countries will be happy to go ahead and have a referendum.</P>
        <P>It looks as if Angela Merkel will make a considerable effort.  The top two items for her presidency are energy and the EU constitution.  She will put life into it and work around the March declaration of the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome to try to bring forward a policy position and get others to buy into it.  The topic has been aired a great deal in the French presidential campaign and the French are leading the cherrypicking campaign.  The trouble with cherrypicking is that everyone picks different cherries.  It will not be possible to achieve agreement if they proceed on that basis.</P>
        <P>Everything moves on over a period of a few years.  I reminded the Parliament and Commission last week that once we had 27 member states, in a month&rsquo;s time, under the Nice treaty, about which they have all conveniently forgotten but will not be able to forget for much longer, there would no longer be one commissioner per member state.  We are straight back into that argument and I suspect they will all wake up to it around February.  They almost reckon it does not matter but they will realise it is a written treaty and the law.  Once Bulgaria and Romania join, there will be a difficulty.  That will bring some sense to the debate.  It will also bring some interesting issues to it.</P>
        <P>I agree with the view articulated by Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s colleague, Mr. De Rossa, MEP, that one could simplify the constitution and add some protocols to it that could be worked out, a little like what we did.  That would be easy to do if one really wanted to do it.  If one takes the French line, it will become a major problem.  An election has been held in the Netherlands but I am told it will be several months before a government sees the light of day.  That will not be great for the process either.</P>
        <P>The position on the energy issue is far better than it is on the human rights issue with regard to the Putin meeting.  The water was much clearer in that regard.  He recognises that he has 500 million or 600 million consumers and that he is getting a good price for energy supplies.  Energy companies &mdash; mainly Gazprom &mdash; have to renew many of their pipes.  As significant capital investment is required, they would gladly do deals with European businessmen to update their infrastructure.  To ensure security of supply, we must ease the situation and avoid conflicts such as the ones started this year but this may be unlikely.  Whether it is right or wrong, our Polish colleagues have taken a tough line with the Russians.  I will not make any comment, other than to say they have taken a tough line and delayed European discussions on the ACP agreement which is based on farm produce.  If they were to take a similar line on energy matters, it <Col N="1808"/>would not be helpful but apart from this, it would work itself out quickly.</P>
        <P>There are two camps on the enlargement issue.  Turkey is now an applicant country, as is Croatia.  There are commitments to other countries in the Balkans that cannot be withdrawn.  Discussions will have to take place at some level.  There are no great difficulties with Croatia&rsquo;s application but it will take a number of years to process.  Major difficulties surround Turkey&rsquo;s application which will take a long time to process, it will extend certainly into the next round of the financial perspective, almost a decade away in 2014.  The Balkan countries will not be ready but a cause must be given to them to continue the process.  That brings me back to the point that one cannot have enlargement until the institutional arrangements are worked out in the constitution.  They will have to decide how the issue is to be dealt with, if not in 2007, which I doubt, then certainly in 2008.</P>
        <P>As I stated in reply to Deputy Kenny, the Commission&rsquo;s view &mdash; probably the Presidency&rsquo;s view and the majority view on the Council &mdash; on the Turkish position is that we should at least keep the discussions going on certain chapters, even if it is not at the same pace as perhaps envisaged a year ago, and see how they proceed.  It will be a long process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>A commitment was given by the Commission in terms of its communication on reducing the impact on the climate of aviation and its expressed intention to bring forward a legislative proposal by the end of this year.  Is this still on course?  Has there been contact with the aviation sector here?  What position will the Government take on the general thrust of such a legislative proposal if it emerges?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this on the open skies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>No, on the climate impact of aviation in trying to reduce emissions and whether there would be taxation to accompany it or whatever.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Those proposals are still live but I do not know when they will come to parliament.  The Commission&rsquo;s view still is that this is a big area of concern for emissions.  It is sticking to its policy and, I think, it will continue to do so.  I do not think it is listed.  On the aviation area, it had hoped to put forward a whole package of measures, but this has been deferred because of what has happened with its own agreement.  The Commission had hoped that the open skies agreement would have led to considerable rationalisation but it will probably deal with it as an environmental issue and proceed with it.  It is still on course.</P>

        <P Just="Left">On the European Council meeting and the forthcoming international human rights day, did the Taoiseach hold discussions with the British Prime Minister on collusion?  Will that issue be pressed further on demand for co-operation with the British Government and, on foot of that, does the Taoiseach propose to establish a public inquiry into murders in which State-sponsored terrorism seems to have played a part, according to the committee of which Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd is a member?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Again, with human rights in mind, the last time we had questions on this area I raised with the Taoiseach the murder of a Russian journalist.  Since then the former spy, Mr. Alexander Litvinenko, was poisoned.  Is there an understanding that we will not press this issue from a human rights point of view, in spite of the fact that Russia has said it will not extradite poison spy suspects, according to the title of a report I have seen, or is it that our dependence on energy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a question for another Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate it is a serious matter that needs to be dealt with by a number of Ministers, but the Taoiseach has discussed this matter at the European Council meeting.  Is it the case that we have to be quiet on human rights issues because of our dependence on Russia for energy?  In regard to the December European Council meeting, given the adoption of targets of 15% to 30% cuts on 1990 carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 2020, is it not likely that member states will be asked to identify targets for each country in terms of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emission cuts?  Is it not the case that the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government and the country, will have to indicate Ireland&rsquo;s target and, if so, has he done that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like a brief resum&eacute; of whether the Lisbon Agenda was discussed at the meeting and whether the Taoiseach is confident that it will be met or even partially met by 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To respond to Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question, that matter is always discussed in detail at the spring Council, which is given over to it totally, and there are always some updates on it at the other Council meetings.  I do not think all the targets will be reached by 2010 but substantial progress has been made in many of the areas.  All member states are still very committed to the ongoing issues of the Lisbon Agenda.  It will continue to be policy for the foreseeable future.  Obviously it is being used as the benchmark for every member state to report back.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s question, I would not like to give the impression that the relationship between the European Union and Russia is soft on the human rights issue.  There is considerable tension on this issue.  It applies far more to others <Col N="1810"/>than to ourselves as they are directly engaged in many everyday dealings with Russia.  Those tensions, if anything, are getting greater by the month.  Obviously, because the recent poisoning happened in London it has received far more publicity here than, in fairness, did the death of Anna Politkovskaya.  There have been so many that the tensions are growing and there were sharp exchanges at the European Council.  There have been fair reports of the meeting, but there were very sharp exchanges, both ways.  President Putin does not sit there on these issues.  He defends his position and attacks fairly aggressively.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Including extradition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On extradition, there are a whole range of people.  Part of the problem in this is that the United Kingdom, as I understand it, has given residency to an enormous number of former KGB people.  They are legally in the UK and this is part of their difficulties in dealing with these issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week the Minister, Deputy Roche, had detailed discussions with the relevant Commissioner on our entire programme.  Obviously there are pressures and tensions where we must deliver on what we said and also acknowledge what we have done.  The Minister will outline our steps on this matter.  I believe questions in this regard appear on the Order Paper.</P>

        <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to further reports on Leas Cross or on the nursing home inspection system which have not been published by her Department or by the Health Service Executive; the steps she proposes to take to ensure the findings of these reports are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive recently published Review of Deaths at Leas Cross Nursing Home 2002-2005 that was commissioned by the HSE and written by Professor Des O&rsquo;Neill.  Separately, the HSE&rsquo;s complaints review group for Dublin north-east has written a report for HSE management on foot of complaints received from concerned families of patients at Leas Cross since May 2005.  That report has not been published as it relates to individual complaints received.</P>
        <P>The HSE working group on nursing home inspections completed an interim report in July this year.  Although it has been referred to in this House and more widely, the HSE has not pub<Col N="1811"/>lished this report as it considers it to be an internal document.  Other reports prepared for the HSE are the normal inspection reports on individual nursing homes, and these are progressively being made available on the HSE website.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it the Minister of State is referring to the report by Dr. Dermot Power, a consultant geriatrician, written on behalf of the HSE.  Does the Minister of State know the name of the report that has not been published?  It is a significant report and I do not believe it relates to just one or two patients.  I believe it is along the lines of the Leas Cross report.  If it is not being published why is this the case?  I do not believe the Minister of State fully understands whether this is the report to which he refers.  It is important because at a time when the departmental officials are screaming at HSE officials to push patients into private nursing homes, another huge issue regarding the Leas Cross report is arising, which the Minister of State is not addressing.  In the first place the Minister of State should clarify for the House that he knows the report mentioned in his response to the parliamentary question.</P>

That report has not been published because it relates to the individual complaints that were received by the HSE in respect of Leas Cross.</P>

	<P>I do not wish to be awkward but is the Minister of State familiar with the author of the report to which he refers?  I am referring to Dr. Dermot Power, a consultant geriatrician at the Mater Hospital who wrote a report for the HSE on nursing homes.  Is that the report to which the Minister of State is referring?  Has the HSE informed him that Dr. Dermot Power compiled a report in respect of nursing homes issues?  Is the Minister of State familiar with the doctor in question and is he aware of the report to which I refer?</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the report to which the Minister of State referred.  The latter report relates to a completely different issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of reports involved, the main one of which relates to Leas Cross.  The HSE sought that the review group for <Col N="1812"/>Dublin north east compile a report and it relates specifically to individual complaints received and, for that reason, it has not been published.</P>
        <P>Dr. Dermot Power&rsquo;s report has not come into my possession.  I am aware that he was asked to compile a report by the HSE.  I will follow up with the executive in respect of that report.  However, I do not have the details relating to it in my possession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the matters in Professor O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s report on Leas Cross relates to the HSE seeking tenders from nursing homes in respect of the taking of high-dependency patients and the fact that such homes subsequently refused to take those patients.  Professor O&rsquo;Neill recommended that patients and families should be informed in this regard.  If the Minister of State is not aware of the existence of a report commissioned by the HSE in respect of a similar issue and if he does not know whether his initial reply related to that report, how could he be in a position to know whether the recommendations are being followed up?  That is extremely sloppy work, particularly when one considers the outcry that has taken place in respect of Leas Cross.  This is the first priority question of the day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>To the best of my knowledge, the Power report is specific to Leas Cross.  From what the Deputy stated, one would think that we were trying to cover up something.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is correct in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The main report that was commissioned was that which relates to Leas Cross.  On the previous occasion on which this matter was dealt with on Question Time, the general view put forward by the Opposition was that we were trying to keep a lid on that report and that we did not want it to be published.</P>

	<P>The Government was obliged to agree with us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not.  I have just explained the reasons for the delay in publishing the report.  We were satisfied to have the report published.  The Minister for Health and Children indicated that we had made every effort to encourage the HSE to publish the report.  It was the HSE that commissioned the report.  It is important that lessons are learned from this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not be possible to learn anything from this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should allow me to answer the question he asked.  Reports have been compiled in respect of this matter.  The Leas Cross report was published.  Even before the latter emerged, a number of measures were taken in respect of how the inspection process works <Col N="1813"/>and we are putting in place a proper training system in respect of the inspection teams.  For the first time ever, we are developing dedicated inspection teams, which are in place throughout the country.  Proper training was not, however, in place.  We will adopt a standardised approach to the way in which inspections are carried out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a different matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The idea of publishing the report in this instance was to identify where the weaknesses lay and to ensure that we learned lessons and put in place a much stronger system, with improved structures, that will guarantee proper care for older people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>

        <P>The McKinsey report, commissioned by the HSE at my request, provided the original basis for the decision to co-locate adult and paediatric <Col N="1814"/>hospital services.  The report is very clear.  It demonstrates that best outcomes for children are achieved by having the necessary breadth and depth of services on a single site.  Co-location of paediatric services with adult services and, in due course, with maternity services is in line with best international practice and this was widely accepted by stakeholders when the McKinsey report was published.</P>
        <P>The collaboration of adult and paediatric specialists is of critical importance.  It creates the necessary platform for sub-specialisation and improved outcomes.  The optimum delivery of complex paediatric surgical services can best be achieved by creating teams of specialists covering both adult and paediatric patients.  Co-location also offers the benefits of providing transitional care for children with complex illnesses who are now surviving well into adult life.</P>
        <P>I am fully satisfied that the task group undertook a rigorous and robust examination of the key issues in making its recommendation.  It is true that the site chosen for the new national paediatric hospital is in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency.  It is being suggested that the Mater Hospital, an internationally renowned adult teaching hospital, should have been disregarded as a possible site for the new paediatric hospital simply because of its location.  Comments by the chairperson of the Mater and Children&rsquo;s University Hospital Limited at a public function a number of months ago were reported out of context.  They related to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s long-standing support for the redevelopment of the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Temple Street, on the Mater site, which at the time was at an advanced stage of planning.  This has now been overtaken by the Government decision to develop a national paediatric hospital.</P>
        <P>It is perhaps understandable, in circumstances where services provided at three hospitals are to move, that the decision has not met with universal approval.  However, some of the public comment has been misinformed.  Not all paediatric services are moving to the new hospital.  As is the case internationally, the new national paediatric hospital will be supported by a strategically-located urgent care service.  The transition group will be advising early in the new year on the recommended scope and location of this service.  The group is working to ensure that the widest possible range of services will be provided through the urgent care service.</P>
        <P>The report commissioned by Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin was submitted to the joint HSE-departmental transition group some weeks ago and has already been the subject of discussions with the hospital.  I also received the report and met with hospital representatives to discuss their concerns.  The transition group is overseeing the preparation of a high level framework brief to inform decisions in respect of the range of services to be provided at the new hospital and the specific site to be ceded by the Mater Hospital.  I understand that the tran<Col N="1815"/>sition group is satisfied that the new hospital can be fully accommodated on the Mater site.  The transition group has assured the Crumlin Hospital authorities that their report will be taken into consideration in the preparation of the framework brief.</P>
        <P>To date, no decision has been taken in respect of the range of services to be provided at the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Tallaght in the context of the development of the national paediatric hospital and the associated urgent care service.  The Taoiseach has given an assurance to Tallaght Hospital that the Government wishes to see it thrive on a sustainable basis as a particular focal point for the involvement of the minority tradition in the health care system and as a key health provider to an expanding local population.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the development, as planned, is consistent with international best practice.  For example, I recently had the opportunity to visit the Children&rsquo;s Memorial Hospital in Chicago, which is an established secondary and tertiary paediatric centre.  The hospital, which operates as a stand-alone facility, will transfer to a city centre site where it will be tri-located with an existing adult teaching hospital and a new maternity hospital.  The hospital authorities considered other options, including a move to a greenfield site, but ultimately decided the clinical and other benefits of the tri-location model far outweighed any other considerations and would allow for the provision of an enhanced level and quality of care for children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister for Health and Children accept that the goodwill present at the start of the process has evaporated and that the Government decision to locate the paediatric hospital on the Mater site has now effectively been rubbished by Crumlin Hospital&rsquo;s report, which clearly states that it is too small?  Perhaps the Minister might deal with those issues, both of which featured in my question.  If Crumlin Hospital says that the site is too small for four hospitals to relocate there, how does the Minister address that?  Her Minister of State has said that those issues will be addressed.  How will she deal with the site that is too small?  How will she answer the criticism that access is too difficult?  What is her answer to the claim that there are too few beds, with 100 fewer than at present?</P>
        <P>Those specific and very serious charges have been levelled regarding a Government decision about which doubts have been raised.  However, she can deal with that political charge only if she can justify it and reply to the questions raised by Crumlin Hospital.  Its chairman pointed out in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that there is now real fear that care will be compromised and fragmented.  Does the Minister accept that it is a very serious charge?</P>
        <P>She seems now to have jettisoned a recommendation in the McKinsey report on urgent care <Col N="1816"/>units.  The recommendation was that they simply be short-term facilities providing urgent care and that no child should be there for longer than 24 hours.  The intention would be to stabilise the child and direct it to the tertiary hospital.  Is the Minister not clearly stating that the part of the McKinsey report in question has been jettisoned?  Is that also for the sake of political expediency?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>If this were a matter of political expediency, we would continue building a new hospital in Crumlin and another in Temple Street.  The original plan was for approximately 700 beds.  McKinsey and Company examined 17 of the top tertiary children&rsquo;s hospitals in the world, on which basis it recommended a 380-bed hospital in the context of Irish demography.  There will be fewer beds than at present because ever more children&rsquo;s services are being provided on a day-case basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Mater site is 20,000 sq. ft.  Before the decision on the location, every paediatrician in Dublin, including Dr. Doherty, with whom I had many discussions, said that it was fantastic.  I remember him telling me that co-location with an adult hospital would be fantastic; there is no doubt about it.</P><Col N="1817"/>
        <P Just="Left">Issues have arisen regarding parking and access.  One must remember that the hospital is for the entire country, since 48% of the children will come from outside the Dublin area.  It was generally thought that a city-centre site, with many children arriving by public transport, would be best.  The metro station will be adjacent to the site.  Their parents may have to stay for a long period, with other relatives visiting.  It was thought that it would be more accessible than picking a site on either side of the city.  Experts were involved regarding traffic and choice of site.</P>
        <P>I accept that when one does not choose the preferred site of certain individuals, people may oppose it.  However, it reassures me greatly that parents of sick children in Crumlin have said it is great and that I should implement the plan without delay.  That is the greatest reassurance of all, and those are the words that I like to hear.</P>
        <P>Urgent care centres have not been compromised.  Of the 25,500 child visits to Tallaght Hospital last year, for example, 19,500 were dealt with the same day, with no overnight stay.  Thankfully, the vast bulk of sick children who require to attend a hospital are treated as day cases and do not require hospitalisation.</P>
        <P>The new hospital will cater for very ill children with rare cancers and serious illnesses, many of whom will be in hospital for a considerable time.  In the past, many such children would not have survived for more than a few days after their birth.  That has changed, which is why co-location with maternity facilities, where high-risk pregnancies will be dealt with, was an important feature of the decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know which parents of sick children the Minister consulted, but I have spoken to a fair number in my constituency, and I have yet to meet one who is happy with this decision.</P>
        <P>I wish to return to certain points.  Dr. Pat Doherty has been mentioned, and he is quite clear that no meaningful input or consultation with the paediatric community took place.  That is his major problem, and perhaps the Minister might respond to that very serious charge.  She says that she has held discussions, but he says that experts have had no meaningful input.</P>
        <P>At first they welcomed the idea of a single hospital, but they now have serious reservations regarding access.  Many parents have raised that question with me.  The hospital may be too small but cannot expand, since there is no open space.  The Minister seems oblivious to the litany of complaints.  Perhaps she might answer this.  The McKinsey report states very clearly that co-location with an adult hospital, while perhaps desirable, is not essential.  However, certain criteria are absolute, and those concern the hospital&rsquo;s future expansion and accessibility by road and public transport.  I hope that the Minister agrees that we ought to listen to the experts in this matter.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1818"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It depends how one defines experts.  Dr. Doherty is the chairman of the medical board in Crumlin.  He is an anaesthetist of considerable experience.  I am not a clinician and therefore unable to question his clinical judgment.  However, I spoke to Dr. Doherty when he was informed of the decision at a meeting organised by the HSE on the outcome of the McKinsey report.  Like all others to whom I spoke, he was extremely enthusiastic.  Dr. Doherty&rsquo;s preferred location was St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, but the decision to locate it at the Mater was taken for several reasons.</P>
        <P>It is not true that there is no room for expansion.  In addition to what I described, 10,000 sq. ft. will be made available at Temple Street, so the hospital can be expanded.  We must stop thinking in narrow engineering terms as if we were construction experts.  I am now being advised that it cannot physically fit on the site, but the experts assure me that it can.  I am told that we should facilitate those coming by car, but the vast majority of cars at current children&rsquo;s hospitals are those of staff members.  I hope that improved public transport in this city will lead to a reduced need for staff to use cars, particularly when the metro is to be located there.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gormley asked me what parents I had consulted.  It was the parents&rsquo; group in Crumlin that told me to act and not let anything delay implementation.  Above all those people, to whom we must listen, want a state-of-the-art facility for their sick children, believing that current facilities leave much to be desired.  The original plan was to build a new hospital in Crumlin and another in Temple Street.  However, we would not achieve good clinical outcomes, subspecialisation or the kind of hospital that we deserve if we split it over two or three sites.  World expertise points to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Why was the paediatric community excluded, as Dr. Doherty states in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> article?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The paediatric community was consulted after the publication of the McKinsey review and was enthusiastic about its findings.  Difficulties arose with some members of the paediatric community when the site was chosen.  It is inevitable some people will be upset when one hospital must be chosen from among several.  I understand that people have preferred locations.  What is important, however, is that for the first time, we will have a world-class, state-of-the-art tertiary facility for sick children, collocated with an adult teaching hospital and, subsequently, a maternity hospital that will deal with high-risk pregnancies.  This will be a major step forward in the treatment of sick children and it will be welcomed by the vast majority of people, notwithstanding the reservations of some that a particular site was chosen in preference to some others.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1819"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is turning into a debacle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>One might wonder why Progressive Democrats Ministers in the Department of Health and Children are quick to make allegations and innuendoes about those who disagree with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>What allegations have I made?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State who is seated beside the Minister made a serious allegation, which he was unable to substantiate, on national television last night.</P>
        <P>The Minister is correct in her observation that there was goodwill towards the McKinsey report among the paediatric community.  Does she accept that Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin has no vested interest in this matter?  The notion that staff in that hospital are engaging in some type of obstruction is not convincing given the hospital itself will not exist in the future.  Four hospitals will be crammed onto the site of the Mater Hospital, including that hospital&rsquo;s adult and private facilities, the children&rsquo;s hospital and a maternity hospital.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister accept this is one of several serious flaws that have emerged from this decision of the Government?  Will she consider an independent view of the plan?  Let us all be proved wrong.  If an independent review concludes that this is the best site for a children&rsquo;s hospital, I will have no problem admitting to the House that the Minister was correct and I was wrong.  Until that happens, grave doubts will persist.  If the Minister does not have the goodwill of those working in paediatrics, including those working in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin, it will be difficult to make this proposal work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the facilities will be crammed onto the site.  I could list many hospitals elsewhere in the world where the space is substantially less than what is being provided here.  I am neither a construction expert nor a clinician.  It is clear to me, however, that once the site was identified, some people were not as pleased as they might have been if another location was chosen.  The merging of hospitals has not been done often in the past and it is not always a happy experience.  It can take a long time for all types of reasons.  Difficulties arose when St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital was being amalgamated with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, for instance, but the merged facilities are widely accepted as offering the best care for cancer patients.  Some of these decisions are not easy for staff or patients and their families.  If they are made on the basis of sound clinical advice, however, the vast majority of people will accept them.</P>
        <P>I am often criticised for arranging too many reviews but now there are calls for another.  I do not accept the need for such a review.  We must <Col N="1820"/>move on.  I will shortly announce the appointment of the team to oversee the development of the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  The Mater Hospital was selected from among three contenders, the others being Beaumont Hospital and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, and was recommended as the preferred site for several reasons.  It was understandable there would be a certain degree of disappointment that other hospitals were not chosen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To suggest, however, that this decision was motivated by anything other than the best interests of children is incorrect and unfair.  No allegations are being made against anyone.  I have spoken to everyone who wished to raise the matter with me.  I made clear to the board of Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin that, where possible, the issues raised in their report will be addressed but that the decision on location is final unless something arises of which neither I nor the advisory group is aware.  If we are to allow further delays because of uncertainty over the site, we will simply delay the provision of this state-of-the-art facility.  It was the unit in Trinity College which provided advice on transport, location and access.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister and Professor Drumm always repeat this mantra about how we will deal with the capacity problem.  In view of the major increase in the child population, however, it is clear we should increase the numbers of beds in paediatric services rather than decrease them from 480 to 380.  How will the services cope with this reduction?  I ask the Minister not to pass my question off by saying more patients will be treated as day cases.  Does she recognise there will be a serious capacity problem if she proceeds in this way?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I do not.  Tallaght Hospital, for example, has a current occupancy rate of 40%, which means 60% of the beds are not in use.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it that simple?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the McKinsey report advised that this site can take a further 200 beds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is blithely dismissing the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>

        <Quest> the basis on which her Department has estimated the sum of &euro;111 million as the loss of revenue of private beds to public hospitals under the collocation plan; the breakdown of this figure by hospital; if she has estimated the additional costs patients will incur due to this plan; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[41698/06]</QRef><Col N="1821"/>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure of &euro;111 million is an estimate by Health Service Executive of the amount the ten public hospitals selected as sites for collocated private hospitals charged private health insurers in 2005.  I was informed by the HSE yesterday that, as a result of the ongoing public procurement exercise, the collocation initiative will not be proceeding on two public hospital sites at this time.  These are Galway University Hospital and Letterkenny General Hospital.  Leaving aside those two hospitals, the figure reduces to &euro;88.6 million.  I will arrange to have a table sent to the Deputy giving the breakdown of this figure for the eight hospitals concerned.</P>
        <P>The loss of private insurance income to public hospitals arising from the collocation initiative must be seen in the context of the freeing up of 1,000 beds that are currently reserved for private patients and the significant benefits the HSE expects to receive in return for the concessions granted to private operators.  Public patients will not incur any additional costs arising from this initiative.  Whether private patients will pay more in collocated hospitals than they currently pay in private beds in public hospitals depends on the charges that may be set by the new private hospitals.  In any event, it has been the policy of the Government since 1999 to move to full economic charging of private beds in public hospitals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Members do not often make the case for private patients in this House, but it is important to consider everybody who will be affected by this strategy.  When 1,000 beds are moved from the public sector to the private sector under the Minister&rsquo;s privatisation plan, an additional &euro;110 million &mdash; or &euro;86 million as we are now informed &mdash; of lost income to BUPA and VHI will have to be added to the &euro;14 billion required to manage the health service.</P>
        <P>It seems the Minister is valuing the loss of income from each of these beds at &euro;110,000 per year.  This is a totally false economy.  No private hospital can operate a private bed for &euro;2,000 per week.  It is simply not possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Twomey to put a question to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will.  I estimate that each of these beds would require a contribution of between &euro;5,000 and &euro;10,000 per week if these hospitals are to survive.</P>
        <P>On this basis, does the Minister agree the cost to VHI and BUPA will be between &euro;250 million and &euro;500 million, rather than the &euro;86 million to which she referred?  Does she accept her plan will make it absolutely impossible for young families and elderly people to maintain their private health insurance?  We will have plenty of shiny new private hospitals but people will be pushed out of the health insurance market.  Such developments will come at a massive cost to private <Col N="1822"/>patients.  The Minister must concede that when one takes into account other costs that will arise in regard to private health insurance, this plan will double premia within three years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am confused by the Deputy&rsquo;s response.  He asked me what it would cost to convert these beds to public beds.  The cost for 85 beds in the ten hospitals would come to just under &euro;90 million.  It must be remembered all nurses and staff are paid from the public purse.  I have a problem with the taxpayer heavily subsidising private beds in public hospitals.  Those beds are only available for that cohort of the population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Half the population has private health insurance.  It also pays taxes.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I know that.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The Minister is basically ripping them off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is saying that the half with private health insurance should get preferential treatment in hospitals funded by the taxpayer, over and above other people who could be sicker.  I do not agree with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not getting preferential treatment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, they are because only private patients can use those beds.  Access to public hospitals should be solely on the basis of medical need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should be honest on what it will cost to private health insurance patients.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The cost of providing these beds in the traditional way would cost &euro;1 billion &mdash; &euro;1 million per bed.  The maximum cost of providing them in this way will be &euro;480 million.  From a capital cost perspective, the figure saved will be &euro;520 million.  We normally paid for all administrative, nursing and other health staff.  These will be paid for by the private provider.  No group of workers was paid for those patients&rsquo; care except the consultants.  It was not a good system and was not one which people could stand over.</P>
        <P>There are competition issues for private providers.  Legal and competition issues must be taken on board if a facility in a public hospital can supply a service at a considerably reduced cost because it is heavily subsidised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has simply skirted around this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  The Deputy claimed it would cost &euro;2 billion.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1823"/>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Private patients are already paying taxes.  The Minister is turning her back on the public health system with the co-location plan.  She does not care how inefficient it is or how much it will cost.  She expects VHI and BUPA customers to fork out for her cock-up.  How much will a private health insurance patient pay on extra premiums because the Minister turned her back on the public system?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>

        <Quest> her views on the lack of provision made for specialist medicine for older people in the buildings of three major Dublin hospitals; her further views on claims that departments of geriatric medicine are being marginalised and that, according to the Kennedy report, from the 1980s older people should hold a central place in general hospitals, which is not the case today; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[41733/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the development of a comprehensive range of services for older people has been demonstrated by the significantly increased resources made available in recent years.</P>
        <P>The Mater hospital has 39 beds in a geriatric acute facility and four day beds specifically for older persons.  The hospital has three geriatricians and appropriate staff support, including physio<Col N="1825"/>therapists and occupational therapists.  The geriatricians have links to St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital, Phoenix Park, which provides continuity of care for older patients before and after acute care.  The Mater is also participating in the proposed complex discharge for older persons project, the objective of which is to provide full medical, nursing, rehabilitation, allied health and social care services to patients over 65 years who have completed their acute medical episode of care.</P>
        <P>The HSE has contracted the Charter Medical Group to provide a rapid access clinic to significantly improve access to services for older people.  This new service at Smithfield will treat more than 2,000 Dublin patients annually.</P>
        <P Just="Left">St. James&rsquo;s has developed a proposal to build a centre of excellence for successful aging at the hospital.  The HSE is examining the scope for including this project in its capital programme.  St. James&rsquo;s is also participating in the proposed complex discharge for older persons project.  In addition, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital opened a new falls unit for older patients in December 2005, which has treated 1,200 people this year.</P>
        <P>The current phase of development at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital provided for a new emergency department and ambulatory care such as outpatients and diagnostic facilities.  All other redevelopment at the hospital, including inpatient care and a day hospital for medicine for the elderly, is planned for the next phase of the capital project.  In the current phase of the building project recently opened, older people benefit from significantly enhanced facilities when attending for a broad range of conditions.  Furthermore, in recent years there has been significant investment in medicine of the elderly for St. Vincent&rsquo;s patients.  This includes the development of Leopardstown hospital and the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook.  Consultants from St. Vincent&rsquo;s provide the specialist services for these two facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree that Professor Des O&rsquo;Neill has done a considerable service in his report on Leas Cross nursing home?  It was a thoughtful and hard-hitting report.  Has the Government accepted its recommendations?  Does the Minister of State agree with Professor O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s criticisms of the over-reliance on the private nursing home solution in care for the elderly?  How will the recommendations on inpatient facilities be met?</P>
        <P>The report clearly states that inpatient facilities both in medical and psycho-geriatric care are deficient and the issue has to be addressed.  The Minister of State indicated there were some pro<Col N="1826"/>posals floating around from the three major Dublin hospitals.  Is he aware that the capital programme was underspent last year?  What capital provision will be made in 2007 to meet recommendation No. 10 on inpatient facilities for the elderly in the report on the Leas Cross nursing home?  The Kennedy report recommended that elderly people be central to the acute hospital service, but the only way they are central is when they are lying on trolleys in corridors and cared for in a most inappropriate way.  What is the programme, timeframe and financial commitment to ensure inpatient facilities are in place to meet medical and pyscho-geriatric needs of the elderly?</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 1997 the Government has shown a great commitment to improving services for older people.  Last year&rsquo;s budget saw additional significant investment in the services.  There are 39 beds in the geriatric acute facility and four day beds, specifically for older people.  The hospital has three geriatricians, 47 physiotherapists, 12 occupational therapists and 19 social workers.  These geriatricians have links and work with St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital, Phoenix Park, which provides for continuity of care for older people before and after the provision of acute care.  I mentioned the Mater Misercordiae and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals, both of which participate in the complex discharge of older persons project which runs in line with the investment in home care packages we made in last year&rsquo;s budget when we increased the number from 1,100 in 2005 to 3,000 this year.  That investment has worked well and it will be continued.</P>
        <P>I agree with what the Deputy said about Professor O&rsquo;Neill who did the State some service with his report.  We are happy to work with its recommendations.  I indicated a number of improvements that have been made and proposals under consideration in the HSE.  These will be of significant benefit in the treatment of older people.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest> if she is satisfied that the Health Service Executive has a robust, uniform, national inspection system in place for nursing homes as it has claimed; the steps she has taken to satisfy the Houses of the Oireachtas on this matter; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[41408/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive is continuing to strengthen the nursing home inspection process.  Guidelines have been issued to nursing homes inspection teams nationally and <Col N="1827"/>the structure of inspection teams is being strengthened.  In particular, the Health Service Executive is in the process of developing dedicated nursing home inspection teams which are already in place in some areas.  All the mandatory six-monthly inspections will be unannounced.  Follow-up inspections may be announced or unannounced.  A standardised registration certificate will be used.  A significant training programme for all inspection team members is scheduled to commence in January.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>When Mr. Aidan Brown addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, he said that since the beginning of the year all inspections teams comprised a nurse, a doctor and an environmental health officer.  When I informed him that I was aware of at least one case in which an inspection team had an inspector but no doctor or nurse, he suddenly said that still happens in some parts of the country.  In the space of a sentence it went from never happening to happening.  Is &euro;2 million enough to establish HIQA and the social services inspectorate or will we be left with piecemeal inspection of nursing homes?  Apart from the fact that no legislation has been enacted in the last two years to protect health service patients, at the same committee a HSE official said the Minister had not signed off on the complaints procedure of the HSE as expected under Part 9 of the Health Act 2004 under which the HSE was established.  Is that correct?  Although an impression was given that it had been done, when we forced the issue, it appeared the Minister had not signed off on the complaints procedure provided for in Part 9.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister met any of the senior HSE officials involved in the inspection of Leas Cross in recent years?  Have the Minister and Ministers of State learned anything from this experience?  This is important.  They take information at face value without getting down into the trenches and finding out what is going on.  When I accused the Minister and senior HSE officials of colluding in the continued barbarity at Leas Cross, there was not one denial.  That is telling.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister of State aware that senior HSE officials ask health professionals not to make their complaints about quality of care in writing to them but to write to local HSE officials?  This is important.  Does the Minister of State approve of this new form of accountability in the HSE, whereby he will try to scapegoat officials lower down the chain of command?  Health professionals are now being told not to write to senior HSE officials in order that they might know what is happening in the HSE.  That is despicable.  Having heard this, I do not believe the Minister, the Ministers of State, the Government or senior officials in the HSE have learned anything from what happened at Leas Cross.</P>

	<P>When were they signed off?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It is obvious from the Leas Cross report that the inspection system in place did not work as well as it should have and failed the patients at Leas Cross.  On foot of this, the HSE sought a report which Professor O&rsquo;Neill produced.  Even before the report was published, the HSE had embarked on changing the way in which inspection teams worked.  It is intended to establish dedicated teams, provide proper training programmes for them and have a standardised approach nationally.  The inspection reports will be published.  This process only began in September.  It is an important step towards ensuring proper standards of care in homes.  It will benefit patients and families to know homes are inspected regularly and that they are providing proper care.  The health Bill will be published next week.  Adequate resources have been provided to establish the HIQA.  This is necessary in providing proper care for older people, for which we have made adequate provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State mean it is only the Government&rsquo;s intention to establish inspection teams?  He did not answer any of my questions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It is trying to create dedicated inspection teams, some of which are in place.  There will be a standardised approach to the way in which homes are inspected everywhere.  Therefore, the same standard will apply in counties Dublin, Galway and Kerry and everywhere else.  We are bringing it forward.  </P>
        <P>On the health Bill, we have drawn up a draft set of standards.  The Bill will be published next week and we hope, with the co-operation of the Opposition, to pass it early next year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the HSE officials&rsquo; not wanting to receive letters from health professionals?  Does the Minister of State know what is happening on the ground?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State accept that what he is experiencing is the direct result of misguided policy?  Professor O&rsquo;Neill made it clear that over-reliance on the private sector had made the task of protecting residents more difficult because it was harder to maintain quality in private nursing homes than in community nursing homes.  Those were his words.  Is the Minister of State aware of the great shortage of public health doctors?  There are many vacancies in the HSE because of the changes that occurred.  We do not have dedicated and trained teams carrying out these inspections.  Can the Minister of State comment on these shortcomings?  He could also comment on those with disabilities in institutional care.  What checks verify that inspections are carried out in an acceptable fashion?  Is the Minister of State aware of criticisms regarding the infringement of residents&rsquo; rights?  Residents are sometimes asked quite personal questions in public spaces in nursing homes when inspections are carried out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Professor O&rsquo;Neill spoke of empowerment at a recent committee meeting.  Will the Minister of State encourage setting up residents&rsquo; committees?  Professor O&rsquo;Neill spoke favourably of it.  What percentage of inspections include a medical examination?  There was some disagreement between HSE officials on the number of medical inspections carried out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>MRSA and Families highlighted what it regards as the inadequate response to the prevention, detection and treatment of MRSA in care institutions.  The substantive question refers to a robust, uniform and national inspection system.  Is it intended that the <Col N="1830"/>same visitation will address this matter in nursing homes or will it be dealt with independently?  What steps have been taken to ensure a universal standard of hygiene in all of these institutions so that we can eradicate the scourge of MRSA as far as is humanly possible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Are hospitals tipped off in advance of inspections?  The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, should be concerned about the psychiatric hospital in Limerick.  A few months ago, before the inspection took place, if one stood still one was cleaned.  Cleaners arrived at 6 o&rsquo;clock that morning but have not been seen outside regular hours since then.  This suggests staff were tipped off about the inspection.  Is that true and is that happening?  What will the Minister of State do to stamp it out?  Nursing homes and hospitals should not be tipped off.  A second Limerick hospital was also tipped off in advance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Hospitals are not tipped off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I worked in the psychiatric service for 29 years.  Every hospital is informed of the date of inspection one month in advance.  That was the situation while I worked there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I can clarify it.  Deputy Connolly is referring to psychiatric hospitals.  That is a different matter.  Very often, psychiatric hospitals are notified in advance.</P>

	<P>We are organising training for dedicated teams in January.  That has not happened until now and will make the teams much better equipped.  There will be a standardised approach across the country.</P>
        <P>It was the policy of inspection teams to work with nursing homes if difficulties arose.  In most cases that worked but in the case of Leas Cross it did not.  We have learned from mistakes made, which is why we are introducing a new health Bill <Col N="1831"/>and new standards.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government does not like to be kept waiting but look at how the Government has kept people waiting.  People with cancer or <Col N="1832"/>aneurysms must wait for surgery, brain surgeons wait for equipment that works, women who have been raped must wait days for a doctor to attend, the elderly must suffer and wait for the nursing home to be inspected and 3,000 children must wait four years for an assessment but not treatment.  Last year 3,000 children waited in adult psychiatric institutions.  Does the Taoiseach realise how much humanity and sanity is lost because so many people are forced to wait because of Government inaction?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Today, a little boy named Jordan Kelly is waiting.  His parents, Sharon and Martin, say he is angry, aggressive and out of control.  He has spoken of suicide.  Sharon tried to get help for Jordan when he was three years old.  He was placed on a three year waiting list and nobody called in three years.  The Taoiseach knows the joy of being a parent and sometimes the pain of being a Dad.  Yesterday Martin Kelly told &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; that it is as if their little boy is hanging over a cliff and they are trying to hang on to him.  He is slipping and eventually they know he will go but they do not know how it will happen.  What has the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government, done about this?  We do not need the reflex response, the BSE response &mdash; billions expended or blame somebody else.  That would be terrible; somebody should do something about it.  That person is the Taoiseach, with his Minister for Health and Children and her Minister of State.  Action has not been taken, despite being in power for ten years.  In ten budgets there has been money to do so much, but in spending one has gone astray.  Last week, in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s absence, we had a vision of a slumped T&aacute;naiste who was unable to answer any question or utter the word &ldquo;neurosurgery&rdquo;.  I hope the Taoiseach will do better with respect to psychiatric and mental illness, and do what the Government has not been able to do in ten years.  He might like to express his thoughts on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has raised a large number of issues but under Standing Orders, I can reply to only one.  He concluded on the mental health issue.  The Government and the HSE have made it clear a number of times that we are concerned about the length of waiting times for child psychiatry services.  The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, has expressed these concerns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>He blamed the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>He has not delivered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>He is supporting new management actions to reduce waiting times, with substantial funds being provided this year and next.  That is the only way to resolve these problems.  More has been done in the mental health area in recent years than in any other period.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1833"/>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Here we go again.  Listen to the focus groups.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The HSE is carrying out an exercise to assess what must be changed in particular areas to reduce waiting times.  It has confirmed that child mental health services in County Kildare succeeded in greatly reducing waiting times following the appointment of an advanced nurse practitioner who worked in close collaboration with a local multidisciplinary team to improve service access.  The HSE is evaluating this model with a view to extending it to other areas, as it has been shown to work.</P>
        <P>The HSE has 45 child and adolescent mental health teams and funding was provided this year for an additional eight.  Recruitment is under way.  Implementation of A Vision for Change requires the recruitment of an additional 40 child and adolescent mental health teams.  This will be provided for on a phased basis, as planned, over a number of years.  The provision of the eight teams required an additional allocation of &euro;26 million for further development of mental health services.  Although the money was provided, all the staff have not yet been recruited, as it is not easy to find qualified staff in these areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The provision of funding will be prioritised next year to increase the number of child and adolescent mental health teams and provide additional beds.  The inpatient services at St. Anne&rsquo;s in Galway and Warrenstown are being expanded, while four new units are being developed in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, each of which will have approximately 20 beds which will help substantially in dealing with the problem.  Interim arrangements have been made by the HSE, pending the provision of additional child and adolescent beds.  All children in adult units will be treated on a one-to-one basis and additional training will be provided for staff.  The Mental Health Act is in full operation since 1 November.  It provides additional safeguards for children and for the first time recognises 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds as children.  The Mental Health Commission has issued a code of practice for the admission of children under the Mental Health Act.</P>
        <P>We must provide up to 40 additional teams.  As I understand, it will take a few years to recruit the necessary staff.  Eight new teams were put in place this year which means 45 are already in service.  Therefore, we must put 32 more in place before we fulfil the requirements of A Vision for Change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Neville has done more than any other politician in recent years to ratchet up the political priority given to tackling the inadequacies in treating mental health problems and psychiatric illness.  The Mental Health Act does not provide for the provision of treatment, which is only provided when necessary.</P><Col N="1834"/>
        <P>The first report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatric services, set up by Deputy Martin when Minister for Health and Children, states: &ldquo;It is recommended that a total of seven child and adolescent in-patient units for children ranging from 6-16 should be developed throughout the country&rdquo;.  This recommendation was made almost six years ago in February 2001.  In the intervening six years &mdash; a time when the Government has collected a record level in taxes, &euro;8 billion more than it stated it needed &mdash; the public&rsquo;s money has been squandered on PPARS, electronic voting machines and a range of other issues when children needing psychiatric help cannot get it.</P>
        <P>What is different?  Did the T&aacute;naiste speak to the Taoiseach before the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, made his callous and heartless outburst about this matter some time ago?  The T&aacute;naiste has stated he supports inequality in Irish society.  He sees what he sees and knows what he knows.  The Minister of State has now backed it up by stating very few people make representations to him, that the waiting list should be queried and, worse still, that psychiatrists deliberately keep waiting lists long in order to exert power and influence.</P>
        <P>What kind of Minister of State has the Taoiseach in charge of psychiatric and mental health services?  Did the T&aacute;naiste speak to the Taoiseach before this heartless outburst?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is speaking to the Minister for Health and Children now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach have confidence in the Minister of State?  Does he think a Minister of State making such comments about people with a mental and psychiatric illness deserves to be in office?  Does he intend to look for his dismissal or speak to the T&aacute;naiste about the matter this evening?  He should have no further confidence in the Minister of State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>For Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s information, the mental health tribunal is up and running and there are inspections.  I have given impressive figures relating to teams.  The Deputy has correctly stated we are in a better financial position and that we have trebled the resources available for mental health services.  We have an additional 98 consultant posts, with the number moving from 210 to 308, a significant increase.</P><Col N="1835"/>
        <P>A Vision for Change, the report of the expert group on mental health, was only launched 11 months ago and covers both adults and children.  It was accepted by the Government as a basis for the development of mental health policy and has been broadly welcomed by representatives of the mental health professions which asked us to take action.  An independent monitoring group was established eight months ago by the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, to monitor progress in implementation of the report.  The HSE has established an implementation group to ensure its recommendations are realised in a timely and co-ordinated manner.  Allowing for assimilation of the significant number of existing posts, the report estimates that over 1,800 new posts, together with total non-capital investment of &euro;150 million per annum, will be required in the next seven to ten years.  An enormous demand has been outlined to be met by the health service.  The report estimates that approximately &euro;800 million in capital investment will be required.  It recommends &ldquo;that steps be taken to bring about the closure of all mental hospitals and to reinvest the resources released by these closures in the mental health service&rdquo;.  That is the reason we have put so much money into mental health services.  We increased the mental health budget from approximately &euro;300 million to close to &euro;900 million.  Obviously, there will be resources in the budget for mental health.</P>
        <P>Regarding the point Deputy Kenny mentioned at the start, the HSE has 49 child and adolescent mental health teams.  This year we provided funding for an additional eight.  I am not saying we have reached the full position as we need 40 additional teams but even if we were to look for them tomorrow we would not get them.  The report A Vision for Change stated we must keep doing that every year.  It will not take us too long to reach the recommended level but it will not be done in one go.</P>
        <P>Like many issues, resources for staff and buildings are required and we are dealing with that.  This year alone, the HSE will recruit 400 new staff in mental health services.  I do not think people can say that is not an adequate response to a report published at the start of this year.  In 2007, we must do the same and, as I stated, we must do the same for a number of years to reach the total of 1,800 additional people in the health service.  Forgetting about the money for a minute, hiring those people will take a considerable effort because a large portion will come from outside the country.  However, we must hire them and in 2007 we will continue as we did in recent years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has only been there for the past nine and a half years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach stated it will not take too long.  What about the parents in Kerry who waited four years and four months for their <Col N="1836"/>child to get an assessment?  Did the Taoiseach see the programme last night?  If so, was he ashamed?  Was it one of these programmes he feigns not to have seen?</P>
        <P>Does anybody in the Government ever own up to accountability?  Is there any accountability in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government?  How could he have watched the harrowing images on the screen last night?  How could he have watched parents at the end of their tether trying to deal with children with chronic disorders?  We then had the image of the Minister of State responsible smugly proclaiming that the psychiatric profession is responsible and despicably passing the buck.  Has the Taoiseach ever seen a more gauche unfortunate declaration of ignorance by a Minister of State responsible for any aspect of Government policy?</P>
        <P>In reply to Deputy Kenny, the Taoiseach put his head down and muttered into his chest that his Government is trying to improve mental health.  It will not improve mental health with a man who clearly has no empathy with the plight of families who are left waiting for psychological assessment for the same period which that family in Kerry waited.</P>
        <P>In 1999, the then Minister with responsibility for education, Deputy Woods, stated that all national schools would have direct access to educational psychologists by 2004.  According to the survey and the INTO, only 50% of primary schools have such access.  The Taoiseach stated that he provides the resources, but in 1997 11% of the health budget was spent on mental health services &mdash; the current figure is 7.3%.  The tax yield is &euro;3.8 billion higher than expected and there is an Exchequer surplus of &euro;5.89 billion as against a forecast Exchequer deficit of &euro;2.9 billion.  There is almost &euro;9 billion to boast about in terms of resources at the disposal of the Government.</P>
        <P>Children who are acknowledged to be at risk of chronic mental disorder are left in those circumstances because the disorder is unattended or not assessed, no early intervention occurs and no psychologists are available because the tax breaks of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, drove them into private practice.  Parents must do the best they can.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach will not even admit that the man who is responsible is not fit to hold this office.  I do not speak about him personally, I speak about his political ability to do a job and empathise with and understand the area for which he is responsible.  For once in his life, will the Taoiseach state that his Government will have accountability when a Minister of State is manifestly incapable of doing his job?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Rabbitte wants me to deal with the issue of mental health by stating that because the Minister of State does not have all the resources or staff required, he has an inability, I will not do so.  The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, does the job to the best of <Col N="1837"/>his ability and effort.  Jumping on what he stated in an interview as against what he did in recent years is totally unfair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>He has done neither.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>For Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s information, I was in London last night and I did not see the programme.  However, this morning I received a full report on the programme and I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, on the radio.</P>
        <P>Previously, mental health was not referred to because people spoke about cancer, maternity and cardiac services.  It did not receive resources.  In the mid-1980s Professor Ivor Browne initiated changes in the area of mental health and the report on mental health in 1984-85 started a campaign to improve mental health services.  Great strides were made during the past 20 years, but the matter came from a low base in that it did not have the resources of other areas.  Deputy Rabbitte made much play on the percentage.  The report asked for it to be brought to 8%.  Stating what it was on a far lower budget is not the position.</P>
        <P>I outlined that in recent years, mental health received substantial improvements in resources, including more than 400 staff in this year alone.  As I pointed out, the report estimates we need 1,800 posts altogether, which leaves another 1,400 with a non-capital investment of &euro;150 million.  This year we invested &euro;26 million and for 2007 there will be additional money in the Estimates.  The report estimates &euro;800 million in capital investment.  Mental health will receive an increasingly bigger share but it will not receive the entire share.</P>
        <P>I will not state because a programme was broadcast last night that the report A Vision for Change will be implemented tomorrow.  It will not happen.  The report of the expert group on mental health, which was launched 11 months ago, outlines what we should do over the coming years.  The plan will take until 2011.  We have 45 of the centres up and running, with eight additional centres open this year.  I am told, even with the resources available since this time last year, they still do not have all the staff required.  We will continue to invest resources next year.</P>
        <P>We filled consultant psychiatrist posts.  I cannot state whether every post approved will be filled but substantial resources have been provided.  The mental health tribunal has been established, as have inspections.  Everyone would feel sorry for anyone on the list and people must show compassion and understanding.  However, it is no good standing up and stating it will all be solved tomorrow.  The HSE, the Department of Health and Children and the Minister have a clear policy initiative to invest in resources and there is a monitoring group to deal with the matter.  We must consistently follow this through so we can reach the total of 1,800 people as outlined in the <Col N="1838"/>report and have a proper national service in this area.</P>
        <P>As we did in maternity where we have one of the best services in the world, in cardiac where we eliminated the problem and in cancer where we radically improved the situation, we must do in mental health services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is demeaning himself.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte cannot allot to Deputy McManus the entitlement to ask the supplementary question.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach says he cannot do this tomorrow.  I understand this, but he has been there for nine and a half years.  I accept his statement that he did not get the opportunity to watch the programme.  However, I ask him to take time out, leave off one of the pub openings or other commitments and watch the programme to see what it is like to be a parent responsible for a child with a chronic behavioural disorder, attention deficit disorder or autism and yet be unable to even get a psychological assessment.  </P>
        <P>After nine and a half years, the HSE&rsquo;s own assessment is that 3,000 children are awaiting an assessment.  The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods promised in 1999 that all primary schools would have this access by 2004 so this issue is not new.  Can the Taoiseach tell us whether some of the vacancies in the service are due to the embargo?  If they are, will he assure the House that the embargo will not apply to posts in this particular area?</P>
        <P>If this situation arises because of tax relief introduced for care from the private sector, why do parents in the most difficult situations not have access to the National Treatment Purchase Fund?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If a person has a chronic illness in another area, he or she has access to the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Why does this not apply here?  Why do the parents we saw last night not have some prospect of relief?  Why can they not access the National Treatment Purchase Fund?</P>
        <P>It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to come in here and say that he does not want to deal with the responsibility of his Minister of State.  The Minister of State told the suffering parents last night that it is because some people in the psychiatric profession want to make themselves feel powerful that they exaggerate the waiting lists and like to keep people waiting because it confers this sense of power on them.  Can one imagine any other EU member state leaving a man who uttered these sentiments responsible for this sensitive area?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s time has concluded.    </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to say that he did not see the programme and that he wishes to talk about the substantive issue, rather than the Minister of State responsible.  This is not the first time we have seen this.  A week ago, this same man said he thought people in the country suffering from depression were simply experiencing a condition of life.  How can the Taoiseach leave this man in this position and say that he will address mental health services?  They are incapable of being renovated under a Minister of State with this deficit of understanding, to put it at its mildest.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Treatment Purchase Fund normally deals with a waiting list issue where there is no follow on and is not involved in assessment where it is continuing on with a programme.  If there is a quicker way of doing it, there is obviously no difficulty opening this up.  </P>
        <P>I cannot let Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s first question, which stated that we have been here for ten years but that nothing has happened, go.  I will not remind him of what used to happen in the mental health area ten years ago, but he knows this budget has dramatically increased every year.  It is nothing other than the increase in staff.  This year, 400 additional staff were hired.  The area is not bound by the embargo so this will not affect teams.  They have had to work hard this year to increase the 45 teams by a further eight simply to fill the posts and get professional staff to deal with these issues.  It is not a money issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A total of &euro;500 million in the health programme goes towards the building programme but they cannot build everything.  As is outlined in the A Vision for Change report, they must deal with closing the remaining mental hospitals and reinvesting the resources realised as a consequence in <Col N="1840"/>the health services, as recommended, and building up staff.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In respect of what the former Minister for Education, Deputy Woods, said many years ago, I am informed that all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments for their pupils directly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He said he was concerned about the parents, who I agree are unfortunate and want to know if the service is there.  When I give the answer, his colleagues shout me down.  I will repeat for the third time that I am informed by the Department of Education and Science that all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments for their pupils, either directly through educational psychologists or through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments administered by NEPS.  </P>

	<P>Will the Opposition listen to the answer and then disagree with it, rather than disagreeing with it before I say anything?  Schools which do not have NEPS psychologists assigned to them avail of the scheme and have assessments carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS.  In the ten months to the end of October 2006, over &euro;1.25 million was spent on approximately 3,500 of these assessments.  The number of schools which are directly served by NEPS is only half the picture.  One must remember that all the other schools can access assessments paid for by NEPS through the scheme.  As I understand it, this important and fundamental point was missed in last night&rsquo;s programme, but I will wait until I see it.  It was missed in the programme.  </P>

	<P>Hundreds of decent people from County Monaghan again braved the cold and inconvenience to make yet another trek to Leinster House to ask the Government to maintain crucial services at Monaghan General Hospital.  Deputy Connolly has championed the community in County Monaghan time and again on this issue, to great effect.  We want the Taoiseach to clarify exactly where the Government stands on the hospital&rsquo;s services because there is, on the face of it, a total contradiction between what the T&aacute;naiste says will happen in the next two years and what was said today by representatives of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s party.  The T&aacute;naiste is promising that within two years the high care unit in the hospital will be closed, in addition to the medical services ward, which is open 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  It was promised that the opening hours of the accident and emergency unit which has operated 24 hours a day, seven days per week, would be pared back to 12 hours per day and that there would be a similar paring back of X-ray facilities.</P>
        <P>A Fianna F&aacute;il Senator said to the people of County Monaghan outside the gates of Leinster House today that the Taoiseach was in full agreement with him that all current services should be maintained at the hospital.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Teamwork report, commissioned by the HSE, is supposed to be driving this process but it states no services should be removed from local hospitals until better services are in their place.  However, the downgrading of Monaghan General Hospital within two years will mean acute patients will be pushed off to the hospitals in Cavan and Drogheda which currently account for 20% of the national trolley count and are already overwhelmed according to the stated evidence of their dedicated staff.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach should not reply by stating the regional centres of medical excellence are the alternative.  There is no contradiction between local hospitals, where day surgical procedures and minor and intermediate surgery are carried out, and centres of excellence for more serious procedures.  More significantly, no date has ever been set for establishing centres of medical excellence.  It will happen in the dim and distant future.  Within two years, if the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s writ runs, all the aforesaid services will be lost from Monaghan General Hospital.  She has already in place an implementation group to try to put this into effect.</P>

	<P>The Ceann Comhairle is very familiar with this issue.  Deputy Higgins&rsquo;s quotation was correct in that I agree with my Senator colleague who stated we should not close any of the services in Monaghan General Hospital until we provide better services in the region.  That is what he said and that is the position.</P>
        <P>I met the Monaghan action group, the staff and some of the general practitioners from Monaghan General Hospital.  They identified a number of services that they wanted to keep.  The HSE representatives, whom I met recently, said they were prepared to keep them open until a better service could be agreed.  I hope senior members of the HSE can agree on these issues which have been discussed backwards and forwards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Approximately 15 patients per annum who tend to be extremely ill would be minded better and more safely in Drogheda than in the high dependency unit.  There are too few patients to deal with in the latter unit.  The clinicians and specialist staff have been clear on this; they have said this is the better way to deal with the issue.  They made this clear at a number of meetings and I have read what they said.</P>
        <P>On the longer term issue for the region, citizens should have available to them top quality health services that meet their needs within their own region.  There is a short-term plan and a longer-term one.  I have seen the papers produced by both sides and hope there will be a meeting of minds to reach agreement on the issue.  An enormous effort has been made by everybody.  Everybody involved means well but the HSE has set out clearly in the documents I have seen the services it will keep in Monaghan until a better service is made available elsewhere in the region.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is that for several years the Taoiseach has backed and facilitated the extreme right-wing ideology of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and her party, the Progressive Democrats, in crucial areas of the health service.  He has even done so by not restoring the thousands of beds ruthlessly cut from the system in the 1980s and by allowing cowboys &mdash; speculators and builders &mdash; to treat health care as a product on the market by building private hospitals.</P>
        <P>It is very difficult to obfuscate about the situation at Monaghan General Hospital and get away with it.  The Taoiseach may say with regard to mental health services for children that he cannot do the work immediately but these services exist in Monaghan County Hospital for the community of County Monaghan.  Therefore it is easy to be very clear on what will happen in the next two years.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I would like the Taoiseach to state in his final reply whether in two years time the high care unit, the seven day, 24 hour medical services ward, the seven day, 24 hour accident and emergency unit and the extra facilities will be there and fully functioning to provide the service that is needed in County Monaghan.  The Taoiseach could be very specific about that and clear up what is on the face of it a complete conflict between what the <Col N="1846"/>Minister for Health and Children is saying and what the Taoiseach was quoted as standing for at the meeting today.</P>
        <P>It is important that the Taoiseach is clear on this matter for this community and for communities around the country because this is a pilot project.  If the Minister for Health and Children gets away with what she clearly has in mind with the cutbacks, the same will come to hospitals around the country.  A great deal is at stake.  The Taoiseach needs to be very clear, and state in black and white the position of the Government of which he is head.  He can resolve this issue in the next minute, to everybody&rsquo;s satisfaction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be very clear.  I emphasise again that no service will be changed in Monaghan before a better service replaces it and any change will be planned well in advance.  The change will be for the good of the patients in Monaghan.  </P>

	<P>There are seven proposals to put to the House.  Is the proposal on the late sitting agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with the following motions, Nos. 13, 14 and 15 without debate, agreed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Motion No. 15 relates to the Official Languages Act 2003.  The note given to the Whips states that this refers to the fact that prerecorded oral announcements made, stationery used or signage, except road traffic signage, will be in Irish or in Irish and English.  Is the motion to refer these regulations for discussion in the D&aacute;il at some future time?  Will the Taoiseach indicate what is happening to the decision of the people of Dingle in respect of road signage outside the Gaeltacht area being in Irish and in English, which is their preference?  That is a decision that must be made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a hot issue down there.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, has promptly reversed role, probably under direction from the Taoiseach, which may be a good thing.  Is the motion to refer this to the House for discussion at some future time?  I am not clear about what is intended from the Chief Whip&rsquo;s note.  He stated that the Minister wishes to give Deputies and Senators an opportunity to debate the regulations in draft form and make suggestions for changes, if they so wish, before he signs them.  It is considered appropriate that they will be debated in both Houses.  Is that likely to take place in the new year or before the House rises for Christmas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand it, the intention is to give more time for these issues to be debated in committee, not in the House.</P>

        <P>I will say this to the Taoiseach in English also.  We are talking about regulations that have a date of 2026 included.  I question why the regulation must be signed by 14 December 2006 when the Minister has indicated there is no great hurry before 2026.  This suggests a double standard.</P>
        <P>Ar a laghad, ba cheart go mbeadh d&aacute;ta i m&iacute; Ean&aacute;ir ann sa treo is go mbeidh seans againn d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht cheart a bheith againn agus leasuithe a mholadh agus a dh&eacute;anamh.  Sin an ch&uacute;is go bhfuil m&eacute; ag cur i gcoinne 14 Nollaig.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

	<P>I wish to record opposition to the taking of this matter, and with a guillotine applying.  It is apparent to me from recent engagements by Members of all sides with representatives of the HSE that even on the Government benches there is clear opposition to one of the real effects of the implementation of this legislation, which will see the family home immediately brought into the whole assessment of subvention, which will leave vulnerable people at a significant disadvantage with all the residual and resulting pain that will be visited on them and their families.  This is an absolutely objectionable element within this legislation.</P>

We are opposed to the Bill and we are opposed to any guillotining that would hasten passage of the Bill.  Therefore, we are opposed to the measure before <Col N="1853"/>the House.

	<P>I note that a platform has been set up for digital terrestrial television and that 1,000 participants are to be chosen for a pilot scheme.  When can we expect to see No. 23 on the legislative programme, the broadcasting Bill?  It is the time of year when a great deal of voluntary fundraising takes place and the issue always arises of the charities regulation Bill.  I know it is a complex Bill with many sections and is listed for early 2007.  Is that still the expected date?</P>
        <P>I understand this country will be billed for approximately &euro;200 million every year for, literally, hot air from Russia in respect of carbon credits.  When can we expect to see No. 28, on the legislative programme, the carbon fund Bill?  This will allow us to deal with the Minister, Deputy Roche, and his use of taxpayers&rsquo; money to pay for hot air from Russia.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>Serious concerns have been expressed in respect of the proposal in Part 2 regarding the financial assessment of an applicant&rsquo;s means.  The Bill states that such an assessment shall be made on the basis of his or her property.  However, a number of means are excluded.  For example, in respect of a spouse, a child of the applicant in full-time education or a relative of the applicant in receipt of disability allowance, 5% of the family home will not be calculated, and rightly so.  However, this will also be the case in respect of a relative of an applicant who is in receipt of a contributory old age pension, which is his or her sole income.</P>
        <P>I put to the Minister of State the case of two elderly people aged 78 and 77, respectively, the former of whom enters a nursing home, while the latter is in receipt of a contributory pension and a small retirement pension.  According to the criteria, the value of the latter&rsquo;s house will be calculated in respect of the nursing home subvention for the former and will seriously reduce or perhaps eliminate it, depending on the value of the house.  This will force the 78 year old on a contributory old age pension and a small occupational pension to sell his or her house.  There will be similar cases where people will have small amounts of income that will exclude them from the provisions in this section.  In other words, their houses will become eligible to be included in the calculations relating to the subvention.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children stated that this was introduced in 1993.  It was introduced as a regulation, with discretion given to the then relevant health board area, now the Health Service Executive, to consider all factors in respect of its application.  The Bill removes that discretion because section 7B(3) states: &ldquo;Subject to subsection (4), the financial assessment of an applicant&rsquo;s means shall be made&rdquo;.  It does not state that the assessment &ldquo;may be made&rdquo; or that it will be done at the discretion of the Health Service Executive, it states that it &ldquo;shall be made&rdquo;.  Regardless of the circumstances, those making calculations in respect of the nursing home subvention will have no discretion to take into account special circumstances such as those relating to the 78 year old to whom I refer.  We may be discussing an occupational pension of &euro;5.  However, it will be above the level of the con<Col N="1863"/>tributory old age pension.  The Minister of State should seriously consider allowing discretion in all circumstances when calculating means.  He has allowed a level of discretion regarding medical cards, since special circumstances may be taken into account.  The Government promised 200,000 extra full medical cards in the last budget.  While we are often disappointed at the application and level of the means test for such cards, we recognise that a means test must be applied.  Discretion exists when calculating entitlement to a medical card, and we see occasions where it works well.</P>
        <P>I can recall situations where elderly and very ill people, perhaps only weeks or months from death, have been extremely concerned at their condition&rsquo;s cost to their family.  Making representations on behalf of his constituents, the Minister of State will have witnessed the relief of the terminally ill and their families because of something as simple as allocating a medical card.  Doing so in the context of terminal illness, where the person will die within weeks or months, costs very little.  I have seen people with advanced cancer who have received a medical card, expressing their appreciation that the HSE had recognised their fate by saying to them that it would assist them somehow.  Apart from the financial aspect, it was a psychological boost.  I was often amazed at the degree to which this was so, since the patients were in critical circumstances.</P>
        <P>I do not see why the same criteria should not be applied to means tests.  The HSE would have discretion, and I am not arguing that it should not in certain circumstances exclude the relative of an applicant receiving a disability or similar allowance who has other income.  Rather I am arguing that the HSE should be allowed discretion.  The provision has deeply worrying implications for the elderly, whose houses have often soared in value since being bought or inherited.  Certain such houses will have been in families for generations, with their value increasing over time.  The asset is no good to the elderly person, since it is his or her home that will never be sold.</P>
        <P>I have witnessed local authorities allowing houses to remain unoccupied after people were sent to long-stay hospitals, since they knew of the psychological effect that taking the house, which might have been in the family for two or three generations, would have.  No matter how ill or elderly someone is, he or she always wishes to return home, where his or her father or mother may have lived.  Now, when 5% of the value of the home is assessed as income and included with the old-age pension, it might put many applicants above the threshold to qualify for nursing home subvention.</P>
        <P>The Bill copper-fastens the 1993 regulations in the form of primary legislation, but one must remember that those regulations were treated differently in each former health board area, with final decisions entirely discretionary.  On Leaders&rsquo; Questions, the Taoiseach stated the HSE could <Col N="1864"/>use its discretion in situations where an elderly person might be forced to sell his or her home.  Having read the legislation and spoken to lawyers in that regard, I am advised that contention is incorrect, since &ldquo;shall&rdquo; means they must act as the legislation outlines.  They do not have a choice and would breach the Bill, once enacted, if they acted otherwise, meaning they could be held accountable to their masters.  They would breach an Act of the Oireachtas that states how the proposal &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be applied, without discretion.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement does not constitute a guarantee and provides little assurance to those who might find themselves above the income threshold, even if the income in question is purely notional and not of any value in day-to-day terms.  The grim reality is that this legislation will force some elderly people to sell their homes.  I am extremely disappointed at the underhand way in which the Government is trying to push through this provision, and we seek a full debate on funding care for the elderly, in which context the issue should be discussed.</P>
        <P>Those most affected by the proposal must be given a chance to express their views, and we must ensure no one is caused hardship or refused a subvention to which he or she should be entitled.  The Government&rsquo;s record on the elderly is nothing short of scandalous.  From illegal nursing home charges, to Leas Cross, to the shameful absence of an independent social services inspectorate, to the subvention restrictions, it seems the Government is content to preside over the neglect of a vulnerable sector of society.</P>
        <P>Psychiatric patients in long-term stay hospitals are excluded from the refund of illegal nursing home charges.  Those institutionalised for many years, and now treated in homes with full nursing care but under the same treatment regime as in a psychiatric hospital, will not be refunded nursing home charges in the same way as those who did not avail themselves of, or were not determined to move to, long-stay psychiatric nursing homes.  Does the Minister of State feel it discriminates against patients who may have received 20 or even 40 years of treatment in psychiatric hospitals before moving to a psychiatric nursing home, sometimes referred to as a high-dependency hostel, with 24-hour nursing care and full psychiatric treatment?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, or perhaps his superior, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, should revisit the situation.  It is disappointing that circumstances outside our control connected with the budget make this week so difficult, meaning we will be denied the usual opportunities to raise the matter.  I plead with the Minister of State to bring our concerns in this regard to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Harney, and Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, the Minister of State with responsibility for psychiatric services.  It denies such patients the same treatment as those in the old <Col N="1865"/>psychiatric hospitals, which Planning for the Future in 1985 proposed to close by now, with appropriate care for all.</P>
        <P>We look forward to a response to our submissions on calculating means for nursing home subventions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has not given much leeway on any of the proposed amendments to this Bill, but there is no reason he should not consider accepting this particular proposal.  A person who applies for a nursing home subvention must fill in forms and endure various tribulations so that his or her level of dependency may be assessed.  Under the provisions of this Bill, any such persons may be liable to have their application reassessed after only one week of care.  This is unacceptable.  Amendment No. 15 seeks to rectify this by affording some level of freedom and security to the person in receipt of the subvention and to their families and others providing support.</P>
        <P>I raised the issue of the three rates of subvention when the Bill was first introduced.  This tripartite scheme is irrelevant because nursing homes do not recognise those rates but instead specify a fixed charge of &euro;600 or &euro;700 per week, for example.  The specification of three separate rates only causes suffering for those seeking subvention for nursing home care.  Those who do not meet the criteria for the highest rate must make up from their own resources the difference between the rate charged by the nursing homes and the amount they receive in subvention.</P>
        <P>There is no logic in determining rates of subvention according to whether a person can shave his own face, for instance, or must rely on someone else to do it for him.  Such considerations make no difference to the rates charged by nursing homes.  The specification of three different subvention rates, based on varying degrees of dependency, assumes that the Department of Health and Children has control over nursing homes to the extent that they can be instructed that a person who adheres to a particular dependency level must be charged the appropriate rate.  The Minister of State knows this is not the case.</P>
        <P>The issue of assigning one of three subvention rates according to the level of dependency is not relevant in the current situation.  If a loved one of mine were admitted to a nursing home tomorrow, it would be pointless for me to claim that he or she should be charged a particular rate because, for example, he or she is able to use the toilet and get breakfast unassisted.  The legislative provisions in this regard are illogical for the simple reason that nursing homes charge fixed prices.  That is the way the system works.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 15 will offer some relief to subvention recipients and their families by specifying that the level of dependency cannot be reassessed for a period of 12 months.  It is highly unlikely that a person taking up residence in a nursing home will remain there for a shorter <Col N="1866"/>period.  It is generally the case that these people&rsquo;s families and GPs are of the view that they will require long-term care.  I ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment in the interests of fair play.  Providing some leeway in regard to reassessment will involve a minimal cost to the Exchequer.  There is no reason that he should not accept this proposal, which will give some solace to those in receipt of nursing home subventions and their families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, this amendment represents damn little solace and comfort for anybody.  It is the absolute minimum that is required.  To defer reassessments for 12 months or more is probably as much in the interests of departmental officials, who may otherwise be caught in an administrative nightmare, as it will be of benefit to those in receipt of subventions.  One can hardly imagine it will be possible to review every subvention case determined within a 12 month period.</P>
        <P>The reality is that the imposition of a timeframe for reassessment will be of marginal import.  It may be useful in providing an opportunity for a healing or cooling-off period.  Can the Minister of State be unaware of the difficulties involved for families in placing a parent in nursing home care?  I am in my tenth year as a Member of this House and was a councillor for many years before that.  In that time, I have seen that the stress involved can be both traumatic and problematic for families.  Many are forced to go through a difficult internal family negotiation in determining the respective contribution of each member towards the overall assessed cost, with or without subvention.</P>
        <P>This often leads to dispute and rancour.  I am aware of many cases where family rifts occur that may never be healed.  This is unfair and unnecessary.  These are ordinary human beings already having to contend with so much in their own lives, and perhaps with a limited appreciation of the challenges and difficulties each must face.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that he is restricted to two minutes because this is his second contribution on this amendment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief.  This amendment would make a small concession and give an opening to the Department with the term &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo;.  One could describe any number of reasons for embarking on an earlier review as exceptional circumstances.  It is a non-definitive term.  In the majority of subvention cases there is at least a 12-month settling time.</P>
        <P>Many difficulties arise with this legislation.  The core difficulty which led to a division on the Order of Business this morning is the continued <Col N="1867"/>intention to include the primary residence &mdash; the family home &mdash; in calculating the subvention.  This is outrageous.  At a recent engagement with HSE representatives in the audio-visual room in Leinster House Fianna F&aacute;il Members, including former Ministers, stated they strongly opposed this approach.  They spoke in absolute defence of the exclusion of the primary residence.  I accept it would be a different story if an individual had multiple homes.  Since I last spoke on this matter, prominent Fianna F&aacute;il Members have stated they are in agreement with my argument and that of other Opposition Members.  Why is it that this objectionable approach to the calculation of a subvention will be railroaded through by a guillotine motion this evening?  It is outrageous and a disgrace.</P>
        <P>The Bill should have addressed this matter in a holistic, caring and humane fashion.  It will only compound the pain and hurt of so many.  It will not only affect the person who needs care but also his or her immediate family.  During Private Members&rsquo; Business, at the 11th hour, I suggest the Minister of State consult those Members from his party who attended the meeting in the audio-visual room before he expects the House to endorse the legislation.  It must be brought back to the drawing board.  Nothing else will be acceptable.  For those of the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues who will vote for the provision but hold an opposing view on it, twice the shame on them.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has already contributed twice on this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It was very memorable too.  We have never sold this legislation as making a major change to the way the subvention scheme operates.  The scheme operates under the 1993 regulations.  On the advice of the Attorney General, it was decided to provide for it in primary legislation.  There will be no real change in how the scheme will be administered.  It will be administered on a standardised basis across the State.</P>
        <P>The HSE would have to be in a position to review the degree of dependency and the means of a dependant at any time as both dependency and financial circumstances can change significantly in 12 months.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>That is if the person wins the national lottery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>A person could win the lotto.  There is only a certain amount of money that can be put into the scheme.  In the first year &euro;5 million was provided for it.  This year up to &euro;160 million will be spent.  It is prudent to ensure the money <Col N="1868"/>is targeted at those who need it most.  A person in receipt of a subvention could inherit money or have a substantial win on the pools.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment would allow for exceptional circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It is prudent for the HSE to be in a position to carry out a review if circumstances change dramatically or significantly.  This provision represents no change from the position as laid out in the 1993 subvention regulations.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in spoke about the trauma and difficulties experienced by dependants and their families.  With Deputy Wall, I am familiar with them.  I have said before the subvention scheme is far from ideal and several changes will have to be made to it.  That is why we have given serious consideration to the funding of long-term care.  If one were drawing up a subvention scheme from scratch, one would never arrive where we are at.</P>

	<P>There is no bottomless pit in any scheme where money is provided.  When the scheme began in 1993, &euro;5 million was provided.  It was a Labour Party Minister who introduced the clause concerning the primary residence.  At the time it did not seem to cause any difficulty for Opposition Members when they were on this side of the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>Will there continue to be discretion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>No, because this legislation is not about changing the subvention scheme.  It is about grounding it in primary legislation.</P>

	<P>Will there continue to be discretion?</P>

      </Vote>
      <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, lines 22 and 23, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;a&rdquo; in line 22 down to and including &ldquo;Executive)&rdquo; in line 23 and substitute &ldquo;an independent person&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is an important amendment, and at the outset I hope the Minister will take its principle on board.  An appeal against a decision of the executive is to be heard by someone who could be an employee of the executive and who must comply with the guidelines set out by the executive, as relating to sections 7E(3) and 7E(4).  It is important to make reference to these.</P>
        <P>Section 7E(3) states &ldquo;Where the Executive receives an appeal under subsection (1), it shall appoint a person (who may be an employee of the Executive) to consider the appeal.&rdquo;  Section 7E(4) states,</P>
        <P LI="1">The person appointed pursuant to subsection (2) to consider an appeal under subsection (1) shall&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) comply with guidelines issued by the Executive in respect of the procedure to be followed with respect to the consideration of any appeal,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) consider any written or oral objections made by the appellant in support of the appeal,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) make a decision (&ldquo;relevant decision&rdquo;) in writing determining the appeal as soon as is practicable in all the circumstances of the case, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) send a copy of the relevant decision to the relevant person and the Executive together with the person&rsquo;s reasons for the decision.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Comprehensive guidelines are set out within which the person will work.  It should be noted that no independent appeals mechanism is in <Col N="1874"/>place.  Since I entered this House, Bill after Bill has made reference to an appeals mechanism.  Here we have a Bill which refers to the most vulnerable in our society, namely, elderly people who for the last two or three years of their lives will be confined to a nursing home because they do not have the provision or means to remain in their home environments where most would prefer to be.  Through necessity they must enter either a public or private nursing home.  A decision is then taken by the HSE for a particular reason that the person is not eligible for a miserly subvention of &euro;114.30 for medium dependency, &euro;152.40 for high dependency or &euro;190.50 for maximum dependency.  They are the levels of subvention.</P>
        <P>Families of parents who over the years made huge sacrifices to educate them are told a public nursing home place is not available.  This Government, notwithstanding its commitments in its manifesto and programme for Government that another 800 public nursing home beds would be provided, has not provided one.  It is a shame on the Minister for State that this is the case.</P>
        <P>Under this Bill, people will be told they will not be eligible for a miserly subvention.  What is the situation throughout the country?  I can tell the House what is the position in my constituency and in the greater Dublin area.  The average rate for a nursing home bed in the Fingal area is between &euro;800 and &euro;900 per week.  Where a high level of dependency is involved, the average weekly rate can be as much as &euro;1,200 per week.  This Bill states one can go through an appeals mechanism but no independent adjudicator will be involved.  The executive or a nominated person from it will adjudicate on the appeal.  This is a scandal.  Show me another Bill which does not include an independent adjudicator.  As far as I and the Labour Party are concerned, it is not acceptable that the most vulnerable in society and their families can be dealt with in this way.</P>
        <P>Let us envisage an employee of the HSE designated by the chief executive to make an adjudication.  Many people are of good standing. <Col N="1875"/> However, it is unfair to ask them to adjudicate in the first instance.  Certain people, hopefully in a minority, could consider such a situation in light of the best way of climbing a career ladder.  Will they adhere to the advice, recommendations and guidelines handed down by the executive to the letter of the law?  They will be asked to make a judgment.</P>
        <P>As I stated, an independent appeals mechanism is not in place nor is there an advocacy service for an appellant.  Both services are proposed in other Bills.  It would be better if they were in place before the Bill is enacted.  This Bill is all the poorer without this amendment.  This is about people having confidence that when they make an appeal it will be considered by someone in an objective manner and not as an employee of the chief executive.  Such a person may be viewed as being there to implement the diktat of the executive.</P>
        <P>It should be stated in the Bill that decisions of an appeals officer should be subject to a review by the Ombudsman.  Why is the Ombudsman not referred to in this Bill?  Perhaps the Department and Minister are afraid of the Ombudsman and have taken exception to decisions made by her over the years.  The Ombudsman consistently stated with regard to issues relevant to older people that the Department broke the law.  The Ombudsman is the one person who stood up for older people and the treatment they were afforded by the health boards in the past, and now the HSE.  Why can we not have reference to the Ombudsman for further adjudication?</P>
           <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>When we consider the situation of older people in its entirety and their rights and entitlements, it is obvious this Bill is not necessary.  The guidelines in the Bill for an appeals officer state the financial assessment of an applicant&rsquo;s means will include all income and investments including life policies and any assets transferred within the previous five years for nominal consideration and up to 5% of the market value of one&rsquo;s house.  I know the Minister of State does not like us getting back to this, but it is taken into consideration in the assessment of means.</P>

	<P>The Deputy may share his time.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I call on the Government to use its influence in a positive way to address any outstanding issues relating to labour relations in An Post, which have caused unease and distrust in the past, and to clarify the circumstances whereby salary, pension payments or increases due or anticipated are to be met.  I readily recognise that the chief executive officer of An Post has done a tremendous amount of work in this area and is obviously seriously engaged in the work.  Both he and An Post will require the imprimatur of Government to ensure that all outstanding issues are dealt with.  This is because the Government set aside sections 45 and 46 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 and made it difficult for us to raise questions about the matter afterwards.  The Government was in the best position to positively influence what is required in this area.  My colleagues will deal with this further.  </P>
        <P>I call on the Government to use its influence in a positive way to provide for the computerisation, modernisation and upgrading of the entire network of post offices and sub-post offices with a view to providing a reliable, efficient and cost-effective next-day delivery service throughout the country.  The first thing we must realise is that to ensure there is a future for the entire postal service, we must have an efficient, cost-effective and reliable service.  It is no good having glitches in the system.  We must resolve all these problems once and for all.  I know that some of these issues are in hand, but to deal with them effectively, the Government, particularly the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, must bestir themselves and ensure that they are fully <i>au fait</i> with what is required.</P>
        <P>We must recognise the value of the network and ensure we face competition.  Two things can happen with deregulation, from which we are only a hair&rsquo;s breadth.  We can maintain a strong, vibrant and effective postal service and ensure its existence into the future or we can throw our hands up in the air and say that nothing can be done.  Some commentators say modern technology has replaced all this and that things will be done differently in the future, but I do not agree with this.  There must and always will be a place for the transaction of business at local and community level throughout the country.  There is so much emphasis on community enterprise at the moment that if we fail to recognise that critical element of bringing the technology to the people, we will fail the people.  I call on the Government to use its combined influence in a positive way to ensure these matters are dealt with.</P>
        <P>We must recognise and address the appallingly low level of pay to a substantial number of postmasters, who have effectively subsidised the service by providing premises and working at a <Col N="1878"/>rate below the minimum wage and, in some cases, below the poverty line.  I do not know whether the House fully recognises the importance of this, but there has been a fairly sizeable number of postmasters who have worked and provided a service in their own premises to such an extent that they have effectively worked for nothing.  A recent survey showed that approximately 75 or 76 of them have been working at a level of pay below the poverty line.  There is now an opportunity to recognise and address these issues without more ado.</P>
        <P>I presume the Minister will be home tomorrow and if he has given up the Tannoy in Hanoi, he will have time to return and address these issues in a very positive way.  Even if he does not do so, I can rely on the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, who, as a Member from Wexford, is fully aware of the critical role likely to be played by the postal service in the future and will recognise those people who have given of their best for so long with so little recognition.  We now have the opportunity to recognise them.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding deregulation, we must also recognise the existence of a public service, or universal, obligation.  The Minister or someone else might tell us there cannot be any assistance for a utility service because it is deregulated, but this is not true.  Other countries have had to do so.  In most European countries, some assistance is given either by way of direct grant, public service obligation or some other means.  I do not wish to see the quality and service of the postal delivery services in this country drop down to the level of that in some European countries with which we were all familiar in the past.  We laughed at the fact that, after we came back from holidays, the postcard we sent on the first day of our holiday arrived home two or three weeks after we arrived home.</P>
        <P>Communications in the modern era are very important.  We cannot underestimate the value of bringing the power of modern communications to local people in local areas.  I have mentioned the need to computerise and upgrade.  In addition to Fortis Bank, there is a vast number of compatible services which can be tagged on to the postal service with no additional cost.  It can be done simply by fully utilising the availability of the services that are readily available and the goodwill of the staff involved.</P>
        <P>We must facilitate the development and extension of a wide range of compatible services through the postal system and encourage Departments, including the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, to get involved.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government could be encouraged to get involved if it wishes to update and upgrade the register of electors on a regular basis.  The obvious place to go in this regard is the post office whose staff go to almost every house in the country on a daily <Col N="1879"/>basis.  No other group of people has the same access to and knowledge of dealing with the public as post office staff.</P>
        <P>We all know about the instructions given to the Department of Social and Family Affairs in respect of electronic money transfer.  The post offices will now have the services of a bank alongside and integrated within them, which is to be welcomed.  We should take full advantage of this.  The Government should have the courage of its convictions and, through the Minister or the Taoiseach, if necessary, issue instructions to the Department of Social and Family Affairs to ensure the major amount of this business is transacted through post offices.</P>
        <P>The time has come for us to provide a good, honest, reliable and effective service and to recognise the effectiveness of the service that once existed and should exist again if that driving force from the Government is there.  I do not accept that we should leave all this to regulators or anyone else in the future.  We have witnessed the farcical situation pertaining to regulators in the past few weeks where, flying in the face of public opinion and all other economic indicators, the Commission for Energy Regulation approved increases in gas and electricity prices, but subsequently climbed down and pretended that a reduction by a small amount in the increases now represented a decrease.  That was the greatest farce of all time.  I do not want to see the same thing happen in the postal services.  It says much about the impartiality and independence of the regulators.  Let there be a clear commitment on the part of the Government to put in place the measures necessary to ensure that the postal service will survive and will be effective, viable, sought-after and supported by the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this very important issue in the D&aacute;il.  Only some months ago An Post withdrew fully the services of a post office in Rockcorry, a village in my constituency.  It got the opportunity when the then incumbent was going out of business.  Prior to this closure, the local post offices in Stranooden, Swans Cross, Doohat and Aghabog were closed.  They were closed simply because the income the incumbents were receiving was so low that nobody else in the area was prepared to take them on.  No great fuss was made by the rural population and they accept they cannot have everything and that costs must be taken into account.  However, the removal of the postal service from Rockcorry, where many houses have been built and hundreds more are proposed, is completely unacceptable.</P>
        <P>For reasons that have not been well explained, the closure was not indicated when it was first stated the post office would be moved from its existing location.  We were initially told there would be an advertisement and that a post office would be put in the place of the old one but, as <Col N="1880"/>soon as the application appeared, it became very clear that the new operation would not be a post office but an agency.  The applicants wanted an agency in the supermarket, filling station or wherever else they could put it.  A number of applications were received and I wish the successful applicant all the best.  However, one should remember that a service has been removed from an area that has no bus service or other means of transport to the nearest town, Cootehill, which is five miles distant.  This town is not even in the same county.</P>
        <P>In another post office in County Monaghan, which is smaller than the one in Rockcorry, there is a new computerised system.  It is great and if it had been installed in the post office in Rockcorry, there is no doubt that it would have been able to provide a better service.</P>
        <P>There should be political accountability.  When the Minister in charge was contacted regarding the case in question, he said he had no role in the matter.  He had handed over responsibility completely to An Post, which is totally in charge.  Surely there should be ministerial accountability and some understanding that such closures should not happen.</P>
        <P>Deputy Durkan referred to labour relations.  It is vital that there is an agreement on the income of post office staff.  If it were not for their receiving additional income, they certainly could not stay in business.  Computerisation and modernisation of the village-type post office is required to ensure it is not done away with.  It is important that An Post is warned that if it tries to remove the postal service from Cootehill, which is the main post office in the region, and turn it into some sort of agency or private affair, there will be a major reaction.</P>
        <P>An Post has a great opportunity to build up a service.  In the early days of the State, one could post a letter in Dublin and be sure it would reach County Monaghan the next morning.  One could receive a reply the next evening.  For some time, however, it has been taking weeks for letters to arrive.  This must be addressed.  There has been some improvement but dramatic change is required.  An Post provides a useful service and the Government should not let the network be destroyed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Post offices are valued not only for the business they do but also for the wider social role they play.  In rural areas and some deprived urban areas, post offices play a crucial role in sustaining local communities.  In many areas, they help to keep open the only village shop or other retail outlet.  They regularly provide support and advice for vulnerable people and can often act as a focal point for the whole community.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources must bear in mind the rapid speed at which rural post offices are closing.  The local post office is the heart of many rural com<Col N="1881"/>munities and there are serious concerns that the large number of closures will accelerate in 2007.  County Roscommon has lost 20 post offices since 2000.  Twelve have been downgraded to Post-point agencies with a limited service and eight have been closed completely.  In County Leitrim, a further 20 have been affected in that 13 have been downgraded and seven have been closed completely.  Such decisions have a direct negative impact on the communities served by the post offices.  Not only are the communities losing existing postal services but, with the introduction of the full banking service by An Post next year, they will also be denied new and improved services in the future.  The expansion of An Post into the banking sector will become important and many of the banks will pull out of the smaller towns.  It is, therefore, very disappointing that nothing has been done in the past ten years to support the rural post office network.</P>
        <P>The European Court of Justice recently notified the Minister for Social and Family Affairs that the &euro;50 million social welfare contract, currently held by An Post, will be put to tender next year.  It is anticipated that An Post could lose this contract because the Department seems intent on focusing on the electronic transfer system.  As a result, it is likely that many more post offices around the country will close.</P>
        <P>The network has become increasingly reliant on a few lines of business for the majority of its revenue.  In order for the sub-post offices to remain viable, the number of services and volume of transactions must be increased dramatically.  The use of information technology is fundamental to the maintenance of the post office network throughout the country.  While it is stated Government policy to improve information technology and Internet access throughout the country, especially in rural communities, it has paid nothing but lip service to the concept.  Many parts of the sub-post office network have not been upgraded with electronic services.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for modernising the network clearly rests with An Post but the Government also has a role to play to ensure post offices have the resources to make the network operate efficiently.  With immediate effect, the Government must ensure that every sub-post office throughout the country is computerised, thus dramatically expanding the number of services provided.  This would allow non-automated sub-post offices to provide services such as Passport Express, issue prize bonds and offer banking services, which are unavailable at present.</P>
        <P>Opportunities exist to diversify into new lines of business, including e-commerce and one-stop shops for Government information and carrying out transactions.  Over recent years, the Department of Agriculture and Food has facilitated on-line access for farmers but, owing to the lack of broadband in rural areas due to the Government&rsquo;s incompetence, access to the service is limited severely.  The Department, in conjunction <Col N="1882"/>with An Post, should devise a scheme to allow post office staff make electronic returns on behalf of farmers.  Many more Government services could be developed if the political will existed, but it does not seem to be evident at present.</P>
        <P>The social role of post offices is important in rural areas.  In many rural areas, post offices have remained while other services have been withdrawn.  New lines of business should replace most, if not all, of the lost revenues.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Durkan for allowing me a few minutes of his time to make some general points about the importance of the post office network throughout the country, not just in rural areas.   The Taoiseach and Leader of the Minister of State&rsquo;s party has made much play of the importance of community.  He even brought in an American sociologist, Mr. Putnam, some time ago to educate the parliamentary party about the importance of community.  This, however, does not seem to resonate too well with the Minister of State and his colleagues when one considers how they have stood idly by and allowed the post office network to disintegrate without any interest from the party in helping to ensure that some vital responsibilities and services are left, such as the service in many rural areas. </P>
        <P>This recalls the comments and expert advice that suggested the Garda station should be in a central location and the squad car with one or two garda&iacute; would solve all the problems within a 20-mile radius.  We know now that anti-social behaviour and criminal activity are not confined to the precincts of a Garda station in a central location but are rampant throughout the country.  We need to relocate and reopen Garda stations that Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers and the Progressive Democrats Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have closed down, through their policies, in recent years.  It makes no sense that, at a time of unprecedented growth in housing developments in many villages, some planned but much of it unplanned, provision is not made for essential community services, such as cr&egrave;che and sporting facilities, Garda stations or post offices.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to understand the Government&rsquo;s rural development policy.  Before the last general election, the Minister of State at the then Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Davern, published a very noble rural development policy mentioning, among other things, the importance of the post office network.  He said a viable community would need a central State service such as An Post that could disseminate information or other services.  Instead, in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny &mdash; I am particularly familiar with the Kilkenny end of it &mdash; post offices have been closed in Stoneyford, Hugginstown, Kells and Jenkinstown.  Even that in my parish of Tullaroan was recently downgraded.  An Post is buying off the post mistress or master with <Col N="1883"/>a few euro, creating a redundancy package for the individual, closing the post office network without the Government intervening to halt this undesirable development.</P>
        <P>The motion before the House calls for the upgrading of a service that has stood the test of time.  Apart from the economic service, it has been essential to social contact and communication.  The Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats Deputies know that this issue will strike at the heart of rural communities if it is not resolved quickly.  I ask the Minister of State to take an interest in intervening in these matters as the then Taoiseach, John Bruton, did in 1996 when his post office was under threat in Kilcloon, County Meath.  He intervened directly, stating categorically to the board of An Post that as a matter of Government policy he was not prepared to accept the downgrade.  That is the type of initiative required to ensure that we have an essential rural service.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to ensure, in small urban or rural communities, a State network through An Post that provides a wide range of services, apart from post office responsibilities.  What better way to take on board the one-stop shop provision, enunciated in the motion, than through an existing State network, the post offices.  The Government should take into account its social responsibility to all the people, rural and urban, and ensure that the computerisation of those services is not further neglected.  It should ensure that other post offices do not follow those already closed which are starved of investment until the post master or mistress is bought off with a few euro and the service is no longer available.  Deputy Durkan has done the House a good service in tabling a motion that will put it up to the Government Members tomorrow when the vote is called.  We will see what kind of amendment the Government uses to challenge the Opposition in providing an essential rural and urban network for service provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I too congratulate my colleague, Deputy Durkan, on this important motion.  The only problem in An Post is that it has no overall strategy because the Government does not want it to have one.  The easiest way out of this problem is to let the light go out slowly across the country as long as it does not come back to shine on the Government.  I know of no other national organisation that provides a service such as An Post, yet seems not to have any objectives.  If it had targets it could not meet them.  It allows this to happen because it knows that neither the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources nor the Government could care less what it does.</P>
        <P>If this Government is allowed to continue the erosion of services from rural Ireland not only will there be less traffic through the local post office but there will be fewer post men and <Col N="1884"/>women.  Instead of daily deliveries, post will be delivered only three days out of five in rural areas.  That is coming down the track.  Did the Minister of State see what the regulator said about An Post&rsquo;s delivery service?  One expects a letter posted in Dublin to arrive in Ballinasloe or Clonakilty the next day.  There is no magic in this.  The post office was better able to do this 20 years ago than now.  Only 74% of letters posted in Dublin this evening will reach the provinces tomorrow.  What happens the other 26%?  No one notices that.  This is an insidious procedure because the Government hopes that the network will pull itself down until it says it could not possibly make a delivery in the far-flung regions of the country every day of the week.  That is where we are heading.</P>
        <P>The Government is ensuring that every component of the An Post service is under pressure.  Everyone talks about the minimum wage, and rightly so because the non-nationals who come here are entitled to be treated with dignity.  Most of our own people, however, working behind the post office counters for 12 hours every day receive less than the minimum wage.  They are in some of the best buildings in the most advantageous places possible in our towns and villages, yet they are paid a pittance.</P>
        <P>When the incumbent retires or takes the few euro redundancy, An Post has an opportunity to close that post office.  The age profile of postmasters and mistresses is rising by the day.  There will be no trouble closing more post offices by stealth when the incumbents have retired or died, whether the post office has many customers.  That is where the link is broken.  The Government should insist on An Post having an overall set of objectives or a plan for where it wants the organisation to go in the next ten, 15 or 20 years, taking into account the importance of balanced regional development and all the other issues which I do not have time to cover.   The local post office provides an important service in all areas. I assure anyone listening to or watching this debate that if more direction is not provided from the Government to ensure An Post gets its act together, there will be considerably fewer post offices, postmen and postwomen, and far fewer letters delivered.</P>
        <P>Can one imagine the blow it is to places in my constituency of Galway East such as Clonbern, Newbridge, Kiltormer, Kilreekill and a host of other places?  In those relatively big areas, one cannot even post a letter and one certainly cannot draw the pension.  That is some service in rural Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The post office network plays a critical part in the social and economic life of rural Ireland.  The postman or postwoman is probably the only person with whom many old people, in particular, would have contact on a regular basis.  He or she is the only person calling to many houses on a weekly basis, apart from per<Col N="1885"/>haps a doctor or relative.  That is why the network is so important for the future of rural communities.</P>
        <P>I refer to conclusion No. 4 of the FGS report which states that Government policy on the post office network is vague and, unlike the majority of EU countries, Ireland does not have a specific minimum requirement in regard to the size and coverage of the post office network.  It also stated that, as a result, current policy in regard to the post office network would do little to prevent the current <i>ad hoc </i>decline in the number of post offices.  This statement highlights the lack of specific policy on the post office network which arises due to the ambiguity as to what is meant by &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; and &ldquo;nationwide service&rdquo;.  It is this ambiguity which allows politicians to fully support the sustainable development of the rural post office while, at the same time, the number of post offices is in rapid decline.</P>
        <P>Irish policy is in marked contrast to two thirds of that in EU countries where specific criteria exist regarding the number of post offices.  Given that the Government uses 1997 as a benchmark for defining economic policy, I remind the Minister that on 1 July 1997 there were 1,818 contractors operating post offices on behalf of the Government, while the current number is 1,294.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>And falling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is 524 fewer than in 1997 and the number is falling.  That is a massive drop.  The number of company staffed branches has fallen from 97 to 84.  We have lost 537 post offices since the Government came to office which is a major indictment of the Government.</P>
        <P>Many European countries have adopted a specific strategy that sets a ratio of post offices to population that guarantees access for all citizens to a post office within a given number of kilometres from their home.  Few of the European post office networks are capable of being self-financing or require support from their respective governments in some fashion, which they are getting.  Some support is by way of direct subsidisation while in other cases it is merely by way of intermittent contributions to network modernisation.  The bottom line is that they receive direct support.  The absence of Government policy and the size and distribution of the network is the fundamental problem to be overcome before addressing the future of the network and how it should be secured.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this issue in Private Members&rsquo; time because the post office is very much a part of all our lives.  Likewise, the postmaster is an important individual in communities.  With regard to the range of services operated from post offices, we should seriously examine making post offices tourism information points also.  A new system of tourism information has been rolled out by F&aacute;ilte Ireland wherein all tourism points have been centralised under its <Col N="1886"/>control.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland should investigate the possibility of using post offices.</P>
        <P>I seek clarification from the Minister on one point.  It appears the Department of Social and Family Affairs is encouraging people to have pension payments paid directly into bank accounts which would remove post offices from the equation.  That is becoming the norm for social welfare payments.  In itself, this will affect a significant number of post offices.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Deputy Durkan on bringing this motion before the House.  The closure of rural post offices has been before the Government for the past nine years and there is little evidence of any substantial progress in reversing the decline.  The figures are startling in that one quarter of post offices have closed since 2000.  There are now only 1,365 post offices in the country and just 84 of them are full post offices.  The remainder are sub-offices and these are in grave danger also.  A substantial number of these post offices are still non-automated.  Recently, in my constituency, two post office closed.  One was in Kilnamona, and it is not intended to replace it, and the other is in the rural area of Carrigaholt.  As previous speakers stated, few people are interested in taking up the position of postmaster there as An Post does not pay enough for them to make a living.</P>
        <P>Deputy Connaughton referred to the fact that post offices are located in prime villages but they also are in vulnerable locations.  Recently a major robbery took place at the post office in Doonbeg in which &euro;40,000 was taken.  Post offices are a constant security risk.</P>
        <P>A study in Britain by the New Economics Foundation found that in urban areas every &euro;15 earned in post offices generated &euro;24.30 for the local economy.  The ratio would probably not be as great in rural areas but it is no less important.  The loss of a village post office can have a detrimental effect on the local economy.  If pensioners are no longer drawing their pensions in post offices, they are no longer providing business to the local shop.  They are forced, where possible, to drive to the nearest large town.  For those with access to transport, which many people do not have, it creates further congestion on our roads and further expense for the individuals concerned, or their relatives, in making the trip.  Post offices are a centre not only for the local community but also for local businesses.</P>
        <P>It is not good enough for An Post management to wash its hands of a sub-post office when it fails to find an operator to take over a post office when a postmaster or postmistress resigns.  Equally, it is not sufficient for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to state in reply to parliamentary questions that he has no role in the operation of post offices and that the issue in question is a matter for An Post.  That is evading responsibility because, ultimately, <Col N="1887"/>the Government has responsibility for such matters.</P>
        <P>Deputy Crawford referred to a closure in his constituency.  One cannot blame people for closing down offices as many people are making as little as &euro;15,000 a year for working long hours and opening five and a half days a week.  In many cases, post offices are not commercial entities and they are not sustainable as such.  On the other hand, An Post made a profit of &euro;41 million last year.  This shows there is clearly something wrong in terms of priorities.  While An Post is to be congratulated on the range of services now provided in main post offices, including savings and investment schemes, prize bonds, banking and paying bills, money transfers and insurance products, An Post should not be in it just for the money.  There is nothing wrong with making substantial profits but my concern is how those profits are used.  Much of those profits should be put back into the branch network to make rural branches viable as businesses.  Deputy Durkan stated that we should recognise the existence of a public service obligation notwithstanding deregulation.</P>
        <P>An Post&rsquo;s service has declined in recent years.  Previously, if one posted a letter in Ennis at 8 p.m., it was delivered locally the following morning.  If one&rsquo;s letters are not posted at the main post office in Ennis by 5 p.m., they will not be delivered the next day.  They will have to go to the central office in Cork and, as Deputy Connaughton said, delivery could take up to three days.  In this day and age a letter should be delivered within 24 hours and there should be a following day delivery rate of 95%.</P>
        <P>An Post management needs to make some fundamental policy changes affecting the profitability of rural post offices if the decline in their numbers is to be reversed and we are to avoid turning rural villages into ghost towns.  As Deputy Hogan said, this is already happening in the case of Garda stations and rural pubs.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>He was very selective in regard to the post offices he allowed to remain open.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was not a word from the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The communications sector is changing rapidly.  As part of that sector, the global market for postal services is facing a number of significant challenges, including an increasing amount of correspondence conducted by e-mail, falling mail volumes and the threat to post office business from a move to the on-line provision of services.  There are, however, a number of opportunities for postal operators, including An Post, particularly in the stimulation of parcel business caused by increased Internet use.  However, the opportunities arise in an increasingly competitive environment.  For this reason it is key that An Post continues with its current phase of restruc<Col N="1890"/>turing in order to provide the range of products and services necessary to thrive in a competitive environment.</P>
        <P>The Government is firmly of the belief that there will continue to be a key national role for An Post, both in delivery of mail and as a quality service provider of Government and financial services through its nationwide network of post office outlets but, like all national postal operators, it has to change rapidly to stay competitive and commercial in the European postal market.  One thing is certain: it is absolutely imperative that An Post avoids a return to the loss-making situation.  In order to achieve this it will require hard work, a commitment to achieving the goals set out in the company&rsquo;s recovery plan and a strong entrepreneurial outlook to exploit opportunities as they arise.  This can be done by making the best possible use of its long-established and trusted brand name and deploying its resources in a manner which continues to serve existing customers&rsquo; needs and attract additional customers for a range of new services.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be all too aware of the financial difficulties An Post has faced in recent years, where it recorded losses in excess of &euro;70 million between 2001 and 2003.  There is widespread agreement that change is required if the postal services of An Post are to adapt to the modern business environment and the likely increase in competition to ensure it continues to offer a top class nationwide delivery service to the customer into the future.  With this in mind, the board and management of An Post prepared a recovery plan, incorporating details of proposed new collection and delivery arrangements which are now in the process of being implemented and which will re-establish the company on a more secure financial footing.</P>
        <P>To successfully overcome the range of challenges presented by the prospect of greater competition and electronic substitution, it is important that changes in the company&rsquo;s collection and delivery operations are implemented.  In this regard, the company&rsquo;s recovery plan provides for a reduction in numbers of approximately 1,400 in collection and delivery, through voluntary redundancies and non-filling of vacancies, together with changes in existing work practices. The changes will increase operational flexibility and significantly reduce the company&rsquo;s existing cost base. Such changes will enable the company to provide a cost effective mail service and quality of service standards which meet customer expectations.  Furthermore, a key element of the plan concerns the continuing implementation of a major change programme throughout the company to deliver significant cost savings and efficiencies.  The scale of the change required is, inevitably, having an impact on staff throughout the organisation, as it involves the restructuring and rationalisation of management positions, reductions in staff numbers and curtailment of overtime, as well as substantial non-pay cost cuts. <Col N="1891"/> Members will recall that the recovery plan was the subject of a very difficult industrial relations exercise last year and has now been resolved successfully.</P>
        <P>I understand all pay increases provided for under Sustaining Progress, including the payment of &euro;20 million in back pay, which were the source of much of the industrial unrest at the company have now been paid to staff members and passed on to the company&rsquo;s pensioners.  It is up to all parties to ensure the process for full implementation of the change programme that is so essential to placing the company on a firm financial footing and securing its future is achieved fully.</P>
        <P>With regard to the post office network, the Government and the board of An Post are fully committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network through a strategy of maximising the volume of both public and private sector business handled by the network.  This is set out clearly in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The An Post network has many competitive advantages and comprises the single largest number of retail outlets in the country.  In the European context, Ireland still has one of the highest number of post offices per head of population with 4.2 outlets per 10,000 inhabitants, compared to a European Union average of 2.7.  In line with similar trends across Europe, there has been in recent years some network restructuring.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have to be careful with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The post office network currently consists of 995 automated post offices, 404 non-automated post offices and 161 postal agencies.  Effectively, the 995 automated offices transact 97.4% of business.  In addition, An Post has also established 2,567 PostPoint outlets in retail premises.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a great help either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>As well as its nationwide reach, the strengths of the post office include a recognised and one of the most trusted brand names in the country, a high customer footfall and a strong relationship between postmasters and their customers.  However, the network is facing a number of challenges which will intensify in coming years.  First, the bulk of business undertaken by the network is high volume, low margin transactions such as welfare and utility bill payments which are susceptible to migration to other payment channels, especially electronic methods of payments.  Second, the network is heavily dependent on two key contracts, namely, those with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and with the NTMA and the POSB in respect of Government savings.  Third, the European Court of Justice is examining the contract of the Depart<Col N="1892"/>ment of Social and Family Affairs with An Post.  The Advocate General to the court recently issued her opinion that the contract that An Post holds with the Department should have been advertised.   The court is expected to rule on the case shortly.  Furthermore, in line with the Government decision to move to electronic payment methods, the Department has been examining a long-term strategy for the delivery of welfare payments.  The model being considered is cashless and paperless involving EFT functionality for welfare clients.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is like electronic voting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>In this context, An Post needs to implement an IT platform to comply with this and other requirements.  While the Government will support the network in any way it can and the Minister has made it clear to the board and management of An Post that he will be supportive of them in their efforts to ensure the post office network continues to develop and thrive, the development and continued viability of An Post and the post office network is, in the first instance, a matter for the board and management of An Post.  Consequently, the way forward is for An Post to enhance existing services and, building on existing strengths, to develop new product offerings.  There is also an urgent need for it to diversify its income streams and those of postmasters.  In this regard, the Government is aware that An Post, in partnership with postmasters, has had some recent success in acquiring new business for post offices.  Many Members will no doubt be aware that, in accordance with a contract between An Post and AIB, customers of that bank can now transact business at more than 1,000 post offices.</P>
        <P>The key to ensuring the post office network remains competitive and attractive to customers is to ensure it is technologically in the best possible position to retain its current contracts and avail of business opportunities as they arise.  A key step in this regard has been the automation of the network which was completed in 1997.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1997.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 95% of all post office business is conducted through its automated offices.  The company has recently conducted a pilot project to computerise ten small post offices.  The automation pilot project has recently been completed and the results of this trial are being assessed with a view to informing future decisions on network automation.  I understand the Minister will be informed of the results once the analysis has been completed.</P>
        <P>On foot of large-scale investment in the computerisation of the network, the company has also had some degree of success in winning new business.  The past year has seen business growth in its contract business with AIB, Western Union gift <Col N="1893"/>vouchers, Garda fines and Billpay.  Reflecting this improved business activity, since 2000 postmasters&rsquo; income has increased by 63%, which compares with increases of 34% under national wage agreements over the same period and 22% in the consumer price index.  The Government recognises that the matter of postmasters&rsquo; remuneration is still of concern to the IPU.</P>
        <P>Challenges remain and like all businesses, if An Post is to prosper and to grow, it must adapt to the demands of its customers and place delivery of quality services to its customers as its primary focus and objective.  Automation and technology alone will not bring in the business required to support the network.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would help though.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The challenge for the company is to develop a strategy that satisfies the needs of existing customers, while attracting new customers into the post office in order to maintain as large a network as is viable.  Despite what has been said on the far side of the House, the Minister requested the company to develop a strategy for the long-term development of the post office network.  In response to this request An Post examined options relating to the operation of a jointly owned entity termed An Post Financial Services, APFS, to supply a wide range of retail financial services through the post office network and other channels, using the An Post brand and other An Post assets.</P>
        <P>Negotiations were concluded between An Post and Fortis in the summer and the Government approved the An Post board to proceed with the joint venture which it is anticipated will be launched in early 2007.  Its launch will see the establishment of a full service retail bank which will be a separate legal entity to An Post and Fortis, in which both An Post and Fortis will have an equal shareholding; the introduction of a state-of-the-art banking IT platform &mdash; the joint venture will invest significant sums of money in upgrading the network in the next five years; the opportunity to diversify and increase the revenue streams for An Post and postmasters through commissions for the sale and servicing of products; the initial employment of approximately 250 people, which number will rise to 500 within five years; an enhancement of banking services in rural areas; and the introduction of additional competition to the banking sector.  The primary delivery channel for product and services will be via the post office network, with An Post being appointed as sole provider of financial services.</P>
        <P>This deal will result in real investment in the post office network and technology that should place An Post on a platform to continue to win more business and, in particular, higher value financial services and ensure An Post can compete for business on a level footing with other financial services institutions.  The deal will enable the company to deliver the quality customer services <Col N="1894"/>now demanded by the public and also means that social welfare recipients will have more options on their preferred method of payment.  We all regularly hear concerns about the future of our extensive rural post office network.  This deal will result in investment in the network in both urban and rural areas at a time when many of the private sector financial institutes are withdrawing their facilities from many rural locations.</P>
        <P>While the Government recognises that the joint venture will not be the panacea to all of the challenges facing An Post and its network, it is clearly the biggest development and opportunity to have presented itself in recent years.  The alternative course of action of doing nothing is clearly not an option that anyone with the long-term interests of the post office network in mind would wish to pursue.  There are few alternatives.  It is in the interest of all parties that the joint venture with Fortis proves to be a success.  It represents a real opportunity for the company to secure the viability of the post office network and its postmasters.  It is, therefore, very disappointing that the Irish Postmasters Union has recently indicated that it does not intend to co-operate with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are being paid.  The minimum wage would not go down too well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>This is despite the fact that central to the Government approving An Post to proceed with the joint venture was that it represented a real opportunity for the company and postmasters alike to diversify and increase their income in the coming years.  I, therefore, urge postmasters to reconsider their present stance, in which I am sure the Deputy will support me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>However, they need to be paid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Government believes this financial services strategy is an important element in any plans to secure the long-term viability of the network, it is also keenly aware of the human and social dimension to the post office.  It is also clear that other aspects of the relationship between postmasters and An Post need to be addressed.  It is for this reason that the Minister decided to appoint Mr. Eamonn Ryan to act as a facilitator between the IPU and An Post to identify issues of mutual concern and plot a road map for how they might be resolved.  I know that the union is greatly appreciative of this appointment and it is critically important that both sides engage fully on the issues at stake.  Considerable work went into Eamonn Ryan&rsquo;s report, with members of the IPU and An Post identifying issues and looking at remedies.  It is imperative that this hard work is not carelessly jettisoned at this stage.</P>
        <P>The coming year is a crucial one for the post office network.  Everything going well, by early next year the financial services venture should be up and running.  This will be an exciting and chal<Col N="1895"/>lenging time for An Post.  The new financial services venture represents a new departure for the company in terms of what the post office will offer in this consumer-driven age.</P>
        <P>Regarding letter post services and the collection and delivery of mail, the Government recognises the critical importance of having a nationwide, reliable, high quality and efficient postal service.  The economy and society at large need a strong and vibrant postal service in the light of the many internationally traded sectors operating in the country.  It also needs An Post to be competitive.  The Government also believes liberalisation and the expected increase in competition will ultimately be good for both An Post and consumers.  An Post operates within a regulatory framework as enshrined in the EU postal directives which set out the requirements for member states regarding the provision of high quality postal services.  Both directives have been transposed into Irish law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Furthermore, they provide for the phased liberalisation of the postal market and propose that the postal sector be fully liberalised across the European Union on 1 January 2009 subject to political agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Political agreement &mdash; we will need to remember that one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The current regulatory framework grants An Post a legal monopoly in the provision of certain mail services in order to help it meet the costs of meeting its universal service obligation.  Liberalisation of the mail market in Ireland has already commenced.  Since the transposition of the two postal directives, the area of the market reserved exclusively for An Post has been reduced to 50 gm since 1 January last.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That may well be a bad decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>If full liberalisation is achieved, the letter post sector will be fully open to competition.  The outbound international mail sector was fully liberalised on 1 January 2004.  This partial opening of the market has resulted in 29 firms operating in Ireland with a postal service authorisation from ComReg.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>This only affects the postal service, as the Minister of State knows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The current postal directive will expire on 31 December 2008 and it is expected any new postal directive will be adopted by 2007.  As provided for in the current postal directive, a study was recently undertaken by the European Commission of the impact on the universal service of the full accomplishment of a liberalised postal market.  Based on the outcome of this <Col N="1896"/>study, the Commission has presented a report to the European Parliament and Council, accompanied by a proposal confirming the date of 2009 for full liberalisation of the postal market.  The proposed directive is being discussed by the European Council.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Government wants a strong and vibrant An Post, delivering the highest quality postal and counter services to the public on a financially sound basis.  While there has been a significant improvement in the company&rsquo;s financial performance in the past two years through rigorous cost control, there is no room for complacency.  It is imperative that the cost savings provided for in the recovery plan are delivered upon.  This point cannot be over-emphasised.</P>
        <P>The way forward for the postal services is to ensure that we have, on the one hand, adequate competition and, on the other, no diminution of the universal service.  The development of further competition, allied with a modernised and customer-focused An Post, will provide the basis for the further development of the postal sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have just completed four years as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and during that period we engaged with the management of An Post, the trade unions, particularly, the Irish Postmasters Union, other stakeholders, customers, ComReg and the Minister.  At one of our meetings I was horrified to learn that the then CEO had not interacted verbally with the CEO of the Communications Workers Union.  I banged their heads together and informed them that if they did not speak to each other, progress would not be made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should have banged his own head as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted that the industrial relations difficulties experienced by the company in 2005 were resolved with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court and the national implementation body.  At the core of the dispute was the implementation of a comprehensive restructuring agreement, as well as non-payment of Sustaining Progress increases.  The restructuring agreement has been signed up to by all parties and entails changes in work practices, as well as a reduction in staff numbers.  The three-person expert group established by the Labour Court has remained in place and has a key role in monitoring implementation of the recommendations.  I am delighted that the agreement is in place and that the company will be stronger.</P>
        <P>Agreement on restructuring triggered full payment of Sustaining Progress moneys to staff, postmasters and pensioners in December 2005.  In addition, the &euro;20 million owed in retrospective payments was paid in October this year.</P><Col N="1897"/>
        <P>Poor management and some outdated work practices were responsible for the disimprovement in the company&rsquo;s financial position in the years to which I refer.  A former CEO of the company came before the committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Government intervention.</P>
      </Speaker>

When the CEO to whom I refer was replaced six months later, we discovered from his successor what the real position of the company was.</P>
        <P>It is disheartening for me to recall the selling off of high street properties and tracts of land to fund the day-to-day operations of the company.  The latter came about as a result of poor financial management and industrial relations.  In addition, &euro;150 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I see Deputy Broughan has joined the debate.  As I was saying, &euro;150 million in moneys available to the company to expand and develop its operations was wasted.  I was very disappointed &mdash; I am sure my colleagues felt the same way &mdash; at the time.</P>

	<P>I am merely encouraging the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Smaller post offices are operating at a disadvantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> their larger counterparts.  They will operate at a further disadvantage <Col N="1898"/>if the new financial systems are introduced.  They also operate at a disadvantage because, as the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, stated, many are opting for electronic payments.</P>
        <P>When this report and that relating to the pilot scheme are considered in 2007, I hope we will move towards ensuring all post offices will become fully automated.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has indicated post office work is high volume in nature and involves low margin transactions such as welfare and utility bill payments.  Such payments can be transferred to any banking facility.  As the Minister of State said, the network is dependent on the two contracts currently in place, namely, that relating to social welfare payments and the NTMA&rsquo;s small savings products.</P>
        <P>I seem to recall the representative of the Irish Postmasters Union informing the joint committee that its members would embrace this technology.  I am disappointed that the union has withdrawn from the negotiations.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned about the future.  An Post has a reasonably good board and management team and a dedicated workforce which is fully committed to the company.  Everyone involved is willing and able to meet the challenges of liberalisation which will come about in 2009.</P>
        <P>I am sure the company will improve its next-day delivery service.  A previous speaker referred to a level of 74% in this regard.  I agree that this is not acceptable.  The figure for the United Kingdom is between 93% and 94%.</P>
        <P>I do not have a single complaint to make against post office workers in Cork.  They are superb people who deliver the post &mdash; hail, rain or snow.  They never let one down.  It is unusual for anyone to be let down by them and I am sure that goes for their counterparts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I pay warm tribute to the postmen and women of Ireland, with the postmasters and postmistresses, as they enter their busiest season.  One must remember that at this time every year, the post office renders outstanding service to the nation.  Over the next three and a half weeks or so, it will deliver large volumes of mail to every household and business in the State.  That is a really hard job, and we often find ourselves walking around parts of our constituency with postmen and women.  I commend and salute them on the valuable work they do for the nation.  I congratulate them and once again look forward to a very happy Christmas for our delivery and post office staff.</P>
        <P>I also commend Deputy Durkan and Fine Gael on introducing a motion on the vitally important issue of the post office network.  It is ironic that in April the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey, told delegates at the Irish Postmasters Union conference that the &ldquo;government recognises the strong social function that the post office plays ... and it represents a link between the citizens and the state ... that should be maintained and strengthened&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>If that is so, why is the network slowly being decimated?  In practice, the Minister has overseen an unprecedented attack on the long-term sustainability and viability of the post office network.  The number of post offices plummeted under the Minister and his predecessors, Deputy Dermot Ahern and former Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke.  The rate of closures is now so great that at one stage last year I calculated that there was one every ten days.  This year that has risen to one every seven days and it approaches one every six days, a truly appalling record on the part of the outgoing Government on a key national service.</P>
        <P>Even worse, it has evoked no response from the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, or his Government colleagues.  Throughout his period in office as Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, he has prepared no national plan or strategic policy for the post office network but has allowed post offices to close right, left and centre from one end of Ireland to the other.</P>

	<P>We continually hear the Taoiseach and Ministers regurgitating a long list of statistics before the cameras.  We must listen to it daily, and today it concerned the Minister of State&rsquo;s portfolio in the health area.  The <Col N="1901"/>Taoiseach told us how many hundreds of millions the Government had spent, but the one statistic that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats do not want us to know is that they have closed almost half the post offices in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>They have eviscerated the post office network.  If I started reading out the names of those closed since summer 1997, I might be here until 9 p.m.  That is a disgraceful record.  In the last 11-month period, communities around the country, including Whitehall and St. Margaret&rsquo;s in Dublin, Brandon in Kerry, Tomhaggard in Wexford, Grangecon in Wicklow, Church Cross, Kildinan and Carrigrohane in Cork, Martinstown and Holycross, Kilmallock in Limerick, Crosspatrick in Tipperary, Drumcree in Westmeath, Cranford in Donegal and many others have been bereft of a critical postal service.</P>
        <P>The list of closures is staggering.  In the past five years no corner of Ireland has been left untouched by the hammer-blow to the local community that a post office closure entails.  Last week, when I spoke on the issue on RTE, I made the point that for a long time, as everyone in the House knows, the post office was the focal point of each community and a visible sign of the Irish nation and our Republic in every hamlet and town.  The Government has slashed that service across the board.</P>
        <P>Although there has been a massive decrease in numbers of post offices, it has been difficult to get a completely accurate picture, since the Minister, as Deputy Durkan will know, has continually practised obfuscation when providing figures and tried to include all kinds of elements such as postal counters, agents and so on.  However, he cannot deny that there have been 44 shameful closures in the past 11 months.</P>
        <P>A report that I recently received on the period since 2000 shows that 505 post offices have closed.  The newspaper article associated with it termed it the death of the rural post office.  That is one example of what the Government has done to the country.  As Mr. John Kane, the very helpful General Secretary of the Irish Postmasters Union, starkly told the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, &ldquo;parts of the state have been denuded of post offices, particularly on the western seaboard from Donegal to west Cork&rdquo;.  He also said that post offices had been closed across the country on a &ldquo;haphazard basis&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I had that experience in my constituency, not in a small rural area but in one of 2,000 households and 8,000 people, the parish of Priorswood in Dublin North-East.  The post office was transferred from the local shopping centre where people could access it, without reference to anyone, to a new Tesco centre over a mile away.  Many senior citizens now face a weekly trek to <Col N="1902"/>the new shopping centre at Clare Hall or to the Northside Shopping Centre, causing them great dismay, which is also felt by mothers of young children and the many customers in the area who may live over a mile from public transport.</P>
        <P>Local business people, led by a very popular local pharmacist, Mr. John Corr, immediately contacted An Post and me to seek a reversal of the decision as the closure of Priorswood post office was such a grave inconvenience to those 2,000 households.  In this building, I met the chief of operations, Mr. Larry Donald, who has since left the company.  We had a lengthy discussion on the subject, but, as in my contact with the outgoing chief executive, Mr. Donal Curtin, I learned that there are no criteria to decide whether a post office should close, none on expanding rural areas such as those on the periphery of the Minister of State&rsquo;s fair city of Limerick or my own, Dublin, and none on opening new post offices.  No one knows what the criteria are, and if An Post knows, it is not telling us.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, will not allow them to do so.</P>
        <P>We fought a valiant battle in that area but were unsuccessful.  The Acting Chairman will know that I have tried to represent a valiant group in his constituency, the Lombardstown Post Office Action Group in Mallow, County Cork, led by Mr. John Paul O&rsquo;Shea, which has been in regular contact with my office, in its desperate campaign to retain a service.  Among its key problems is that it is not computerised, and the chairman of the committee mentioned that there are almost 400 such offices around the country.  I have made representations and I see that Ardgroom, on the western edge of the Beara peninsula in County Cork, with others across this country, particularly in the western counties, has made representations for automation that simply does not happen.</P>
        <P>An Post has correctly signed a deal with the Fortis group of Belgium, a famous financial services company with a brilliant track record, to provide such services in every locality in Ireland.  However, there will now be 600 or 700 such areas that cannot have the service because the Government has presided over the closure of their post offices.  Second, another 400 cannot offer it because they are not automated, which is crazy when, at long last, An Post has undertaken a positive initiative.</P>
        <P>The Government must also bear responsibility for the allied problem of social welfare contracts.  We know that there is electronic substitution and that the Department of Social and Family Affairs is very interested in moving towards such payments, but we do not understand why the Government has not stood up for An Post at European level regarding the post office contract.</P>
        <P>We have also heard threats from the National Treasury Management Agency.  It attended the Committee on Finance and the Public Service and stated that it would withdraw from the Post Office Savings Bank, which represents small beer <Col N="1903"/>and so does not matter.  However, it matters because it is a key function and the NTMA has an obligation to fulfil it, having been given it by this and previous Governments.  It is important that such business, often representing up to 75% of that of postmasters and postmistresses, is left in the hands of the post office.</P>
        <P>We have also recently seen the notorious problem, particularly in urban areas, of &ldquo;tiger&rdquo; raids, disgusting attempted and actual abductions of postmasters and postmistresses.  The Labour Party is concerned about the response of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey, to these outrageous attacks on workers who provide such an invaluable service to their communities.  When Deputy Durkan and I tried to raise this matter on the Order of Business recently, moreover, we got short shrift from the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
        <P>The 2009 deadline for the full liberalisation of the postal market is significant.  The Labour Party believes a national postal strategy is essential, but it will not happen without Government action.  Some weeks ago, a dynamic chief executive officer of a private postal operation in my constituency visited me in Leinster House.  It was clear from our conversation that he is content to cherry-pick the best aspects of the postal service.  It seems he is not, however, prepared to offer a postal service in the Beara Peninsula, west Clare, the midlands and other rural areas.  The Government must devise a strategy to address this issue.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party welcomes the positive developments in labour relations in An Post in recent months.  It is regrettable, however, that workers were not paid the agreed arrears for so long.  In addition, An Post pensioners were treated disgracefully.  We support the Fine Gael motion and call for a strategy for An Post, whether by means of a White Paper or legislation.  This strategy must set out its future beyond 2009 in the face of ever-changing means of communication and the prospect of deregulation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion regarding the post office network and the future of postal services.  As a representative of a mainly rural constituency, it is an issue close to my heart.  This is not the first time we have discussed in this House the reduction in postal services in rural areas, but it is all the more pressing now given the ongoing phenomenon of the withdrawal of postal services from rural areas.</P>
        <P>I have seen many instances of this in my constituency, but I will refer to just one example of the way in which a small community in west Kerry is suffering because of Government neglect and the unfortunate strategic thinking of An Post.  Cloghane and Brandon are located at the northern end of the Dingle Peninsula and are part of the Gaeltacht.  Until 2003, there was one post office in Cloghane and one in Brandon, providing <Col N="1904"/>local people with an efficient local service which included postal and social welfare payment services.  In that year, however, An Post reduced the post office in Cloghane to agency status.  This meant that the post office was incorporated into a grocery shop which provides only a basic postal service.</P>
        <P>At the beginning of this year, the postmistress at the post office in Brandon retired and An Post decided to close that office also.  An Post advertised in Brandon for someone to take on an agency post office but nobody was available.  An article in today&rsquo;s edition of my local paper, <i>The Kingdom</i>, makes clear why nobody was willing to take this post.  I advise the Minister of State to read that article.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>In the space of three years, therefore, the Cloghane-Brandon area has seen its postal service reduced from two full post offices to just one office with only agency status.  With more than 700 residents in this area of the Kerry Gaeltacht, which encompasses a large physical area, this reduction in services is completely unacceptable.  This, in conjunction with the curtailment of the public bus service, makes life extremely difficult for people in rural areas.  Many pensioners in rural Kerry, because of the closure of the local post office and the limited public bus service, are unable to collect their pensions on a Friday.  Social welfare recipients or those requiring some specific postal services must travel a minimum of ten miles to nearby Castlegregory to obtain a social welfare payment or post a parcel.</P>
        <P>If elderly people living in Dublin city were obliged to travel ten miles without access to public transport, the radio shows hosted by Joe Duffy and Pat Kenny would be bombarded with complaints on a daily basis.  This is a problem that applies in rural areas, however, and it seems people who live in such areas do not matter.  There is little interest in such issues if they do not affect Dublin.  I assure the Government, however, that the people of Kerry will revolt at the next general election.  They are unwilling to endure any more discrimination in the provision of public services.  The BreastCheck service was not extended to the area, we have the longest waiting lists for mental health assessments and we have neither post offices nor public transport.  Perhaps Joe Duffy will be more interested in the concerns of the people of rural Kerry after this debate.  We can be certain, however, that the Government is not interested.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is laughing but this is not a laughing matter for people in Kerry.  When I raise these issues with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I am advised that he has no official responsibility to the D&aacute;il in this regard and that they are a matter for An Post.  When I ask the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, about health related matters, I am told they have nothing to do with her.  This seems to be the mantra of every Minister.  Why is the Minister of State sitting there listening to this debate?  He might as well go to Grafton Street for a coffee because the Government is not taking responsibility.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources must heed the concerns of people in rural  areas.  It is clear that the policies of the Government are leading to the destruction of their way of life.  People in Dublin seem to have forgotten it was the people of rural Ireland who made this city.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I disagree in some respects with my colleague, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, because I am mindful of the lack of post offices in urban areas.  My rural background allows me to sympathise with what is happening in rural areas.  I spoke earlier today to friends and colleagues about the impact the closure of post offices is having on the rural communities I remember from my childhood.</P>
        <P>This issue is not confined to rural areas, however.  I speak on behalf of my constituents and those of Deputy Quinn in raising the matter of the closure of three sub-post offices &mdash; Terenure, Kenilworth and Rathgar &mdash; in my area in 18 months.  Local people can no longer walk to these offices to avail of the facilities and services they provide.  These services were particularly important for elderly people, for instance, as well as for young mothers collecting welfare and child benefit allowances.</P>
        <P>Post offices provide far more than merely a commercial or economic service.  They offer a community service that we simply cannot allow to be decimated because of lethargy, inaction and a determination to ignore what is happening.  I raise this issue regularly with An Post.  It is simply not good enough for those concerned to throw their hands in the air and claim they cannot find suitable premises.  I do not blame those who work in post offices, most of whom are unable to earn anything remotely like a decent living.  The income they receive from providing postal services is entirely inadequate when one takes into consideration the costs of paying staff, renting premises and so on.  It is impossible to make <Col N="1906"/>a living and some who attempt to do so are living below the poverty line.</P>
        <P>We have the worst of all possible worlds.  The knock-on effect of poor postal services is grumpy, disgruntled and disillusioned consumers of those services, and who can blame them?  I last spoke on this issue in the House in 2002 and I could easily have recycled that speech today.  My colleagues and I predicted much of what is happening now.  We also pointed to all the actions that could and should be taken to make the post office much more than a facility for posting letters.  What became of the proposal to provide Internet caf&eacute;s?  What progress has been made in terms of computerisation?  Post offices could provide many modern community services and facilities but such services are largely unavailable locally.</P>

	<P>At least we will not fight over it.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>That is true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>In deciding on appeals there must be independence. In an appeals process in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the appellant is informed that it is an independent process.  That puts the appellant at ease as he or she knows there will be fair play.  The tribunals <Col N="1907"/>of inquiry are fully independent of what they are investigating.  The independence of an appeals board ensures both sides have trust in the process.</P>
        <P>In the nursing home subvention scheme, if an appeal is to be heard by a member of the HSE, it will put the appellant under much pressure.  He or she will be appealing a decision by the HSE to a HSE staff member.  Such a process does not occur in the normal appeals processes in other State agencies.  I cannot see the logic behind this provision.  A staff member of the HSE hearing an appeal against its own decision does not allow for transparency in the system.  In many applications for nursing home subvention, the individuals concerned have reached the end of a very difficult process.  Integrity in terms of the appeal is of the utmost importance.  It would be easier for the Minister to provide that the tribunal would be overseen by an independent person.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment, otherwise there will not be transparency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment seeks to ensure a member of the staff of the HSE does not adjudicate in the event of an appeal presenting.  That is a reasonable proposition.  As the previous speaker said, what other instance can the Minister of State give us where an appeal is conducted directly by the agency which made the initial determination?  It does not stand up.  It is not the case in D&rsquo;Olier House and it should not be the case in the appeals process <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the entitlement to a nursing home subvention or the extent of such support that any dependent older citizen would need.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is very important to point out that the amendment should go further.  It refers to an independent person.  The Bill refers to a person who may be an employee of the executive, but what of the need for specific training and for real skills, for the ability to be open to the difficulties experienced by older people?  Members have given many examples of these during the debate.  There are very serious and often negative consequences not only for the senior citizen, the applicant party, but also for his or her family.  The appeals process should not be heard by a person just plucked out of the staff of the executive, as the presentation suggests is allowable.  Neither should it just be an independent person.  The person involved must be qualified with the required insight into the difficulties of life for so many people who find themselves in this situation.  It is not good enough just to comply with guidelines or to consider any written or oral objections, to make a decision as is required of the holder of the position in paragraph (<i>c</i>) and to send a copy of the decision to the relevant applicant and the executive.  The legislation should be far more specific in terms of the person or persons who should carry out the appeals function.  That is a <Col N="1908"/>weakness in the text of the Bill and in the amendment.</P>
        <P>The amendment, however, would make a significant improvement to the Bill.  If people are to participate in an appeals process, they must have confidence in the system.  Otherwise, how can they ever accept an outcome that is adverse to their understanding of their position?  It is very important that this is taken on board and that the Minister of State does not go through this entire exercise with a &ldquo;no, no&rdquo; position &mdash; I did not add a third &ldquo;no&rdquo; because I will not put him in the Thatcher mould just yet.  She always had three &ldquo;no&rsquo;s&rdquo;.  I am being nice to Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, particularly given what is involved in this legislation which I find so objectionable.</P>

	<P>As Deputy Wall said, it is high time the Minister said yes for a change.  Deputy McManus&rsquo;s amendment seeks independence in the adjudication of any decision where an appeal presents.  I hope the Minister will give us a change of answer on this occasion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the other speakers on this amendment, without which the legislation is weak, faulty and flawed.  The strength of any legislation or system which deals directly with the public, and where a decision can affect their lives to the extent to which this legislation can, is an appeal system.  The integrity of the entire system, not just the appeal system, is determined by the degree to which the appeal system is independent.  If the system is not independent it becomes a self-serving exercise.  What else can happen but a repeat of the original decision?  In this situation many people are vulnerable, under stress and pressure.  They have worked all their lives and given their best to the country and society.  At the end of that, the best we can come up with is an appeal system whereby, if the person is lucky and the appeals officer is in a good mood on the particular day, a favourable decision might be reached.  On the basis of the decision originally coming from the same Department, what is likely to happen in the event of an appeal?  Will that appeals officer overturn that decision?  Will he or she overturn 50% of the decisions?  There is no chance of that.  Will he or she overturn all the decisions?  There is absolutely no chance of that.  If that could happen we would have different legislation in the first place and a different provision in the Bill.</P>
        <P>There is an urgent necessity to take on board this amendment, which will give the Bill some kind of integrity and an appearance of fairness to all, particularly those people with whom we have all dealt.  Over the years, like every Member of this House, the Minister has dealt with families in stressful situations faced with the type of scenario anticipated in this legislation, under which they <Col N="1909"/>will not have a compassionate response and institution to go to in the event of a decision being made.  We have all seen decisions that have put individual households in virtual penury almost at the end of their days.  There is so much money floating around this country.  There is virtually money to burn, and in some parts of the country it has been burned.  An abundance of money is coming in at such a rate that even the Department of Finance was unable to count it in the last few days until the last minute.  How have we arrived at the situation whereby although the Government has that kind of money in its pocket, there are people who are vulnerable and under stress, who have one eye on the clock and the other on the bank account, wondering whether the decision will go against them?  If the decision goes against them, they wonder what will happen to their appeal, who the appeals officer will be and to what extent they can depend on that appeals officer returning a decision in accord with their circumstances.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I am amazed that we are discussing a Bill that will allow the HSE to seize the homes of elderly people and sell them if their income is &euro;5 above the old age pension.  That is the thrust of this Bill.  To compound matters we are dealing with the appeals system that might be available.  The principle of the independence of an appeal or a judicial decision is enshrined in many pieces of legislation.  If the Minister were bothered he could see that everybody agrees we made a serious mistake on this matter when we established the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board, which allowed the Garda to examine complaints against itself.  This was ineffective and unacceptable, and fell into disuse arising from the fact that it was not independent.  At last the Government is doing something about that, and it will have to do something about this.  This type of legislation whereby somebody who is the cause of a grievance will have a peer from his or her own organisation dealing with the grievance will not give any sense of fairness.  Even if the appeal officer came to a correct decision and the complainant had no case in the appeal, there would still be a grievance due to the perception that an appeal officer from the organisation that made the original decision could not be objective or fair.  If the Minister of State does not have the authority to do this, he should refer it to his senior Minister and introduce an amendment similar to this one on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  The one requirement for an appeal system is credibility.  People must believe they are getting justice and there must be a sense of objectivity and fairness.  I do not say the members of the executive who will be appointed will not be fair.  While some of them may be influenced, most will be fair.  There <Col N="1910"/>is much integrity among civil servants.  However people whose appeals are unsuccessful will not believe this.  They will be suspicious and lack confidence when embarking on the appeals process if they know the appeals officer is from the organisation against which they are appealing.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether the Minister has the power to make decisions.  His demeanour and responses on this Bill suggest he does not have that power.  We have seen some Ministers and Ministers of State make decisions on amendments that were influenced by debate.  They faced down the advice they were given on the basis of what was right.  Despite strong presentations and views from the Opposition, he has not made such decisions.  We have seen the independent investigation of issues by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and we deal with them regularly, as the Minister does from his constituency.  Deputy Stagg has referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board and the Minister knows the difficulties that have arisen, not regarding the decisions of the body but the perception that it was part of the institution.</P>
        <P>Would the Minister take courage on this decision?  It will not require an extensive change.  His Bill specifies the appeals officer may be a member of the HSE.  If he changes this to specify that it may not be a member of the HSE it will be independent.  The Minister made his mark politically some time ago.  Now he should make his mark again and say it will be independent, since under the Bill it can be independent.  He should not allow influences beyond his control to be exerted on this issue, which might result in cases not being adjudicated on independently for reasons he may not like.  He might not be in control of this area ten years hence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  The general principle is that an appeals system should be independent and seen to be independent.  People should have confidence in it and should feel that the system is fair, allows them to advance their point of view and is overseen by someone without a hidden agenda.  The current position suggests that will not be the case.  The Bill is black and white.  It guarantees that people who have worked their entire lives, bought a council house and helped to build the Celtic tiger will be forced to sell their homes.   Even if Almighty God was the appeals officer he would not be fair, nor seen to be fair, nor could he be.</P>

	<P>I put a question to the Minister of State last week.  I know two brothers on non-contributory old age pensions.  Both are medical card holders and local authority tenants.  Both have applied for public beds in long stay institutions but the beds are not available.  The maximum subvention they can receive is &euro;240 per week. <Col N="1911"/> When this is added to the pension each is &euro;100 short per week.  What should they do?</P>

This allows the HSE to retain an employee to consider appeals in particular instances where it proves difficult to recruit a person outside the executive with suitable qualifications.  Any appeals officer must act independently in hearing an appeal and act in accordance with natural justice, as provided for in the Bill.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Is c&uacute;is &aacute;thais dom an Bille t&aacute;bhachtach seo a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id na D&aacute;la.  The British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill 2006 comprises a short technical amendment to the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999.  The amendment concerns one of the North-South bodies, namely the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, which was established to manage the EU&rsquo;s PEACE and INTERREG cross-Border funds.  Next year, under the new EU financial perspectives, there <Col N="1916"/>will be changes in the funding structures for the period 2007 to 2013.  While the PEACE programme will continue much as before, the policy areas and objectives currently covered by the INTERREG programme are being transferred to a new EU territorial co-operation objective.  As a result, some of the terms currently used in the 1999 Act to describe the SEUPB&rsquo;s remit will become out of date on 1 January 2007.</P>
        <P>It was always the Government&rsquo;s clear intention that the SEUPB should continue in its role in managing the EU funds.  The British Government shares this intention.  The two Governments confirmed this shared understanding through an exchange of letters, signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Hain, MP, on 25 July of this year.  These letters <Col N="1917"/>make it clear that it was the joint intention of the two Governments that certain terms used in the 1999 agreement, such as the phrase &ldquo;community initiatives&rdquo;, would include &ldquo;successor, substitute and equivalent Programmes, building on the same substantive objectives, priorities, policy areas and activities&rdquo;.  This exchange of letters constituted an international agreement and this Bill gives domestic legal effect to that important agreement.</P>
        <P>As the House will be aware, the Good Friday Agreement provided the basis for a balanced political settlement in Northern Ireland.  It recognised the importance of relationships between North and South and between east and west.  At meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council, Ministers from both jurisdictions come together to undertake &ldquo;consultation, co-operation and action&rdquo; on matters of mutual interest, to the benefit of the people, North and South.</P>
        <P>The agreement also provided for co-operation in a number of specific sectors, to be progressed by new North-South Implementation Bodies, commonly referred to as the North-South bodies.  However, since the suspension of the institutions in 2002, the North-South Ministerial Council has not been able to meet and the bodies have been unable to operate in a manner that would allow them to reach their full potential.</P>
        <P>The Irish Government has consistently sought to bolster and protect the North-South bodies.  In spite of the restrictions imposed on them, the bodies have continued to pursue co-operation and deliver important public services to the people, both North and South.  Their achievements range from the Food Safety Promotion Board&rsquo;s eye-catching safe food campaigns to the work of Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster Scots Agency in promoting our island&rsquo;s cultures and languages.  The Loughs Agency is ensuring the development of the aquaculture industry in the Carlingford and Foyle loughs, Intertrade Ireland is stimulating business links between the North and South and Waterways Ireland, the largest North-South body, continues to manage one of our island&rsquo;s most important recreational and tourism assets, namely, our canals and waterways.  We saw in the news just today how Tourism Ireland has once again managed to increase visitor numbers to the island as a whole, making this year a record year for tourism in our country.</P>
        <P>The SEUPB&rsquo;s success is all the more remarkable given the constraints imposed on it by suspension.  Since its establishment in 1999, it has acted as a conduit for over &euro;1 billion to 12 counties, both North and South.  In practical terms, this means that some 6,500 projects have received funding from the SEUPB.</P>
        <P>The PEACE programme in particular has provided assistance on the ground to support reconciliation and to help the region develop a more peaceful and stable society.  The INTERREG programme, for its part, has helped create genuine cross-Border partnerships and has <Col N="1918"/>greatly improved the economic and social landscape of the Border region.</P>
        <P>The SEUPB is highly regarded throughout the European Union for its management of the EU funds.  It is used as a model of best practice.  It has met the demanding financial targets set by the EU each year.  The impact of the funds that the body manages can be seen throughout Northern Ireland and in the six Border counties, namely, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.  The distinctively European character of the funding brings a special added value.  By highlighting aspects of our shared identity, it facilitates programmes on a cross-community and cross-Border basis, which might not have been possible otherwise.</P>
        <P>In promoting peace and prosperity, the EU, through the SEUPB, has made an important contribution to the peace process.  While much has been achieved with EU funding to date, there is no doubt that the support of the European Union will continue to be very important as we move forward.  We are at an important juncture in the peace process in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The agreement reached at St. Andrews in October last sets out a clear way forward for all of the northern political parties to commit to the full operation of stable power-sharing government in Northern Ireland and the restoration of all of the institutions envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement.  It provides for full support for policing and the criminal justice institutions, including the Policing Board.</P>
        <P>The British Government has introduced legislation that provides for devolved government to be restored in Northern Ireland in March of 2007 and for the electoral endorsement of the St. Andrews Agreement by way of elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly in March of 2007.  Both Governments have made it clear, however, that an election will only take place if the parties are working constructively towards participation in a power-sharing Executive by 26 March of next year.  We have seen signs of progress towards power-sharing in recent weeks.  We have had clear indications that, subject to the outcome of the election and other necessary conditions, Dr. Ian Paisley and Mr. Martin McGuinness would be the First and Deputy First Ministers, respectively, on restoration next March.</P>
        <P>This week, the parties are sitting together in the Assembly and at the Programme for Government Committee discussing their policy priorities and the practical issues facing Northern Ireland, such as education, the economy, local government reform, policing and justice.  Dr. Paisley and Mr. Adams have each spoken of their personal commitment to making progress towards restoration by next March.  The Government believes this will require real leadership from both the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in.  The DUP must show that it is ready to share power with Nationalists under the arrangements laid down in the Good Friday Agreement.  That means direct engagement with <Col N="1919"/>Sinn F&eacute;in as its prospective partner in Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Movement is required from Sinn F&eacute;in on policing.  Both the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, have said they would like to see Sinn F&eacute;in call its Ard-Fheis to deal with this issue sooner rather than later, in any event by January next.  For its part, the Irish Government will continue to work in close partnership with the British Government, as well as with all the parties, to secure our overriding priority, that is, the restoration of power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland and full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Only full restoration will allow the North-South bodies, including the SEUPB, reach their full potential and further develop North-South co-operation in their respective areas.  Restoration of the devolved institutions will also allow meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council to resume.  Government Ministers will once again be able to sit down with locally elected Northern Irish Ministers to advance North-South co-operation for our mutual benefit.</P>
        <P>The Government has sought to give a strong impetus to North-South co-operation.  Both the Irish and British Governments recognise that there are significant benefits and advantages in working together.  For example, the two Governments have recently launched an ambitious agenda for strengthening economic co-operation.  This included a number of ground-breaking joint initiatives, such as further collaboration in research and development and a new targeted approach to enterprise training, as well as to identifying labour market needs, on an all-island basis.  We have also agreed to pool our resources in trade promotion, opening up trade missions to businesses across the island and placing the overseas offices of Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland at the disposal of companies, North and South.  Trade missions to India and Canada have already included companies from both parts of this island.</P>
        <P>The Governments have identified co-operation on the planning and delivery of infrastructure as the key to maximising returns on the major investments being made North and South.  Greater co-operation will also help ensure more balanced regional development, especially in the Border region.  In this regard, the all-island dimension will be an important horizontal theme of the Government&rsquo;s next national development plan for the period 2007 to 2013.</P>
        <P>The Governments are committed to working together to create a more integrated and regionally balanced road network, enhancing key routes between the major urban centres on this island.  In addition, the Government is moving ahead to re-open the remaining few cross-Border routes, closed as a result of the Troubles.  Some significant progress has already been achieved, for example, in the upgrading of the Dublin-<Col N="1920"/>Belfast road.  We have also agreed with the British Government to jointly invest in City of Derry Airport.</P>
        <P>The Irish Government is committed to taking forward plans for the restoration of the Ulster Canal to create a further major inland waterway for the Border region, similar to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell project, which we executed in the 1990s.  In the energy sector, the single electricity market will be operational in 2007.  Plans are advanced for the development of further interconnection of our electricity and gas supply systems on a North-South and east-west basis.  The two Governments have agreed to work together to maximise the contribution of renewable and sustainable energy to the future energy needs of this island.</P>
        <P>The Government also believes that key public services, such as health and education, can be delivered more efficiently and effectively on an all-island basis and will be advancing co-operation in this area also.  This Government will continue to take these initiatives forward with the British Government in the coming months but looks forward in particular to working with Northern Irish Ministers, in the context of restoration, which will also allow the North-South bodies to become fully operational once again to the benefit of all.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the Government wishes to ensure that the SEUPB can continue its strong role in managing the EU funds that have been so important in promoting peace and prosperity throughout the Northern region.  In recognition of this key role, the Government is ensuring that the SEUPB&rsquo;s future remit is clear.  This Government believes that the SEUPB and the other North-South bodies will have an important role to play, in ensuring that the economic benefits of the hoped for new dispensation are widely enjoyed, not only in Northern Ireland, but throughout this island.</P>
        <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, I have worked closely with the special EU programmes body.  I have seen at first hand how its work has improved the quality of life of thousands of people, bringing them together, across communities and borders.  I have also participated in the very difficult Strand II talks and have worked to strengthen North-South co-operation and the North-South bodies.</P>
        <P>I wish to commend the work of this unique body, its chief executive, Mr. Colgan, and all of its executive staff and I commend this important Bill to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to share time with Deputy Crawford.  The purpose of the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill 2006 is to amend the provisions of the original Act relating to the special European Union programmes body which was set up in 1999.  This body was established with the specific purpose of putting into action for communities in Northern Ireland the inter<Col N="1921"/>national support that was offered by the friends of Ireland overseas.</P>
        <P>I welcome this Bill.  I accept that, very unfortunately, for the people of Northern Ireland it has been some time since they had normality in many ways, including in their political structures.  While the people of Northern Ireland do not have political normality, they have experienced an increase in prosperity in business across all communities because of the relative peace that has existed there for the past decade.  Businesses, determined community leaders and many individuals in Northern Ireland have been the driving forces behind this prosperity.</P>
        <P>We must do anything we can to support further economic development in Northern Ireland.  The people and their representatives rightly associate economic prosperity with political stability, and<i> vice versa</i>, and recognise that it is a real and tangible dividend of political stability.  The INTERREG and PEACE programmes have played a major role in bringing about political stability.  A total of 6,000 community-based projects have benefited from the &euro;868 million spent on the PEACE programme.  These projects have had a positive effect on all communities.  I understand that &euro;182 million has been spent through the INTERREG programme, making a positive difference to people&rsquo;s lives.  This Bill will allow the continuation and expansion of these programmes.</P>
        <P>The Food Safety Promotion Board, InterTrade Ireland and Waterways Ireland have done excellent work while playing their part in promoting prosperity in Northern Ireland, with positive benefits for the whole island.  I welcome the St. Andrews Agreement and the progress made in recent times.  All participants must see the big prize at the end of a time of great frustration.  Prosperity can be achieved only by taking the next step to have the Northern institutions up and running, with all political parties co-operating in a normal political atmosphere.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to those of all shades of political opinion who have been involved in resolving the conflict in Northern Ireland, especially members of my own party, including former taoisigh Liam Cosgrave, Garret FitzGerald and John Bruton who were involved respectively in negotiating the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Framework Document.  These agreements have been central to the whole process.</P>
        <P>My party, in Opposition, has supported this Government&rsquo;s efforts to achieve the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Fine Gael supported the Government in the negotiations that led to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  We campaigned vigorously throughout the country for this agreement to be accepted in the referendum that followed.  The principles that underpin the Good Friday Agreement are those that Fine Gael has espoused for many years: devolution, power-sharing, mutual <Col N="1922"/>respect and understanding and the absolute and total rejection of violence as a means to achieving political objectives.</P>
        <P>Since the Good Friday Agreement was negotiated, signed and endorsed by the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland in the referendum, Fine Gael has supported all efforts to see the agreement being fully implemented.  The Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, has visited Northern Ireland several times to meet with political leaders and encourage compromise, co-operation and progress on this issue.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the progress made at St. Andrews.  Although the original deadline has not been met, all parties appear to recognise that full and unconditional support for the police and the justice system is essential for any durable settlement.  Progress on this issue must be made soon.  We should remember that the St. Andrews Agreement is an agreement between two governments and that reaching agreement between the parties is now an even greater challenge.  I reiterate my party&rsquo;s support for the St. Andrews Agreement and express the hope that all difficulties can be overcome before the retirement of Tony Blair as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and before the next general election here.  I ask the Government to announce its programme of investment as a result of the St. Andrews Agreement as the British Government has already outlined its proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.  It may not be the most important Bill to come before the House but it is essential to allow the funding from the PEACE and INTERREG programmes to continue.  This funding has been important but could have been more so if it had been additional as it was intended to be.  I make no apology for that criticism.  We need a great deal of support in the Border where many towns, such as Clones where I went to school, still experience many difficulties.  My colleague from Donegal, Deputy Keaveney, knows that because of unemployment and so on, the Border area still needs a great deal of support.  It is important that any funding that comes from the St. Andrews Agreement is shared not just with the Six Counties but also with Donegal, Leitrim and Cavan-Monaghan which have gained little from the recent prosperity in the country.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said that the Government is committed to taking forward plans for the restoration of the Ulster Canal.  I welcome that because it will be a major step in cross-Border, cross-party and community involvement.  It has brought the communities north and south of the Border together in a way that I have never before seen them united.  If this can be done quickly it will help to cement the situation.  Until Waterways Ireland is back working as it should, which depends on the full settlement of the St. Andrews Agreement and, in turn, the Good Friday Agreement, progress will be slow.</P><Col N="1923"/>
        <P>There is a need for movement in the DUP on power sharing.  From meetings I have had with some DUP councillors and MLAs, I accept they have anxieties.  However, if we go on like this forever, we will never see an end to it.  The time is nigh and the opportunity may not come again for quite some time.  I say to them in this House &mdash; they may not like to hear it coming from here &mdash; that it is vital they take hold of power sharing with both hands.</P>
        <P>I say with the same sincerity to the Sinn F&eacute;in Party that policing must be dealt with in a proper way.  We will not have the society we would like unless there is a proper police force that is acceptable to and has the involvement of all concerned.  I urge Sinn F&eacute;in to get on with the job.  I accept it is difficult for that party also, but if we all stand back from our difficulties nothing will ever happen.  It is crucial that these two issues are resolved in the next few months.  Both Mr. Gerry Adams on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in and Mr. Ian Paisley on behalf of the DUP stated they want to be involved.  The only way we can be sure of that is if, in fact, they do get involved.</P>
        <P>I was interested to hear the reference in the speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the energy sector.  Regardless of the agreement, this is an issue that must be tackled by the Government.  I visited Scottish Power with my colleagues on a sub-committee of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body last week.  I was most impressed with the efforts it is making towards alternative energy now and in the future.  It is aiming at having 54% of energy requirements provided from alternative energy sources by 2020.  Scotland is a long way ahead of us.  If we are to benefit from cheaper energy through our links with Europe, we must move ahead in every possible way in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is almost impossible for a company like Wellmans in Mullagh on the Cavan-Meath border to pay &euro;1.10 per KW hour for electricity, compared to &euro;0.62 in its factory in the Netherlands and &euro;0.55 at its factory in France.  If we are to be properly linked to Europe and have a genuine energy programme, we should at least be on a par with our European neighbours.  Otherwise, we will lose more of our manufacturing industry than is the case to date.</P>
        <P>We need a genuine effort to get industry to the Border regions.  In this regard, the Ulster Canal is important, but so too is the fact that, at long last, a reasonable road is being constructed from Dublin to Monaghan town.  If that is to be totally successful, we must use the funds that have been made available to go right through to Derry, the fourth largest city in this country.  Such infrastructure is most important for the viability of industry, tourism, etc.</P>
        <P>I recently spoke to a lady from north Monaghan who is aiming to provide 150 jobs in Glaslough.  She hopes to provide 150 high quality tourism beds in her centre based around the <Col N="1924"/>castle and an equestrian centre.  That is the type of spirit we want to see in evidence but it must be supported by the Government and cross-Border co-operation.  The necessary road structures must be put in place so that when this local industry is fully in place, she can be sure people can travel there in comfort.</P>
        <P>The road from Belfast to Dungannon was finished 20 years ago but it never went further west.  The road from Monaghan to Derry has been improved a little but it still requires work.  It is time for the Government to provide money.  Perhaps in the budget tomorrow we will hear what is being given towards the peace process in Northern Ireland.  It is vital that an announcement about such an allocation would be made soon.  The purpose of the funding should be clearly set out and it should be earmarked to serve not just the Six Counties but the Border counties also.  Without that type of commitment, we in the Border areas will remain in the doldrums in terms of tourism and industry.</P>
        <P>To all intents and purposes, the IDA has not visited County Monaghan in recent years.  There has been no effort to get industry into that area.  It is vital that we use the final element of the peace process to ensure that situation is rectified.  A marvellous announcement was made in recent years regarding County Cavan but it did not materialise.  This opportunity cannot be missed so that we can look forward to a bright future.  I commend and support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party welcomes this Bill and is happy to support its passage through the Oireachtas.  The creation of the North-South Implementation Bodies was a crucial part of the Good Friday Agreement.  That Agreement was not merely a political contract between the political parties in Northern Ireland and the British and Irish Governments on the administration of Northern Ireland.  It also laid the foundations for increased North-South co-operation for the mutual social and economic benefit of all.</P>
        <P>The North-South Implementation Bodies were key in this regard.  Their success is crucial in ensuring that those areas identified for specific co-operation and day-to-day action between the Irish Government and Northern Ireland are developed for the benefit of both parts of the island.  Given the economic growth experienced in the South over the past decade and the potential of the North&rsquo;s economy to expand and develop further in the context of a functioning and stable Assembly and Executive, the capacity of North-South co-operation to succeed is endless.</P>
        <P>Moreover, North-South co-operation and the bodies themselves are not simply about delivering for the economy.  They also have a key role to play in regard to the development of good relations and partnership between the two parts of the island.  To quote Co-operation Ireland: <Col N="1925"/>&ldquo;The promotion of effective North-South co-operation is an integral part of building peace on the island of Ireland.&rdquo;  For that reason alone, the Labour Party supports this Bill and any effort that assists the work of these bodies.  However, we do not shy away from the fact that the North-South Implementation Bodies themselves currently exist on a care and maintenance basis.  Their establishment, work and future is dependent on the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
        <P>Suspension of the Assembly and Executive since the autumn of 2002 has undoubtedly impeded progress towards North-South development.  The intervening period &mdash; years that should have been used for the bodies to bed down and embark on important work in regard to spatial planning, tourism and economic development &mdash; has instead been full of frustration, as repeated political initiatives to re-establish the institutions they require to fulfil their mandate have ended in failure.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is the Labour Party&rsquo;s sincere hope that the latest initiative, the St. Andrews Agreement, and the subsequent timetable towards restoration, succeeds.  Subsequent to the return of the institutions, the North-South agenda so crucial for the future must be put centre stage and prioritised by any new Executive.  Unfortunately, the positive view of increased North-South co-operation and of the Implementation Bodies themselves is not shared by all political parties in Northern Ireland.  In recent years the Democratic Unionist Party has had the bodies in its sights in its repeated attempts to renegotiate certain elements of the Good Friday Agreement.  This has not just been a matter of political expediency.  It has not sought mere minor changes to North-South bodies as cover for accepting the Agreement.  Rather, it has specifically sought to diminish the powers and scope of the bodies and to challenge the basis on which they continue to function.</P>
     
        <P>In this regard I express some concern about the Governments&rsquo; attitude to the DUP&rsquo;s agenda.  Ever since early 2004 when the DUP published its North-South, east-west document on strands two and three of the Good Friday Agreement, the DUP&rsquo;s aims have been clear.  In that document it stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">We opposed the all-Ireland Implementation Bodies, amongst other things on the basis that they were not accountable to the Assembly and were not value for money for the taxpayer.  We opposed the overall set of proposals because they were mainly driven by the desire to achieve Irish unity.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the subsequent negotiations that led in the first instance to the December 2004 comprehensive agreement, and ultimately to the St. Andrews Agreement two months ago, the DUP sought concession after concession to make the North-South Ministerial Council and the implemen<Col N="1926"/>tation bodies increasingly responsible to the Assembly and the Executive.</P>
        <P>While accountability and responsibility would be crucial for important decisions on North-South issues, under the DUP&rsquo;s plan anyone working in the implementation bodies would effectively first have to seek Executive or Assembly permission for the purchase of a paper clip.  As Peter Robinson said in his exchange with Northern Ireland Minister, David Hanson, in Westminster two weeks ago, during a debate on the legislation arising from the St. Andrews Agreement:</P>
        <P LI="1">Will the Minister confirm that the Bill will mean that any decision of the North-South Ministerial Council, which is cross-cutting by nature, or any other matter involving relationships with the Republic of Ireland that are affected by external relations, will have to go to the Executive for agreement?  Without such approval, will Ministers have authority to take such a decision? Would any such ministerial decision be valid?</P>
        <P FLI="0">All this is designed to make the work of the North-South bodies cumbersome, unwieldy and impractical.  This would enable the DUP to argue that they are impossible to work and are in need of reform.  It would then argue that North-South co-operation should only function on the basis of <i>ad hoc</i> consultation between Ministers in Stormont and Dublin on a case-by-case basis. There should be no superstructure, no formal institutions to promote North-South co-operation and development, in short, no implementation bodies at all in the DUP&rsquo;s plans.</P>
        <P>What is most worrying about all this is Minister Hanson&rsquo;s response to Peter Robinson&rsquo;s questions.  In reply he said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The honourable Gentleman also asked the Secretary of State to confirm that, by virtue of the arrangements put in place by the Bill, details relating to the North-South Ministerial Council or any matter involving relationships with the Republic of Ireland will require Executive approval.  I can confirm that such matters will be referred to under the ministerial code that applied until suspension, and will require Executive agreement.  Under the arrangements provided for in the Bill, decisions taken without Executive agreement would not be legitimate and would be open to legal challenge.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I would have hoped that such a response from Secretary of State Peter Hain&rsquo;s second in command would have severely disturbed the Irish Government.</P>
        <P>It is evident from this reply that the British Government has conceded major ground to the DUP in its efforts to make unworkable any decision taken by the implementation bodies or the North-South Ministerial Council with which it may disagree.  Unfortunately, over recent weeks I have heard very little from the Government on <Col N="1927"/>this issue.  I afford the Government this opportunity to clarify its position.  Has the Government raised this matter with the British Government?  What was its reaction to Minister Hanson&rsquo;s comments?  Does it agree with the analysis that this represents a clear attempt by the DUP to damage the North-South agenda?  More importantly, what efforts is the Government making to prevent the DUP from achieving its aim?</P>
        <P>There is a real fear that in the period between now and the Assembly elections scheduled for March, if we get that far, the DUP will seek further concessions on North-South issues.  To prevent this, I appeal to the Government to mount a robust defence of the implementation bodies and the North-South Ministerial Council to ensure that this vital area of co-operation and development is protected so that it can thrive in the future.</P>
        <P>We must not forget that just as the DUP has sought to inflict as much damage on the North-South bodies as possible, Sinn F&eacute;in could have protected the bodies more strongly.  When did we last hear anything from Sinn F&eacute;in representatives about their importance?  Perhaps that will be rectified in Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s contribution.  So far it has concentrated on its own interest rather than the wider public good.  There have been delays in decommissioning, the ending of all paramilitary and criminal activity and now towards supporting the PSNI.  In that regard I hope that as Sinn F&eacute;in approaches decision time on taking its seats on the policing board, it will not merely seek to win further concessions from the two Governments for itself but rather that it will ask the British Government to resist DUP demands to capitulate on the North-South bodies.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to some specifics in North-South co-operation.  In education, which is of particular interest in my role as spokesperson on education and science, there is huge potential for co-operation.  Recently I was involved in presenting digital schools awards.  The particular school in Limerick had a digital relationship with a school in Northern Ireland.  The information technology area provides major opportunities for co-operation in education between North and South.  I was involved also with a conference in Dundalk on educational disadvantage organised by a school principal in a disadvantaged school in Dublin.  Representatives from political parties North and South were present, as well as officials from the education and library boards in the North and from the Department of Education and Science in the South.  It was a positive experience.  Working groups have been set up as a result of that conference to continue the co-operation between North and South in that area of educational disadvantage.</P>
        <P>I support what has been said about Waterways Ireland.  Given that I am at the bottom of the line in Limerick, I have a great interest in the development of the Ulster Canal and in making <Col N="1928"/>the connection from the North, through my constituency, to the sea.  There is enormous potential for the implementation bodies to have a positive effect on life in Northern Ireland and in the South and I hope they will be able to operate.  I hope also that the points I have made, especially about the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, will be taken on board and that there will be a positive response to these bodies.</P>

	<P>This Bill, which makes provision for a slight but important adjustment to the British Irish Agreement Act 1999, is welcome.  The 1999 Act was one of the fruits to flow from the Good Friday Agreement which, at the time, constituted an historic compromise between Nationalism and Unionism.  The majority of Irish people on this island endorsed the Agreement because it afforded them the opportunity to transform the face of Ireland for the better after three decades of conflict.</P>
        <P>The Good Friday Agreement forged between the North&rsquo;s political parties and the Dublin and London Governments, would pave the way for an end to violence and civil unrest.  The North-South dimension was of crucial importance, best exemplified by the establishment and successful operation of cross-Border bodies.  Co-operation for mutual benefit has already taken place in a number of areas: tourism, agriculture, infrastructure and health.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In tourism, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is successfully promoting the entire island as a single destination.  That is welcome.  Attractions such as the Shannon-Erne Waterway and a fully restored Ulster Canal could be marketed on an all-island basis.  All the waterways are under the aegis of Waterways Ireland.  We have heard about the restoration of the canal in a number of contributions.  It has many benefits.  We have witnessed the benefits the Shannon-Erne Waterway has brought to County Leitrim, which is a place in which to live.  It has brought much tourism potential to Blacklion and Belturbet in Cavan.  A spur should be brought to Clones and we should get on with the job.  There is no reason not to do it.  People talk about impediments.  With a will to drive it on both sides and co-operation in a Border area, the benefits that would flow to a town such as Clones would be nothing short of fantastic.</P><Col N="1929"/>
        <P>In the cross-Border body, CAWT, Co-operation and Working Together, there is potential for more meaningful co-operation than at present.  A large tranche of the population lives on either side of the Border.  Some 12 counties and up to 1 million people are involved.  Those areas have been denuded of hospital services and have been neglected by both central governments in Belfast and Dublin.  The situation in Tyrone is similar to that in Monaghan &mdash; it has no hospital and services are being removed.  Accident and emergency services are provided at both ends of the N2 from Dublin to Derry, with no accident and emergency unit in between.  While one exists on the coast in Drogheda and another on the coast in Derry, the current situation is unacceptable if we are to look after people fairly.  We need a regional trauma centre in that Border area where people could be brought and stabilised in the event of an accident.  The Cavan-Monaghan region has a large number of accident black spots and rather than having a regional trauma centre in a regional centre of excellence we could have a standalone regional trauma centre.  We should consider such matters, as they would give more meaning to the concept of cross-Border co-operation.</P>
        <P>Under the special EU programme, INTERREG will be most affected by the terms of the Bill.  Coming under a new EU territorial co-operation objective, INTERREG programmes have made a significant contribution to waterways infrastructure in Ireland.  The development of the cross-Border waterway links the island&rsquo;s two major rivers, the result of which is that one can travel by boat from Belfast to visit our colleagues in Limerick.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Is dea-sc&eacute;al &eacute; seo.  This is a good news story and it is great to be able to welcome the Bill.  It is welcomed by the Green Party both North and South and indeed east and west on both islands.  I have just returned from Belfast where we signed an agreement to further develop co-operation in line with the Good Friday Agreement, strands 1, 2 and 3.  On that basis I am familiar with the great benefits of pursuing co-operation that is practical, fair and mutually beneficial.  This applies to all the people on this island and the neighbouring island.</P>
        <P>This is an urgent matter.  The Minister of State alluded to some questions on renewable energy.  Ardnacrusha is familiar to Members of this House and particularly to Deputies from Limerick.  Given that we are consuming energy requiring a new Ardnacrusha every six months it begs the question as to whether we are serious about facing our futures together on the island.  This is a very practical consideration.  If we are to avoid nuclear energy we need to develop the potential of offshore renewable energy sources in particular, North and South.  I was in Blackrock, Dundalk, supporting an offshore wind farm development because of the urgency of the <Col N="1930"/>matter with which we are dealing.  Practical lessons can be learned from the North from, for example, marine conservation in Portaferry.  We are trying to build a similar centre in Balbriggan in my constituency.  Considerable co-operation already exists and the Bill gives some structure to it.</P>
        <P>There is also a question of fairness.  While it may not be known &mdash; it certainly needs to be known &mdash; because so much petrol is bought South of the Border, this jurisdiction will pay &euro;50 million per annum in Kyoto penalties for carbon dioxide emissions discharged North of the Border.  This begs the question as to whether we will get our act together on the island on harmonisation to mutual advantage.  Likewise, north of the Border the authorities are paying &euro;44 million per year for illegally dumped rubbish which comes from the South.  We are discussing a bread and butter financial issue as well as a peaceful and sustainable future for the island.</P>
        <P>On the mutual benefit towards which we both need to work, it is somewhat ironic and potentially tragic that having come through a period of such turmoil, violence and tragedy, the British Government has announced a plan to reinvigorate and relaunch a new programme of nuclear weaponry.  People, both North and South, need to unite on that front because it threatens us both.  It would be ironic and tragic if we were to leave behind one warmongering episode and replace it with another.</P>
        <P>I hope we will now be able to have the register of persons considered to be unsafe to work with children &mdash; another form of violence we want ended.  That register has been stalled because the institutions have not been operational.  I hope it will be developed along with other issues, too numerous to mention, by ensuring we have proper consultation with all sides of the House.  The Opposition parties have been very patient, understanding and forgiving of the Government&rsquo;s secrecy on how it deals with the matters.  If we are to move beyond a sectarian basis of a settlement in the North, all parties in this House need to be consulted in working to reach solutions in the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>While this is a technical Bill, it gives us the opportunity briefly to reflect on the state of the peace process.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in are making every effort to ensure that the inclusive Executive, with a DUP First Minister and a Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy First Minister is established, along with the restoration of the Assembly, the All-Ireland Ministerial Council and the full working of the All-Ireland implementation bodies.</P>
        <P>We are also committed to addressing the issue of policing and in recent days Gerry Adams has set out his willingness to call an Ard-Fheis when the threshold has been crossed to real civic policing in the Six Counties, free of the sectarian and repressive legacy of the past.  Last week&rsquo;s <Col N="1931"/>Oireachtas report on the Barron investigation, which exposed once again the involvement of British forces in collusion, sets out very clearly the need to ensure that there is no role for MI5 in civic policing.  We are continuing to negotiate on this issue with the British Government.  Powers in the areas of justice and policing must also be transferred to the Assembly and the Executive, and it is up to the DUP to accept that principle.  It is just as important as the principle of power sharing.  All of this is work in progress and we will spare no effort to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is restored in full measure.</P>
        <P>The Bill before us is a technical measure to clarify the mandate of the Special EU Programmes Body, one of the All-Ireland bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement.  The other five implementation bodies are InterTrade Ireland, Foras na Gaeilge, the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, the Food Safety Promotion Board and Waterways Ireland.  As a result of the repeated and prolonged suspension of the Good Friday Agreement institutions, these bodies have not achieved their full potential.</P>
        <P>There is frustration in the Border region that the promised peace dividend has not been delivered as expected.  Projects, which are very deliverable and very necessary, have been delayed and blocked.  I welcome signals from the British direct rule Minister with responsibility for Education, Maria Eagle MP, that the All-Ireland Centre of Excellence for Autism at Middletown, County Armagh, is to go ahead.  This project, first initiated under former Education Minister, Martin McGuinness, has been subject to repeated delay by the British.  Similarly, the development of the Ulster Canal has been talked about endlessly with little real action so far from either of the two Governments.</P>
        <P>The Special EU Programmes Body has done much good work in managing and disbursing EU funding in the Six Counties and the Border region.  However, the All-Ireland Ministerial Council should be taking decisions on policies and actions to be implemented by the body.  A principal aim of the SEUPB is to promote cross-Border co-operation through the administration of the cross-Border element of the PEACE programme and the monitoring and promotion of the common chapter in the national development plan and the Northern Ireland Structural Funds plan.  There has been a high commitment of investment funds through the different programmes that come within the remit of the SEUPB to administer.  Taking into account the percentage of these programme funds which have not been drawn down or taken up by projects, there is little doubt that the SEUPB All-Ireland body has failed in important respects.</P>
        <P>The major opportunities for cross-community and cross-Border development have not been <Col N="1932"/>fully availed of.  Communities have common difficulties in mastering complex application procedures.  There has been a tendency for INTERREG funds, in particular, to be used for infrastructural development, often of a most localised nature &mdash; I refer, for example, to their use in respect of the provision of street lights, roads or bridges and to supplement or even replace local authority and Government funding.  These are projects that should be quite at variance with the objectives relating to the allocation of these funds.  The funds to which I refer should always be in addition to and over and above funding from local and central government sources in respect of this region.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed an increase in the resources available to the SEUPB in order to employ more development and advisory staff who are skilled in bringing forward practical, innovative ideas for developments with economic benefits and community gain and who are well trained in the nature of social economy agencies.  We are not prepared to stand still.  Not only do we want the outstanding aspects of the Good Friday Agreement implemented, we want to see them expanded as the Agreement provides.</P>
        <P>In November 2003, as part of the review of the Good Friday Agreement, Sinn F&eacute;in called for the expansion of the remit of all the current bodies and areas of co-operation, as well as calling for more to be formed.  I hope Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan will note that and the fact that I and my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues have made that call repeatedly.  The Agreement says there could be &ldquo;at least&rdquo; six of each, so there is no bar on the establishment of further such bodies.  The All-Ireland Ministerial Council is allowed to meet to consider this issue, but it only did so on one occasion.</P>
        <P>We asked for extra areas of ministerial co-operation in community development, arts and heritage, public investment and economic co-operation.  In addition, we called for nine further All-Ireland implementation bodies to be formed in respect of energy, the social economy, pollution control, mental health, policing, justice, rural development, further and higher education and telecommunications.  In this peace process, we will not lower our expectations and we will continue to work tirelessly for lasting peace and, as Irish republicans, for reunification.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill, even though the time allocated is extremely limited.  I am disappointed the Bill is being dealt with so late in the evening and that the time allocated to it must be curtailed.  Previous speakers stated it is not an important Bill.  However, in the scheme of my life and in the context of my constituency, it is most significant legislation, short and technical though it may be.</P>
        <P>When one takes the first letter from each of the words &ldquo;British&rdquo;, &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; and &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; <Col N="1933"/>and puts them together, one is left with the word &ldquo;bia&rdquo;, which translates into English as &ldquo;food&rdquo;.  The food to which I refer is the food of nourishment, of nurturing, of peace, of infrastructure, of co-operation, of development and of what the north west deserves.  It has been denied to the area for too many years, possibly for as many as I have been on this earth.  I welcome anything that includes the development of further co-operation and that moves the peace process forward.  I call on those who are involved at any level or who in any way represent an impediment to my region obtaining the development it deserves, to cease what they are doing and deliver the peace the people of the area deserve.</P>
        <P>This new programme includes an element that was not there before in respect of parts of Scotland.  The latter will now have an interaction with Donegal and Northern Ireland that it did not previously enjoy.  Scotland&rsquo;s potential in this regard is being assisted by people in my area.  The Leader company in my constituency worked hard, in co-operation with its partners in Northern Ireland, to ensure the west of Scotland would be included in this programme in the context of INTERREG funding.  I commend Dennis Canavan, a former MP who is now a Member of the Scottish Parliament, for the significant work he did to ensure, through his committee, that this matter was progressed.  I also commend the people we met from the various Departments who assisted us when we brought IRDL and Dennis Canavan and his Scottish counterparts to meetings here in order to press our case.</P>
        <P>Scotland is important to me for a number of reasons, one of which relates to the fishing industry.  Like Scotland, Ireland is permitted to control its coastal waters to a limit of 12 miles.  It is only a 30 mile journey from the part of Donegal in which I reside to Scotland.  If we work together and co-operate to have programmes put in place, we could engage in joint management of fisheries in the area.  This would have important implications, particularly in the context of good management leading to better preservation of stocks and better potential gains for fishermen.  That is only one of the many opportunities people perceive in the context of new INTERREG funding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I had dinner recently with George Reid from the Scottish Parliament.  We discussed simple matters in the context of peace and reconciliation, such as encouraging people from Donegal who are involved in Irish traditional music and fiddlers from the North to travel to Scotland to play with the Scottish fiddler orchestra and engage in workshops and exchanges.  A simple part of peace and reconciliation is encouraging people to understand each other.  Many people from Donegal emigrated to Scotland and much of the heritage of both has been mutually influenced.  Ulster also played its part in this regard.</P>
        <P>A significant amount of North-South community work has been carried out in the area I represent.  The region has engaged in North-<Col N="1934"/>South politics for over 30 years and in the recent past we have explored North-South economics following the growth of Border villages into towns.  We see no difficulties in respect of North-South co-operation, although in the area I represent, which is located further north than many parts of Northern Ireland, it is more North-North co-operation.  Our only problem is that this co-operation has not translated into the senior level of politics.  When it does so, it will yield results.  I refer, for example, to what happened in the case of the North-West Region Cross Border Group.  In that context, I was able to help, with the assistance of the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, to deliver the Foyle cross-Border ferry.  The latter has served 1 million customers in less than three years, which shows the potential economic gains to be made.</P>
        <P>The gateway initiative must deliver in terms of consultation, co-operation and action.  The Minister of State said that since the suspension of the institutions in 2002, the North-South Ministerial Council has not been able to meet and the bodies do not have the full powers they should possess.  Donegal has been impacted upon as a result of that development.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State also referred to the Loughs Agency as developing and delivering cross-Border co-operation.  I wish to flag that legislation is planned in respect of this matter.  We have waited a long time for proper management, resourcing and legislative support in respect of the Foyle.  I would be concerned by legislation that did not embrace proper opportunities to manage and look after the lough that has survived without legislation.  Let us hasten slowly, particularly if we are not going to address the issue in a comprehensive manner.  I am aware that I will have further opportunities to discuss this matter.  However, I wish to flag that there is an issue which, as a matter or urgency, must be addressed.</P>
        <P>Waterways Ireland is working well and I am glad that lines on the map have been accepted by all communities in respect of linking Coleraine, Dublin, Waterford and Limerick.  The Minister of State intimated that these lines will be included on the map in the next national development plan.  I do not know whether it was because of political sensitivity or otherwise that such lines could not previously be presented.  In my opinion, there is no reason there cannot be co-operation, similar to which took place between Dublin and Belfast, in respect of delivering motorways on particular routes, such as the N2-A5 road and others in the north-west region.  I will be seeking to ensure that those practical issues to which the Minister of State referred form part of the solution to be reached in the context of the national development plan.</P>
        <P>There should be no pandering to anyone who states that all-Ireland co-operation is a problem.  Such co-operation represents a win-win scenario for everyone, particularly in the development of infrastructure.  As I personally stated to Peter <Col N="1935"/>Robinson many years ago, I must pass through various counties on the rest of the island to travel to Dublin.  I, therefore, wish to see roads improved for my benefit.  However, it also benefits many other counties along the way.  Practical issues must be resolved.  We must reach the stage where all politics are local.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan mentioned the massive opportunities in education but we are stymieing and stifling them because of third level fees.  The two major parties in the Six Counties have stated they would not have such fees.  I want to see their manifestoes implemented, since students from County Donegal who formerly chose to go to the North are being forced either to forgo their education or travel south.  This puts more pressure on the Southern university system and undermines the wonderful system in the North, an interest in which I declare, having attended college in Jordanstown for seven years.  It also undermines the potential to gain professional qualifications locally and remain at home.  This negative spiral must be addressed.  Regarding all-Ireland co-operation on education, one of the core elements is third level fees.  Other issues include such matters as water rates.</P>
        <P>It was interesting to hear Jeffrey Donaldson call on Sinn F&eacute;in to hold its Ard-Fheis.  I had not realised that his Gaelic had improved so much and, as chair of the relevant committee in the Houses of the Oireachtas, look forward to recognition and promotion of the Irish language in the North in order that it will stand on a par with English, in the same way as the Official Languages Act 2003 has developed the language in the Republic.  I do not consider this especially contentious.  On occasion people have tried to politicise the language, the flag and everything else, but many on a cross-Border, cross-community and pluralist basis are very interested in the Irish language.</P>
        <P>My main concern is to ensure money will be spent to make things happen, for example, in Muff where the Coney Road and Cannings Lane, an unopened cross-Border road, are situated.  The gas supply that was to have continued from Belfast to County Donegal but stopped in Derry should continue its journey, given the Minister&rsquo;s talk of east-west links.  We have spent large amounts of European funds on capital projects.  I would like to see this turned into social capital and that social capital mainstreamed in order that such provision might continue.</P>
        <P>The two Governments have identified co-operation in the planning and delivery of infrastructure as key to maximising returns on the major investments being made North and South.  The all-Ireland dimension must be realised.  The important horizontal themes of the Government&rsquo;s next development plan for the period 2007 to 2013 must deliver for the north west.  I am selfish and parochial.  My constituency and county have suffered unduly in recent years, something that <Col N="1936"/>we wish to see rectified.  Anyone who can help in that regard and take an all-Ireland approach to the important issues is more than welcome.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to one or two speakers.</P>
        <P>We have seen the level of co-operation between the Parliaments involved in the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, in which members such as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Deputy Keaveney have played a very significant part.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the very high level of co-operation achieved through current mechanisms and know that under the proposed legislation, it will be further enhanced.  All parties in Northern Ireland are doing their best and I trust them.  Despite the significant challenges facing them, they will be able to bring together a viable Executive and functioning Assembly, a body which will bring local governance to Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body has addressed many of the issues mentioned.  The issue of all-island co-operation was discussed in Edinburgh 18 months ago, when Stephen Kingon spoke of an economic analysis of Northern Ireland, detailing positive and negative aspects.  That discussion was continued in Killarney, where we talked to representatives of the DUP informally about engagement on economic and political matters.  It was further advanced when Sir George Quigley addressed the body in Belfast earlier this year.</P>
        <P>One issue is extremely important &mdash; I know that all the Northern Ireland parties have signed up to it &mdash; namely, an agreed rate of corporation tax on the island, an agreed programme of economic co-operation on North-South interconnectors, broadband infrastructure, roads and public transport, all of which have been mentioned.  They are part and parcel of the current legislation.  I have seen at first hand that there is tremendous co-operation locally, of which Border Deputies have extremely good evidence, in such areas as inter-church co-operation, cross-community relations, sports and educational exchanges and so on.</P>
        <P>In July more than 80 groups met in Dublin Castle for a conference to discuss their experience of co-operation North and South, across the communities in Northern Ireland, and east-west.  Arising therefrom, I have seen significant community initiatives.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in mentioned the autism centre.  I pay tribute to the late Margaret Ewing, MSP, for the work she did to <Col N="1937"/>heighten awareness of the condition.  I have no doubt that the centre of excellence of which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in spoke will come to fruition, just as the commitment regarding Ulster waterways will bring to fruition that aspect of development.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>Civil society is driving much of that development.  Although I do not suggest political parties are not part of it, such groups in Northern Ireland are far ahead of their politicians who ignore them at their peril.  They want them to listen to their voices and grasp the nettle.  There are issues that are difficult to tackle, including those relating to water rates and the reform of local government.  If the parties in Northern Ireland are not to be relegated to the status of local councillors, however, they must all accept the challenge of making progress.  I recognise the challenges that exist for Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP in regard to policing and power-sharing, respectively.  If both parties &mdash; we tend to forget the other parties, including the SDLP, the UUP and the smaller parties &mdash; work together, there is a unique opportunity to move forward the situation on this island.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the work that the North-South bodies should be able to do.  Notwithstanding the challenges and restrictions they face, they can already do a significant amount.  I commend their work.  I spoke at a conference in Newry earlier this year at which the influence of these bodies was made clear.  I look forward to the time when they will be able to do much more.  The potential of the designated areas of co-operation is immense if the opportunity is grasped.  I commend the Government&rsquo;s initiative in including in the national development plan a chapter on the all-island economy.  That is crucial.</P>
        <P>Deputy Keaveney referred briefly to the potential for east-west co-operation, an issue that does not receive adequate attention.  Earlier this year, one of the committees of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body met representatives of the CBI and IBEC to discuss road transport connections within and between Ireland, Scotland and England.  They outlined the volume of haulage that is carried from the Republic, through Larne to Stranraer and even on to Felixstowe.  I urge the British Government to lend its support to initiatives in this regard.  To date, regrettably, it has been found wanting in this area.</P>
        <P>The potential for other links is great.  Further east-west co-operation is possible in the gas and electricity markets and there is potential for enhanced North-South co-operation in health care and education.  I recently attended a conference in Mullaghbawn, just outside Crossmaglen, where the links between Newry and Dundalk across a range of areas were emphasised, including education, industrial development and information and communications tech<Col N="1938"/>nology.  There is potential for greater co-operation in such areas throughout the island.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan referred to the lessons North and South can learn from each other in the area of education.  There is no doubt that the education system in this State has great strengths, but there are aspects of the Northern Ireland system from which we can learn.  We have seen, for instance, that the North has the highest level of participation in third level education among all the regions of the United Kingdom and the highest level of early school leaving.  Our school completion initiatives and the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools programme could be developed as models of best practice for both jurisdictions on this island.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is major potential in the area of tourism.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland spoke at our conference in Belfast of how more than 2 million visitors came to the North last year, a figure greater than its own population.  The all-island tourism product can be developed and refined a great deal.  I commend the Government on supporting an instance of practical co-operation.  At this year&rsquo;s Belfast Horse Show, I spoke to people from all over the island, including Cork, Tipperary, Down and Derry, who were competing for prizes.  This was a level five competition and it is proposed to raise it to a higher level in the future.  I commend the Government on lending seed capital to support this initiative.  Similar initiatives can be taken in many areas, whether in respect of tourism, education, broadcasting, media or ICT.</P>
        <P>This is an important Bill and I commend it to the House.  It is something that can be built upon if the parties in the North recognise the challenge and grasp the opportunity it presents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Deputies for their co-operation in facilitating the passage of this Bill and, in particular, for their encouraging and positive comments on Northern Ireland affairs.  As political representatives of all the parties and groupings in this House, they clearly reflected the unity of purpose in all our collective efforts to promote North-South co-operation and enhance peace and prosperity throughout the island, particularly in the North.</P>
        <P>This technical Bill is important in giving domestic legal effect to the international agreement between the British and Irish Governments and securing the mandate of the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, in managing cross-Border EU funds.  Through its support for projects on a cross-community and cross-Border basis, the SEUPB has brought together groups and individuals who would otherwise have no contact.  Moreover, it has ensured that these groups work together to build a better economic future for their communities based on reconcili<Col N="1939"/>ation and mutual understanding.  It has made a significant contribution to the economic and social development of the Border region.</P>
        <P>The two Governments look forward to the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive on 26 March in line with the St. Andrews Agreement.  The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, met yesterday to review developments and the two Governments continue to work closely with the parties to see this process successfully completed.  In recent weeks, there have been signs of further progress towards power-sharing in Northern Ireland.  The transitional Assembly is up and running and the parties are getting down to the serious business of preparing for government in the Programme for Government Committee.</P>
        <P>The St. Andrews Agreement is built on the core foundations of full support for a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland and for policing and the rule of law.  We want the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in to move quickly to address outstanding issues.  Northern Ireland deserves a devolved government, with locally elected Ministers, to get on with the business of addressing the significant challenges it faces in a globally competitive world.  Political stability is the bedrock on which economic growth and prosperity can be built.</P>
        <P>The Government is driving forward North-South co-operation because we believe that by working together, North and South, we can deliver significant benefits for all the people on the island.  We are taking forward economic co-operation across a range of sectors, from infrastructure to trade promotion to innovation.  This is a vitally important agenda for the future of this island.  We look forward in particular to working with Northern Ireland Ministers on these issues and to a resumption of the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC.  With the NSMC meeting again, all the bodies, including the SEUPB, will be able to operate to their full potential.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Members raised several important issues during this debate and I will respond to as many as possible in the time available.  Several questions were asked about institutional issues and, in particular, the North-South Implementation Bodies.  Upon restoration of the Executive, meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council will resume and the North-South bodies will be able to operate without the restraints imposed on them during suspension of the institutions.  The Government will work to progress North-South co-operation with the Northern Ireland Ministers in the restored Executive.</P>
        <P>The legislation enacted two weeks ago incorporates several specific safeguards to ensure the North-South institutions can function effectively.  For example, the revised pledge of office will require Northern Ministers to participate fully in <Col N="1940"/>the NSMC and where a Minister cannot attend, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister are to nominate a replacement.</P>
        <P>We engaged in close discussions with the British Government in the lead-up to the St. Andrews Agreement and those discussions are ongoing.  The St. Andrews Agreement and British legislation set out certain matters that require to be considered and agreed by the Executive Committee, and this would also apply to any NSMC decisions falling within those agreed provisions.  The nature and content of the decision will determine whether matters should be considered and agreed in the Executive Committee or whether they are within ministerial decision-making.  The Government is determined to ensure an effective and fully functioning North-South Ministerial Council.  We want balanced, fair, even-handed, inclusive and positive decisions in the interests of all the people in Northern Ireland and in the Border region.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in expressed doubts as to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the Ulster Canal project.  He should reflect on the late 1980s when, as a Minister of State I had responsibility for the Office of Public Works, which was the manager of the first ever North-South project, the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  The project was led by the then Taoiseach, the late Charles Haughey, with the full support of the Cabinet and particularly the then Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry.  If it did not have that leadership and drive, it would never have happened.  It was a major project on North-South co-operation.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the Taoiseach is driving the Ulster Canal project.  He recently announced an ambitious project to restore and re-open the canal.  This will create a major inland waterway for the Border region, serving as a focus for tourism and community development.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter for the people of Crossmolina.  Last weekend there was major flooding in the Crossmolina area in which many homes and business were badly damaged.  Several years ago there was a similar flooding in Dublin.  On that occasion the Government was obliged to provide a package for those affected.  I want a similar package to be put in place for the people of Crossmolina.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I must point out that Deputies Ring, Cooper-Flynn and Cowley have ten minutes between them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an unusual arrangement.  I was put out of the Chamber once before over a similar arrangement.  I understood the Member called for the Adjournment was given five minutes.  I will not disagree with the House&rsquo;s wishes this time.  I am disappointed the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, who is responsible for the OPW, has not attended the Chamber for the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>In October 2004, I contacted the Minister of State concerning the development of a major supermarket near the River Deel at Crossmolina.  The OPW had not been notified about it.  The developer informed the OPW when contacted that he had planning permission from Mayo County Council.  He assured it that he would restore the river to the same state it was in prior to the development.  In February 2005, I again contacted the Minister of State about this development and was informed the matter was being taken up with the developer.</P>
        <P>In May 2005, the Minister of State informed me the OPW had received correspondence from the developer that all works had been carried out in accordance with the planning permission.  In January 2006, I was informed the OPW had not received notification of this development at the planning stage.  At this stage, the developer informed the OPW that the development was within planning permission.  The OPW then contacted Mayo County Council which stated the development did not comply with planning permission.  As part of its comments on the retention application, the OPW has recommended the council to get a hydrological analysis of the alterations to the flood plain.</P>
        <P>Did the OPW receive this plan?  Did it get the developer to comply with the planning permission?  What will it do to prevent future flooding in Crossmolina?  It is unbelievable that a development can be built without planning permission and that Mayo County Council did not <Col N="1942"/>notify the OPW.  This is negligence on the part of the OPW.  The OPW must provide the necessary funding to send an inspection team to Crossmolina.  It must ensure the developer restores the river to its original state or else he should be prosecuted.  This developer has applied to retain what he had.  Within six months the council sought further information but he had to withdraw it because the information did not come back.  The people of Crossmolina suffered last Sunday because Mayo County Council and the OPW did not do their jobs.  The people of Crossmolina must pay their taxes, make a living and look after their homes.  They have been let down by the State.  The State must put in place a package for those affected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish I had more time to speak and that the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, was in the Chamber to answer why a developer could disturb the state of a river and neither the local council nor the OPW did anything about it.  It is a disgrace.  There is flooding across County Mayo yet no one is responsible, neither the OPW nor Mayo County Council, nor the Moy Development Commission, for drainage work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>The flooding that occurred last Sunday in Crossmolina should never have happened.  I downloaded a document from the OPW website entitled, Extreme Flood Events &mdash; The Irish Experience.  It lists several areas which are notable for flooding and provides a detailed analysis of these rivers flooding.  They include the River Dodder, the River Lee, the River Brosna, the River Clare, the River Griffeen and the River Deel in Crossmolina.</P>
        <P>How was it that the River Deel could flood again?  The damage caused when it flooded in 1989 came to several hundred thousand punts.  The damage last weekend is estimated at more than &euro;100 million.  Up to 20 houses were flooded up to a depth of three feet.  Even the priest&rsquo;s house was flooded and Sunday mass was cancelled for the first time.  The Minister saw on the television news an interview with a man who has a carpet showroom in which the stock was destroyed causing at least &euro;200,000 worth of damage.  That is a terrible situation which, based on the events of 1989, should not have happened.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>People have recently raised concerns about the flooding of the pedestrian walkway in the town.  That should have been sufficient warning that something needed to be done.  Although the flood was predictable and inevitable, there were no sandbags available.  It is only a matter of time before another flood occurs.  There is no provision for a flash flood, as there is in Dublin, where the citizens will be well looked after.  We saw the Taoiseach in his wellington boots in Dublin but we did not see him in Mayo.  There is an urgent need for a hydrological survey of the system to identify what needs to be done.  It is obvious what <Col N="1943"/>needs to be done and the Office of Public Works has a major responsibility to resolve this matter.</P>
        <P>I call for a fund to be established to compensate the affected people of Crossmolina for the damage to their premises, the loss of their livelihoods and the destruction of their businesses.  How many times must this happen before it is resolved?  This financial package should not be delayed.  There must be more than words from the Minister.  There should be an immediate assessment by the OPW followed by a quick payout to those in great need.  I implore the House to ensure that this never happens again.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn"><NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the opportunity to raise this issue.  On Monday I spent five hours in Crossmolina inspecting the extensive damage caused by this flood.  It damaged local businesses in the lead-up to Christmas.  Deputy Cowley mentioned the furniture store and many hardware shops and businesses selling seasonal items will not have the opportunity to make money at Christmas time as a result of this damage.  Many residences were also damaged forcing people to move out of their houses before Christmas, which is a terrible tragedy for them.  As a result, elderly people need the help of the State.</P>
        <P>I call on the Government to examine why this happened.  On Monday I met officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the OPW, both of which are investigating why this flood occurred.  We need to know the answer to that question and identify where the responsibility lies.  I commend the fire service, the Garda and Mayo County Council which were on site.  However, bringing sand bags to houses at 9 a.m. which were already under a couple of feet of water was no good.  I compliment the emergency services for their excellent work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I seek relief funding for those affected by the flood.  Although many of the businesses have consequential loss insurance, many people, particularly in the context of houses, may not have insurance or access to financial support in time.  I ask that the Government come to their aid.  Through the health service, the Minister should ask community welfare officers to provide the necessary immediate support to get those people over the Christmas period.  That is something positive he can do.</P>
        <P>I also ask that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government provide money to carry out remedial work.  The history of the flooding of the River Deel goes back many years.  Some 50 to 60 years ago the town of Crossmolina used to flood once or twice a year.  During the 1970s extensive work was carried out on the Moy drainage.  Millions of pounds were spent and, as a result, flooding stopped until 1989, when there was a severe flood.  There has not <Col N="1944"/>been a flood in the town in the 17 years since then, but something has happened and we need to know what it is so that remedial action can be put in place ensuring that these people will not be exposed to this type of hardship again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take the three matters together.</P>
        <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to express my concern, and that of the Government, to the people of Crossmolina affected by the flooding at the weekend.  In particular, I wish to sympathise with people whose homes were flooded.  This is a particularly traumatic and unpleasant experience and one of which Deputy Parlon has a particular understanding, having spoken in the past with victims of similar flooding.  We hope that people will not have lost valuables or other irreplaceable items and that it will be possible for them to recover from the worst effects of the flooding.  We are also conscious that a large number of people whose homes or businesses were not flooded were indirectly affected by the flooding and I want to express our concern for those people also.  I acknowledge the work of local authority staff and members of the emergency services who are the frontline responders when unpredicted events like this occur and who do magnificent work in very difficult circumstances.</P>
        <P>The OPW no longer has responsibility for the provision of humanitarian aid in situations like that which occurred in Crossmolina at the weekend.  In line with the recommendations of the flood policy review group report of 2004, responsibility transferred to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which was considered the most appropriate agency to deal with the issue given the nature of its remit and its nationwide network of offices and staff.  I understand the Department is already considering the request for financial assistance and I will ensure the terms of these motions are brought to the attention of the personnel dealing with the matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, is also aware that apart from the immediate impact of flooding, there is a longer term effect as people fear a recurrence.  In this regard officials from the OPW were in Crossmolina yesterday to see the situation at first hand and to gather information that will be essential in trying to determine the cause of the flooding.  That process is ongoing.  Early indications are that the flood in the River Deel at the weekend was the fourth highest on record, though somewhat lower than the level when flooding occurred previously in 1989.  The river flooded its banks at a point upstream of the section which is maintained by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  The OPW scheme is maintained in proper repair and effective condition as required by the Act.  However, <Col N="1945"/>the OPW has no power to undertake works in the area where the flood occurred and did not undertake the work referred to in Deputy Ring&rsquo;s contribution.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P>The OPW will be considering what measures can be taken to provide protection to what is now the accepted standard, namely, to defend against a flood event that has a 1%, or a once in 100 years, probability of occurring.  It is likely to take some time to produce a design for such a scheme.  In the meantime the OPW is also considering whether it may be possible through short-term measures to provide more immediate improvement in flow conditions on the River Deel.  Contact has already been established between the OPW and Mayo County Council in this regard and this will continue.  The discussions between the OPW and the local authority will also consider what mechanisms might be used to implement any measures considered likely to be beneficial.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue and the Minister for replying to it.  It is a serious situation in which the HSE has failed to provide a physiotherapist in the Drogheda-Dundalk region, which covers south Monaghan.  I have raised this matter because in the last few days I have encountered two serious cases.  I have a long letter on one case in which the patient fell ill last May and was transferred from Beaumont Hospital to D&uacute;n Laoghaire hospital on 9 June where she received eight weeks of treatment.  This shows that she needed that type of support.  When her husband took her home she was assured of all sorts of backup.</P>
        <P>The HSE talks about home care packages, physiotherapy, and so on.  However, this woman has not received anything.  After much pressure she received a few sessions of physiotherapy in Drogheda.  However, the Drogheda unit, according to the HSE a centre of excellence for the north east, no longer offers physiotherapy services to outpatients.  Services at Monaghan General Hospital are being transferred to this centre of excellence.  Having spent a period in D&uacute;n Laoghaire rehabilitation centre the 39 year old woman returned home but has received no physiotherapy to date.  Is that a reasonable or realistic commitment after all the talk about home support and care?  She did not receive a home care allowance either.  Her husband had to take time off work to look after her.  That she has not received physiotherapy is causing her serious problems and affecting her mentally.  She was supposed to return to Beaumont Hospital for an appointment on 20 November but this was cancelled and rearranged for next year.  Is this the health service to which that family is entitled when we have budgeted &euro;14.5 billion in 2007?  I <Col N="1946"/>urge the Minister of State to re-examine this situation and what is happening on the ground.</P>
        <P>On a walk around Carrickmacross I met a young girl in a wheelchair who had undergone an operation.  She cannot receive physiotherapy.  Is this the appropriate treatment of a 17 year old who wishes to continue with her life but desperately needs help with cerebral palsy?  No home help or physiotherapy is available.  This is happening at the centre of excellence to which the colleague of the Minister of State is directing the people of Monaghan and Cavan, assuring them there will be no cutback in the Monaghan and Cavan service until a better service is available.  Those in south Monaghan normally attend the hospitals at Drogheda or Louth.</P>
        <P>Why are there no physiotherapists?  The Minister of State was interviewed on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; but I listened to a father who complained that his daughter, a fully qualified physiotherapist, cannot find work.  None of her classmates, nor those who qualify next year, will find work because of a recruitment embargo.  While the embargo does not seem to affect sections of the HSE administration, it affects those in frontline care.  I beg the Minister of State, for the sake of the 39 year old woman who is desperate and in serious difficulty, that she be provided with physiotherapy.  I will gladly provide the Minister of State with details after the debate.  An attempt has been made to facilitate these patients at Mount Hamilton House, Dundalk but neither has received confirmation that physiotherapy is available there.  It is not available at Drogheda or Dundalk.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I respond to this debate on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  The HSE has operational and funding responsibility for the provision of health and social care services, including physiotherapy services, in south Monaghan.  The HSE has advised me that the primary, community and continuing care physiotherapy service for Louth and south Monaghan has 1.5 whole-time equivalent physiotherapy staff in its core service.  Referrals of approximately 150 patients per year are taken and prioritised on the basis of clinical need.  Referrals are made mainly by general practitioners, public health nurses and hospitals following an inpatient stay.  In addition, physiotherapy is provided in the community by a number of teams working in disability, district rehabilitation in Louth, palliative care, early intervention and children&rsquo;s disability.  All these teams cover the south Monaghan area.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that persons requiring physiotherapy from south Monaghan can be referred to the outpatient unit in Louth County Hospital.  The hospital has four physiotherapists attached to its outpatient unit.  It takes referrals mainly from GPs and hospital consultants.  Hospital and community physiotherapy services are well integrated and the physiotherapy man<Col N="1947"/>agers jointly manage hospital and community services.  Physiotherapists in either the community or in hospital services share the responsibilities when required.</P>
        <P>The HSE plans to further enhance the physiotherapy role by filling approved posts within existing teams that are currently vacant, improving the existing community team structure and further developing discharge planning arrangements.  Further implementation of the primary care strategy will also impact on the provision of physiotherapy services.  The strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, aims to develop services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, home helpers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.  It has been estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of the new primary care teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services in these areas.</P>

The HSE received an additional &euro;10 million in 2006 to enable the establishment of up to 100 primary care teams.  A further &euro;10 million will be provided in 2007 to meet the full year costs of these developments.  The total funding provided by the Government to support the implementation of the strategy will be increased to &euro;38 million.  This is in addition to the very substantial resources already in the funding base for a wide range of primary care services.</P>
        <P>The HSE is working to establish this complement of primary care teams in 2006 and it expects substantial progress to be achieved by the end of the year.  This will ensure integrated, accessible services for the populations served by these teams.  The funding is being targeted by the HSE to provide the potential for each local health office, formerly community care areas, to establish up to three primary care teams in accordance with the adopted national policy.  It is estimated that approximately 77 of these front line staff posts will be physiotherapy posts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter concerns some 1,000 students and 100 teachers and ancillary staff at three schools in Clonakilty.  This is a case of outrageous discrimination against the people of Clonakilty by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government and particularly against the young population <Col N="1948"/>attending Clonakilty Community College, Clonakilty Gaelscoil and the national school at Knockskeagh in Clonakilty parish.  Clonakilty Community College was built for 400 students but now holds 600 and employs 60 teachers and ancillary staff.  The Gaelscoil has 230 pupils and 25 staff.  Knockskeagh has 110 pupils and ten staff.</P>
        <P>What do the three schools have in common?  All are in the parish of Clonakilty, are in dreadful condition and have been pawned off by this Government with meaningless promises and commitments.  A second campus has been opened for the community college at the other end of the town, giving rise to major health and safety problems.  I warned the Government of the danger of accidents involving young students travelling across the town.  It is a great college coping with dreadful conditions.  It provides adult education, post Leaving Certificate programmes, ionad l&aacute;n Gaeilge and a class for moderately handicapped people.  On 24 April 2002 the then Minister for Education and Science, Dr. Woods, wrote concerning the much needed extension to the college.  He stated: &ldquo;I am pleased to inform you that I have authorised the appointment of a design team to initiate the architectural planning of this extension.&rdquo;  What has happened to this authorisation or did it ever exist?  Was it a totally phony pre-election facade?  Was it typical Fianna F&aacute;il electioneering, handing out false commitments and promises?</P>
        <P>Absolutely nothing has happened on the ground four and a half years on, other than that the needs of the college having grown.  The student population has increased and the problem has worsened.  Four and half years on, the Government gives a succession of meaningless responses with total contempt for the students, parents and people of Clonakilty in general.  The Minister refused to visit when actually passing by the school despite being asked to view the problem.  Her absence from the House tonight is further evidence of her contempt.  She and the Government have shown absolute contempt for the problems of Clonakilty and its community college.</P>
        <P>The case of Clonakilty gaelscoil is similar.  It was founded in 1994 and given official recognition in 1997, but it is housed in temporary prefabs which, to put it mildly, have seen better days.  For example, the ceilings of the toilets collapsed ten days ago, but fortunately no schoolchildren were <i>in situ</i> at the time.</P>
        <P>As a parallel to the waste of the Government on e-voting machines, PPARS and elsewhere, the case of Clonakilty gaelscoil is an even worse example.  This year alone, &euro;330,000 will be paid by the Government for the rent of those dilapidated and run-down collection of leaking prefabs.  Again, inquiries through D&aacute;il questions meet with the totally opaque response from the Minister for Education and Science, who appears to have adopted a lack of transparency and a total <Col N="1949"/>lack of accountability as her trademark.  It is said that wilful waste makes woeful want, and this is a major example.  The trouble is that the wilful waste is on the Government&rsquo;s part but the woeful want is on the part of the scol&aacute;ir&iacute; and muinteoir&iacute; of the gaelscoil, who yearn for decent conditions.</P>
        <P>Knockskeagh national school is the third section of Clonakilty&rsquo;s crown of educational thorns.  It was built 70 years ago and is an outstanding school operating in Third World conditions.  It is included in the INTO list of substandard schools.  In July 1997, the Department of Education confirmed that an OPW report indicated: &ldquo;Due to the extent of the proposed works, it will be necessary to consider these works as a major building project.&rdquo;  It also remarked that due to financial constraints &mdash; this was just after the 1997 election when all promises were off and money was being cut back straight away &mdash; the Department was not in a position to consider that major project &ldquo;in the current year&rdquo; of 1997.</P>
        <P>Ten years on, nothing has happened, apart from a major part of the roof blowing off five years ago.  Again, fortunately, there were no casualties at the time.  There was the charade of offering to allow the school to participate in the small schools scheme, years after the Department admitted it was a major project.</P>
        <P>The Government is telling us about its &euro;5 billion surplus, which is a sick joke in Clonakilty.  I demand on the part of the people of Clonakilty decent conditions for the schools there; an end to the absolute contempt shown by the Government to the children, students, parents and teachers in Clonakilty; and no further delay in issuing the necessary sanctions and approval for the three schools I mentioned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects, and also to outline the position regarding Gaelscoil Chloch na Coillte, Clonakilty community college and Knockskeagh national school.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools, as well as responding to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a major priority for the Government.  Since taking office, it has shown focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>As evidence of this commitment, there will be in the region of 1,300 building and modernisation projects active in our primary and post-primary schools during 2006.  This year alone, in the region of &euro;500 million is being spent on primary and post-primary projects throughout the country, compared to approximately &euro;90 million in 1997.  I am sure the Deputy will agree this record level of investment is a positive testament to the high <Col N="1950"/>priority the Government attaches to the challenge of school modernisation and development.</P>
        <P>Turning to the specific matter in hand, Gaelscoil Chloch na Coillte is a co-educational school with an enrolment of 232 pupils in September 2005.  Although the September 2006 enrolment has yet to be confirmed, the Department of Education and Science understands that enrolments have increased by approximately 20% in the past five years.  The school has a current staffing of principal plus nine mainstream teachers, one learning support and resource teacher and two resource teachers.</P>
        <P>The school planning section of the Department has determined the appropriate level of accommodation to be provided will cater for a principal and 12 mainstream class teachers and appropriate ancillary activities.  A suitable site has now been acquired to facilitate the construction of a new 12-classroom school, which will meet the school&rsquo;s long-term needs.  This project is under active consideration in the Department.</P>
        <P>Clonakilty community college is one of two schools serving the post-primary education needs of Clonakilty.  These are Clonakilty community college, which is co-educational; and Sacred Heart secondary school, which is all girls.  Clonakilty community college was formed in 1980 as a result of the amalgamation of the town&rsquo;s vocational school and St Mary&rsquo;s boys&rsquo; secondary school and it operates under the aegis of County Cork VEC.  The community college was built in 1980 to cater for 400 pupils and since then additional accommodation has been provided to cater for increasing enrolments.</P>
        <P>Cork VEC requested that the Department review the accommodation at the college and make capital funding available for a refurbishment and extension.  This application was processed having regard to all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends in the area and the overall accommodation requirements of the post-primary schools in Clonakilty.  An accommodation brief to cater for a long-term enrolment of 550 pupils has been agreed with the school authorities.  Schedules of accommodation were revised earlier this year to ensure the appropriate level of accommodation is provided in order to meet the school&rsquo;s long-term needs.</P>
        <P>Knockskeagh national school is a co-educational school with an enrolment of 105 pupils in September 2005.  Although the September 2006 enrolment has yet to be confirmed, the Department understands enrolments are relatively stable at this school.  It has a current staffing of principal and three mainstream teachers, one learning support and resource teacher and one resource teacher.</P>
        <P>The management authority of this school declined an offer of funding made under the small schools scheme 2006 to provide appropriate accommodation for a four-teacher school on the basis that it could not deliver the required accommodation within the grant approved.  It also <Col N="1951"/>raised the need to review the long-term accommodation needs of the schools as it had indications that the school population is set to increase in the medium to long term.  This re-assessment of the school&rsquo;s projected enrolment and long-term projected staffing is nearing completion and, when finalised, a decision on how best to provide for the long-term needs will be taken.</P>
        <P>Once again I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to outline the position on these particular school projects and highlight the <Col N="1952"/>enormous work being undertaken by the Department of Education and Science in implementing the school building and modernisation programme to ensure infrastructure of the highest standard is available for all our school-going population.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has allocated specific funding for a three year plan to combat Health Care Associated Infections including antimicrobial resistance. A number of educational pilot projects have already been carried out as a result of The Strategy for the Control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland National Committee recommendations.  The HSE is now in discussions with relevant media companies with a view to agreeing a suitable national two year education and information campaign. The campaign is expected to commence early in the new year. It will run in parallel with an education intervention involving General Practitioners. </P>

	<P>I am advised by the Health Service Executive that, on the day mentioned by the Deputy, the number of patients awaiting admission nationally was 172. Of these, only one patient had been waiting longer than 24 hours.  I understand that the reason for the discrepancy between the figures produced by the Irish Nurses Organisation and the HSE is that the figures are compiled at different times of the day. Information on daily activity levels in A &amp; E departments is available on the HSE website.</P>
        <P>Tackling the problems in A &amp; E departments is the Government&rsquo;s top priority in health.  Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in A &amp; E and do not require admission.</P>
        <P>A &amp; E services have improved around the country.  The improvements, particularly in Dublin, have been acknowledged by the INO.  The HSE activity reports over recent months indicate a significant reduction in the average number of patients in A &amp; E departments awaiting admission compared with the equivalent period in 2005.  Waiting times for patients have also been reduced.  The percentage of people waiting longer than 24 hours for admission has decreased from 13% in May to 6% in October.  I wish to move to a position where no patient will wait longer than six hours to be admitted after a clinical decision to admit has been made.</P>
        <P>To ensure that the improvements that have been achieved in recent months are sustained, particularly during the winter months, the HSE has introduced a broad-based Winter Initiative.  Its purpose is to ensure that the services required to address the particular demands of the winter season are in place and operating optimally. It encompasses not just hospital services but also primary and community care services.</P><Col N="1955"/>
        <P>The actions and initiatives being taken by the HSE are designed to deliver the sustained improvement in A &amp; E services that patients and their families deserve.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 69, 101, 122, 132 and 133 together.</P>
        <P>The objective of this Government is to ensure the provision of a world-class hospital to serve the children of this country.  It was for this reason, and for no other, that the Government strongly endorsed the recommendation of the Joint Task Group and the decision of the Board of the Health Service Executive to locate the new National Paediatric Hospital on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital.  The decision was taken in the best interests of children, not on political grounds.  To suggest otherwise is an injustice to those people who have worked tirelessly over the last twelve months to bring forward this essential development.</P>
        <P>The McKinsey report commissioned by the HSE, at my request, provided the original basis for the decision to co-locate adult and paediatric hospital services.  The report is very clear.  It demonstrates that best outcomes for children are achieved by having the necessary breadth and depth of services on a single site.  Co-location of paediatric services with adult services and, in due course, with maternity services, is in line with best international practice and this was widely accepted by stakeholders when the McKinsey report was published.</P>
        <P>The collaboration of adult and paediatric specialists is of critical importance.  It creates the necessary platform for sub-specialisation and improved outcomes.  The optimum delivery of complex paediatric surgical services can best be achieved by creating teams of specialists covering both adult and paediatric patients.   Co-location also offers the benefits of providing transitional care for children with complex illnesses who are now surviving well into adult life.  I am fully satisfied that the Task Group undertook a rigorous <Col N="1957"/>and robust examination of the key issues in making its recommendation.</P>
        <P>It is true that the site chosen for the new National Paediatric Hospital is in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency.  Is it being suggested that the Mater Hospital, an internationally renowned adult teaching hospital, should have been disregarded as a possible site for the new paediatric hospital simply because of its location?  Comments by the Chairperson of the Mater and Children&rsquo;s University Hospital Limited at a public function a number of months ago were reported out of context.  They related to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s long-standing support for the redevelopment of the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital Temple Street on the Mater site which at the time was at an advanced stage of planning.  This has now been overtaken by the Government decision to develop a National Paediatric Hospital.</P>
        <P>It is perhaps understandable, in circumstances where services provided at three hospitals are to move, that the decision has not met with universal approval.  However, some of the public comment has been misinformed.  Not all paediatric services are moving to the new hospital.  As is the case internationally, the new National Paediatric Hospital will be supported by a strategically-located urgent care service.  The Transition Group will be advising early in the New Year on the recommended scope and location for this service.  The Group is working to ensure that the widest possible range of services will be provided through the urgent care service.</P>
        <P>The report commissioned by Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Crumlin was submitted to the joint HSE/Departmental Transition Group some weeks ago and has already been the subject of discussions with the hospital.  I also received the report and have met with hospital representatives to discuss their concerns.  The Transition Group is overseeing the preparation of a high level framework brief to inform decisions in relation to the range of services to be provided at the new hospital and the specific site to be ceded by the Mater Hospital. I understand that the Transition Group is satisfied that the new hospital can be fully accommodated at the Mater. The Transition Group has assured the Crumlin hospital authorities that their report will be taken into consideration in the preparation of the framework brief.</P>
        <P>To date, no decision has been taken in relation to the range of services to be provided at the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Tallaght in the context of the development of the national paediatric hospital and the associated urgent care service.  The Taoiseach has given an assurance to Tallaght Hospital that the Government wishes to see it thrive on a sustainable basis as a particular focal point for the involvement of the minority tradition in the healthcare system, and as a key health provider to an expanding local population.</P><Col N="1958"/>
        <P>I am satisfied that the development, as planned, is consistent with international best practice.  For example, I recently had the opportunity to visit the Children&rsquo;s Memorial Hospital in Chicago, which is an established secondary and tertiary paediatric centre.  The hospital, which at present operates as a stand-alone facility, will be transferring to a city-centre site where it will be tri-located with an existing adult teaching hospital and a new maternity hospital.  The hospital authorities considered other options, including a move to a greenfield site, but ultimately decided that the clinical and other benefits of the tri-location model far outweighed any other considerations, and would allow for the provision of an enhanced level and quality of care for children.</P>

	<P>&euro;12.5m was made available by the Health Service Executive from the 2006 disability services investment programme to provide multi-disciplinary supports, including therapy supports, to people with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities and people with autism.  I also understand that the HSE&rsquo;s priority in 2006 has been to increase the multi-disciplinary support services for children with developmental delay.</P>
        <P>The HSE has experienced difficulties in recruiting speech and language therapists. They are one of the therapy grades where shortages are being experienced nationally.

	<P>The Mental Health Commission  has conducted an annual inpatient census since 2004.  The census is reported in the Annual Report of the Mental Health Commission.  The latest census was conducted on 8th November, 2006 and all returns are due by 8th December, 2006.</P>
        <P>In the census carried out by the Mental Health Commission on 4th November 2005, there were 3,475 persons in approved centres. 476 persons were in hospital for 21 years or more.  The 2005 Annual Report of the Commission contains further information on the census, including gender, age and legal status.  The Health Research Board Report on Activities of Irish Psychiatric Units and Hospitals 2005 reports 229 deaths in psychiatric in-patient facilities during 2005.</P>
        <P>The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; was launched on 24th January, 2006.  This policy envisions an active, flexible and community-based mental health service where the need for <Col N="1960"/>hospital admission will be greatly reduced.  The report recommends that steps be taken to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals and to re-invest the resources released by these closures in the mental health service.</P>
        <P>The Report emphasises that this process should take place on a phased basis with wards closing sequentially.  The Health Service Executive has emphasised that mental hospitals can only close when the clinical needs of the remaining patients have been addressed in more appropriate settings such as additional community residences, day hospitals and day centres. There will also have to be a substantial increase in the number of community-based multidisciplinary Community Mental Health Teams, as recommended in &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>The Government decided in July 2005 that the best option for improving geographic access for patients in the North West to radiation oncology services is to facilitate access to Belfast City Hospital and to progress consideration of a joint venture for the provision of oncology services in the medium term to patients in the North West from a satellite centre in the North West linked to Belfast.</P>
        <P>Until recently, cancer patients in Donegal requiring radiation oncology treatment were referred to either St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin or to University College Hospital Galway.  I am pleased that a Service Level Agreement has now concluded for the referral of about 50 radiation oncology patients annually from Donegal to Belfast.  It has also been agreed that the number will be increased if there is sufficient demand from patients in Donegal.  Three assessment clinics will be held each month on an ongoing basis.  The first referral clinic took place on 8 November.</P>
        <P>As regards progressing the consideration of a satellite in the North West, the Deputy will appreciate that my first priority was to gain access for cancer patients in the North West to Belfast as early as possible.  The issue of a satellite centre in the North West will be pursued with the authorities in Northern Ireland at both Departmental and Ministerial levels.</P>
        <P>My Department is working closely with the HSE and the National Development Finance <Col N="1961"/>Agency to progress the National Radiation Oncology Plan announced by Government in July 2005.    The Agency has  assembled a team to progress the financial and procurement aspects of the Plan, to be provided mostly by PPP.  The HSE has appointed a Project Manager and support team.  The Clinical Output Specifications are being finalised and technical advisors will be appointed shortly to advise on the construction and other technical aspects of the project.  Six new linear accelerators will be provided by traditional procurement in the Eastern Region in the short term, two in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin in late 2007 and two each in St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont Hospitals by early 2009.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 328 together.</P>
        <P>Government policy is to develop health services in all regions of the country to provide safe, high-quality and accessible services that provide the best possible outcomes for patients.  My Department has developed a broad range of strategy documents and associated policies to guide it in its work.  The progress being made in pursuing these objectives is set out each year in my Department&rsquo;s Annual Report which is available in the D&aacute;il Library and in the HSE&rsquo;s Annual Report which is available on their website.</P>
        <P>The Health Reform Programme comprehends Quality and Fairness &mdash; The National Health Strategy, The Primary Care Strategy as well as the Prospectus, Brennan and Hanly reports.  These reports are guiding the future of the health service in that they lay out the overall direction for the major changes which are now underway in the health services.  They culminated in the introduction of the Health Act, 2004, which abolished the health boards and established the HSE in January, 2005 as a mechanism for unitary service delivery in the area of health and personal social services. The HSE together with my Department is implementing the recommendations of the Brennan Report on an ongoing basis in striving to achieve greater accountability, efficiency, consistency, quality and effectiveness in a national context.</P>
        <P>The underlying vision guiding the delivery of primary care and hospital services is one which puts the patient or the service user at the centre of a high quality system which is fair, safe and which provides good value for the resources available.  This approach will mean rebalancing service delivery so that those services that can be safely delivered locally are delivered locally and in the most appropriate setting with particular regard to the ongoing development of primary care infrastructure at local level as set out in The Primary Care Strategy.  The Strategy is a road map for the future development of primary care services in Ireland over a period of some 10 years, both as the appropriate service for the delivery of the majority of people&rsquo;s health and social care needs, and to complement the services provided by acute hospitals.</P>
        <P>More complex services that require specialist input must be concentrated at regional hospital settings, or in the case of highly specialised <Col N="1963"/>services such as organ transplantation, in national centres of excellence.</P>

	<P>The Government and I are anxious to build on the expertise and ethos of St. Luke&rsquo;s.  It is held in great affection by the Irish people. Many thousands of Irish patients and their families from every part of the country have experienced high quality cancer care at St. Luke&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>The decision to transfer St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin was taken by the Government in the best interests of cancer patients.  The decision was based on expert medical, scientific and management advice.  It is designed to ensure that radiation oncology is integrated with all other aspects of cancer care, including surgery and medical oncology.  It is in line with best international practice.  This is the model that exists at Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital Galway and which is being developed at Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals, Dublin.  The Board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting this decision.  A transfer on similar lines took place earlier this year in Northern Ireland when radiation oncology services transferred from a stand alone facility to Belfast City Hospital, which is a major academic teaching hospital.</P>
        <P>The expertise and professional commitment of the staff at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital will continue to be an essential element in the provision of cancer care.  Medical and scientific experts from the hospital are involved in developing the output specifications for the delivery of new radiation oncology services nationally.  I have also appointed the Chairman of St. Luke&rsquo;s to chair a National Radiation Oncology Oversight Group to advise me on progress on the implementation of the plan.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the role for St. Luke&rsquo;s in the new facility at St. James&rsquo;, I have made a commitment to pursue discussions with the Boards of both Hospitals about its governance and a re-configuration of the Boards, with the twin goals of ensuring continuity of expertise and ethos in the care of cancer patients and the effective integration of multi-disciplinary patient care at the one site.   I remain confident the transition will be managed with great sensitivity and skill by the two hospital Boards to achieve those objectives.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 144 together.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive recently published a Review of Neurosurgical Services in Ireland.  The Report identifies a clear need for significant investment in, and organisational reform of, neurosurgical services.  Neurosurgery is currently provided at the national centre in Beaumont Hospital and in Cork University Hospital.  The Report recommends that the future development of safe, high quality neurosurgical services in Ireland would be best served by a two-pronged approach by increasing capacity in Dublin and Cork and improving access to neurosurgical units, including transport and telemedicine facilities for referring hospitals.</P>
        <P>The HSE is committed to progressing the recommendations of the Report.  It is undertaking a national neurosciences needs assessment. Neuroscience includes neurology, neurophysiology and neurosurgery. This assessment is guided by previous reviews of neurology and neurophysiology services and the recent report on neurosurgery. It aims to clearly identify the requirements for neuroscience services as a whole across the country.</P>
        <P>An additional &euro;3m was provided in 2006 to develop 3 new neurology units in Waterford, Limerick and Sligo through the appointment of 3 consultant neurology teams. In addition, the HSE provided funding for the appointment of an additional paediatric neurosurgeon at Beaumont Hospital this year.  The recently published Estimates for the Health Service Executive provides a further &euro;4m to continue these developments into 2007.</P>

	<P>I accept that the placement of children and adolescents in adult mental health facilities is inappropriate. However, in situations where there is no available alternative, such admissions may be necessary.</P>
        <P>At present, inpatient mental health services for 16 and 17 year olds are provided in adult psychiatric units.  However, the HSE has put in place improved arrangements for the treatment of children in such units, pending the provision of additional dedicated child and adolescent beds. All children admitted to adult units are treated on a one-to-one basis by appropriately trained staff. Work is underway to identify two adult units in each of the four HSE regions which will deal with under-18s on an interim basis and staff of these units will receive additional training. Eight dedicated child and adolescent multidisciplinary teams will be provided for these units. These arrangements are interim ones pending the completion of four dedicated child and adolescent inpatient units in Cork, Galway, Dubin and Limerick.</P>
        <P>My Department, the HSE and the Mental Health Commission will continue to work together to ensure that the highest standards of mental health services are provided to children and adolescents in the most appropriate setting. The Mental Health Commission has also issued a code of practice relating to the admission of children under the Mental Health Act 2001.</P>
        <P>Child and adolescent mental health services will be a priority for investment next year.  I expect that additional funding will be provided in 2007 to improve services in this area.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive has statutory responsibility for the implementation of the 1996 and 1997 Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991. These provide for notification to, and inspection by, the Health Service Executive of pre-school services.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I announced on 23 December, 2005 that the risk equalisation payment provisions of the scheme would be commenced with effect from 1 January 2006. Taking account of the phasing factor of  50% applicable to risk equalisation payments for the first 12 months, the amount BUPA Ireland would have to contribute in risk equalisation payments would be half of the amount quoted by the Deputy for the 12 months ending June 2006.</P>
        <P>The purpose of a risk equalisation scheme is to neutralise differences in insurers claims costs that arise due to variations in the age and gender distributions of their members. In a community rated market without risk equalisation, insurers with more favourable risk profiles have a regulatory advantage. The current Risk Equalisation Scheme reduces the advantage of insurers with lower risk profiles.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 153 together.</P>
        <P>The Primary Care Strategy is the roadmap for the future development of primary care services in Ireland over a period of some ten years, both as the appropriate service for the delivery of the majority of people&rsquo;s health and social care needs, and to complement the services provided by acute hospitals.  At the heart of the Strategy is the aim of developing services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, home helps, occupational therapists and others.</P>
        <P>The HSE received an additional &euro;10m in funding in 2006 to enable the establishment of up to 100 Primary Care Teams; a further &euro;10m is being provided in 2007 to enable the full year costs of these developments to be met.  This will bring to &euro;38m per annum the total ongoing funding provided by the Government to support the implementation of the strategy.  This is in addition to the very substantial resources already in the funding base for a wide range of primary care services.  The HSE is working to establish up to 100 Primary Care Teams in 2006 and it has indicated that it expects substantial progress in this regard to have been achieved by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The provision of the appropriate infrastructure for the effective functioning of the teams is also being considered by the HSE, having regard to <Col N="1968"/>a number of factors. These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years.</P>

        <Quest> if she has sought an explanation from the Health Service Executive regarding the circumstances in which a number of nursing homes were not considered suitable for contracted patients despite the fact that all of these homes had previously been assessed as suitable by a team from the HSE which was independent of the routine nursing home inspection system; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The inspection of private nursing homes is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.   The 1990 Act provides for the registration of private nursing homes and procedures for attaching conditions to the registration and for de-registering homes.  The Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations, 1993 set out the standards which private nursing homes owners must adhere to in the provision of nursing home services.</P>
        <P>There are currently two nursing homes in the Dublin Mid Leinster Area where HSE admissions have been suspended. The HSE continues to work with these homes to resolve outstanding issues and the standard of care for current patients is under regular review.  The position currently is that the most recent report of the registration and  inspection service is reviewed prior to entering any arrangements with nursing home proprietors. Where issues remain outstanding no patients will be  placed in contract beds in any such nursing home.</P>
        <P>The HSE has informed me that they are not aware of any current case in the Dublin Mid Leinster Area where there is a conflict between the recommendations of the inspection team and any other inspection process.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive is committed to progressing the development of neuroscience services. Neuroscience includes neurology, neurophysiology and neurosurgery. A national neurosciences needs assessment is currently underway.  This assessment is guided by the previous Comhairle na nOspideal report on neurology and neurophysiology and the recently published report on neurosurgery. It aims to clearly identify the requirements for neuroscience services as a whole across the country.</P>
        <P>The HSE has informed my Department that an interim progress report is due to be submitted to the National Hospitals Office shortly and the final Report will be submitted early next year. The Government provided an additional &euro;3m in 2006 to develop neuroscience services and the recently published Estimates for the Health Service Executive provides a further &euro;4m to continue these developments into 2007.</P>
        <P>The HSE is developing additional neurology services in Waterford, Limerick and Sligo through the appointment of additional consultant neurologist teams. In addition the HSE has approved the appointment of an additional consultant neurosurgeon with a special interest in paediatrics for Beaumont Hospital.</P>

        <P>The claims were heard by the Labour Court on 20 June 2006 and a recommendation issued on 9 November 2006. The Court did not recommend concession of the major cost increasing claims. Instead the Court urged the unions to reconsider their position with regard to the Benchmarking so as to have their claims examined through that process. I would also see this as the way forward.</P>
        <P>In relation to the claim for a shorter working week the Court noted that concession of this claim at this time would have profound consequences for both health care delivery and costs unless effective countervailing measures could be put in place. The Court did recommend that employers and unions explore the possibility of initiating an appropriate process aimed at achieving a major reorganisation of working arrangements within the health service generally.</P><Col N="1973"/>
        <P>Within the context of the Labour Court recommendation I recently suggested that meaningful discussions could be held between unions, the HSE and my Department in relation to greater flexibility, improved skill mix and work patterns.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 93 and 134 together.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the taxpayer is receiving excellent value for money from the National Treatment Purchase Fund. I am not aware of evidence that the cost of procedures arranged by the Fund in the private sector is &ldquo;substantially more&rdquo; than similar procedures in public hospitals.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to make a direct comparison between the costs of procedures carried out under the auspices of  the NTPF in the private sector and  those carried out in the public sector. The NTPF basically has a procedure-based pricing system. The factors that are taken into account in agreeing prices with private hospitals include the market rate for the treatment, the cost base of the private hospital, the supply and demand for  particular treatments and other pricing benchmarks including Casemix and some information from private insurers.</P>
        <P>The Casemix system in use in public hospitals groups a range of patients having the same condition, who may have differing lengths of stay, severity and cost, into one Diagnostic Related Grouping, which is then split by cost per hospital to make it as accurate as possible.  As an example, a simple tonsillectomy costs less than a tonsillectomy complicated by infection; a cataract may be a day procedure for some people while an overnight stay may be required by others.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82, 130 and 157 together.</P>
        <P>The Health Services Executive is currently undertaking a procurement exercise to select consortia to build and operate private hospitals on 10 public hospital sites utilising the competitive dialogue tendering process. Invitations to participate in dialogue issued to pre-qualified bidders in mid September 2006 with a deadline to submit outline proposals by 19th October 2006.  The HSE has evaluated the outline proposals that it received and has recently completed the selection of short-listed bidders who will be invited to continue in the competitive dialogue phase. Some of the bidders withdrew from the procurement process for commercial reasons.</P>
        <P>I was informed by the HSE yesterday that the co location initiative will not be proceeding on two public hospital sites at this time. The sites in question are Galway University Hospitals and Letterkenny General Hospital.</P>
        <P>The key objective of the competitive dialogue phase is to explore different options for meeting the core requirements identified by the HSE in respect of each remaining site. The preferred bidders will then be invited to tender to build and operate private hospitals in accordance with the specifications determined by the HSE. The assessment of each proposal will involve a vigorous and comprehensive value for money assessment. The HSE envisages that the award of contracts will be made in the first quarter of 2007.</P>
        <P>The HSE is working towards having consultants providing services as part of a team and hospitals operating as part of a network within a region. This is primarily aimed at improving pati<Col N="1976"/>ent care but it will also avoid the emergence of the type of problems envisaged by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I have no direct function in relation to the staffing of private acute hospitals. According to the latest report on Consultant Staffing published by the National Hospitals Office, the number of consultants holding Category II posts, which entitles them to work in private hospitals, stands at 610 which represents 31% of the number of consultants available nationally. I would point out that it is open to private hospitals to recruit consultants who do not have commitments in the public hospital system.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 107 together.</P>
        <P>Screening is a service provided to apparently healthy people so that some who may go on to develop the disease may be diagnosed and treated effectively.  The aim is to reduce the number of people suffering and dying from a specified health condition.  As a process, screening has risks and benefits and is not without cost. <Col N="1977"/> My Department has an obligation to minimise risk and maximise benefit as efficiently as possible.</P>
        <P>The challenge for screening programmes is that there is a consistent and reliable approach to the criteria relating to the effectiveness and quality of screening programmes.  Equally valid is the need to ensure that screening programmes are tailored to population health needs and that they deliver tangible health benefits.</P>
        <P>Screening can be provided at the population level (comprehensive programmes that are population based and include recruitment, recall, follow-up and timely assessment of people with positive tests.)  Examples include cancer screening (breast and cervical), newborn screening for congenital abnormalities e.g. Phenylketonuria (PKU), child health screening.  Screening is also provided to prevent complications of disease especially related to chronic diseases.  Examples include diabetic retinopathy screening, and the identification of risk factors for cardiovascular disease including stroke through primary care.</P>
        <P>There are internationally recognised criteria for the provision and delivery of screening programmes e.g. those set by the World Health Organisation.  My Department is actively considering the most appropriate ways to monitor new developments in screening and how they should be evaluated.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Convention in question is primarily designed to reduce both the number of experiments and the number of animals used for such purposes.  Parties to the Convention are encouraged not to experiment on animals except where there is no alternative and to encourage research into alternative methods.  Animals to be experimented on should be selected on the basis of clearly established quantitative criteria and must be well cared for and spared avoidable suffering whenever possible.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, these outcomes are achieved in practice by the European Communities (Amendment to the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876) Regulations 2002 which give effect to Council Directive 86/609/EEC regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes.  However, ratification of the Convention would require primary legislation and, as there would be no additional protection of experimental animals, I could not justify allo<Col N="1978"/>cating resources for this purpose; accordingly, there are no proposals to proceed with ratifying the Convention.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88, 146 and 329 together.</P>
        <P>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collects data on MRSA bacteraemia (also known as bloodstream infection or &ldquo;blood poisoning&rdquo;) as part of the European Anti<Col N="1979"/>microbial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS).  EARSS collects data on the first episode of blood stream infection per patient per quarter.   The Irish data for EARSS, which is published on a quarterly basis by the HPSC, showed that there were 445 cases in 2002, 480 cases in 2003, 553 cases in 2004, 586 cases in 2005 and 285 reported cases in the first half of 2006.  It is difficult to identify the number of fatalities attributable to MRSA as many people also have significant co-morbidity factors.</P>
        <P>Clostridium difficile is not a notifiable disease and as a result it is difficult to quantify the extent of infection in the health care system.  However, Clostridium difficile infection was examined in The Third Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs) in acute hospitals in 2006.  The survey found that thirty-six patients had Clostridium difficile representing 0.5% of patients studied.  Clostridium difficile infection increases with age and is eight times more common in patients over 65 years compared to those under the age of 65 years.  The emergence of more virulent strains of Clostridium difficile which is partly due to over use of antibiotics underlines the importance of strict antibiotic stewardship in our health care system.</P>
        <P>This year, Ireland participated in the Hospital Infection Society&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections&rdquo; (HCAIs) in the United Kingdom and Ireland.  The survey, which included 45 Irish acute adult hospitals, including 8 private hospitals, provides accurate and comparable data on the prevalence of Health Care Associated Infections (including MRSA)  and can also be compared with similar data being obtained in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Preliminary results of this study are now available. The overall prevalence of health-care associated infection in the UK and Ireland study (these figures exclude Scotland) is 7.9%. The England figure is 8.2%, Wales 6.3%, Northern Ireland 5.5% and the Republic of Ireland 4.9%.  The prevalence of health-care associated infection was highest in regional/tertiary hospitals at 6% and lowest in specialist hospitals at 2%.   There is no room for complacency and HSE must continue to work with hospitals to control HCAIs.</P>
        <P>Community acquired MRSA infections are generally caused by strains of MRSA bacteria that differ to strains associated with hospitals.  The Irish National MRSA Reference Library carried out a preliminary study in 2005 to look for evidence of such community acquired strains of MRSA in Ireland.  They identified five patients with such strains, four of which appear to have acquired the infection outside Ireland.</P>
        <P>Measures to control the emergence and spread of HCAIs are necessary because there are fewer options available for the treatment of resistant <Col N="1980"/>infections and because these strains spread amongst vulnerable at-risk patients. The prudent use of antibiotics underpins any approach to the control of antibiotic resistant bacteria, including MRSA.  This, together with good professional practice and routine infection control precautions, such as hand hygiene, constitute the major measures in controlling and preventing healthcare-associated infection, including that caused by MRSA, both in hospital and in community health care units. While many HCAI are not preventable, we can make every effort to reduce the rates of infection and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>
        <P>A Strategy for the control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland (SARI) was launched in 2001 and includes recommendations such as hospital hygiene practise, appropriate antibiotic prescribing, active surveillance for the detection of MRSA and corporate/ clinical governance structures in the area of infection control.</P>
        <P>The base funding for MRSA and HCAI is &euro;4.5m.  The funds allocated to SARI since its launch are:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />2001: &euro;2,539,000</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />2002: &euro;4,383,000</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />2003: &euro;4,492,000</P>
        <P FLI="0">Funding for 2004 and 2005 has remained the same, with an increase in each year to allow for inflation.</P>
        <P>The HSE has appointed Dr. Kevin Kelleher, Assistant National Director of Health Protection, as the lead person nationally, for MRSA in the HSE.  He is supported by senior representatives of the NHO, PCCC and Risk Management as well as senior clinicians.  The HSE are shortly to publish a three year Action Plan which will set targets for the control and management of HCAIs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 117 and 119 together.</P>
        <P>The inspection of private nursing homes is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.   The 1990 Act provides for the registration of private nursing homes and procedures for attaching conditions to the registration and for de-registering homes.  The Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations, 1993 set out the standards which private nursing homes owners must adhere to in the provision of nursing home services.</P>
        <P>A Nursing Homes Inspection and Registration Working Group was established in July 2005 by the HSE and reported in July 2006. Among the recommendations of the report was the recruitment of dedicated inspection teams throughout the country, these teams to have staff with nursing, medical and mental health expertise, and other professionals available to them. The HSE is in the process of developing dedicated nursing home inspection teams and these have been developed in some areas.  Standardised documentation will be used by all inspection teams throughout the HSE. An Integrated Checklist will be adopted by all Inspection Teams and completed at each inspection by team members.  The HSE commenced publication of nursing home inspection reports on their website in September 2006.</P>
        <P>Priority is being given to the appointment of dedicated multi-disciplinary inspection teams whose remit solely covers all aspects of nursing home inspections, registrations and investigations.  A training programme is being developed and implemented for nursing home inspection teams which will address, in particular, report writing, elder abuse, legislation and training on appliances and clinical skills.  All of the mandatory inspections of nursing homes, i.e. the six-monthly inspections, will be unannounced. <Col N="1982"/> Follow-up inspections may be announced or unannounced.</P>
        <P>A Working Group was established by the Minister last year to produce draft standards for all long-term residential settings &mdash; public, private and voluntary. The Department is currently in discussion with interim Health Information and Quality Authority (iHIQA) in relation to a consultation process on these draft standards.</P>
        <P>The Health Bill 2006 will establish the Health Information and Quality Authority, or HIQA, and will put the Social Services Inspectorate, or SSI, on a statutory basis within HIQA. The intention is that the SSI will be required to monitor residential services provided to older persons against standards adopted or set by HIQA.  The Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services will be established as an Office within HIQA.  The Chief Inspector will have powers to cancel a registration or to add conditions to a registration.  He or she will also be able to seek the urgent cancellation of a registration by application to the courts in situations where he or she considers the health and well-being of a person is at risk.  The Health Bill will be published before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The Department and the HSE have progressed work on a number of initiatives as outlined above to ensure that all patients who require nursing home care are placed in appropriate settings that meet their needs. The Department will continue to work closely with the HSE to develop additional bed capacity, replace existing bed stock and to carry out necessary refurbishment and upgrading. In that context it is proposed to develop 50 Bed Units at a number of locations in Dublin and Cork and a number of other sites across the country.</P>

	<P>This Government is committed to the development of acute hospital services in each individual hospital, network, and region.  Each hospital, including Roscommon, has a role to play in providing acute hospital services.</P>
        <P>Our policy is to provide safe, high-quality services that achieve the best possible outcomes for patients.  This will mean that those services that can be safely delivered locally are delivered locally and the more complex services that require specialist input are concentrated at regional centres, or in the case of highly specialised services in national centres.  This approach is consistent with international best practice for the optimum delivery of patient care.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 143 together.</P>
        <P>Screening is a service provided to apparently healthy people so that some who may go on to develop the disease may be diagnosed and treated effectively.  The aim is to reduce the number of people suffering and dying from a specified health condition.  As a process, screening has risks and benefits and is not without cost.  My Department has an obligation to minimise risk and maximise benefit as efficiently as possible.</P>
        <P>The challenge for screening programmes is that there is a consistent and reliable approach to the criteria relating to the effectiveness and quality of screening programmes.  Equally valid is the need to ensure that screening programmes are tailored to population health needs and that they deliver tangible health benefits.</P>
        <P>Screening can be provided at the population level (comprehensive programmes that are population based and include recruitment, recall, follow-up and timely assessment of people with positive tests.)  Examples include cancer screening (breast and cervical), newborn screening for congenital abnormalities e.g. Phenylketonuria (PKU), child health screening.  Screening is also provided to prevent complications of disease especially related to chronic diseases.  Examples include diabetic retinopathy screening, and the identification of risk factors for cardiovascular disease including stroke through primary care.</P>
        <P>There are internationally recognised criteria for the provision and delivery of screening programmes e.g. those set by the World Health Organisation.  My Department is actively considering the most appropriate ways to monitor <Col N="1987"/>new developments in screening and how they should be evaluated.</P>

The Health Service Executive has confirmed that it fully accepts the recommendations made by Professor O&rsquo;Neill and has already addressed many of these that apply to the HSE.  </P>
        <P>My Department and the HSE will work together to implement the recommendations contained therein.  I believe this is the appropriate, continuing response to the Report.  It is the best course of action to assure patients of higher quality standards and services.  I understand that Professor O&rsquo;Neill has agreed to participate in a group to oversee the implementation of the recommendations.  I believe that this is the appropriate forum to consider the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Services for older people are a priority for the Government.  We are implementing significant <Col N="1988"/>changes to give the required assurance to older people about care standards.  A thorough and robust system of inspections is vital.  The Health Bill 2006, which is before Government and will be published imminently, will provide for the first time for an independent, statutory body to set standards and inspect all nursing home places, both public and private.  This will also strengthen the registration and de-registration process.  New standards for all long-term residential care facilities for older people have already been prepared.</P>
        <P>In 2006, the total budget for services for older people is &euro;1.2 billion, including an increase of &euro;150 million this year alone.  There will continue to be substantial funding increases for these services in 2007.  We have already carried out considerable work to prepare policy to overhaul the financial support system for people in long term care.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 127 together.</P>
        <P>My Department was recently made aware of a case of an elderly woman who, following treatment in the accident and emergency department of a public hospital, received a bill in respect of private services from a Consultant who attended to her there. Patients attending A&amp;E departments in public hospitals are deemed to be public patients and are not liable to pay Consultants&rsquo; private fees.  The fact that a patient may hold private health insurance does not alter this position.  My Department has brought the case to the attention of the Health Service Executive and requested that all public hospitals be reminded <Col N="1989"/>that there is no statutory basis for charging private fees in A&amp;E departments.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the medical organisations have taken issue with the action taken by my Department.  I wish to make it clear that I regard equitable access to A&amp;E services as a core principle.  The nature of A&amp;E services demands that no distinction be made between public or private patients.  The payment of private fees for duties undertaken in A&amp;E departments would totally undermine this principle.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 112 together.</P>
        <P>The inspection of private nursing homes is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.   The 1990 Act provides for the registration of private nursing homes and procedures for attaching conditions to the registration and for de-registering homes.  The Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations, 1993 set out the standards which private nursing homes owners must adhere to in the provision of nursing home services.</P>
        <P>A Nursing Homes Inspection and Registration Working Group was established in July 2005 by the HSE and reported in July 2006.  Among the recommendations of the report was the recruitment of dedicated inspection teams throughout the country, these teams to have staff with nursing, medical and mental health expertise, and other professionals available to them. The HSE is in the process of developing dedicated nursing home inspection teams and these have been developed in some areas.  Standardised documentation will be used by all inspection teams throughout the HSE.  An Integrated Checklist <Col N="1990"/>will be adopted by all Inspection Teams and completed at each inspection by team members.  The HSE commenced publication of nursing home inspection reports on their website in September 2006.</P>
        <P>Priority is being given to the appointment of dedicated multi-disciplinary inspection teams whose remit solely covers all aspects of nursing home inspections, registrations and investigations.  A training programme is being developed and implemented for nursing home inspection teams which will address, in particular, report writing, elder abuse, legislation and training on appliances and clinical skills.  All of the mandatory inspections of nursing homes, i.e. the six-monthly inspections, will be unannounced.  Follow-up inspections may be announced or unannounced.</P>
        <P>A Working Group was established by the Minister last year to produce draft standards for all long-term residential settings&ndash;public, private and voluntary.  The Department is currently in discussion with interim Health Information and Quality Authority (iHIQA) in relation to a consultation process on these draft standards.</P>
        <P>The Health Bill 2006 will establish the Health Information and Quality Authority, or HIQA, and will put the Social Services Inspectorate, or SSI, on a statutory basis within HIQA.  The intention is that the SSI will be required to monitor residential services provided to older persons against standards adopted or set by HIQA.  The Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services will be established as an Office within HIQA.  The Chief Inspector will have powers to cancel a registration or to add conditions to a registration.  He or she will also be able to seek the urgent cancellation of a registration by application to the courts in situations where he or she considers the health and well-being of a person is at risk.  The Health Bill will be published before the end of the year.</P>

	<P>The Strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, aims to develop services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, home helps, occupational therapists and others.</P>
        <P>It has been estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services in these areas.

This represents a significant increase over previous years and brings the total ongoing funding for this purpose to &euro;28m per annum.</P>
        <P>Of the &euro;16m provided, &euro;10m has been earmarked to establish up to 100 primary care teams, which will include some 300 additional frontline professionals.

The HSE is at present in the process of finalising arrangements for the establishment of Primary Care Teams in 2006.

	<P>In July 2005, I announced an initiative designed to provide up to 1,000 additional beds for public patients.  This will be achieved through the development of private hospitals on the sites of public hospitals, transferring private activity to those hospitals and freeing up beds currently reserved for private patients.</P>
        <P>As the charges levied on private health insurers for treating private patients in public hospitals are subsidised, the transfer of 1,000 beds will impact on private health insurance costs as private hospitals will have to charge the full economic rate, including the need for a return on their capital investment.  However, it is, in any case, Government policy that this subsidy be removed from public hospital beds.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 282 together.</P>
        <P>Since the publication of the Report of the National Task Force on Suicide in 1998 there has been a positive and committed response among both the statutory and voluntary sectors towards finding ways of tackling this tragic problem.  The Chief Executive Officers of the former Health Boards established the Suicide Review Group and Resource officers were appointed in all health boards with specific responsibility for implementing the Task Force&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
        <P>In 2003, the ongoing concern about reported rates of suicidal behaviour underlined the need to develop a national strategy for action on suicide prevention, building on earlier efforts and learning from national and international experiences.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Reach Out&rdquo; a National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention, 2005-2014 was launched in September 2005.  This strategy builds on the work <Col N="1993"/>of the National Task Force on Suicide and takes account of the efforts and initiatives developed by the former health boards in recent years.  During the two years developing the strategy, wide ranging consultation took place throughout the country to draw on the experience, perspectives and ideas of the key stakeholders and interested parties.  This consultation process, combined with continuous monitoring of evidence and best practice, allowed the project team to take both an evidence-based and pragmatic approach in prioritising actions to be undertaken by the various agencies and groups in order to effect real change over the next 5 to 10 years.</P>
        <P>Reach Out recommends a combined public health and high risk approach.  This approach to suicide prevention is also that advocated by the International Association for Suicide Prevention <Col N="1994"/>(IASP) and is in keeping with the European Action Plan for Mental Health which was signed and endorsed on behalf of ministers of health of the 52 member states of the European Region of the World Health Organisation at the Ministerial Conference on Mental Health in Helsinki, Finland in January 2005.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) is taking a lead role in overseeing the implementation of Reach Out, in partnership with those statutory and voluntary organisations that have a key role to play in making the actions happen.  In 2005, the HSE established the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) to oversee the implementation of the strategy.</P>
        <P>According to the Central Statistics Office, the number of registered deaths by suicide for each year since 1998 is as shown in the table.</P><Col N="1993"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 241 together.</P>
        <P>The cost of developing private hospitals on public sites must be seen in the context of delivering up to 1,000 acute hospital beds for public patients.  It also has to be seen in the context of the significant benefits that the HSE expects to receive in return for the concessions granted to the private operators.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has informed my Department that in 2005 the 10 public hospitals selected as sites for co-located private hospitals charged health insurers for a total of &euro;111 million.  I was informed by the HSE yesterday that, as a result of the ongoing public procurement exercise, the co-location initiative will not be proceeding on two public hospital sites at this time. These sites in question are Galway University Hospitals and Letterkenny General Hospital. Leaving aside those two hospitals, the figure reduces to &euro;88.6 million.</P>
        <P>In addition it is estimated that tax forgone under the capital allowances scheme will be about <Col N="1995"/>&euro;420 million over a 7 year cycle.  This is less than half the capital cost of providing the same number of beds through direct exchequer capital funding.</P>
        <P>A rigorous value for money assessment of each co-location proposal will be carried out by the HSE.  This has been a requirement from the start.  No project will proceed without the value for money to the State being demonstrated.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 267 together.</P>
        <P>I am committed to the full implementation of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy.  The Government has accepted the Report as the basis for the future development of our mental health services.  &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; provides a framework for action to develop a modern high quality mental health service over the next 7 to 10 years.</P>
        <P>In March 2006,  I appointed an independent monitoring group to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;.  The group will monitor and assess progress on the implementation of all the recommendations including those which fall under the responsibility of the HSE, government departments and other relevant agencies.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the individual recommendations of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; is a matter primarily for the HSE.  The HSE recently established an implementation group to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; a reality.  Both of these groups will play an important role in ensuring that the recommendations are implemented in a co-ordinated and timely manner.</P>
        <P>The Mental Health Act, 2001, which was fully implemented from 1st November 2006, significantly improves safeguards for mentally ill persons who are involuntarily admitted for psychiatric care and treatment and will bring Irish mental health law in this area into conformity with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  It provides a modern framework within which people who require treatment or protection can be cared for and treated.</P>
        <P>Mental Health Tribunals will conduct a review of each decision to detain a patient on an involuntary basis or to extend the duration of such detention.  The review will be independent, automatic and must be completed within 21 days of the detention order being signed.</P>
        <P>All involuntary patients detained in psychiatric hospitals under the provisions of the 1945 Act <Col N="1998"/>immediately before the 1 November 2006 will also have their cases reviewed by a Mental Health Tribunal.  This review must take place before the expiration of their existing detention orders in the case of temporary patients and within 6 months of the 1 November 2006 in the case of persons of unsound mind.</P>
        <P>The Inspector of Mental Health Services carries out inspections of all psychiatric hospitals and units, including private facilities, at least once a year.  The Mental Health Commission has introduced rules governing the use of ECT and the use of seclusion and mechanical means of bodily restraint and has issued Codes of Practice relating to the use of physical restraint in approved centres.</P>

	<P>The Health Services Executive recently published a Review of Neurosurgical Services in Ireland.  It identifies a clear need for significant investment in and organisational reform of neurosurgical services.</P>
        <P>Neurosurgery is currently provided at the national centre in Beaumont Hospital and in Cork University Hospital.  The Report recommends that the future development of safe, high quality neurosurgical services in Ireland would be best served by a two-pronged approach:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. Increased capacity in Dublin and Cork;</P>
        <P LI="1">2. Improved access to neurosurgical units, including transport and telemedicine facilities for referring hospitals.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The HSE is committed to progressing the recommendations of the Report.  It is undertaking a national neurosciences needs assessment. Neuroscience includes neurology, neurophysiology and neurosurgery. This assessment is guided by previous reviews of neurology and neurophysiology services and the recent report on neurosurgery. It aims to clearly identify the requirements for neuroscience services as a whole across the country.</P>
        <P>An additional &euro;3m was provided in 2006 to develop 3 new neurology units in Waterford, Limerick and Sligo through the appointment of 3 consultant neurology teams.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 318 together.</P>
        <P>I am committed to investing significantly in the implementation of the National Cancer Control Strategy.  The Estimates for 2007 include additional revenue funding of &euro;20.5m for cancer control.  This is an increase of 74% on the 2006 investment.</P>
        <P>This funding includes &euro;3.5m to support the initial implementation of the HSE National Cancer Control Programme.  The HSE will establish four Managed Cancer Control Networks to deliver the Programme.  Clinical leaders in oncology will be appointed to lead the delivery of quality multi-disciplinary care.  The main priorities are the establishment of the leadership team to implement the Programme, including the National Cancer Control Director and key medical leaders at network level.    The Programme will facilitate national standards for equity and access and will maximise ambulatory care.</P>
        <P>I will shortly establish a National Cancer Screening Service to amalgamate BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme (ICSP) to deliver both programmes nationally.  BreastCheck will commence national roll-out in Spring of next year.  The ICSP will commence roll-out in late 2007, based on an affordable model.  I have allocated additional funding of &euro;8m and &euro;5m to BreastCheck and the ICSP respectively to deliver on these commitments.  The Service will also advise in relation to a colorectal cancer screening programme.</P>
        <P>My Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive and the National Development Finance Agency to progress the delivery of the National Radiation Oncology Plan for which additional revenue funding of &euro;3.25m has been allocated in 2007.  This will support the appointment of additional Consultant Radiation Oncologists, Specialist Registrars and support staff.  Six new linear accelerators will be provided in the Eastern Region in the short term, two in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin in late 2007 to provide much needed interim capacity pending roll-out of the national plan and two each in St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont Hospitals by early 2009.</P>

	<P>In relation to the standard and quality of services and facilities in nursing homes the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993, made under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, set out the standards which private nursing homes must adhere to. Article 19.1(h) of the Regulations state that &ldquo;In every nursing home the following particulars shall be kept in a safe place in respect of each dependent person; a record of any occasion on which physical or chemical restraint is used, the nature of the restraint and its duration&rdquo;.  In addition, a Working Group was established by the Department to develop standards for residential care settings, both public and private, for older people.</P>
        <P>The Department is currently in discussion with the interim Health Information and Quality Authority in relation to a consultation process on the draft standards.

A number of short-term measures are to be prioritised for implementation as part of the HSE Winter Initiative.</P>
        <P>The number of patients in acute hospitals whose discharge has been delayed has fallen significantly, reflecting the positive impact of the current initiative of discharging patients to private nursing homes, and the increase in the number of home care packages that have been made available.  A number of initiatives are underway to address capacity issues in the long-stay care and community settings.  The HSE has developed proposals in relation to additional private nursing home beds, as well as additional extended care beds in the public sector, including 350 beds in Community Nursing Units in the Dublin region where the difficulty in accessing extended care beds has been most acute.</P>
        <P>A Steering Group has been established under the chairmanship of the National Director of the National Hospitals Office to review our acute hospital bed requirements  up to the year 2020.   The Group includes representatives of the Health Service Executive, my Department, the Department of Finance and the Economic and Social Research Institute.   The Health Service Executive is about to appoint external consultants to carry out the review.  The review will provide for an assessment of acute bed capacity requirements for Ireland to 2020 and will be published when it is completed.</P>

	<P>The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act, 2006 came into effect on 30 June 2006. The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the scheme. Accordingly, all queries relating to the operation of the scheme are referred to the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive for investigation and direct reply.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised the Department that the Scheme Administrator has recently issued correspondence to all public representatives informing <Col N="2004"/>them that a facility has been put in place to make enquiries apart from the information phone line which is in place to assist the general public. As well as direct communication the Scheme Administrator is also working with bodies such as the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE and Regional Health Forums to ensure public representatives are kept up to date about the scheme and its progress.</P>
        <P>The HSE has also advised the Department that written queries received are dealt with by the Scheme Administrator and that there is no e-mail facility available. Queries can also be directed to the Health Repayment Scheme helpline 1890 886 886.</P>
        <P>In relation to dates of repayments to applicants, the HSE has informed the Department that over 21,000 forms have been submitted to the scheme administrator applying for repayments and these applications are being processed at present. The timeframe for repayment is predicated primarily on whether the applicant is alive or whether the application is being made by the estate of a deceased person. Living people who were wrongly charged will be the first to receive payments under the scheme. It is estimated that there are now in the region of 15,000 people within this category.</P>

The Group submitted its report on 31 January 2003.  The report was published in February 2004 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.doh.ie</i>, along with reports prepared for the Group by Indecon International Economic Consultants.</P>
        <P>On foot of the recommendations of the Pharmacy Review Group, my Department commenced drafting new pharmacy legislation in two pharmacy Bills.  I consider the first Bill a priority piece of legislation.  It will deal with the governance of the Pharmaceutical Society, registration and fitness to practice issues.  It will also remove the EU derogation for supervisory pharmacists (where only Irish-trained pharmacists can supervise pharmacies less than 3 years old).  The general scheme and draft heads of the first Bill were approved by Government on 25th May 2006.  Work on the drafting of the Bill is ongoing between my officials and the Parliamentary Counsel&rsquo;s Office.  Subject to the Cabinet&rsquo;s approval, I hope to publish the Bill before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The second Bill will address the regulation of pharmacy and pharmacy services, including the definition of pharmacy services and of a community pharmacy, enhanced provisions for the inspection of pharmacies, and the provision for regulation of pharmacies for matters such as physical conditions, standards, record keeping and promotional activities.  It is also proposed to deal with general provisions relating to community pharmacy contracts for services, as well as the remaining recommendations of the Pharmacy Review Group.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>On Tuesday 28th of November I announced that I had decided that there would be no further examination of the question of Vaccine Trials involving babies and children in institutional settings in 1960/61, 1970 and 1973.  The trials which involved both children in institutional settings and within the family home, were the subject of a report by the Chief Medical Officer, Dr Jim Kiely, which was laid before the Oireachtas in November 2000.</P>
        <P>This decision follows a detailed examination of judgements in court cases heard in both the High and Supreme Court.  As the House is aware, Justice &Oacute; Caoimh in the High Court in June 2004 adjudged that the essential issue of the matter  was not one suggestive of abuse as defined in the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000. The Judge was satisfied that nothing disclosed in Dr Kiely&rsquo;s report suggests that the conduct of the trials was such that they could be said in any way to amount to abuse as defined by the 2000 Act. Justice &Oacute; Caoimh was conscious that  the term abuse is widely defined in the Act, but in his judgement it was clear that none of the issues raised in Dr Kiely&rsquo;s report were even suggestive of abuse as so defined in the conduct of the trials.  Justice &oacute; Caoimh adjudged that the Additional Functions Order which sought to allow the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse to inquire into the matter of Vaccine trials was <i>ultra vires</i>.</P>
        <P>I understand that it is difficult for people to accept not knowing exactly what occurred when they were children in these institutions and  that those who were participants in the trials may be disappointed at my decision but the difficulties encountered to date would undoubtedly arise again if this matter was to be investigated by another forum.  These difficulties include the availability of persons with a necessary knowledge of events and the scarcity of documentary records of the trials.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that there is no evidence available which suggests that any of the participants in the trials had experienced reactions to <Col N="2008"/>the vaccines other than those normally expected.  There can be no doubt that the consent for the trials described in Dr Kiely&rsquo;s report were certainly not those that would be applied today.

	<P>The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) is responsible for the protection and promotion of public and animal health, through the evaluation and supervision of medicines for human and veterinary use.  It co-ordinates the evaluation and supervision of medicinal products throughout the European Union and brings together the scientific resources of the 25 EU Member States in a network of 42 competent national authorities.  A network of some 3,500 European experts underpins the scientific work of the EMEA and its committees.</P>
        <P>Tamiflu is an antiviral drug  approved in the European Union for the treatment of influenza in children between 1 and 13 years of age and for the prevention and treatment of influenza in adults and in adolescents over 13 years of age.  Two cases of alleged suicide associated with the treatment of influenza (involving a 17 year old boy in February 2004 and a 14 year old boy in February 2005) were reported to the EMEA.  In both cases the adolescents exhibited abnormal/disturbed behaviour prior to their deaths.</P>
        <P>No causal relationship has been identified between the use of Tamiflu and psychiatric symptoms (such as hallucination and abnormal behaviour).  All adverse reactions of Tamiflu are monitored and assessed by the Agency&rsquo;s scientific committee, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on a continuous basis.  In addition, close monitoring of psychiatric disorders has been in place for Tamiflu since February 2003 at the request of the EMEA, following the safety information provided by the manufacturers November 2002.</P>
        <P>The CHMP, at its meeting of 14-17 November 2005, decided to request the Marketing Authorisation Holder of Tamiflu to provide a cumulative <Col N="2009"/>safety review of all available data on serious psychiatric disorders, including all case reports with a fatal outcome where Tamiflu was involved.  Further to the evaluation of the data submitted in November 2005, the CHMP concluded that close monitoring of psychiatric disorders should continue.</P>
        <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the statutory body responsible for the regulation of human and veterinary medicines in Ireland.  The Board works closely with both the EMEA and other European regulatory bodies on issues of safety concerning medicinal products.  As with all medicinal products, the Board will continue to assess new information concerning Tamiflu and take appropriate action, where necessary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure of &euro;111 million is an estimate by Health Service Executive of the amount that the 10 public hospitals selected as sites for co-located private hospitals charged private health insurers in 2005.  I was informed by the HSE yesterday that, as a result of the ongoing public procurement exercise, the colocation initiative will not be proceeding on two public hospital sites at this time. These sites in question are Galway University Hospitals and Letterkenny General Hospital. Leaving aside those two hospitals, the figure reduces to &euro;88.6 million.</P>
        <P>The loss of private insurance income to public hospitals arising from the colocation initiative must be seen in the context of the freeing up of 1,000 beds that are currently reserved for private patients.  It also has to be seen in the context of the significant benefits that the HSE expects to receive in return for the concessions granted to the private operators.</P>

	<P>The Influenza Pandemic Expert Group is finalising its report for publication later this month. I can confirm that our pandemic influenza preparedness strategy includes the stockpiling of supplies of Tamiflu and Relenza.</P>
        <P>An emergency supply of over 45,000 treatment packs of the antiviral drug, Tamiflu, was purchased in 2004. A further 1 million treatment packs of Tamiflu have now been stockpiled as part of our pandemic preparedness strategy.  This quantity is sufficient to treat 25% of the population and is in line with international trends. We have also stockpiled 63kg of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (oseltamivir phosphate powder). This will allow for treatment of approximately 60,000 children aged between 1 and 5 years of age.</P>
        <P>We are also stockpiling 706,000 courses of Relenza. This is sufficient to cover 20% of the population over the age of seven. This antiviral can be used in the event of resistance developing to the first line drug, Tamiflu, and will also provide cover if the clinical attack rate is higher than 25%. This stockpile will be complete by September 2007; the first 70,000 courses have been delivered.</P>

	<P>The full provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001 came into operation on 1 November 2006. The Mental Health Act 2001 significantly improves safeguards for persons who are involuntarily admitted for psychiatric care and treatment.  The Act changes the procedure for involuntary admissions and provides for an automatic and independent review all involuntary detentions by a mental health tribunal.  This brings Irish mental health legislation into line with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  A review of the operation of the Act will be carried out in 2007 and any concerns will be examined in this context.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I regard the continued development of rehabilitation services as an essential element of providing appropriate care to patients across a wide range of health services.  In April 2003, Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al submitted a report of a review of neurology and neurophysiology services.</P>
        <P>It recommended a significant enhancement of services, including increases in consultant manpower.  It also recognised that there are aspects of a number of other specialties and services, such as rehabilitation medicine, geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry, which are related to and overlap with neurology services.  It recommended that a national multi-disciplinary review of rehabilitation services be undertaken to further inform the policy framework in relation to the development of neurology services.</P>
        <P>Consistent with this recommendation, and in line with commitments in the National Health <Col N="2014"/>Strategy, a national action plan for rehabilitation services is currently being prepared by my Department in consultation with the HSE.  The action plan will set out a programme to meet existing shortfalls in services and to integrate specialised facilities with locally based follow-up services.  This will be informed by Comhairle Report and the work undertaken by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland.  The intention is to have a comprehensive policy framework for the future development of neurology and neurophysiology services in this country.</P>
        <P>Additional revenue funding has been made available in 2005 and 2006 and an additional &euro;4m will be provided in 2007 to the HSE to support the development of neurology/neurophysiology services in a number of regions, having regard to agreed priorities.  The continuing  development of the services is a matter for the Health Service Executive, having regard to available funding and other competing service priorities.</P>

	<P>I am aware that the drugs Suboxone and Subutex (active ingredient buprenorphine) is an alternative choice to methadone in the treatment of opiate dependent addicts.</P>
        <P>The current position is that Subutex (buprenorphine only) can be prescribed to opiate users by addiction service consultants in specialist drug treatment clinics, where the prescription and dispensing of Subutex is tightly controlled.</P>
        <P>I am informed that the combination drug Suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone combined) has recently been granted an EU license via central procedure by the EMEA, and that preliminary studies have shown that the combination drug is as effective as Subutex (buprenorphine alone) in the management of opioid dependence and that it has less abuse potential.</P>
        <P>My Department is considering the implications of the introduction of the combination drug Suboxone and its use as a possible treatment for opiate dependency. In that context, my officials will be meeting the license holders, Schering-Plough in the coming week to discuss the best approach on its probable Irish launch in early 2007.</P>

	<P>In 2006, total health funding is &euro;13.147 billion, which represents an underlying increase of 12.04% over 2005. The vast bulk of this funding is provided under the vote of the Health Service Executive (HSE) which has statutory responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.  This continuing high level of investment by the Government provides the Executive with considerable capacity to address the healthcare needs of the population in the most effective manner.</P>

	<P>Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future. The Deputy may wish to note that between end-1997 and June 2006 there has been an increase of nearly 39,000 Whole-Time Equivalent posts (+58%) in employment levels for the health services.</P>
        <P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

        <P FLI="0">These consultancies in the main related to the modernisation of the Civil Service, both as it relates to my Department and across the Civil Service generally.  These included for example Employee and Customer Surveys, Regulatory Reform initiatives etc.</P>
        <P>Consultants were also engaged to deal with aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU in 2004, as well as to provide expertise and advice on matters relating to the successful implementation of Social Partnership Agreements.</P>
        <P>Every effort is made by my Department to minimise expenditure on Consultancy Services. However, where it is necessary to engage consultants in order to avail of their particular expertise or experience, the procurement of consultancy services is subject to tendering procedures as laid down in Public Procurement Guidelines and, where applicable, EU procurement rules and guidelines.</P>
        <P>The procurement of consultancy services in my Department is subject to Public Procurement Guidelines from the Department of Finance as set out in &ldquo;Guidelines for Engagement of Consultants in the Civil Service &mdash; 1999&rdquo;.   Procurement of outside expertise in the public relations field is also subject to Public Procurement Guide<Col N="2019"/>lines as set out in the 2004 Department of Finance publication &ldquo;Public Procurement Guidelines &mdash; Competitive Process&rdquo;, which replaced the previous Department of Finance guidance entitled &ldquo;Public Procurement  &mdash; 1994 Edition (Green Book)&rdquo;.  In addition, the procurement of these services is also subject to applicable EU Procurement rules and guidelines.  There are also additional guidelines agreed by Government specifically for PR and communication type consultancies which are now incorporated into the Cabinet Handbook.</P>
        <P>The application of these guidelines requires that appropriate competitive procurement procedures are carried out in order to select the best service available, taking account of a number of important criteria including cost, the ability to undertake the work required and other relevant criteria, which may vary from project to project. This is an objective process, which results in selection of a provider, which should provide good value for money.</P>
        <P>Every effort is also made to reduce the cost of consultancy by providing, where possible, any administrative or other support from existing resources within the Department.  It is also our policy that skills-transfer from consultants to Departmental staff takes place as an integral part of all consultancy engagements.  The purpose of this is to increase the knowledge and expertise of Departmental staff and to reduce and, if possible, eliminate future dependance on consultants in the areas concerned.</P>
        <P>There are a number of safeguards in place which give assurance that value for money is obtained. These include:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Competitive selection processes in accordance with the Guidelines for engagement of consultants, which ensure that the most economically advantageous proposal is selected;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Monitoring of the work of consultants on a regular basis throughout the engagement and the use of appropriate project management techniques to ensure that the work is proceeding according to schedule;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Placing of Department staff to work on project teams alongside consultants to benefit from skills transfer;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Payment of fees according to the achievement of pre-agreed milestones; and</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Approval of expenditure on consultancy projects at the appropriate level depending on the scale and nature of each engagement.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am satisfied that these guidelines and procedures are followed in my Department and are fully reflected in the Department&rsquo;s internal procedures including the training provided to relevant staff.</P><Col N="2020"/>
        <P>The use of consultants by my Department has decreased substantially over the period 2003 to 2005 and there is in fact a relatively small provision in the Estimate for my Department of &euro;143,000 in 2006 and &euro;145,000 in 2007. I consider that this relatively small provision made for consultancy services in my Department&rsquo;s Vote is necessary and appropriate for the effective discharge of its functions.</P>

	<P>The Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003 already apply to personal data recorded through the operation of CCTV systems or other monitoring equipment.</P>
        <P>The Privacy Bill which was published on 4 July 2006 creates an offence to be known as the tort of invasion of privacy, for a person wilfully and without lawful authority to violate the privacy of another individual. Where material obtained from closed circuit television or other monitoring equipment may be used in an inappropriate manner, then the aggrieved person will have an accessible remedy in law.</P>
        <P>The Privacy Bill contains a defence (in Section 5) in a privacy action for a defendant to prove that the act in respect of which a privacy action is being brought consisted of the installation or operation, in good faith, of a closed circuit television system or other surveillance system for a purpose authorised by law, or for the purpose of detecting or preventing the commission of an offence or the protection of persons or property.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, under the provisions of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, the Property Registration Authority was established as and from 4 November, 2006. The Property Registration Authority replaces the Registrar of Deeds and Titles as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland and, subject to the above Act, is independent in the performance of its functions.</P>
        <P>In order to be of assistance I forwarded the Deputy&rsquo;s registration query to the Authority for its attention and direct reply.  I understand that a reply has already issued.</P>
        <P>I would also like to refer the Deputy to my letter of 26 May, 2006 to members of the Oireachtas regarding a new service for T.D.s and Senators concerning the current status of applications of this type.  As outlined in my letter, the service was introduced, inter alia, to provide a speedier and more cost effective alternative to submitting Parliamentary Questions.</P>

        <P>In the interests of fairness to all concerned, it is the practice of the Citizenship Division to process cases in chronological order based upon the date of receipt of the application. However, due to the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, I understand that a submission will shortly be made to my Office for decision on whether this case might be expedited.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 and 167 together.</P>
        <P>Traffic Corps personnel deployments are designed to optimise service delivery and are intended to match as closely as possible operational demands in the areas of both traffic management and traffic law enforcement.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that peak traffic times in Dublin on weekdays are approximately 07.00 to 10.30 and 16.00 to 20.00, when the primary focus of Traffic Corps personnel is on traffic management.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel, including Traffic Corps personnel, in accordance with requirements. Such allocations are continually  monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy,  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.  I am informed that the strength of the Traffic Corps in the Dublin Metropolitan Region as of 15 November was 263 members.</P>
        <P>The Assistant Commissioner in charge of Traffic has been tasked with implementing the recommendations contained in the Strategic Review of Traffic Policing which will see 1,200 personnel attached to the Traffic Corps by 2008.  This increase of personnel is taking place on a phased basis as the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increases to 14,000.</P><Col N="2023"/>
        <P>Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are not members of the Traffic Corps have the responsibility, inter alia, to deal with traffic duties when breaches of road traffic law occur.  Marked and unmarked patrol vehicles driven by these members are therefore also available for road traffic law enforcement on a daily basis.</P>

        <P>I am also informed that the Directive stated that as a matter of policy the powers should be utilised unless the circumstances pertaining, such as the need to render medical assistance, require otherwise.</P>
        <P>It is the policy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make the fullest use of all legislative powers available in investigating the commission of offences, including road traffic offences.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 on Thursday, 16 November, 2006, following the attestation of 299 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel <Col N="2027"/>strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 on Thursday, 16 November, 2006, following the attestation of 299 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have a duty and responsibility to enforce all aspects of road traffic legislation on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>Between now and 2008, it is planned that the Traffic Corps will increase its numbers to a complement of 1,200.  The new members will be assigned to areas identified to be in most need of additional resources to pursue enforcement strategies.</P>
        <P>I should also say that an additional 163 Probationer Garda&iacute; have been allocated to the Dublin Metropolitan Region since 17 November, 2006 with particular responsibility for the enforcement of Operation &lsquo;Freeflow&rsquo; which came into effect on Monday 27 November, 2006 and will continue until 7 January, 2007.</P>
        <P>Garda Management state that Traffic Management and enforcement duties are carried out as part of normal operational policing duties and, as such, are not assigned a specific budget within the total Garda Vote. Therefore, it is not possible to quantify the cost of Garda duties dedicated to traffic and road safety enforcement. However, I am informed that funds provided are consistent with the objectives in the Annual Policing Plan which include Garda duties and initiatives in relation to road traffic matters.</P>
        <P>I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there were two calls received by Clontarf Garda Station during October and November concerning scrambler motorcycles in the area referred to. These calls were attended to by Garda&iacute; who located and took possession of two motorcycles for the purpose of establishing ownership of same. However, no reports of damage to the pitches referred to have been received by the Garda authorities. The pitches are patrolled by foot and bicycle units.</P>
        <P>I understand the local authority has recently erected new railings which should act as a deterrent to the activity referred to by the Deputy.</P>

        <Quest> the position of applicants who include an Irish citizen child and a non-national parent or parents who apply or have applied to stay in the State under administrative arrangements established in 2005 which became known as the IBC/05 scheme, consequent upon a recent decision of the High Court delivered on judicial review proceedings on 14 November 2006; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the administrative arrangements announced by me on 15 January 2005, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 Scheme, applications for permission to remain in the State were received from non EU national parents of Irish citizen children who were  born in the State prior to 1 January 2005.</P>
        <P>In order to qualify for permission to remain in the State under the IBC/05 Scheme each applicant had to satisfy defined criteria.  Some 17,917 applications were received of which a total of 16,984 applicants were granted permission to remain in the State. A further 933 applicants were refused under the IBC/05 Scheme. Each applicant who was refused under the revised arrangements was advised of the reasons for their refusal in writing.</P>
        <P>The closing date for the receipt of applications was 31 March 2005. Applications received after this date were considered as &ldquo;late applications&rdquo; and were returned unprocessed to the applicants. <Col N="2029"/>A number of applicants who were refused under the IBC/05 Scheme challenged their refusal decision by way of Judicial Review proceedings.  The judgments delivered in the High Court on 14 November 2006, as referred to by the Deputy, were test case proceedings taken in relation to the IBC/05 Scheme.</P>
        <P>I am currently considering an appeal to the Supreme Court of the High Court judgements delivered on 14 November 2006.  As the outcome of such an appeal is inextricably linked to the position of the applicants referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I am unable to comment further until those proceedings, if any, have been determined.</P>

	<P>The person concerned submitted an application for residence on the basis that he is the spouse of an EU citizen, having married the EU citizen in Ireland on the 25 January, 2006.</P>
        <P>The application has been examined under the provisions of the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2006. These Regulations give effect in Irish Law to the European Directive on the rights of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States (Directive 2004/38/EC).</P>
        <P>An examination of the documentation submitted shows the person who is subject to Irish entry visa requirements did not obtain the appropriate Irish entry visa prior to their arrival in the State.  While he was issued with a UK entry visa this only entitled him to enter the territory of the United Kingdom. UK entry visas are not valid for entry to this State . It is therefore the case that the person entered the State illegally, and has remained illegally in the State for a number of years.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Immigration Division of my Department has recently informed the person concerned that he does not qualify for residence on the basis sought.  A further letter will be issued to him shortly outlining the various options open to him.</P>

	<P>The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</P>
        <P>The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.</P>
        <P>Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.</P>
        <P>While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  I understand that applications received in May 2006 are currently being dealt with.</P>

        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that a working group was established by the Commissioner to bring forward new proposals governing the behaviour of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the acceptance of gifts, hospitality and sponsorship. It is envisaged that their report will be finalised in early 2007.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 to 196, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am informed that at an inquest on 26 April, 2004 into the death of the person referred to by the Deputy, the jury brought in a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence that the cause of death was due to immersion in fresh water.</P>
        <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that as a result of allegations made by the family of the person the Garda authorities examined the investigation file on the death of that person, as a result of which they decided that a Superintendent from outside the Garda District where the death took place should carry out a new investigation.  This investigation is now completed and I received the findings of this investigation on 28 November, 2006. I am currently examining the findings of the report.</P>
        <P>I understand that in the second investigation the Garda authorities did not find evidence to substantiate the allegations regarding the cause of death or the conduct of the original investigation.  However, that second investigation did find that some aspects of the original investigation could have been carried out more professionally, but that these did not affect the outcome of the investigation.</P><Col N="2038"/>
        <P>In addition to the second Garda investigation, I further understand that the State Pathologist reviewed two medical opinions obtained by the family and also the post mortem findings. She did not find anything to cast doubt on the inquest&rsquo;s findings.</P>
        <P>I am advised that arising from the findings of the second investigation the Assistant Garda Commissioner for the Eastern Region has been directed by the Garda Commissioner to address the issues highlighted in the report and to report on the action taken on them. In addition, he has been directed by the Garda Commissioner to have correspondence received from an RTE correspondent, including contents of a Radio interview conducted by that correspondent, examined to ascertain if the interview disclosed any new information which would warrant further investigation by the Garda authorities. I have asked for a report on the Assistant Commissioner&rsquo;s findings.</P>
        <P>I also understand that the second Garda investigation file has been forwarded to the Law Officers and their directions are awaited.  It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Garda management are satisfied that all criminal incidents reported to them are being recorded. Incidents are recorded on PULSE on the basis of the criminal offence they disclose, which may range from homicide to minor assault, whether related to domestic violence or otherwise.</P>
        <P>I understand that instructions relating to the recording of incidents involving domestic violence were issued by the Garda authorities earlier this year and the operation of this policy is being monitored.</P>
        <P>Statistics relating to the number of breaches of court orders issued under domestic violence legislation have been published in the Garda Annual Report since 2004.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that until 2004 statistics published were generated from a stand alone paper based system.  Since 2004 the statistics published are based on the number of breaches of court orders issued under domestic violence legislation as recorded on the PULSE system.  The PULSE data is more comprehensive and provides a greater level of detail about detections, arrests, proceedings and a more complete view of breaches of domestic violence legislation than that provided by the previous system.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202 to 204, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In relation to the two storey building incorporating administration and visitors facilities at Loughan House the position is as follows.  A number of modular accommodation units which were procured by the Office of Public Works in the context of the provision of asylum seeker accommodation and which were subsequently surplus to  requirements were utilised to provide a new building incorporating visiting and administration facilities at Loughan House in 2004.  This resulted in a significant saving in the overall cost of the project.  The contract for the work involved was awarded to Glenbeigh Construction Ltd who submitted the most competitive quotation for a prison construction project on 22 March 2002 under the terms of a tender competition dated March 2002.  The tender included a provision for draw-down facility as required by the Prison Service.  A total of six companies were invited to submit tenders for the above project.</P>
        <P>A subsequent competition which was advertised in the EU Journal on 2 July 2004 sought expressions of interest from firms to provide an additional  accommodation block at Loughan House.  The notice also stated that the Prison Service reserved the right to enter negotiations with the successful contractor in relation to other prison projects within a duration of three years from the initial contract.  A total of nine submissions were received and following an assessment process a short-list of four contractors was selected for a formal tender competition.  The lowest tender subsequently received was from Glenbeigh Construction.  A contract was awarded under the tender in respect of a general refurbishment of the existing bedroom accommodation which is now complete.  The construction of a new 60 place  accommodation unit for offenders with self contained bathroom and shower facilities is also now underway by Glenbeigh Construction under the above tender.  Other works being carried out at Loughan House under this tender include a new education and general purpose building, the replacement of the dilapidated fence surrounding the facility, and repairs to the roof of the main building.</P>

	<P>Employee contributions to approved occupational pension schemes, including AVCs, are exempt from income tax, subject to certain limits, as are contributions made by self-employed individuals to retirement annuity contracts.  Similar relief applies to contributions to personal retirement savings accounts (PRSAs).  With effect from 1 January 2006, the maximum annual tax relieved contribution that an individual may make towards all of his or her pension funds is determined by the individual&rsquo;s age and the level of his or her remuneration, subject to an overall earnings cap which currently stands at &euro;254,000.  The <Col N="2043"/>age related percentage limits are as shown in the table.</P>

        <P FLI="0">If the pension contribution (including an AVC contribution) exceeds these percentages, the excess contribution can be brought forward to a following tax year against relevant earnings for tax relief purposes (subject of course to the above annual percentages not being exceeded in any one tax year).</P>
        <P>I understand that the position regarding PRSI refunds on pension contributions (which also cover the health contribution elements of PRSI), insofar as it relates to individuals paying tax through the PAYE system, was set out to you in a recent response  to a question to my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan.  My understanding is that such refunds do not apply in the case of self-employed individuals paying tax under the self-assessment system.</P>

	<P Just="Left">By using capital allowances for the construction of private hospitals, I believe that the hospitals will come on stream quicker than if they were being provided by the public sector.  The Government is committed to exploring fully the scope for the private sector to provide additional capacity needed in the health system.  The HSE will be able to take up a proportion of the additional beds at a discounted price to address their waiting lists - the legislation specifies that a qualifying hospital must undertake to make available 20% of its capacity for public patients at a discount of 10%.  The effect of this measure will be to reduce the pressure on public hospital beds.  Providing hospital facilities for those with private health insurance in private hospitals will enable more beds in public hospitals to be made available for public patients.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I should also point out that the scheme of capital allowances for the construction of private hospitals was reviewed by Indecon Economic Consultants as part of the overall review of property tax incentives in 2005.  Indecon consulted <Col N="2044"/>widely in the course of their review, including consultations with the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive.  The report was published on 6 February and is available on my Department's website.  Among the findings of the review, it is stated that: "While it is too early to provide detailed estimates of the impact of the scheme on the supply and on the costs of hospital beds, Indecon believes the scheme has the potential to address supply shortages in the sector and to reduce costs."</P>

	<P>The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the Sixth VAT Directive, Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex H of the EU Sixth VAT Directive.  While Annex H does include the supply of children&rsquo;s car seats, it does not include car safety equipment.  The reduced rate cannot therefore be applied to such goods.</P>
        <P>With the exception of child car seats the only rate of VAT that can apply to car safety equipment, under EU law, is the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot accept the Deputy&rsquo;s contention that an injustice exists in the BMW region.</P>
        <P>Under the National Development Plan/ Community Support Framework (NDP/CSF) 2000-2006, there has been substantial investment in infrastructure &mdash; such as roads, public transport, water and waste services &mdash; in health facilities, social housing, education, industry and rural development in Ireland.  The most recent information available to my Department indicates that some &euro;48 billion had been spent by the end of June 2006, with &euro;13 billion spent in the BMW region.  This represents a sizable investment in the region.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware of the general state of play in relation to expenditure in the BMW region from previous debates and questions on <Col N="2045"/>this issue.  The figures reported at the recent Monitoring Committee meetings indicate that some &euro;11.1 billion or 82% of forecast Exchequer and EU expenditure had been incurred by the end of June 2006.</P>
        <P>In view of the slow start up in some areas at the beginning of the programme and the relatively disappointing response in certain demand led schemes due mainly to the impact of the slowdown in economic activity in 2000-02, the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and a lower than anticipated take up of financial opportunities by the private sector, this can be considered to be a good implementation rate.</P>
        <P>Based on the most recent information available to my Department, I anticipate that by the end of the programme period which under EU Rules, does not actually end at the end of 2006 but rather continues to 2008, the original forecasts for Exchequer and EU spending in the BMW region will largely be met.</P>
        <P>Results over the 2000 to mid-2006 period show that, from a slow start up, there has been a steadily improving trend with over &euro;5.8 billion invested in the BMW region under the key Economic and Social Infrastructure programme &mdash; of which &euro;1.1 billion was invested in 2005 alone representing 105% of forecast expenditure for that year.  Under that programme, almost &euro;1.8 billion was invested in national roads, &euro;2.1 billion on housing, over &euro;850 million on water and waste services and &euro;819 million on health facilities.  Under the Employment and Human Resources programme, &euro;4 billion has been invested in the BMW region to end June 2006.  The other operational programmes show investment of &euro;2.5 billion under the BMW regional programme, &euro;837 million under the Productive Sector programme and &euro;120 million under the Peace and Technical Assistance programmes.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the Region under the current NDP/CSF is delivering results.  The ESRI carried out a mid-term evaluation of the NDP/CSF 2000-2006 which stated that the BMW region had all but closed the gap with the S&amp;E region in respect of the rate of unemployment and employment growth.  The ESRI in its recent ex-ante assessment of investment priorities for NDP 2007-2013 concludes: &ldquo;The current NDP has greatly enhanced the economic and social infrastructure of the State with major benefits to economic development throughout all regions&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the BMW region does not cease when the current funding round draws to a close.  Investment to achieve more balanced regional development is a key Government priority.  An important objective of the next NDP (2007-2013) will be the promotion of balanced regional development in line with the National Spatial Strategy (the NSS).  The details of the strategy for regional development will have to await publication of the Plan.  I am confident that the level of ambition in the overall NDP <Col N="2046"/>2007-2013 investment envelope combined with a commitment to utilise this investment to implement the NSS will lead to a better balance in economic development.</P>
        <P>In addition, the BMW region will also receive an EU Structural Funds allocation of &euro;458 million under the next round of funding for 2007-2013.</P>

	<P>It is assumed that the information sought by the Deputy is the additional excise duty on a litre of petrol that would be required to produce the same yield as Vehicle Registration Tax in the event of that tax being abolished.</P>
        <P>On the basis that the VRT yield for 2006 will be approximately &euro;1,300 million, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a yield of this amount from excise duty and additional VAT could be achieved by increasing the excise duty on a litre of unleaded petrol by 85 cent. This method assumes that the normal price elasticity factors will apply and consumption would fall as a result.  However, if there were no change in purchasing patterns or consequent reduction in consumption the increase required would be 54 cent per litre.</P>
        <P>In the scenario outlined in this reply there is no provision for a price increase in diesel and additional yield does not therefore arise.</P>

        <Quest> the criteria a person must meet in order to qualify for the disabled drivers fuel refund; his views on expanding the scheme to include long-term disabled drivers not at present eligible under the disabled drivers scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and VRT (up to certain limit) on the purchase of a car adapted for the transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, as well as relief from excise on the fuel used in the car up to a certain limit.</P>
        <P>The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.  To get the Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions:</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</P>
        <P LI="1">(b) be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</P>
       <P LI="1">(c) be without both hands or without both arms;</P>
         <P LI="1">(d) be without one or both legs;</P>
         <P LI="1">(e) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</P><Col N="2050"/>
         <P LI="1">(f) have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Senior Medical Officer (SMO) for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the SMO to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.</P>
        <P>A special Interdepartmental Review Group reviewed the operation of the Disabled Drivers Scheme.  The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The Group&rsquo;s Report, published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.</P>
        <P>In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.  This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. This includes the contributory and non-contributory pensions paid by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and there are no plans to change this position.</P>
        <P>However, in the case of social welfare pension income, the extent to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends, of course, on the amount of other income that the social welfare recipient, or the recipient&rsquo;s spouse, has in the particular tax year. If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare payment, the existing exemption limits or tax credits can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the social welfare income itself.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their income tax statistics do not generally distinguish between the amounts of tax that arise from pensions and from other sources. However, it is estimated that for 2003 &mdash; the latest year for which the necessary detailed information is available &mdash; the total tax liability on the combined social welfare pension and other income of some 41,200 income earners aged 65 years or over was of the order of &euro;253 million.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available <Col N="2052"/>to my Department, as neither the Financial Regulator nor the Pensions Board collects such data.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that the administration of pension schemes is primarily the responsibility of scheme trustees. Trustees are required to, at all times, act in the best interests of scheme members, with due regard being paid to the legislation governing the operation of pension schemes and the trust deeds and rules of individual schemes. In discharging their duties to members, trustees must ensure that they are achieving best value in terms of administration charges and other fees and commissions payable arising from the operation of pension schemes.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the Financial Regulator published a Consultation Paper, Review of Remuneration Structures and Transparency, in January 2005 seeking views in relation to remuneration structures in the insurance market and also in relation to non-insurance investment products. This would include certain investment-type pension products. It sought views, on amongst other things, as to how the charging structures could be made simpler and clearer for the consumer and looked for suggestions as to what would be an appropriate measure of the impact of those charges and a means of comparing one product with another. The Financial Regulator&rsquo;s public response to the first phase of consultation was published on its website on 30 November setting out the questions that were posed as part of the review, the views received and the Regulator&rsquo;s response.</P>
        <P>The Government is also committed to publishing a Green Paper on pensions as part of its commitments under Towards 2016.  It is expected that this will be published by the end of March next year. Given the role which annuities play in delivering retirement incomes the Green Paper will include an examination of that market.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In his question of 24 October last, the Deputy raised the issue of the tax treatments of pensions of Irish nationals who are retired officials of the EU as compared with the pensions of Irish nationals who are retired officials of the United Nations.</P>
        <P>I informed the Deputy that there are legislative provisions which relieve the salaries and pensions of Irish nationals from the charge to Irish income tax in respect of service to the EU. However, both the salaries and pensions of serving or retired EU officials are subject to EU tax and are not paid tax-free.</P>
        <P>There are also legislative provisions which relieve the salaries and emoluments of officials of the United Nations and its specialised agencies from the charge to Irish income tax.  These provisions do not apply to ex-officials or retired officials and, accordingly, UN pensions payable to Irish nationals are not relieved of the charge to income tax in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I undertook to have my Department and the Revenue Commissioners examine this matter further. My Department has asked the Department of Foreign Affairs to request background information from the United Nations on these general issues. This request has been made and a response is awaited. I will provide the Deputy with a copy of any response received.  It does appear, however, that pension payments to former officials of the United Nations are generally not relieved of the charge to national taxation by reason of any international agreement. This reflects the tax position under Irish legislation and, in line with the general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation somewhere, I see no reason to change that position.</P>

        <Quest> if he will introduce a compensation scheme for charities who work in developing countries and who could do much more with fundraised moneys <Col N="2055"/>if they did not have to pay VAT on items and services. </Quest>
        <QRef>[41305/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I should explain that the VAT regime and rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the Sixth VAT Directive charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt. This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.</P>
        <P>Ministerial Orders have been used in the past in a limited way to provide refunds of VAT on certain aids and appliances for the disabled and on medical equipment donated voluntarily to hospitals; equipment and buildings used by water rescue organisations; and, humanitarian goods for export. These orders are focused and are designed to target specific circumstances. However, under EU law, it is no longer possible to introduce new schemes within the VAT Act 1972 to relieve charities from the obligation to pay VAT on goods and services that they purchase.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, under EU law, it is not possible to remove or reduce the VAT rate for a particular customer, in this case charities, as the rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service, and not by the category of customer. It would, therefore, not be possible to remove or reduce the VAT paid by charities.</P>
        <P>In summary, EU law precludes removing or refunding the VAT which charities are required to pay under the taxation system. This view is also held by the European Commission, who have stated that while charities cannot be refunded through the VAT system, there is nothing to prevent national Governments paying charities a subsidy to compensate them for the irrecoverable VAT which they have incurred, provided that State Aid rules are observed.  Given that Exchequer funding is made available to very many charitable organisations this is in effect already happening.</P>
        <P>I should say that the tax code currently provides exemption for charities from Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Capital Acquisitions Tax, Stamp Duty, Probate Tax and Dividend Withholding Tax. Moreover, charities also benefit significantly from the uniform scheme of tax relief for donations, which was introduced in the Finance Act 2001 and which, for the first time, allowed tax relief on personal donations to domestic charities and other approved bodies.  The relief is based on the taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal rate which for an individual donor could be as high as <Col N="2056"/>42%. In the case of donations from the PAYE sector the relief is given directly to the charities.</P>

	<P>Prior to 1 June 1973, no superannuation benefits were payable to civil servants, male or female, on cessation of service prior to age 60 other than in cases of retirement on grounds of ill-health or death in service.  Prior to 1974, female officers were required to resign on marriage and received marriage gratuities.</P>
        <P>Following the abolition of the marriage bar, any officer appointed prior to early 1974 now has the option of resigning within two years of marriage or remaining in employment.  Officers who resign may preserve their pension entitlements until minimum pension age, normally 60, or receive a marriage gratuity in lieu of any pension entitlements.</P>
        <P>I do not have any plans to extend civil service pension benefits to former officers who received marriage gratuities. However, any officer who has received a marriage gratuity, including those who resigned prior to 1974, who is subsequently reappointed to the civil service or any other area of the public service may, on refund of the gratuity with appropriate interest, have all service given prior to that resignation aggregated with subsequent service for pension purposes.</P>

	<P>Income earned by artists, writers, composers and sculptors from the sale of their work is exempt from tax in Ireland in certain circumstances. The exemption is only available to individuals who are resident here for tax purposes.</P>
        <P>Section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, formerly section 2 of the 1969 Finance Act, allows the Revenue Commissioners to make a determination, under guidelines drawn up by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, and the Arts Council, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, that certain artistic works are original and creative, and generally recognised as having cultural or artistic merit. Earnings derived from such works are exempt from income tax.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of Section 195, the Revenue Commissioners can make determinations in respect of artistic works in the following categories:</P>
        <P LI="1">1 &mdash; a book or other writing</P>
         <P LI="1">2 &mdash; a play</P>
         <P LI="1">3 &mdash; a musical composition</P>
         <P LI="1">4 &mdash; a painting or other like picture, and</P>
        <P LI="1">5 &mdash; a sculpture.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Singing is not a specified category within section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and <Col N="2058"/>therefore, the artists exemption is not currently available to singers. In fact, performances of any kind, such as dancing or acting, do not qualify for the exemption.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to amend the Artists Exemption to allow singers to qualify for tax relief. There are already very significant supports in place for arts industries through the tax and public expenditure systems. When the Artists Exemption was introduced in 1969 it was intended as a secondary measure to providing direct funding to the arts to help ensure sustained employment for artists. The review of the scheme carried out last year by my Department in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners concluded that this should remain the case and I have accepted this recommendation.</P>

	<P>Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission controls and is responsible for the investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund. It has discretionary authority to determine the Fund&rsquo;s investment strategy in accordance with the Fund&rsquo;s statutory investment policy of securing the optimal total financial return provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the Commission.</P>
        <P>The Commission is a founder signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment launched by the UN Secretary General in New York on 27 April last. The aim of the Principles is to integrate consideration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into investment <Col N="2059"/>decision-making and ownership practices. They stem from a growing view among investment professionals that ESG issues can affect the performance of investment portfolios.  Investors fulfilling their fiduciary (or equivalent) duty therefore need to give appropriate consideration to these issues, but to date have lacked an appropriate framework for doing so.</P>
        <P>In announcing its decision to sign the Principles, the NPRF Commission said the launch of the Principles is the beginning of a process which will see the Fund taking account of environmental, social and governance factors in its investment strategies and becoming a more engaged shareholder in the companies in which it invests. It said it would be taking specific measures to implement the Principles. Actions it is planning to take over the first 12 months include:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />development and implementation of a comprehensive proxy voting policy;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />development of an engagement capacity with investee companies on ESG issues; and</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />refinement of its investment manager selection process to include specific consideration of ESG issues.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Commission stressed that incorporation of environmental, social and governance issues into the NPRF&rsquo;s investment and operating framework is a long-term project and it would be taking further implementing actions as its capacity in the area develops.</P>
        <P>On my own behalf, I would like to add that I welcome the launch of the Principles. I believe they represent a significant step towards ensuring that investors take into consideration the environmental, social and corporate governance aspects of the businesses in which they invest and I am pleased that the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission is a signatory to them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>A flood relief scheme, the John&rsquo;s River (Waterford City) Drainage Scheme, which aims to prevent or substantially reduce localised flooding in the John&rsquo;s River and the Lisduggan Stream catchment, was publicly exhibited in Waterford in March / April 2002.  A report entitled John&rsquo;s River (Waterford City) Flood Relief Scheme &ndash; Potential for Phasing of Works was commissioned by OPW in 2003 and com<Col N="2060"/>pleted in 2004.  This report investigated the viability of carrying out the flood relief works on a phased basis.</P>
        <P>The report recommended that the proposed works, as exhibited, could be carried out in five phases.  The fifth phase, incorporating works on the Tramore Road, provided for approximately 3 km of new road construction and associated road works and the re-alignment of several short sections of the John&rsquo;s River.  The estimated overall cost of this phase was &euro;7million.  The benefit area would be the section of Tramore Road where the works would be undertaken.  However, there are no properties in this area and the only benefit accruing would be in relation to avoidance of costs associated with traffic disruption.  The phasing report concluded that the Tramore Road phase of the works had a negative benefit to cost ratio of 0.05 and was therefore not deemed to be economically viable.  As it is a requirement of the Department of Finance that all flood relief works be economically viable, the decision was taken to omit this phase of works from the scheme and to proceed only with the remaining four phases.  Also, the Report of the Flood Policy Review Group, which was approved by Government in September 2004, proposes that all future expenditure must be consistent with the Review&rsquo;s recommendations.  The proposed works on the Tramore Road do not currently meet this requirement.</P>

	<P>In the years 2003 to 2005 my Department entered into contracts for consultancy services with 77 consultants. In the same period my Department spent some &euro;6.57m from its vote on those consultancy services. A significant proportion of this was related to ICT system and software development.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department issues comprehensive guidelines concerning the engagement of consultants.  In the period to which the Deputy refers, the guidelines entitled Engaging Consultants: Guidelines for the Civil Service were in effect.  My Department complied with those guidelines.</P>
        <P>The guidelines cover a range of topics relevant to the decision to commission external support or assistance. They stress that value-for-money considerations must be paramount when deciding whether or not to engage consultants, that projects should be strictly necessary and that consult<Col N="2061"/>ants should only be engaged where specialised knowledge is not available internally, or in the wider civil service, or where independent advice is deemed essential, and that as far as possible skills are transferred to the civil servants involved. My Department is distributing revised guidelines on the engagement of consultants to all Departments and Offices.</P>
        <P>In addition, the recent establishment of a Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit will provide my Department with internal expertise on programme evaluation and project appraisal. This initiative will allow it to reduce its reliance on consultants for such functions. The Department&rsquo;s Training and Development Strategy (training and post-entry education) supports this by facilitating the participation of staff in the Master of Economic Science in Policy Analysis Programme at the Institute of Public Administration.</P>

Capital grant assistance is available to both community based/not for profit organisations and private sector child care providers to build, renovate, or equip child care <Col N="2062"/>services where a proposal meets with the programme objectives. In areas of significant disadvantage staffing grants are available to community based groups providing child care services which meet the needs of disadvantaged parents.

        <P>In 2006, total health funding is &euro;13.147 billion, which represents an underlying increase of 12.04% over 2005.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 and 246 together.</P>
        <P>Out of hours co-operatives allow general practitioners to put in place arrangements to provide services  to their patients, while their surgeries are closed in the evenings, on weekends and bank holidays. The development of GP co-operatives is in line with the overall health service policy of strengthening primary care services and ensuring that to the greatest extent possible, people&rsquo;s care needs are met in the primary care setting.</P>
        <P>Out of hours co-operatives are now in place in all Health Service Executive (HSE) areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties. Between 2000 and 2005 approximately &euro;105 million was allocated to the HSE for out of hours GP co-operatives and in 2006 almost &euro;34 million is available to the Executive for these  services.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for this service, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular issues in the questions raised by the Deputy . My Department has requested the Parliamen<Col N="2066"/>tary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs.

	<P>The Government decided in July 2005 that the best option for improving geographic access for patients in the North West to radiation oncology services is to facilitate access to Belfast City Hospital and progress consideration of a joint <Col N="2069"/>venture for the provision of oncology services in the medium term to patients in the North West from a satellite centre in the North West linked to Belfast. Until recently, cancer patients in Donegal requiring radiation oncology treatment were referred to either St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin or to University College Hospital Galway.  I am pleased that a Service Level Agreement has now concluded for the referral of about 50 radiation oncology patients annually from Donegal to Belfast.</P>
        <P>It has also been agreed that the number will be increased if there is sufficient demand from patients in Donegal.  Three assessment clinics will be held each month on an ongoing basis.  The first referral clinic took place on 8 November. As regards progressing the consideration of a satellite in the North West, the Deputy will appreciate that my first priority was to gain access for cancer patients in the North West to Belfast as early as possible.  The issue of a satellite centre in the North West will be pursued with the authorities in Northern Ireland at both Departmental and Ministerial levels.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Services Executive recently published a Review of Neurosurgical Services in Ireland.  It identifies a clear need for significant investment in and organisational reform of neurosurgical services.  Neurosurgery is currently provided at the national centre in Beaumont Hospital and in Cork University Hospital.  The Report recommends that the future development of safe, high quality neurosurgical services in Ireland would be best served by a two-pronged approach:  1. Increased capacity in Dublin and Cork; 2. Improved access to neurosurgical units, including transport and telemedicine facilities for referring hospitals.</P>
        <P>The HSE is committed to progressing the recommendations of the Report.  It is undertaking a national neurosciences needs assessment. Neuroscience includes neurology, neurophysiology and neurosurgery. This assessment is guided by previous reviews of neurology and neurophysiology services and the recent report on neurosurgery. It aims to clearly identify the requirements for neuroscience services as a whole across the country. An additional &euro;3m was provided in 2006 to develop 3 new neurology units in Waterford, Limerick and Sligo through the appointment of 3 <Col N="2070"/>consultant neurology teams. In addition, the HSE provided funding for the appointment of an additional paediatric neurosurgeon at Beaumont Hospital this year.</P>
        <P>The recently published Estimates for the Health Service Executive provides a further &euro;4m to continue these developments into 2007.  Lengthy consideration was given to the case for a neurosurgical unit in Galway. The conclusion was that a neurosurgical unit in Galway would not be viable and that the needs of the entire population would be best served by increasing capacity in Dublin and Cork and improving access to services. The HSE is convinced that the implementation of the recommendations of the report represents the best way forward in terms of building a high quality neurosurgical service that will meet the needs of the entire population.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 and 266 together.</P>
        <P>Private Health Insurance is an integral part of the Irish health care system covering over half of the population. It has, for nearly 50 years, played a major role in the financing of our health services. There is considerable support for community rating as a fundamental principle of the health insurance market in Ireland. This principle, together with lifetime cover and open enrolment, guarantees an equitable non-discriminatory regulatory framework for voluntary private health insurance, and compares favourably with private health insurance systems found elsewhere.</P>
        <P>This Government is intent on supporting genuine competition and development in the private health insurance market. However, in the first instance consideration has to be given to the stability of the community rated health insurance system, and the safeguards provided to protect it, such as risk equalisation. The ultimate beneficiary of risk equalisation is the insured population, particularly the elderly and the ill, who would otherwise be vulnerable to the effects of risk <Col N="2073"/>selection, and would find the cost of private health insurance unaffordable at the point in their lives when it was needed most. A market without the balancing measure of risk equalisation to address the effect of mandatory community rating exposes insurers with higher risk members to spiralling claims and ultimately threatens their viability while opening the possibility of super-normal profits being made by other insurers, at the expense of consumers and the insured community as a whole.</P>
        <P>Risk equalisation will not over-compensate any insurance undertaking for the share of the total community of sick and elderly it serves, and is neither disproportionate, a cause for any distortion of competition in the market place, nor does it constitute State Aid. Risk Equalisation is about compensating for differential risk profiles. It is not about transferring profits. It is about ensuring that competition takes place on an equitable basis.</P>
        <P>The Competition Authority and the Health Insurance Authority are examining the health insurance market and are to bring forward recommendations on how greater competition could be encouraged in this market. Their joint report is expected early in 2007. It is the Government&rsquo;s view that the regulatory framework for private health insurance, including the provision for risk equalisation, is appropriate. This position has been endorsed by the High Court. While the Government accepts that the framework influences the market environment, it does so for a good reason, namely, the protection of the consumer and in the interests of the common good.</P>

	<P>The Government and I are anxious to build on the expertise and ethos of St. Luke&rsquo;s.  It is held in great affection by the Irish people. Many thousands of Irish patients and their families from every part of the country have experienced high quality cancer care at St. Luke&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>The decision to transfer St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin was taken by the Government in the best interests of cancer patients.  The decision was based on expert medical, scientific and management advice.  It is designed to ensure that radiation oncology is integrated with all other aspects of cancer care, including surgery and medical oncology.  It is in line with best international practice.  This is the model that exists at Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital Galway and which is being developed at Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals, Dublin.</P>
        <P>The Board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting this decision.  A transfer on similar lines took place earlier this year in Northern Ireland when radiation oncology services transferred from a stand alone facility to Belfast City Hospital, which is a major academic teaching hospital. In recognition of the role for St. Luke&rsquo;s in the new facility at St. James&rsquo;s, I have made a commitment to pursue discussions with the Boards of both Hospitals about its govern<Col N="2075"/>ance and a re-configuration of the Boards, with the twin goals of ensuring continuity of expertise and ethos in the care of cancer patients and the effective integration of multidisciplinary patient care at the one site.   I remain confident the transition will be managed with great sensitivity and skill by the two hospital Boards to achieve those objectives.</P>

	<P>Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004 and funding for all health services has been provided as part of its overall vote.  The Executive is currently undertaking a number of reviews of acute hospital service configuration.  The overall objective is to ensure the optimum configuration of acute hospital services across the country, with a view to developing acute health care which minimises risk to patients and is in line with national policy and best international practice. </P>
        <P>The Deputy is aware that, in the North East, acute services are being developed in line with the recommendations in the Teamwork Report.  In line with the report, services across the region are to be reconfigured to centralise the expertise <Col N="2077"/>required for the optimum care of critically ill and trauma patients.  The Deputy has been briefed by the Executive on the future service configuration planned for Monaghan General Hospital, where it is planned to provide nurse-led treatment services on a 12 hour/seven day basis under the supervision of A &amp; E consultants.  The HSE will be working to ensure that changes to the existing service are introduced in a phased, planned and structured way.  In the meantime, there will be no diminution in local services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.  I am not aware of any plan by the Executive to remove 24/7 A &amp; E services in other regions.</P>
        <P>The policy of the Government is to ensure the provision of safe, high-quality services that achieve the best possible outcomes for patients.  Patient safety and quality must be paramount and must be the key drivers in configuring acute hospital services, including accident and emergency services. This will mean that those services that can be safely delivered locally are delivered locally and that more complex services that require specialist input are concentrated at regional centres, or, in the case of highly specialised services, in national centres of excellence. This approach is consistent with international best practice for the optimum delivery of patient care.</P>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the table.</P>
        <P>When examining mental health expenditure as a proportion of total health spending, it is important to note that the scope of services provided under the overall health heading has widened considerably.  Services in a range of areas such as child care, older persons and intellectual disability have been substantially expanded since 1980 and have led to an increase in total health spending.  As a result, it is not very informative to compare mental health spending as a proportion of total health expenditure over a number of years.  In fact, the Government has trebled mental health expenditure in the period 1997 to 2006, from  &euro;326m to &euro;835m.</P>

	<P>There were no changes made to the medical card system for persons with a physical and intellectual disability in long stay care which includes community residences where nurses are employed.</P>
        <P>The management and delivery of health and personal social services are the responsibility of <Col N="2082"/>the HSE under the Health Act 2004.  It is a matter for the HSE, based on its own legal advice and taking into account the individual circumstances as well as the service being provided, to make a decision on any charges levied.</P>
        <P>I take it the question refers to charges for persons with a physical and intellectual disability in long stay care which includes community residences where nurses are employed.</P>
        <P>The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 in keeping with Section 53 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended, have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges can be levied.  Class 1 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;120 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;35, whichever is the lesser.  Class 2 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises.  In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;90, or the weekly income of that person less &euro;55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P>These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on a person in either class. The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo;.  Under Section 1 (b) of the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005, the HSE can examine a person&rsquo;s overall financial situation in view of the person&rsquo;s reasonable expenditure in relation to themselves or their dependants, if any.</P>

	<P>The Influenza Pandemic Expert Group is finalising advice on non-pharmaceutical public health interventions, with reference to recommendations from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). </P>
        <P>Influenza is spread mainly by droplet transmission, but can also be spread by direct and indirect contact. Airborne, or fine droplet, transmission can also occur. The Expert Group considers that the two most important public health messages to convey are the importance of respiratory etiquette and hand washing  in the prevention of infection. Campaigns to promote these messages are being developed as part of pandemic planning.</P>
        <P>The Expert Group has found that there is very little evidence on the effect of the use of face masks in public in preventing influenza transmission. The WHO has recommended that mask use by the public should be based on risk, including frequency of exposure and closeness of contact with potentially infectious persons. The ECDC has issued interim recommendations on personal public health measures for reducing transmission of human influenza. With regard to mask use in public, it has adopted the same position as the WHO. The ECDC cannot recommend general mask wearing during an influenza pandemic: however it notes that there is little or no evidence against people wearing simple masks if they wish to do so and do so properly.</P>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to check whether the information is available and, if so, to provide it directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive recently published a Review of Neurosurgical Services in Ireland.  The Report states that information in relation to neurosurgical inpatient and daycase discharges in 2004  indicate that inpatient access to neurosurgical service is almost uniform from all areas of the country, except the South and South East where access is slightly higher. It also indicates that problems in accessing neurosurgical care are more closely impacted by availability of beds and other resources rather than geographical distance from a unit.</P>
        <P>The Report recommends that the future development of safe, high quality neurosurgical services would be best served by a two-pronged approach of increasing capacity in Dublin and Cork and improving access to neurosurgical units, including transport and telemedicine facilities for referring hospitals.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s recommended immunisation programme is based on the guidelines of the National <Col N="2090"/>Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  Vaccines are continually evolving and guidelines change given the nature of these developments.</P>
        <P>The Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland currently recommend vaccination against pneumococcal disease only for persons who are at increased risk of the disease and its complications, particularly for those with: asplenia or severe dysfunction of the spleen, including surgical splenectomy; chronic renal disease or nephrotic syndrome; chronic heart, lung or liver disease illness including cirrhosis; diabetes mellitus; sickle cell disease; Immunodeficiency or immunosuppression due to disease or treatment, including HIV infection at all stages; patients with CSF leaks, either congenital or complicating skull fracture or neurosurgery; or persons aged 65 years or older.</P>
        <P>The inclusion of the pneumococcal vaccine in the Primary Childhood Immunisation Programme is being considered by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee as part of its review of the immunisation guidelines.  No decision has yet been reached.  My Department and the Health Service Executive will be guided by the expert advice from the NIAC in this regard.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive activity reports indicate that the average number of patients awaiting admission during November 2006 was 125.  The average for the equivalent period last year was 185.  Information on daily activity levels in A &amp; E departments is available on the HSE website.</P>
        <P>Tackling the problems in A &amp; E departments is the Government&rsquo;s top priority in health.  Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in A &amp; E and do not require admission.</P>
        <P>A &amp; E services have improved around the country.  The HSE activity reports over recent months indicate a significant reduction in the <Col N="2096"/>average number of patients in A &amp; E departments awaiting admission compared with the equivalent period in 2005.  Waiting times for patients have also been reduced.  The percentage of people waiting longer than 24 hours for admission has decreased from 13% in May to 6% in October.  I wish to move to a position where no patient will wait longer than six hours to be admitted after a clinical decision to admit has been made.</P>
        <P>To ensure that the improvements that have been achieved in recent months are sustained, particularly during the winter months, the HSE has introduced a broad-based Winter Initiative.  Its purpose is to ensure that the services required to address the particular demands of the winter season are in place and operating optimally. It encompasses not just hospital services but also primary and community care services.</P>
        <P>The actions and initiatives being taken by the HSE are designed to deliver the sustained improvement in A &amp; E services that patients and their families deserve.</P>

	<P>Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population into the future.</P>

 </tgroup> <P Just="Left">*The decrease in the number of nurses registering in 2005 is due to the introduction of the four year Nursing Degree Programme in 2002.  The Nursing Diploma Programme was a three year programme with the final 2001 intake graduating in 2004.  The 155 nurses registered in 2005 were repeat students from the nursing diploma programme.  The increase in overseas nurses was a result of a recruitment drive undertaken in 2005 to ensure there was an adequate number of nurses during this transition period.</P>

	<P>In 2001, the year of the publication of Health <Col N="2098"/>Strategy, the average number of in-patient beds and day places available for treatment of patients in the 53 public acute hospitals was 12,145.  At the end of 2005, this figure had increased by 1204 to a total of 13,349, involving an additional 724 in-patient beds and 480 day places.  The HSE has introduced a broad-based Winter Initiative. Its purpose is to ensure that the services required to address the particular demands of the winter season are in place and operating optimally. It <Col N="2099"/>encompasses not just hospital services but also primary and community care services. The actions and initiatives being taken by the HSE are designed to deliver the sustained improvement in hospital services that patients and their families deserve.</P>
        <P>The Initiative focuses on a range of measures, including the following: Preventative measures; Public Communications; Operational readiness (capacity, staffing, etc); Out of hours arrangements; NHO/PCCC arrangements (Ambulance/ Primary Care/A&amp;E links, Discharge Initiatives, Continuing Care and  Home Supports); Planned escalation procedures to enable responsiveness to increased demand beyond normal operating levels; and continuation of the development of necessary infrastructure particularly for continuing care.</P>
        <P>Eight teams, comprising local health office and hospital managers, have been put in place around the country. These teams are responsible for ensuring that the Initiative&rsquo;s priorities are implemented at local level, as well as devising and implementing local solutions to address specific local winter demands.Each of the eight teams has provided an initial status report on the priority tasks and actions set out under the three main elements of the Initiative: Promotion and Prevention, Hospital Avoidance, and Capacity. A publicity campaign is underway focussing on the Flu/Pneumo-vaccine campaign among the elderly, and the importance of staying safe and warm during the winter period.</P>

	<P>The Strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, aims to develop services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, home helps, occupational therapists and others.</P>
        <P>It has been estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services in these areas.  The provision of additional community based services can <Col N="2100"/>provide significant benefits to both individual patients and to the overall health system by allowing hospitals to concentrate on those who need more complex interventions, and by reducing the number of people who are required to attend Accident and Emergency facilities.</P>
        <P>The HSE received an additional &euro;10m in funding in 2006 to enable the establishment of up to 100 Primary Care Teams which will include some 300 additional frontline professionals. The funding is being targeted by the HSE to provide the potential for each Local Health Office (formerly Community Care Areas) to establish up to three primary care teams; a further &euro;10m is being provided in 2007 to enable the full year costs of these developments to be met.  This will bring to &euro;38m per annum the total ongoing funding provided by the Government to support the implementation of the strategy.  This is in addition to the very substantial resources already in the funding base for a wide range of primary care services.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s policy on radiation oncology is based on the Report on &lsquo;The Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland&rsquo; which was published in 2003.  It was prepared by a multi-disciplinary group of experts in radiation oncology, medical oncology, public health and palliative care.  It included experts from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and representatives of bodies such as the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Irish Cancer Society and Aid Cancer Treatment.  It has had significant endorsement from such bodies as <Col N="2102"/>the National Cancer Forum, US National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society.</P>
        <P>The Government and I are anxious to build on the expertise and ethos of St. Luke&rsquo;s.  It is held in great affection by the Irish people. Many thousands of Irish patients and their families from every part of the country have experienced high quality cancer care at St. Luke&rsquo;s.  The decision to transfer St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin was taken by the Government in the best interests of cancer patients.  The decision was based on expert medical, scientific and management advice.  It is designed to ensure that radiation oncology is integrated with all other aspects of cancer care, including surgery and medical oncology.  It is in line with best international practice.</P>
        <P>This is the model that exists at Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital Galway and which is being developed at Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals, Dublin.  The Board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting this decision.  A transfer on similar lines took place earlier this year in Northern Ireland when radiation oncology services transferred from a stand alone facility to Belfast City Hospital, which is a major academic teaching hospital.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the role for St. Luke&rsquo;s in the new facility at St. James&rsquo;, I have made a commitment to pursue discussions with the Boards of both Hospitals about its governance and a re-configuration of the Boards, with the twin goals of ensuring continuity of expertise and ethos in the care of cancer patients and the effective integration of multi-disciplinary patient care at the one site.   I remain confident the transition will be managed with great sensitivity and skill by the two hospital Boards to achieve those objectives. As regards the future use of the site and facilities at St. Luke&rsquo;s, my objective is to ensure that these resources are utilised in the best interests of the health services.  I will discuss this issue in due course with the Health Service Executive and the Hospital Board.</P>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to expenditure on consultancy by my Department in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and the number of consultants engaged is being collated and will be forwarded directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>In relation to the second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question the procedure in place to engage consultants requires that a senior official of my Department must sign off on any proposal to engage outside consultants.  These proposals consist of the details of the project, the nature of the assistance required, the rationale for engaging outside assistance and the anticipated cost.  These requests must be submitted as early as possible in the project cycle and prior to tender or seeking proposals.  This is in line with guidelines issued by the Department of Finance.  Every proposal to engage outside assistance must also be submitted for individual sanction by myself as Minister.</P>

        <Quest> if she is considering staff retention measures specifically aimed at nurses in view of the high drop out rate in recent years of recently qualified nurses; if consideration has been given by her Department to the causes of the high drop out rates; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware that there is a high drop out rate among recently qualified nurses. The first cohort of students from the new four year degree programme graduated and registered as nurses earlier this year. I understand that the overwhelming majority of these newly qualified nurses have taken up employment in the public health service.</P>
        <P>The Government has been conscious of the need to recruit and retain nurses and midwives in the public health service and a number of initiatives have been introduced. The pay and conditions of nurses and midwives have dramatically improved over the last nine years. The basic pay of staff nurse has increased by over 74% since 1997. The pay of Clinical Nurse Manager 3 has increased by 113% in the same period.  The promotional structure within nursing, including the <Col N="2104"/>introduction of a clinical career pathway, has been substantially improved on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing and the 1999 Nurses&rsquo; Pay settlement. Over 38% of nurses are now in grades above staff nurse level.</P>
        <P>The Government has invested heavily in nurse education &mdash; thirteen new purpose built schools of nursing have been provided and undergraduate training places have been increased by 94% since 1998.  A comprehensive range of financial supports have been introduced to support qualified nurses in pursuing part-time degrees and specialist courses.  My predecessor introduced a scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in February 2001. Under the scheme, individual nurses and midwives may apply to work between 8 and 39 hours per week on a permanent, part-time basis thus helping to retain nurses in the workforce whose preference is to work less than the standard week. The Health Service Executive has established a Nursing and Midwifery Recruitment and Retention Project Office to coordinate national initiatives to ensure there is an adequate supply of nurses and midwives.</P>
        <P>The Government has been successful in attracting an additional 10,200 nurses and midwives into the health service over the last nine years. I am confident that the extensive range of measures I have outlined will continue to prove effective in addressing the nursing workforce needs of the health services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 338, 339 and 342 together.</P>
        <P>Council Regulation (EC) No. 850/98 lays down technical conservation measures for the protection of juvenile marine organisms. However, Article 43 of this Regulation provides for a derogation from these measures (mesh size and other technical stipulations) for the purpose of scientific research. The cases referred to by the Deputy relate to scientific research being carried out with gill-nets with mesh sizes under 120mm which are currently banned. The article stipulates that any such research must be carried out under the supervision of the Member State whose vessel is involved, and with advance notification to the European Commission and to the coastal state, in this case Ireland. However, under current rules the express permission of the coastal state to carry out this research is not required.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the need for research involving the use of undersized mesh, and particularly not where the species in question is the subject of protection as part of a recovery plan. I have written to Commissioner Borg requesting an amendment to the EU Regulations so that the express approval of the coastal Member State would be necessary for research projects in their Exclusive Fisheries Zone. Commissioner Borg has advised that the Commission is currently examining ways to improve the rules in this area. While not excluding an amendment to the TAC and Quota Regulation the Commission is currently working towards holding discussions with Member States in the New Year. I consider this to be a matter of importance and accordingly I am continuing to press very strongly for amendments to be agreed at the forthcoming Fisheries Council.</P>
        <P>In July/August this year I became aware that French vessels were proposing to carry out experiments (using undersized mesh) in the hake and monkfish fisheries off the west coast. I immediately instructed officials to raise the matter with the European Commission and the French authorities, with the result that the French authorities instructed their vessels to withdraw the element of their research programme involving undersized meshes.</P><Col N="2106"/>
        <P>In September the Department received notification from the Spanish Ministry advising of their intention to carry out similar research in the hake fishery. At my request, officials of the Department again expressed our very strong opposition to the proposal and asked the Commission to intervene to stop such fishing which is completely contrary to the EU plans for conservation and recovery of the stocks. The Commission has written to the Spanish authorities seeking a justification for the research programmes. Officials from the Department have also met with the Spanish authorities in relation to the matter. One such vessel was indeed arrested while discussions were ongoing with the Commission and the Spanish authorities, but was subsequently released on the basis that it was part of the research programme.</P>
        <P>The Irish control authorities will continue to monitor the activities of any vessels carrying out research in Ireland&rsquo;s waters to ensure that the regulatory requirements are met.</P>

        <P>Council Regulation (EC) No. 850 of 1998 as amended lays down technical conservation measures for the protection of juvenile organisms. This Regulation stipulates the minimum mesh size for gillnets in various fisheries and offences for breaches of this Regulation are set down in Irish law by means of Statutory Instrument No. 171 of 2006.</P>
        <P>The Irish control authorities constantly monitor the activities of any vessels in Ireland&rsquo;s waters to ensure that all regulatory requirements, including those relating to minimum mesh sizes are met. Where a vessel is detected as using undersized gillnets prosecution is taken through the normal channels.</P>

	<P>In the course of a routine inspection by Sea Fishery Officers of the fishing vessel at Killybegs on the 18th of November a number of apparent infringements of the fisheries regulations were detected.  An individual was identified by the inspecting officers as acting as the Master of the fishing vessel, having just taken over this duty to relieve another individual. The person identified as the acting Master of the fishing vessel during the inspection process had also made a substantial number of entries to the EU fishing logbook of this fishing vessel in the recent past. This person is now at sea with the fishing vessel.</P>
        <P>Following the initial inspection the Office of the Attorney General was advised that a number <Col N="2109"/>of apparent fisheries infringements had been detected. Following this an application was made to the court for a 48-hour detention order to investigate further the alleged fishery infringements. This order was duly granted by the Judge and the fishing vessel and its Master were lawfully detained at Killybegs for a period of 48-hours. The detention order was subsequently extended by 36-hours to facilitate the continued investigation of the alleged infringements and of the catch of the fishing vessel.  The inspecting officers then prepared and presented statements to the Office of the Attorney General for consideration.  The fishing vessel and its Master were released without charges being made at this time. I do not wish to comment further as this case remains under consideration.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Scheme II was launched on 25 July 2006, with a closing date of 28 August 2006. The scheme was rolled out on a similar basis to the 2005 pilot scheme in that it was a competitive call for proposals comprising an open and transparent process in which the scoring mechanism was published as part of the application form and accompanying documentation. Following the launch of the scheme, an assessment panel was formed, comprising officials from my Department, Sustainable Energy Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  The scheme was the subject of a State Aids application which has been approved by the Commission. Under State Aids Rules the process must be open and fair and subject to single market rules.</P>
        <P>There were 102 applications received under the Scheme. The range and quality of applications was exceptionally high and the panel was faced with difficult decisions across all four categories of biofuels. While the application in question was of very high quality, it did not score as highly as the successful applicants in the category.  I understand that my officials met with the individual in question on Thursday 30 November 2006.</P>

A number have indicated a combination of domestically produced and imported biofuels. In most of these cases applicants intend to import biofuels until they have established production facilities or supply chains in Ireland.

	<P>On 29th September I announced the first tranche of support under the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) programme to over fifty new renewable powered electricity generating plants. The combined capacity of these projects is over 600 megawatts (MW), with wind-power accounting for most of the new support. The amount of megawatt hours that will be produced by these and other successful projects will depend on the build rate and, in the case of wind and hydro projects, weather conditions.   </P><Col N="2112"/>
        <P>REFIT allows project developers to negotiate long term fixed price contracts in the wholesale electricity market. On the back of these contracts investors will release the necessary capital. Project costs vary on a case by case basis. Developers negotiate their financing and expenditure in the liberalised market. These are purely commercial matters for the developers involved.</P>
        <P>The Public Service Obligation (PSO) is calculated annually by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). I have no function in relation to the Public Service Obligation.</P>

	<P>On 3 August 2006 I launched an &euro;11m grants package for Combined Heat and Power (CHP) to encourage industry and commercial users to generate their own electricity and heat. CHP units simultaneously generate heat and electricity in a single process on site. By combining these processes CHP saves around 25% of the energy that would have been required to produce electricity in a conventional power station and heat in separate heat-only boilers. The scheme is providing grant support to assist the deployment of small-scale fossil fired CHP (up to 1MWe) and biomass CHP systems. </P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 358 and 359 together.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s primary motivation is the conservation of the wild salmon species, which has long been regarded as one of Ireland&rsquo;s most prized fish. It is vital to afford every protection to the remaining salmon stocks and to clearly prioritise conservation over catch. The current imperative must be to maintain stocks above conservation limits or at the very least halt the observed decline.</P>
        <P>The status of salmon stocks in Ireland and elsewhere is well documented and it is evident that these have declined in the years since an historic high in the mid-seventies. Reflecting these trends, conservation measures have been introduced progressively over the past decade. However, the 2006 report of the Standing Scientific Committee confirms that despite recent reduced exploitation, many stocks are still falling well below their conservation limit.</P><Col N="2118"/>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware I appointed an Independent Group to examine the implications of alignment with the scientific advice for the commercial salmon fishing sector in 2007 and beyond. As part of their remit the group made recommendations to address any financial hardship that may be experienced by the sector. The approach they adopted to determining the hardship payments is robust and convincing.</P>
        <P>In their report the group commented that the level of hardship likely to be experienced would vary both in extent and scale. Taking all factors into account and based on available information, noting particularly that there is no legal obligation on the State to provide compensation in a situation where it is imposing management measures that are fundamentally in the public good, they proposed to provide a measure of relief to each individual in line with the level of hardship likely to be experienced.</P>
        <P>They recommended that this should be based on the recent catch history of the individual licence holder (2001 to 2005). The Government accepted the recommendation of the Independent Group and has determined that the level of payment should be based on the average net income per salmon in the commercial fishery for the past five years (2001 to 2005). This income calculation was based, by the group, on the average price obtained per fish each year less the costs incurred by fishermen. Each individual licence holder who applies to the fund is set to receive six times their average catch multiplied by the average net income per salmon. An additional payment equal to 6 times the current licence fee will be made in all cases. I believe this is a fair and reasonable allocation and does not need to be modified.</P>
        <P>I have no function in tax matters, as it is the Revenue Commissioners who decide whether an income is taxable. The Independent Group recommended that the compensation be paid in one tranche to assist people to move to a new business as quickly as possible, particularly those who had been deriving a large income from drift netting. The Government agreed from the beginning that if people want to spread the receipt of <Col N="2119"/>the payment over a two or three-year period, they can do so. This would obviously have tax implications for them.</P>

	<P>The position is that, since 2002, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is a statutory independent body, has been charged with all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002. </P>
        <P>Earlier this year the CER directed Bord G&aacute;is (BG&Eacute;) to implement a new Gas Connections Policy, which determines the economic viability of connecting towns to the gas network. In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite. This is to ensure that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the consumption of gas and the associated tariffs. The new policy allows for the appraisal of a new town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.</P>
        <P>Having regard to this new policy, BG&Eacute; carried out a comprehensive review of towns being considered for connection to the national gas network. The review is being conducted in two phases, and phase 1, which covers the towns in the proximity of the Mayo-Galway Pipeline (including Ballinrobe) has already been completed. I am advised that the connection of Ballinrobe to the network was determined not to be currently economically viable.</P>
        <P>As regards the methodology employed by BG&Eacute; in the review, including source material for population figures and the grouping of particular towns together, I can advise the House that BG&Eacute; has a dedicated e-mail address, newtowns@bge.ie, for the purpose of dealing with any such queries.</P>

	<P>I understand that the Independent Group based their recommendations in relation to the hardship fund on verifiable catch date and calculations of net income for salmon, both averaged over five years from 2001 to 2005 and with the addition of six times the current licence fee for the type of licence.  I also understand that they were assisted in these calculations by experts from BIM. </P>
        <P>The new policy for the management of wild salmon is motivated by the need to conserve the species.  I would also comment that there is no legal obligation on the State to provide compensation in the circumstances.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including wired broadband, is a matter in the first instance <Col N="2121"/>for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. </P>
        <P>There are a number of platforms for delivery of broadband, my Department operates a dedicated website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i> where potential broadband customers can ascertain the availability of services in their area.</P>
        <P>However, it has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband.  My Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities.  These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.  The networks offer towns opportunities to attract inward investment in advanced technology and knowledge based enterprises.</P><Col N="2122"/>
        <P>Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under the first phase and are currently being managed by ENet, the Management Services Entity.  The second phase extends the programme to over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband offering from the private sector.</P>
        <P>The Department also offered funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the Group Broadband Scheme.  The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area.  To date, over 160 projects have been approved for funding under this Programme.  The most recent phase of the group broadband scheme, which provides grant aid for the installation of broadband in rural areas, has closed.  However, the nature of the scheme is currently being reviewed in the context of options being considered for the achievement of nationwide broadband.</P>
        <P>The following projects were approved under the Department&rsquo;s Group Broadband Scheme to advance broadband roll-out for the counties of Cavan and Monaghan.</P><Col N="2121"/>

	<P Just="Left">The North Western Regional Fisheries Board is responsible for management of the state owned Moy Fishery which includes draft netting rights on the tidal waters of the River Moy as well as the rod fishery at Ballina.  The Board has advised me that in accordance with the Moy Development Plan, 1992, draft netting on the River Moy ceased with effect from 1994.  Since then, the rod fishery has been developed to a very high level and it now attracts anglers from all over the world each year.  The question of the commercial harvesting of any surplus in the Moy catchment in 2007 and future years is a matter for the Board in the first instance.</P>

	<P>My Department monitors the situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, which is also accredited to Colombia, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware from my replies to previous questions on this subject, Ms Ingrid Betancourt &mdash; a candidate in the 2002 Colombian presidential election &mdash; was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC, on 23 February 2002.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the Irish Presidency of the European Union in 2004, the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) underlined the European Union&rsquo;s view of the importance of a rapid release of all remaining hostages and kidnapped persons in Colombia.  In addition, Ireland participated at the international meeting, organized by the Government of Colombia, in support of the peace process in Colombia which took place in Cartagena in February 2005.  The Cartagena Declaration, which issued at the conclusion of this meeting, called for the immediate freeing of all those kidnapped. Likewise, at the 61st session of the Commission on Human Rights in April 2005, the Chairperson&rsquo;s statement on Colombia, in the negotiation of which Ireland actively contributed, also urged the immediate and unconditional release of all kidnapped persons in Colombia.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Mr Noel Treacy T.D., met with Juan Carlos Lecompte, the husband of Ingrid Betancourt, on 28 June 2005, during his visit to Ireland. Minister Treacy assured Mr. Lecompte that the Government shares his concern about the plight of his wife and the many others who are held hostage in Colombia.</P>
        <P>Ireland, together with our EU partners, strongly condemns the practice of hostage-taking and kidnapping and we call upon all illegal armed groups in Colombia to release all hostages immediately and unconditionally.  We continue to support the Government of Colombia in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict, including through direct engagement with those illegal armed groups who may be prepared to negotiate a peace agreement.  We will continue to work with our EU partners to pro<Col N="2126"/>mote an end to the plight of Ingrid Betancourt and the other kidnap victims in Colombia.</P>

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement I made at the European Parliament on 30 November 2006, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, in which I dealt in detail with the issues raised by the Deputy.  In that statement, I made clear that I would have the most serious questions about the methodology used by the Rapporteur of the relevant European Parliament Committee in establishing such a figure of allegedly suspicious flights. During the exchange of views which followed my statement, it was clear that some members of the Committee would also share these doubts about the figure arrived at by the Rapporteur. </P>
        <P>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to the Government&rsquo;s legal obligations, I have engaged in detailed correspondence with the Irish Human Rights Commission on this subject.  In this correspondence, I outlined the Government&rsquo;s position in respect of the scope of its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, having regard to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on the matter.  The Government is satisfied that it is fully in compliance with its obligations under international law in regard to this matter.  Moreover, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the powers necessary to search any aircraft in relation to which there is a suspicion of illegal activity.</P>
        <P>I made clear to the IHRC in my most recent letter, dated 25 July, that my Department is very open to continuing dialogue with it.  Following on from my appearance at the Temporary Committee, I have arranged for my correspondence with the IHRC to be passed to the Committee for its information.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The vast majority of the expenditure on consultancies under Vote 28 during the period 2003-2005 relates to the upgrading of the Department&rsquo;s information technology infrastructure and to the development of an Automated Passport System (APS).  The upgrading of the Department&rsquo;s information technology infrastructure covered a broad range of technologies that required specialised expertise in a number of areas.</P>
        <P>Under Vote 29, the consultancies undertaken by the Department&rsquo;s Development Cooperation <Col N="2128"/>Division cover a wide range of sectors including HIV/AIDS, health, education, governance and rural development.  A high proportion of them concern the monitoring, review and evaluation of development programmes and projects commissioned at HQ.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious of the need to achieve value for money on consultancy expenditure.  The Department commissions consultancies only where specialised knowledge and/or skills are not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of Irish Aid (Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance programme), where an independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required.  Given the overall scale of the Irish Aid Programme, this level of monitoring, review and evaluation is both prudent and proportionate.</P>

While it is open to golf clubs to apply for funding under the programme in respect of the development of facilities, funding for private golf clubs would not generally be regarded as a priority under the programme and no private golf club has benefited under the programme since 2003.  I intend to announce the grant allocations for the 2007 programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>

	<P>The Irish Sports Council (ISC) was set up as a statutory body in July 1999 with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards.  The Sports Council provides funding to recognised National Governing Bodies (NGBs), including Cycling Ireland.  NGBs are <Col N="2130"/>dealt with as autonomous organisations and grants are allocated under agreed funding conditions and with specific priorities in mind.  Since 1999, Cycling Ireland has received over &euro;3.5 million in funding from the Irish Sports Council, with grants of &euro;614,400 in 2006.</P>
        <P>Since 1998, the sport of cycling has also received &euro;919,705 in funding for 31 projects under the national lottery-funded Sports Capital Programme administered by my Department.  In 2006, under this programme, the allocation of &euro;316,600 included &euro;80,000 to the Cycling Ireland Mountain Bike Commission and &euro;111,600 to Cycling Ireland for the provision of high-performance sports equipment for elite athletes.</P>
        <P>Cycling Ireland recently published its Strategic Development Plan, which outlines its goals for the period 2005-2009 for cycling as to:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />grow significantly in membership, resources and influence</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />become a high profile lifetime leisure activity in Ireland</P>

      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />be an effective organisation catering for all aspects of cycling.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The organisation now has a Leisure and Tourism Commission, which deals with the promotion of cycling as a healthy activity, and it has supported a range of leisure initiatives in recent years including various charity cycle events.  A Women&rsquo;s Commission has also been established to encourage more females into the sport, particularly in relation to disciplines such as mountain biking.  Cycling Ireland is working with the Irish Sports Council in developing a National Trails Strategy to encourage people to utilise our natural resources for undertaking active pursuits, such as mountain biking, in their leisure time.</P>

Special Olympics Ireland recently made a submission to the Government on the development and funding of the Special Olympics Programme over the next three years.

	<P>The most recent Quarterly National Household Survey published by the Central Statistic&rsquo;s Office on 30 November, 2006, shows that for the third quarter of 2006, there were 533,500 people in employment in the Border, Midland and Western region.  The corresponding figures in 2004 and 2005 were 489,800 and 512,700 respectively.  This substantial growth in employment over that last two years is very encouraging.  Furthermore, in the year to the third quarter of 2006, employment grew by 4.1% in the BMW region which is almost on a par with the 4.2% increase in the Southern and Eastern region in the same period.</P>
        <P>The issue of job creation by companies supported by the Enterprise Development agencies is a day-to-day matter for the relevant agencies and the County Enterprise Boards, and is not a matter with which I am directly involved.  However, I am aware that for the year to end December, 2005, which is the latest available data, there was a net gain of 1,055 jobs in IDA Ireland client companies in the BMW region.  In 2005, employment in Enterprise Ireland clients in the BMW region also increased.  Overall employment growth during 2005 by Enterprise Ireland clients was 1,897.</P>
        <P>There are thirteen County Enterprise Boards operating in the BMW region.  The job creation performance in respect of CEB-sponsored business projects is on target and is expected to exceed target by the end of 2006.  I am satisfied that the on-going efforts of the Industrial Development agencies under the aegis of my Department, together with the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to regional development, will continue to bring sustainable jobs and investment opportunities to the BMW region.</P>

	<P>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary basis.  CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>To this end and in order to support the delivery of essential services, the ring fencing and prioritisation of places for health related services, including assistance for persons with disabilities, child care and Drugs Task Force clients was introduced over the period 2002/2003.  As a result service provision levels by CE participants within these sectors was, and continues to be, maintained at a constant level.  The total number of places spread across the 3 ring-fenced sectors, namely drugs, child care and health, is approximately 6,000, which represents 27% of current places.</P>
        <P>In November 2004, following a review of F&Aacute;S Employment Schemes (Community Employment, Job Initiative and Social Economy Programmes), it was announced that Community Employment places supporting the delivery of health services will continue to be ring-fenced.  However, in line with Government policy, there are currently no plans to mainstream these Community Employment places.</P>

	<P>Following the decision by the Board of IFI to put the company into liquidation, ICI and the State, the shareholders in IFI, while there was no legal obligation to do so, established a special fund with almost &euro;24.5 million to provide ex-gratia severance payments to the former employees of IFI.  Payments from the fund were made were in accordance with the basis for distribution determined by the trustee of the fund, which was endorsed by a ballot open to all employees.  These payments were in addition to statutory redundancy entitlements which were also paid.</P>
        <P>In addition, the liquidator has admitted, as unsecured creditors in the liquidation, claims from the employees of the company to have <Col N="2134"/>entitlements in respect of the voluntary severance terms traditionally paid by the company.  However, the dividend payable to the workers concerned, if any, can only be determined when all the assets of the company have been realized and all liabilities established.  It must be emphasised, of course, that the amount, if anything, to be paid in due course in respect of such claims is a matter solely for determination by the liquidator.</P>

	<P>Advances in communication technology are continuing to transform the lives of deaf people and have opened up employment opportunities that were once considered unattainable.  Consequently, there are very few employment opportunities for which deaf job applicants would be unsuited.

For persons with partial hearing speaker phones, amplifier phones and a variety of loop systems help to significantly over communication difficulties.</P>

        <P LI="1">Job Interview Interpreter Grant &mdash; This grant is intended for job seekers with a significant hearing or speech impairment who are attending job interviews.  The job seeker can apply for funding to have an interpreter attend the interview with them.  A grant of  &euro;106.68 for a three hour period is normally paid by F&Aacute;S, together with travel costs for the interpreter.</P>

        <P>F&Aacute;S Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) &mdash; The F&Aacute;S Wage Subsidy Scheme provides financial incentives to employers, outside the public sector, to employ disabled people who work more than 20 hours per week up to a maximum of 39 hours.  A person availing of the Wage Subsidy Scheme is subject to the same conditions of employment as other employees, including PRSI contributions, annual leave, tax deductions, and the employer pays the going rate for the job, as per any other employee.  Employees hired under this Scheme may also qualify for the Department of Social and Family Affairs Back to Work Allowance.  The subsidies are structured under three separate strands and employers can benefit under one or all, simultaneously.  Further details of these, and other supports, may be obtained through the F&Aacute;S website (<i>www.fas.ie</i>) under &lsquo;Disability&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>Community Employment Programme &mdash; The Community Employment programme is operated by F&Aacute;S to provide work experience and training for disadvantaged persons, and is available to those with a disability.  Participation rates for people with disabilities on the programme have been increased under the Sectoral Plan for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the Disability Act, 2005.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2005 protect employees from being unfairly dismissed by laying down criteria by which dismissals are judged to be unfair and by providing an adjudication system and redress for an employee whose dismissal is found to be unfair. A claim for redress under the Acts may be submitted initially to either of the adjudicative bodies specified in the Acts i.e. a Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal within 6 months of the date of dismissal (this can be extended to 12 months in exceptional circumstances).</P>
        <P>Redress may take the form of either financial compensation, re-instatement or re-engagement, whichever the relevant adjudicative body considers appropriate having regard to all the circumstances. To qualify to take a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, an employee is normally required to have at least one year&rsquo;s continuous service with the employer at the date of the dismissal.  Section 14(4) (as amended) of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 provides that where an employee is dismissed, the employer shall, if requested, provide particulars in writing of the principal grounds for dismissal to the employee within 14 days of the request. If the reason for dismissal was related to any of the nine grounds of discrimination which include age and disability (including a range of health-related circumstances), the employee may wish to consider making a complaint to the Equality Tribunal under the Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2004. These Acts are administered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform through the Equality Authority. However it is important to note that redress is not available under more than one of the above-mentioned pieces of legislation.  Finally, if an employee decides to sue an employer for &ldquo;wrongful dismissal&rdquo; or &ldquo;breach of contract&rdquo;, it is possible that the employer could, for example, cite &ldquo;frustration of contract&rdquo;, particularly after a long and protracted period of absence due to illness, as a defence for terminating the contract of employment.</P>

	<P>Many charitable and voluntary organisations find the company code structure a suitable means in which to organise their activities.   The favoured type of company structure formed is usually guarantee companies without a share capital and with limited liability.   In return for the privilege provided by society in allowing such companies to organise themselves with limited liability, company law sets out a series of rules and procedures that must be complied with.  These include the submission of an annual return to be accompanied by a full set of audited accounts to the Registrar of Companies.</P>
        <P>My Department, through the Company Law Review Group, is currently working on the General Scheme of a Bill to restructure, consolidate, simplify and modernise company law in Ireland, including the law as it applies to guarantee companies.  It is anticipated that the draft General Scheme of the Bill will be presented to me shortly and, subject to the approval of the Government, I expect to pass the Bill to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for formal legal drafting early next year.</P>

	<P>The table supplies the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the amount of expenditure by my Department on consultancy in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and the number of consultants engaged by the Department in those years.  My Department operates to detailed guidelines when commissioning outside expertise from our consultancy or research budgets. In that regard, my Department interprets Consultancy as relating mainly to the pro<Col N="2139"/>vision of advice and Research as relating to the compilation of information or data.</P>
        <P>The guidelines state, inter alia, that &ldquo;the requirements for external consultancies and/or research projects should arise only where appropriate skills, knowledge or expertise are not available within the Department, where a particular need arises that cannot be addressed within the resources available, and/or where expertise available in other Government Departments and Offices, e.g. obtaining legal advice from the Chief State Solicitors Office in preference to engaging external consultants, cannot be used&rdquo;. Furthermore, in order to maximise the effectiveness of the consultancy and research budgets, all pro<Col N="2140"/>posals for funding must present a strong business case to my Department&rsquo;s Management Board for consideration and approval.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In evaluating each business case my Department examines: whether the project is designed to tackle a problem of sufficient importance to the Department relative to the costs, both in terms of financial and staff resources involved; and whether the business case has been properly identified, prepared and is convincing, and the links to the Department&rsquo;s Strategy Statement.  The Guidelines also set out the specific information required in each application for funding which includes an evaluation of possibilities other than engaging external consultants to carry out the project.</P><Col N="2139"/>

Supplementary welfare allowance is not normally payable to people who are engaged in full-time employment.  For these purposes, employment for 30 hours or more per week is regarded as full-time.  The Executive has advised that, following a notification that the person concerned commenced full-time employment, it contacted him and requested details of the employment.  This information has not been provided and accordingly the payment of rent supplement has been suspended. </P>

	<P>Family Income Supplement (FIS) is designed to provide income support for employees on low earnings with children and thereby preserve the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if s/he were claiming other Social Welfare payments.  My Department received an application for Family Income Supplement from the person concerned on 19th Oct 2006.  Her application was referred to a Social Welfare Inspector for investigation. These investigations are now being concluded and any decision regarding the claim will be made with effect from the date of application.

	<P>Entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance is based on an applicant satisfying medical, means and residency conditions.  In determining entitlement to the allowance there are, in certain cases, unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and enquiries.  Delays can also arise if persons applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.</P>
        <P>Many applicants for carer&rsquo;s allowance are already in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed.   Such payments will normally continue until entitlement to their carer&rsquo;s allowance is determined. There are currently 2,178 pending cases awaiting a decision, of which 67.5% were received within the last eight weeks.  The average time for deciding an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance is currently just under 10 weeks.  The majority of claims currently on hands will be processed within ten weeks.  8,860 new claims were processed to a final decision up to week ending 24 November 2006.  The volume of claims finalised so far this year represents an 11% increase on the total for 2005 and a 19% increase on the total for 2004.  There are 27,333 carer&rsquo;s allowances in payment, compared to 25,000 at the end of 2005 and 23,000 at the end of 2004.</P>

The position will continue to be kept under review to ensure that the best possible level of customer service and customer response continues to be provided.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The social security rights of people living and working in the EU are governed by EU Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72.  The Regulations co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.  This is achieved primarily by setting out rules as to which State&rsquo;s social security a person will pay insurance contributions towards, when, for example, s/he moves from one Member State to another to take up work or where s/he lives in one State and works in another. In addition, the Regulations set out rules as to which State will pay benefit in the event of the usual contingencies arising, sickness, unemployment, old-age etc.</P>
        <P>The general rule is that a person is insured in the State in which s/he works. Equally, the state of employment has, in general, responsibility for paying benefits when, for example, a person becomes unemployed or ill.  The Regulations also provide that when entitlement to benefit is being examined, account must be taken of insurance paid in any other Member State where the person worked.  In the case of pensions, different rules apply and, in general, a person will get a pension from each State in which s/he worked in proportion to the periods of insurance completed in each Member State.  The rules are binding and a person cannot elect to be attached to a particular social security scheme or claim benefits from a State of their choice.</P>
        <P>As a general rule, a person is entitled to sickness benefits from the country where s/he is insured and in accordance with the rules of that country&rsquo;s legislation.  In the case of a person who is working in Northern Ireland and living in the <Col N="2144"/>Republic, the Regulations provide that the person is subject to UK legislation i.e. s/he must pay social insurance contributions to the UK. In the event of sickness the Regulations also provide that sickness benefit is payable by the UK but if, for example, the person has insufficient contributions paid in the UK to meet the contribution conditions there, any PRSI contributions paid in Ireland can be added to the UK record.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The social welfare system comprises two types of payment, social insurance based schemes, which require those eligible to reach a certain standard in terms of the social insurance contributions paid or credited on their record, and non-contributory payments designed for those without the necessary social insurance record for contributory schemes who can satisfy a means test.</P>
        <P>In general, the social insurance class paid by those affected by the marriage bar was a modified rate which now gives coverage for widow(er)&rsquo;s and guardian&rsquo;s payments and occupational injury benefit, bereavement grant and carer&rsquo;s benefit only.  This class of insurance reflected their occupational pension position and general contract of service at that time.  Accordingly, even if they had continued in employment, contributions paid at this class would not have entitled them to a contributory pension under the social welfare system.</P>
        <P>With regard to non-contributory pensions, the new enhanced standard State pension (non-contributory) for those over 66 years, which I introduced at the end of September, features significant improvements in the means test which will allow some who are currently outside the social welfare pensions system to qualify for a payment.  In assessing eligibility for a non-contributory pension the means of the household is assessed and this ensures resources are directed to those who are most in need.  My Department has no record of an application for non-contributory pension from the person concerned but if she wishes to have her eligibility for state pension (non-contributory) assessed, Social Welfare Services Office in Sligo will be able to advise her further.</P>
        <P>With regard to pensions generally, the Government is committed to producing a Green Paper on pensions as part of the new social partnership agreement Towards 2016 with a view to <Col N="2145"/>developing a framework for future pensions policy.  This will deal with pensions in general but it will include outstanding issues relating to social welfare pensions, including those who remain outside the system.  The Green Paper will be published within months.  A consultation process will then take place and the Government will subsequently publish a framework for future pensions policy.</P>

Broadly expertise is sought under three main headings: Support with a number of strategic multi-annual programmes aimed at enhancing the delivery of the Department&rsquo;s services e.g. the Service Delivery Modernisation Programme; Technical consultancies relating to the ongoing development of information technology systems; Consultancy assistance in other areas (for example, policy development).</P><Col N="2146"/>

        <P FLI="0">My Department is undertaking a major programme of business, organizational and technological change to enable it to modernise the services which it provides to its 1 million customers. It is also engaged in a series of policy reviews in areas.  This involves the use of consultants to provide expertise, where it is not sufficiently available within the Department, to support the development and implementation of new and modern technologies in certain instances and research in others.</P>
        <P>Given the fast pace of change in society today and in technological development I do not believe that it would be feasible or indeed sensible for my Department to attempt to meet all the areas of skills and expertise necessary for the future from within the organization. The employment of consultants in a planned way to support the needs of the Department will continue in the future so as to ensure the delivery of a comprehensive and efficient service to customers.</P>

	<P>Section 55 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 provides that a person shall not park a vehicle in a public place if, when so parked, the vehicle would be likely to cause danger to another persons using that place.  This offence of parking a vehicle in a dangerous position is regarded as being a serious road traffic and where a Garda is of the opinion that a person is committing or has committed such offence he or she may arrest the person without warrant.</P>
        <P>A further indication of the serious nature of this offence is that it is scheduled as a penalty point offence with no opportunity permitted to pay a fixed charge in lieu of being prosecuted in Court. In addition, five penalty points apply on conviction of the offence in Court since 3 April 2006.</P>

	<P>The National Development Plan investment programme for national roads is being implemented as part of the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme 2000 to 2006 (ESIOP).   The total investment originally envisaged in national roads in the case of the BMW region for the seven years of the ESIOP was &euro;2,479.362 mil<Col N="2148"/>lion.    The most recent forecast for the final outturn figure for national roads investment in the region for the period 2000 &ndash; 2006 is &euro;2012.531 million, which is &euro;534.96 million less than the amount originally envisaged.</P>
        <P>At the start of the ESIOP, a relatively small number of major road projects in the BMW region had progressed through the planning, design and public procurement processes.    The NRA provided grant assistance towards the acceleration of this work.    As a result there was an intensification of planning and design activity on major road projects, resulting in a sharp upturn in the number of projects arriving at the construction stage, and a corresponding increase in the level of spending on national roads in the region since the beginning of 2004.</P>
        <P>Construction work on a number of the projects will continue into the period after 2006.    There is no question of an &ldquo;underspend&rdquo; or a loss of funding in respect of national roads in the BMW region.   The position is that, at an early point after 2006 the total level of investment which had originally been envisaged for the seven year period from the start of 2000 to the end of 2006 will be reached and surpassed.</P>
        <P>The major pick-up in road building activity in the BMW region has been acknowledged at the ESIOP Monitoring Committee.</P>

	<P>The development of park and ride facilities is a matter for local authorities and as an incentive my Department also provides capital funding for such purposes. In the Greater Dublin Area, &euro;1.2 million was allocated in 2004 for local authorities in respect of interchanges/park and ride, and &euro;1.2 million was allocated in 2005.  The amount paid out by my Department in 2004 was &euro;0.8 million, and &euro;0.289 million was paid in 2005.  In 2006, I have made &euro;5 million in capital available.  Although there have been expressions of interest, I have not received any proposals in relation to this funding.</P>
        <P>In the case of regional cities, the funding allocated is in respect of bus priority and park and ride measures.  In 2004, my Department allocated &euro;8.5 million for bus priority and park and ride measures in the regional cities.  Of this funding, &euro;2.4 million was drawn down in relation to park and ride.  An original allocation of &euro;8 million by my Department in 2005 was increased to &euro;10.8 million, due to accelerated work on Green Routes in Cork.  Of this funding, &euro;1.5 million was <Col N="2152"/>drawn down in relation to park and ride.  In 2006, a total of &euro;12 million has been made available for these measures in the regional cities.  To date, &euro;425,000 has been drawn down in respect of park and ride facilities.</P>

        <P>The information requested by the Deputy has been provided by the DTO and is contained in the attached tables.  In the case of park and ride developments provided as part of Luas and rail works, the cost is included in the overall cost of the developments.  In other cases, park and ride facilities have been funded through the Dublin Transportation Office Traffic Management Grants Scheme (DTO-TMG), and the relevant figures are set out in the tables.  I should also add that my Department is in regular contact with local authorities about the availability of funds for the development of traffic management grant measures, including park and ride facilities.</P><Col N="2151"/>

        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest> his views on a change to the relevant legislation whereby the offence of breaching a three ton restricted area would in addition to a fine also incur penalty points for the driver in view of the fact that the present fine system makes no distinction between a person committing this offence for the first time and a repeat offender. </Quest>
        <QRef>[41261/06]</QRef><Col N="2154"/>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The policy in relation to the range of offences, scheduled in the Road Traffic Acts, to which the penalty points system can be applied is that the focus in relation to all such offences is on safety.</P>
        <P>At present a road authority may apply a road traffic regulation to prohibit access to a road or area to large vehicles where the unladen weight of such vehicle exceeds the weight specified on the regulatory road traffic sign provided at the entrance to that road.  However an exemption is permitted in respect of a large vehicle that has no option but to go past the regulatory sign to access premises located on that road.  This exemption therefore legally permits large vehicles to be driven on that road in those specified circumstances.  Therefore the fact that such a vehicle is driven on the road cannot, of itself, be regarded as a road safety issue and accordingly it is not appropriate to schedule that offence to come within the ambit of the penalty point system.</P>
        <P>Since 3 April 2006 the illegal breach of the weight restriction regulation was brought within the remit of the fixed charge system.  A driver of a vehicle who does not comply with the regulation is liable to be issued with a fixed charge notice by a Garda and then has the option to pay a fixed charge of &euro;60 within 28 days or that <Col N="2155"/>amount increased by 50% within the following 28 days.  If the person opts not to pay the fixed charge then he or she will be prosecuted in court.</P>
        <P>The monetary penalty provisions contained in the Road Traffic Act 2002 provide for a higher monetary penalty for a repeat offender.  If a person is convicted in court of breaching the weight limit restriction then he or she is liable on a first offence to a fine of up to &euro;800, for a second or subsequent such offence is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 and if the offence is a third or subsequent such offence committed within 12 months he or she is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or both.  The level of fine that is imposed by the court in any instance is at the discretion of the court.</P>
        <P>Furthermore the Road Traffic Act 2006 provides that the fine of &euro;800 referred to above be increased to &euro;1,000 and that the fine amounts of &euro;1,500 be increased to &euro;2,000 in each case.  I propose to commence the relevant provision shortly to provide for the increased level of fines.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest> if his Department has commenced the drafting of the regulations required under the Transport Acts and related legislation to allow local authorities to permit partial footpath parking in areas where, due to the narrowness of the street, full on-street vehicular parking causes congestion and prevents the easy flow of traffic, particularly in residential areas where, due to the small size and depth or absence of front gardens, the provision of full off-street parking is not possible; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[41278/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 it is prohibited to park a mechanically propelled vehicle on any part of a footpath.  Since 3 April 2006 this illegal parking offence was brought within the ambit of the fixed charge system and, on issue of a fixed charge notice, a person may pay &euro;40 within a 28 day period or that amount increased by 50% within the next 28 day period in lieu of being prosecuted in court.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council are seeking an amendment to the 1997 regulations to permit partial parking on public footpaths and contend that parking of this nature is permitted in other jurisdictions but no country has been identified in this regard.  My Department has no information in relation to the circumstances or conditions in other jurisdictions where partial parking on footpaths may be permitted.  The paramount matter to be considered before vehicles are permitted to park partially on a public footpath is the safety of pedestrians.</P><Col N="2156"/>
        <P>It is not just a case of amending the parking regulations and that vehicles then proceed to park on footpaths.  It must first be ascertained what circumstances and conditions apply where this measure is deployed in other countries .i.e. whether such parking is only permitted where the footpath is of a certain minimum width, where the footpath pavement has first been constructed to a certain weight bearing standard, whether is it a requirement that the footpath be dished and kerbs removed to facilitate the driving of vehicles up onto a footpath and that such parking is not permitted where access points, manhole covers etc for utilities are located.</P>
        <P>It is not proposed to make any amendment to the current law until all of the safety implications are assessed and in this regard Dublin City Council are being requested to identify the countries abroad where such measures are said to be in place and to submit fuller details in relation to the proposal.</P>

	<P>I should point out that my remit covers only the network of National roads.  This amounts to some 5% of the total network of roads in the State.  With the exception of a small number of Toll roads, the national road network is outside of the commercial arena and it would be misleading to ascribe a commercial monetary value to it.  In the lifetime of this Government approximately &euro;9.4 billion has been invested in the national roads network.  Under Transport 21 a further &euro;15 billion of national road investment is planned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Cycling is an important part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment under Transport 21 to increase modal share of public transport through infrastructure and service improvements and to encourage a transfer of trips from the private car to more sustainable modes of transport.</P>
        <P>While the actual provision of cycle ways and cycle parking is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant local authorities, my Department provides funding to the local authorities for the development of such facilities.  Approximately &euro;30m has been provided by my Department to <Col N="2157"/>the Dublin Transportation Office for the provision of specific cycling facilities in the Greater Dublin Area since 1994.  &euro;1m was provided in 2005 and &euro;2.2m in 2006.  The investment of bus priority funding and cycling-only spending has resulted in some 300 kms of cycle facilities being provided, as well as cycle parking facilities throughout the GDA.</P>
        <P>The Dublin Transportation Office has recently adopted a Cycle Policy for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) over the coming years.  The policy proposes to enhance the cycling environment in the GDA and promote safe cycling by a variety of means, including creating a continuous cycle-friendly environment on cycle routes and training and education measures.  My Department will assist the roll out of this plan through the provision of funding.</P>
        <P>Outside of Dublin, the framework for the promotion of cycling in the regional cities is set out in the relevant local land use and transportation strategy or in the relevant Development Plan or Local Area Plan.  Cork City Council has developed a cycle network strategy.  The strategy is currently being delivered as part of the development of a network of &ldquo;Green Routes&rdquo; in Cork.  In Galway, the City Development Plan includes proposals for improving facilities for cyclists which is now being rolled out, as is also the case in respect of Limerick.  Waterford City Development Plan includes proposals for improving facilities for cyclists and an implementation plan is now being prepared by the local authority.</P>

        <P>I will be announcing 65 million Euro exchequer assistance under Transport 21 for regional airports including Knock Airport within the jurisdiction.  Decision on grant aid will take account of a realistic assessment of sustainable development, having regard to each airport&rsquo;s natural hinterland.  I can confirm that the Government will continue to support the Derry to Dublin air service under the current essential air services programme.</P>

	<P>I understand from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that, while its Strategic Development Plan 2005-2010 recognises the need for a network of small industries and service providers, grant assistance is not available to local shops.  Given the proliferation of retail businesses over the years without recourse to grant assistance, and in the context also of the possible implications for State aid which could attach to the provision of such assistance, I am satisfied that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s has taken an appropriate line in this matter.</P>
        <P>Under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts, assistance is available to qualified applicants in a Gaeltacht area for building new houses and improving existing houses.

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the joint ministerial initiative on the review of local and community development structures, the Government agreed a series of measures in January 2004 designed to improve arrangements under which community and local development initiatives are delivered and improve cohesion and focus across various measures.  In this context, in line with a recommendation in the NDP/CSF evaluation report on county and city developments boards <Col N="2162"/>(CDBs) to support a strengthened social inclusion co-ordination function, funding for improved co-ordination of local and community development services was provided in the Vote of my Department over three years (2004, 2005 and 2006).</P>
        <P>During 2004, a total of &euro;3,248,600 was allocated to CDBs and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in respect of proposals aimed at improving linkages and sharing resources by local agencies.  In 2005, some &euro;4,836,927 was allocated in respect of proposals for the improved alignment of local and community development agencies and the establishment of unified structures in provincial areas.  This allocation included &euro;1,463,400 for actions to promote volunteering at the local level.  So far in 2006, &euro;4,270,962 has been allocated for alignment actions and &euro;300,600 for the promotion of volunteering at the local level.</P>
        <P>At this stage, 24 of the local authority areas and na Gaeltachta&iacute; have fully agreed the structures which will cover their areas from January 2007 and therefore the requirements arising in 2007 in relation to cohesion will be much reduced.  While I am confident that agreement on local, rural and community development structures will have been reached in all outstanding areas by the end of 2006, owing to the impending end of the financial year, it is unlikely that it will be possible to allocate funding for implementation costs to all those areas in the current year.  The provision of &euro;2,200,000 in the Estimates for 2007 will be primarily focused on addressing requirements for such areas and also to meet any further contingencies identified by the local development agencies in relation to implementing plans for improved cohesion.</P>
        <P>Provision for the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme will increase by 15% or just over &euro;7m next year in the context of the expansion of this programme nationwide from January 2007.  An additional &euro;5m is being provided in 2007 to further support volunteering.  Finally, the resources for rural development will increase almost threefold over the lifetime of the next rural development programme which covers the period 2007 to 2013.  The improvements that I have outlined represent a significant improvement on the current level of resources available for local, community and rural development services.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category B.  Category B caters for farmers who made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000-2002.  Investments can include purchase or long term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.  The person named applied under Category B(i) in relation to investment in land and B(ii)  in relation to the purchase of suckler quota and has been deemed successful under both measures.</P>
        <P>The Regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme provide that checks must be made to ensure that an allocation from the National Reserve, to an applicant who has already ben<Col N="2164"/>efited under other measures associated with the Single Payment Scheme, does not result in double benefit.  An applicant may only benefit from the measure that is most beneficial.  The person named has already benefited from another measure (Force Majeure during the reference period) and an allocation from the Reserve would result in double benefit.  Therefore, the force majeure has been rescinded in favour of an allocation from the Reserve which is more beneficial.  A formal letter of decision together with relevant payment due will issue shortly to the person named.</P>

	<P>As indicated in my reply to the earlier question referred to, a group representing retired farmers lodged a petition with the European Parliament Committee on Petitions in May 2003, alleging that Ireland had not implemented correctly the Council Regulations governing the 1994 and 2000 Schemes of Early Retirement from Farming.  The Committee requested information from the European Commission.  In reply, the Commission made it clear that in its considered opinion there was no question of any infringement having been committed by Ireland in the implementation of the Schemes.  The Chairman of the European Parliament Committee on Petitions raised these issues with me again in a letter dated 5 September 2006, while acknowledging the view that the Commission had taken.</P>
        <P>A reply to the Chairman of the Petitions Committee is being prepared.  Most of the issues raised in his letter were also dealt with in the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture and Food.  Certain of the Joint Committee&rsquo;s recommendations are precluded by the EU <Col N="2165"/>Regulations under which the current Scheme and its predecessor are operated.  I saw merit in other aspects of the Committee&rsquo;s report; and some recommendations have been either fully or partially implemented and others will be considered in the context of the proposal for a new Early Retirement Scheme, which has been included in the draft Development Plan for the period 2007-2013.  Following clarification from the European Commission, I have also recently announced increases in the rate of pension under both Schemes.  These increases, which are financed entirely from the National Exchequer, will cost some &euro;33 million extra over the remaining period of the two Schemes, and some 5,000 retired farmers will benefit from them.</P>

	<P>The position is that the Council Regulation governing the Single Payment Scheme provides that, by 1 January 2007, Member States shall set up a system of advising farmers on land and farm management to be known as &ldquo;the farm advisory system&rdquo;.  The system is to be operated by one or more designated authorities or by private bodies.   The advisory activity must cover at least the Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) and Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition associated with cross-compliance.   The regulation also provides that farmers may participate in the system on a voluntary basis but that Member States shall give priority to farmers who receive more than &euro;15,000 of direct payments (Single Payment) each year.</P>
        <P>It is intended that the existing Teagasc advisory service together with the service provided by existing private REPS planners will constitute the Farm Advisory System in Ireland from 1 January 2007.  This arrangement has been confirmed to the European Commission.</P>

	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the recent announcement by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources awarding excise relief to 16 projects under the new Excise Relief Scheme.  Responsibility for this scheme rests with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. However, I am aware that the scheme was subject to a state aid application and the state aid guidelines precluded granting preference to domestic producers and/or feedstocks.</P>
        <P>I am confident that farmers will respond positively to the demand for feedstock arising from these new projects and this will encourage the development of an energy crop growing sector in Ireland.</P>

	<P>The position is that Single Payment entitlements are not attached to land but are the property of the farmer who was farming during the reference period 2000-2002, who was in receipt of direct payments under one or more of the Livestock Premium and/or Arable Aid schemes and who claimed the entitlements by submitting a Single Payment application form in 2005.</P>
        <P>Entitlements may be sold with or without land but can only be sold without land once 80% have been used in one calendar year.  On the other hand entitlements may only be leased to another farmer if accompanied by an equivalent number of hectares of eligible land.   Entitlements may also of course be transferred with or without land by gift or through inheritance.</P>
        <P>In order to transfer entitlements by way of sale, lease, gift, or inheritance, a transfer of entitlements application form must be completed and submitted to my Department.  The application form to be completed by farmers engaged in transferring entitlements for the 2007 Single Payment Scheme year is available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.agriculture.gov.ie</i>.</P>

        <P>The Deputy may be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through the local special educational needs organisers (SENO), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special needs supports. These supports include resource teaching hours for pupils with low-incidence special needs, based on applications in respect of individual pupils.  You may also be aware that a specific function of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local SENOs, is to identify appropriate educational placements for all children with special educational needs.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, extraordinary progress has been made right across the whole spectrum of education in recent years, with the extra investment provided by this Government to support the implementation of our Programme for Government commitments and enable progress on emerging areas of need. The budget for my Department has increased substantially in recent years and the recent Estimates provide &euro;8.4 billion for education in 2007.</P>
        <P>We have hired 4,000 extra primary teachers since 2002, with approximately 1,200 of these posts created in the last school year. These extra <Col N="2172"/>teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, to tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional support for children with special needs. An additional 800 primary teachers are included in my Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2007.</P>
        <P>The average class size at primary level is now 24, while there is one teacher for every 17 children, including resource teachers etc. At post-primary level, there is now one teacher for every 13 children.</P>
        <P>Under the largest school building programme in the history of the State we are spending nearly &euro;500 million on school buildings in 2006, compared to just over &euro;90 million in 1997. Under the 2006 Budget &euro;3.9 billion is being provided over the five years 2006-2010 for capital projects at all levels of the education sector from primary to third level.</P>
        <P>We have also intensified work to tackle disadvantage at all levels in recent years. A comprehensive Action Plan for tackling educational disadvantage was launched in May 2005 under which extra resources have been provided to our most disadvantaged schools over the past year, while even more additional supports will be rolled out. In 2007, nearly &euro;730 million will be spent tackling educational disadvantage at all levels &mdash; this represents an increase of &euro;95 million on the 2006 provision.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government places a high priority on improving special needs education. I am proud to say that the improvements made in this area in recent years have been dramatic, with the enactment of the EPSEN Act and a substantial increase in staffing supports for children with special needs.</P>
        <P>There are now almost 8,200 Special Needs Assistants in our primary and second level schools. The amount of funding allocated for SNAs in 2007 is over &euro;240 million. There are also more than 7,000 resource and learning support teachers.  In 2007, &euro;820 million will be spent on educational provision for those with special needs and disabilities.</P>
        <P>There has also been a major focus in recent years on science education and improving schools&rsquo; ICT facilities. We have updated the Science programmes in our schools and provided specific investment to improve facilities for teaching the science and technology subjects.  A new science curriculum has been introduced at primary level, supported by a grant in December 2004 of &euro;1000 per school plus &euro;10 per pupil. Revised syllabi in Junior Certificate Science and Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology have also been introduced.</P>
        <P>In November 2005, capital investment of &euro;40 million was announced to upgrade technology rooms in over 500 second-level schools and support the introduction of a new leaving cert course &lsquo;Technology&rsquo; and the replacement of the techni<Col N="2173"/>cal drawing course with a new &lsquo;Design and Communications&rsquo; course.</P>
        <P>In relation to ICT, the priority in recent years has been networking and bringing broadband to all schools. I intend to build on this by publishing a new ICT strategy in 2007 that will address the broad range of needs &mdash; from hardware and software to maintenance and teacher training etc.</P>
        <P>As well as improving the facilities in our schools and ensuring increasing staffing levels, we have also placed a high priority on improving support for second chance education. The number of PLC places has increased, while initiatives to attract people back to education have been prioritised. Adult education has received particular attention, as have programmes to improve adult literacy.</P>
        <P>We have also focused on increasing access to third level education. The number of students has increased significantly, to over 140,000. In 2004, 55% of 17-19 year olds entered third level, up from 44% in 1998.</P>
        <P>We introduced a Top Up Grant for students who need the most support, which will benefit more than 11,000 students this year. The maximum amount of grant support available this year (including top-up) is &euro;5,970.</P>
        <P>Overall provision for third level education in the 2007 Estimates amounts to &euro;1.9 billion. Budget 2006 outlined a 5 year programme of investment in third level building projects of &euro;900 million over 2006-2010. This will see major projects progressed in every university and institute of technology.</P>
        <P>In line with our commitments in the Programme for Government, we have provided for a massive increase in funding for third level research activities in recent years.  Since the launch of the programme for research in third-level institutions (PRTLI), awards totalling &euro;605 million have been made.  A further &euro;640 million is being invested under SFI. The Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation published earlier this year sets out a multi-billion plan for the coming years.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will see, huge progress has been made across a wide range of areas. It would be impossible to address all of the work done in one answer. However, if the Deputy has a query about a particular aspect of the Programme for Government, I would happy to answer it.</P>

	<P>Teachers trained outside the jurisdiction of the State, whose qualifications have been assessed and accepted by my Department, but who do not possess an appropriate Irish language qualification, are granted a five year period of provisional recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools. During this period these teachers are expected to obtain their Irish language qualification, Scr&uacute;d&uacute; le hAghaidh C&aacute;il&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge (SCG), in order to become fully recognised as mainstream class teachers, learning support teachers, and home/school/community/liaison teachers. They must also provide certification that they have resided in the Gaeltacht while attending an approved three-week course or its aggregated equivalent.</P>
        <P>Teachers who had acquired a university degree in Irish were required to sit the SCG in common with other teachers but they had exemption from Paper II. Under the new arrangement, candidates, who have Irish as a major subject at primary degree level, including the person referred to by the Deputy, will be required to take the practical test, which incorporates three elements &mdash; to teach an Irish lesson, to take the theory test and to compile a portfolio of materials as a resource for the teaching of Irish &mdash; which will form a part of the SCG for all candidates from 1st September, 2006 onwards.</P>

	<P>The criteria and procedures for the recognition of new primary schools were revised in 2002 based on the recommendations of a report of the Commission on School Accommodation, on which the Education Partners were represented.</P>
        <P>Applications for the recognition of new primary schools are assessed by an independent advisory board (the New Schools Advisory Committee) on the basis of the facts provided by the patron body in support of the case for the new school and the likely demand for places. Schools are granted provisional recognition and permanent recognition follows when long term viability has been established on actual enrolments over a period.</P>
        <P>Under this process all patron bodies are treated on an equal footing regardless of whether they are denominational, inter-denominational or multi-denominational. The Committee&rsquo;s annual programme of work culminates in a report with recommendations on the granting of recognition to an application. I am happy to support all new schools where it has been clearly demonstrated in accordance with the criteria that a demand exists.</P>

        <Quest> the way she proposes to address the urgent need for additional resources for foreign language teachers, in particular if she will be making specific allocations in this regard to schools in west Dublin who are under pressure in relation to the number of newcomer children and the shortage of language facilities; if she will be deploying additional resources to the schools (details supplied) in Dublin 15. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In order to ensure that children whose first language is not English can succeed at school, my Department gives additional support to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional teaching posts or portions of teacher posts.</P>
        <P>The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled.  Recent years have seen a significant rise in the number of language support posts being provided by my Department. In the current school year there are more than 1,100 such teachers in our schools, at a cost of &euro;67 million. This compares with approximately 820 language support teachers last year and just 260 in the 2001/02 school year. Hence there has been more <Col N="2176"/>than a four-fold increase in language support posts over the past few years.</P>
        <P>In addition to the full-time posts approved, grants towards the cost of employing part-time teachers are paid to primary schools with between 3 and 13 eligible non-national pupils. In the 2005/06 school year, 409 schools sought grant aid under this provision.</P>
        <P>Between extra language support posts and grant aid, the level of support provided to schools to meet the needs of children whose first language is not English has increased dramatically in recent years. Nonetheless I am very conscious of the pressures on schools &mdash; such as those referred to by the Deputy &mdash; that have large numbers of non-English speaking children enrolled. I am determined to provide greater support for these schools.</P>
        <P>To that end, provision has been made in the 2007 Estimates for an extra 200 language support teachers in 2007. A further 350 posts will be provided under the Towards 2016 partnership agreement between 2008 and 2009. These extra posts will allow the current cap of 2 teachers per school to be reformed.</P>
        <P>While details as to the precise number of posts to be allocated at both levels in the current school year and the schools to which the posts will be allocated have yet to be finalised I can assure the Deputy that I will be anxious to ensure that the additional resources are properly targeted at those areas where they are most needed.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive strategy is currently being finalised which will ensure that the extra investment in this area is being used to the best effect, and that it is underpinned by the right support and training for teachers.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 456, 459 and 489 together.</P>
        <P>School enrolment is a matter for Board of Managements. The parent in question should, therefore, apply for enrolment, in the normal way, to the Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; in the area. Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>
        <P>In addition, I can confirm to the Deputy that the Department is in receipt of an application to establish an additional Gaelchol&aacute;iste in the South Dublin area.  This application is currently under consideration and a decision will be communicated to the proposer as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>Schools which have not qualified for inclusion in DEIS, and which are receiving additional resources under pre-existing schemes for addressing disadvantage, can be assured that they will continue to get support in line with their level of disadvantage. I can also assure the Deputy that the school to which he refers will benefit from the lower local contribution rate for capital works.</P>
        <P>With regard to ACCESS programmes, the aim under DEIS is to strengthen progression and access to higher education for those from disadvantaged communities through cooperation between third-level institutions and schools serving the communities concerned. The National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education has published an action plan for the period 2005-2007 (Achieving Equity of Access to Higher Education in Ireland). The areas for action identified by the plan include the development of a national framework of equity of access policies, initiatives to widen access by under-represented learners and the provision of supports for higher education institutions in pursuing a practical agenda <Col N="2179"/>for achieving equity of access as a core part of institutional strategy. The work carried out in these areas will complement the new approach being adopted under the DEIS initiative and my Department and the National Office will work together in this regard.</P>
        <P>Under DEIS, I recently announced the provision of 80 new posts to add to the 370 posts already in place in order to extend Home School Community Liaison services to any of the DEIS schools that do not currently have the service.</P>
        <P>In addition, all schools, including the school to which the Deputy refers, which currently have HSCL service but are not included in DEIS, will continue to receive HSCL services after 2006/2007. HSCL services will continue to be provided to some 650 schools (282 second level and 370 primary schools).</P>
        <P>However, following a full review of HSCL clustering arrangements by the Department in the coming year, levels of service may be varied in some schools to reflect their levels of disadvantage and size and to facilitate local HSCL co-ordinators working with families of disadvantaged children across both primary and second level.</P>

	<P>The average class size at primary level in 1996/97 was 27, while there was one teacher for every 22 children, including support teachers.  Details of the average class size and the pupil teacher ratio for the current school year are not yet available.  However, in 2005/06 the average primary class size was 24, while there was one teacher for every 17 children, including support teachers.</P>
        <P>In 1996/97 there were 21,035 primary teachers. By September 2006, the number of primary teachers had risen considerably to 27,823.  In 1998, there were approximately 300 special needs assistants in primary schools.  This compares to a figure of 6,775 in the current year.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will see, there are nearly 7,000 more primary teachers now than there were in 1997 and both average class size and the pupil teacher ratio have been significantly reduced.  While I appreciate the need to make further progress in reducing class size, it should be acknowledged just how much has been achieved.  In recent years, priority has rightly been given to providing extra support for children with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those that need help with their English.</P>
        <P>Special education provision in particular has undergone a level of expansion the extent of which nobody could have predicted a few years ago &mdash; and this was only right.  If we had put all 4,000 of the teachers hired since 2002 into classroom teaching, our average class size would be a lot smaller than it is now.  But we would have done a great disservice to those children who need extra help the most.  I am sure the Deputy would accept that we have taken the right approach.</P>
        <P>Now that children with special needs are finally getting the support they deserve, we are providing extra teachers this year and next specifically to reduce class sizes, through a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</P>
        <P>This has meant that, whereas all primary schools were staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the 05/06 school year, in the current school year there is a general rule of at least one teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &ndash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next year, we are com<Col N="2182"/>mitted to hiring even more extra teachers in order to reduce this to a general rule of at least one teacher for every 27 children.</P>
        <P>We also acted this year to specifically address the needs of growing schools by making it easier to qualify for a developing school post.  Over 280 such posts were sanctioned for the 2006/07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005/06.  This change specifically addressed the needs of schools which are seeing large increases in their enrolments year on year.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers.  About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

	<P>Significant improvements have been made in the staffing of our second level schools in recent years.  In the 1996/97 school year, there were approximately 23,200 whole-time equivalent teaching posts allocated to second level schools.  For 2006/07, the corresponding figure is 25,424 whole-time equivalent posts.</P>
        <P>This increase in staffing has dramatically improved the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years.  The pupil teacher ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the 1996/97 school year to 13.2:1 in the 2005/06 school year.  The PTR for 2006/07 is not yet available.</P>
        <P>In relation to class size at post primary, data on average class size is not available within my Department.  Teacher allocations to second level are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment.  In general <Col N="2183"/>a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established Junior Certificate, Leaving Certificate, repeat Leaving Certificate and Transition Year Programmes and a ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Post leaving Certificate courses and Leaving Certificate Applied.  Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils&rsquo; needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation.</P>
        <P>The rules for allocating teaching posts provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet essential curricular commitments, my Department will consider applications for additional short term support.  An independent Appeals Committee is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.  In relation to providing for children with special educational needs, figures for 1996/97 are not readily available, however, there are currently 1,854 whole time equivalent additional teachers in place to support pupils with special educational needs at second level.  This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils.  In addition, there are approximately 1,365 whole time equivalent special needs assistants (SNAs) in our second level schools.</P>
        <P>In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector.  Priority will be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas.</P>

Under the package, schools received &euro;2,000 towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment in their school.  This grant issued together with the annual minor works grant which I have increased by 44%.  This funding package is being made as part of this Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to modernise facilities in schools throughout the country.  It remains a priority for me to ensure that all schools are resourced and facilities are improved where necessary.</P>
        <P>Schools may also use their general capitation funding to support the implementation of curricula including Physical Education.  The primary school capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years.  Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from &euro;57.14 per pupil to &euro;163.58 with effect from 1st January, 2007. This represents an increase of over 186% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.</P>
        <P>A start-up grant of &euro;6,348.69 was also paid to the school last August.  This grant is to enable new schools to purchase equipment, furniture, teaching and administrative materials and to cover insurance and other costs attendant with the operation of a new school.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Department to investigate the position with regard to the grants in question and revert to the school referred to by the Deputies as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 478, 480 and 481 together.</P>
        <P>My Department provides funding to primary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for arranging insurance cover, including the specific requirements of insurance cover for school property and against public liability, is a matter for the managerial authorities of primary schools and would fall to be met from the capitation funding which schools receive from my Department.</P>
        <P>The primary school capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from &euro;57.14 per pupil to &euro;163.58 with effect from 1st January, 2007.</P>
        <P>This represents an increase of over 186% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes.  One scheme is the 1978/79 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary.  This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.  This scheme has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the Ancillary Services grant.</P>
        <P>The Ancillary Services grant scheme does not provide for the linking of the grants to any particular pay scale and is flexible by nature, giving Boards of Management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.</P>
        <P>The standard rate of grant per pupil under the scheme was increased from &euro;102 in 2002 to &euro;139 in 2006.  From 1st January next this will be increased by a further &euro;6.50 per pupil bringing the overall ancillary grant per pupil at primary level to &euro;145.50.</P>
        <P>In the case of both the capitation grant and the ancillary services grant, a minimum grant equivalent to that for 60 pupils is paid to schools with enrolments of less than 60.  This level of grant is payable in respect of the school referred to by the Deputy.</P><Col N="2189"/>
        <P>A start-up grant of &euro;6,348.69 was paid to the school in August.  In addition, an advance payment of portion of the ancillary services grant has been paid to the school.  The balance of that grant and the full capitation grant will be paid in 2007.</P>
        <P>There is no provision for the retrospective payment of once-off grants of the type referred to by the Deputy to new schools.</P>

	<P>My Department is of the view that children with autism, in common with all children should have access to appropriate provision delivered by suitably qualified teachers within the school system where children can mix with their wider peer group and have maximum opportunities for integration. The preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for children with autism, is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through place<Col N="2190"/>ment in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools, a view that is supported by the findings of the Task Force Report on Autism. My Department&rsquo;s ongoing commitment is to ensuring that all children, including those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders, receive an education appropriate to their needs.</P>

	<P>Between January 2003 and the end of October 2006, a total of &euro;47.57m was expended by my Department on the purchase of prefab accommodation for primary and second level schools across the country. The annualised details are set out in the attached table. The expenditure was for the supply and installation of prefabricated buildings including associated site works, and other costs such as compliance with planning permission conditions, professional fees, and connections for water, electricity and sewage.  </P>
        <P>The spend on temporary accommodation represents a very small fraction of the overall yearly spend on school buildings. The current focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible, by way of permanent accommodation. In order to reduce the amount of temporary accommodation at primary level a new devolved initiative was launched in 2003. The purpose of this initiative is to allow schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money. Since the introduction of the devolved initiative, over 200 schools have been allocated funding under this scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 490 and 492 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has issued guidelines to the Management Authorities of second level schools on meeting their obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act to ensure the safety and health of their employees.</P>
        <P>As in other workplaces, staff in second level schools may be victims of violent or intimidating behaviour.  During the course of their work, school staff may be at risk in the form of verbal abuse, threats, assaults or other forms of intimidation. This behaviour may come from pupils, parents, guardians, other staff members or visitors.</P>
        <P>While it may not be possible to prevent all such incidents, effective school policies concerning a range of issues can have a positive effect in reducing the risk of such incidents occurring and to minimise their consequences.  The close interaction of the school management with staff and parents in developing effective school policies on school discipline, bullying and health and safety contributes to a positive school environment where mutual respect, co-operation and natural justice are accepted features of the school community by all.</P>
        <P>School Management Authorities are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school. The Code should be developed by the Principal and the staff in consultation with parents and approved by the School Management Authority. Parents should be circularised regarding the Code when it is finalised.</P>
        <P>This Code should have as its aim the maintenance of desirable standards of behaviour, particularly in fostering understanding and co-operation between teachers, pupils and parents in helping schools to adapt to the needs of its students while establishing the basis for responsible actions by its students and observing the principles of natural justice. Any sanction imposed on a pupil should be in accordance with the Code of Discipline. Procedures for suspending pupils should be clearly set out in the school&rsquo;s Code of Discipline and should be adhered to.  Aggressive, threatening or violent behaviour towards a teacher is regarded as serious or gross misbehaviour and may warrant suspension.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board is currently working on revised Guidelines for Developing School Codes of Behaviour. This work is nearing completion and I expect that the revised Guidelines will be available in the new year.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority has also issued a Code of Practice on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying. It defines workplace bullying as repeated inappropriate behaviour, direct or <Col N="2194"/>indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, at the place of work and/or in the course of employment, which could reasonably be regarded as undermining the individual&rsquo;s right to dignity at work. An isolated incident of the behaviour described in this definition may be an affront to dignity at work but as a once off incident is not considered to be bullying.</P>
        <P>As a supportive resource, teachers can now access an Employee Assistance Service (EAS) specifically tailored to meet their particular needs.  The EAS now available to teachers throughout the country is designed to support the health and well-being of teachers which will in turn positively affect work quality and performance.  The service will incorporate confidential counselling on issues such as health, relationships, addictions, bereavement, stress, conflict, critical incident and trauma.</P>
        <P>Services include, single session or short term structured telephone counselling, face-to-face short term confidential counselling as well as critical incident debriefing.  These services are intended to assist individual teachers and school communities to increase psychological resilience, improve communication, develop positive work relationships and enhance well-being</P>
        <P>Earlier this year I announced an implementation strategy following publication of &ldquo;School Matters&rdquo; the Report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools, and that strategy is now well advanced.</P>
        <P>At the core of the recommendations of the Task Force was the putting in place of a National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS). This has now happened with the appointment of a National Co-ordinator and four Assistant National Co-ordinators. In addition, nine Regional Development Officers and twenty part-time Associates have been recruited to ensure the success of this significant initiative. A key feature of the composition of the National Behaviour Support Service is the assignment to it of a senior psychologist and three psychologists. These have been seconded from the National Educational Psychological Service and their presence will ensure that the team operates in a multi-disciplinary way. A full-time administrator is based in Navan Education Centre.</P>
        <P>Since their appointment, the team has been working on a number of key issues as follows: the development of a Draft National Framework for Behaviour Improvement; the development of models of good practice for systems in schools which assist with and impact on classroom and whole school behaviour; ongoing training for the NBSS team; and research into and communication with behaviour support systems in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>The NBSS has commenced its engagement with schools and a series of information seminars have been organised throughout the country. <Col N="2195"/>Subsequently intensive work will begin with a smaller number of schools most in need of this intervention.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that this new service will work intensively with those schools initially selected for inclusion in this development. I have already announced that part of this work will see us trialling the concept of a behaviour support classroom in up to 30 schools next year. I want to emphasise however that these classrooms cannot be, in themselves, a solution to the issue of poor student behaviour. They must be one part of a holistic response which should see a school, actively supported by the Behaviour Support Team, defining for itself a pathway to improvement.</P>
        <P>It terms of expenditure, funding has been provided to cover the costs of the NBSS recruitment process, staff training and development, staff salaries, establishment of an NBSS Office, development of an NBSS website and the information seminars with schools. At this stage, it is anticipated that the &euro;2 million allocated in 2006 toward the implementation of the Task Force&rsquo;s recommendations will be fully expended by the end of the current financial year.</P>
        <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Deputies to my announcement in the context of the 2007 Estimates, that I am providing &euro;8 million to support the work of the NBSS, in helping schools promote positive student behaviour at second level.</P>

The Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. </P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a <Col N="2196"/>school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission of a pupil to the school.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 498 and 499 together.</P>
        <P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P>In January 2005, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) issued guidelines to the management authorities of all primary and post primary schools on reporting student absences,suspensions and expulsions. These guidelines advise that a school must report to the NEWB where a decision has been taken to expel a student.</P>
        <P>Schools are also required to periodically report to the NEWB on student absences. Suspension is one of seven possible categories of absence which are reported on.</P>
        <P>As regards the specific data requested by the Deputy on the matter of suspensions, I have <Col N="2199"/>requested the NEWB to provide this information to me and I will reply directly to the Deputy when the data is to hand.</P>

Arising from this, a submission has been made to the local authority on estimated school site and school requirements for inclusion in the local area plan.

Owing to the level of spare capacity in existing Post-Primary schools in the area, the Department is not proposing additional post-primary provision at this time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The difference between the role and responsibility of a Board as employer and the Minister for Education and Science flows from the history of education in Ireland and the Constitution. The relationship of the State and schools derives from provisions in our Constitution. The State has a Constitutional obligation under Article 42.4 to provide for free primary education.  As Minister, my constitutional obligation is to provide for primary education and not to provide it. As Minister I make arrangements <Col N="2202"/>for the availability of primary education, through the payment of teacher salaries and provision of funding.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Education Act, schools are managed by the Patron and the Patron is responsible for the direct governance of a school.  The Patron nominates a Board of a Management to manage a school on its behalf.  My Department has not now and never had direct responsibility for the day to day operation of a school.  This position was recognised by the Supreme Court in Crowley v Ireland.</P>
        <P>In addition, Section 24 (1) of the Education Act 1998 provides that the Board of Management &ldquo;may appoint such and so many persons as teachers and other staff of a school as the board from time to time thinks necessary for the performance of its powers and functions under this Act&rdquo;.  Section 24(3) of the Act also states that &ldquo;A board shall appoint teachers and other staff, who are to be paid from monies provided by the Oireachtas, and may suspend or dismiss such teachers and staff, in accordance with procedures agreed from time to time between the Minister, the patron, recognised school management organisations and any recognised trade union and staff association representing teachers or other staff as appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Board has the responsibility to ensure that the school operates efficiently and effectively and also has responsibilities in relation to the actions of its employees in the context of the regulations outlined above.  Therefore, the Board as manager of the school must manage the staff in the school and intervene when it considers necessary to resolve matters relating to the actions of its employees. The Board of Management is the employer and has similar powers to any other employer.  My Department is not the employer and does not have an employer/employee relationship with the teachers in a school. My Department cannot perform functions which are proper to the Board in relation to the management of the teaching staff of the school, including decisions in respect of difficulties or personnel problems with teachers.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to change the position in this regard.</P>

        <Quest> if, in relation to the grazing stocking rate for an area (details supplied) he will provide a copy of what was proposed by the EU for this area to bring the Irish farmers in line; the proposals from Europe in relation the destocking of sheep from the hills; and if he will provide a copy of what was agreed between his Department and the EU. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Continued overgrazing by livestock in some areas has given rise to environmental problems, particularly loss of vegetation and soil erosion in commonages. In this regard, damage to the habitat of the Red Grouse in the Owenduff/Nephin Beg Complex Special Protection Area in County Mayo, has been the subject of a continuing infringement case, under the Birds Directive, taken against Ireland by the EU Commission in the European Court of Justice. The Commission has called on Ireland to implement measures and demonstrate improvements in this area and in other commonages.</P>
        <P>It is for the appropriate Irish authorities, to devise and implement measures sufficient to restore this habitat and to satisfy EU Commission or European Court of Justice requirements in that regard. My Department, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and Food and the European Commission, has been working to resolve the issue of appropriate commonage management, which is made complex by the multiple shareholdings involved.</P>
        <P>The two Departments have put in place a number of measures which are directed at meeting EU requirements fully. These measures include: full rather than partial destocking under the Commonage Framework Plans; a requirement for participation in REPS or the NPWS farm plans by farmers in the area; guidelines to farm planners on appropriate carrying capacities for commonages; and most significantly, a special closed period for all sheep farming on the Owenduff Nephin Beg commonage for 5 months of the year (November to December and mid February <Col N="2206"/>to mid May).  Farmers are being paid compensation for additional costs arising from removal of sheep for this closed period.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department is increasing the monitoring of the condition of commonages and privately owned lands in designated areas and where appropriate will take the necessary enforcement measures to secure compliance under the requirements of the Directive.</P>

	<P>The safety and control of designated smoking areas of public buildings is a matter in the first instance for the owners of such premises and a number of legislative codes apply.  I have no plans to introduce legislation or designate an agency of the type suggested in the Question.</P>
        <P>The Fire Services Act 1981 as amended by the Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003 and Ease of Escape Regulations made under that Act provide a comprehensive statutory basis for the operation of fire safety in buildings and structures, whether temporary or permanent.  The Fire Services Act 1981 applies to buildings used for any purpose involving access to the building by members of the public.  Section 18(2) of the Act places a duty of care on persons, having control of a building to which the Act applies, to take all reasonable measures to prevent the outbreak of fire and to ensure as far as possible the safety of those using the premises in the event of fire.</P>
        <P>The Act also places a duty on every person on the premises to conduct himself/herself in such a way as to ensure any person on the premises is not exposed to danger from fire.  Enforcement of the provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981 is carried out by fire authorities.  One of the benefits of the smoking ban has been the reduction of fire risk in premises such as pubs and clubs.</P>
        <P>The measures outlined above relate to fire authority powers to deal with issues of fire safety and overcrowding in buildings including pubs and <Col N="2212"/>clubs, and are in addition to the powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other public bodies under other legislative codes.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>During the period 1992 to 1999, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) carried out a nationwide survey of radon gas in domestic dwellings.  The survey involved the measurement of radon in some 11,000 houses nationwide.  Based on the results of this survey, the RPII estimated that some 91,000 houses nationally, equivalent to about 7% of the national housing stock, have radon concentration levels in excess of 200 Becquerels per cubic metre (Bq/m3).  This is the National Reference Level adopted by Government in respect of houses, and is the level above which it is recommended that radon remediation works should be considered.</P>
        <P>The RPII&rsquo;s website &mdash; <i>www.rpii.ie</i> &mdash; contains a comprehensive map which shows the location of High Radon Areas throughout the country, i.e., areas where 10% or more of the houses are estimated to have radon levels in excess of the National reference Level.  County radon maps and survey results can be viewed also on that web-site by clicking on the county by name.  Of the approximately 30,000 houses tested to date by the RPII for radon, some 200, or about 1%, had radon concentrations in excess of 800 Bq/m3, a level considered by RPII as extremely high. Such householders are strongly urged by the RPII to undertake immediate  radon remediation measures on their house.</P>
        <P>The Government, largely through the RPII, has for many years now committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to highlighting public awareness of radon and the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to high radon concentrations.  In this connection, I would <Col N="2213"/>refer to the reply to Question No. 607 of 1 November 2006 in which I outlined the numerous initiatives undertaken by RPII and my Department. Householders, particularly those in high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake radon remediation works where necessary.</P>
        <P>On the issue of grant assistance, and as stated in my reply to previous questions, increasing the awareness of the public is considered to be a more effective approach than the provision of State financial assistance schemes to householders for radon testing of their homes or for radon remediation works.  Such schemes of assistance are not operated by the majority of EU Member States.  It would be difficult for a demand led scheme of domestic radon grants to ensure appropriate and cost effective targeting of remedial action. Furthermore, such a scheme could require very significant public expenditure and administrative resources.</P>
        <P>As is clear from the above, considerable resources are being expended by Government on promoting public awareness of radon. Government efforts and resources, together with the RPII, will continue to focus on highlighting public awareness of radon and on improving information to householders and employers so as to enable and encourage them to address monitoring or remedial requirements effectively and economically.</P>

	<P>The information sought  is not available in my Department.  The National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste, published in April 2006, is aimed at the progressive diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill by 2016 to 35% of the amount of biodegradable municipal waste generated in the baseline year of 1995.  This will be achieved through a combination of measures &mdash; separated biodegradable waste can be composted at home or delivered to local recycling centres while separate collection of organic waste will be required in all suitable urban and rural areas as part of an integrated collection system.</P>
        <P>While the cost of providing a compost bin is a matter in the first instance for the householder, the use of such a bin can reduce a household&rsquo;s overall waste management bill and I understand that compost bins are generally available at reduced prices from local authorities.</P>

	<P>I assume that the Questions refers to article 10(4) of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 which sets out an exemption for development consisting of the use of not more than 4 bedrooms in a house, where each bedroom is used for the accommodation of not more than 4 persons, as overnight guest accommodation.</P>
        <P>Article 10(5) of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 already sets out exemptions for the use of a house for the purpose of child-minding. For the purposes of the Planning Acts child-minding is defined as the activity of minding no more than 6 children, including the children, if any, of the person minding, in the house of that person, for profit or gain.</P>
        <P>In addition, planning authorities currently require the provision of at least one child care facility for each 75 dwellings in a new housing area, in accordance with the Child care Guidelines for Planning Authorities published in April 2001.  Under the Planning and Development Act 2000 planning authorities have extensive powers to provide or facilitate the provision of child care facilities in their functional area, through appropriate strategic planning through the development plan, the setting of appropriate conditions on planning permissions and the use of development contributions to pay for the capital cost of community facilities. I am satisfied that these powers, used proactively, will facilitate an adequate supply of child care places through the planning process.  Accordingly, it is not proposed to amend the Act or Regulations in this respect.</P>

        <P>In relation to the case referred to in the Question, no application for funding has yet been received by my Department from Kildare County Council who are responsible for the administration of these schemes in their area.</P>

	<P>An upper age limit of 65 years applies for any member of the Board of an agency under the aegis of my Depart<Col N="2220"/>ment who is an employee of the agency and whose employment commenced before 1 April 2004. This arises because such an employee does not come within the scope of the definition of new entrant as set out in Section 2(1) of the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004; Section 2(3) of that Act contains a general provision that a person who is a new entrant to the public service shall not be obliged to retire on age grounds.</P>
        <P>No age limit applies in relation to members of boards of agencies under my Department&rsquo;s aegis who are not employees of the agency concerned.</P>
