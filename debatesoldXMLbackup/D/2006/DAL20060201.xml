    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the darkest days this country experienced was 30 May 2005, when the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme exposed the shocking conditions in Leas Cross nursing home. Following that programme, the Taoiseach on 31 May promised in the D&aacute;il to establish an independent inspectorate for all nursing homes, the legislation for which would be published later that year. That promise was repeated by him on 1 June 2005 and reiterated by the T&aacute;naiste on 20 July. We now see from the Government programme published by the Chief Whip that the promises by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have not been met. There is no date for the production of legislation on an independent inspectorate.</P>
      <P>We should not be too surprised at this Government&rsquo;s failure to deliver. The health strategy published in 2001, the Sustaining Progress agreement and the programme for Government in June 2002 all promised an independent inspectorate for nursing homes. All these promises were broken. The Government has reneged upon these specific commitments, which refer to the most frail and vulnerable among our citizens. The T&aacute;naiste was well able to bring in emergency legislation to claim back retrospective payments from money taken from people in long-stay geriatric homes. The issue of the standards in our nursing homes has not been addressed with the same sense of urgency by this Government.</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach provide a reasonable explanation for why he stood up here on two occasions to promise this legislation and why the T&aacute;naiste also made a promise if it has not been delivered? Can he tell us why he was in a position to say last May, June and July that this was a priority for legislation, given that it does not now appear in any of the Government&rsquo;s own programmes?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach should be aware &mdash; I am sure he is &mdash; that this delay has caused massive concern among the owners of nursing homes in which the standards of care and attention are as they should be. However, because of the Government&rsquo;s failure to implement and draft legislation <Col N="1550"/>for an independent inspectorate, everybody is being dragged down by those who do not even measure up to minimum standards. Can he explain why the Government has failed on this fundamental issue in respect of the elderly, the frail and, in many cases, the neglected and why it failed to deliver on this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I made the point several times last year that the HSE already has a large number of staff involved in the supervision and examination of standards in our nursing homes and we stated at the time that we would put that on a statutory basis and would enter a period of consultation on how it can best be done. That did not take from the HSE&rsquo;s move, immediately after the events of last summer, to examine all our nursing homes to make sure they had the requisite complement of staff on duty at all times, had drawn up individual care plans for patients, maintained a safe and supervised environment for elderly people, implemented activities programmes and had developed and implemented policies on incontinence wear. Many of these matters were highlighted in Leas Cross and recent inspections around the country have shown that these conditions are being applied and adhered to.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny is correct that it is not yet on a statutory basis but he wrong in saying these issues are not being dealt with through the HSE and its various regions. The HSE has advised us that it will continue to closely monitor the conditions in nursing homes to ensure high levels of care are afforded to residents. Many of those were previously happening and happening well but, obviously, the Leas Cross breach shows that standards and numbers involved were not high enough. Leas Cross was an awakening to that and the home subsequently closed because of it. Other standards were implemented in other areas, so it was a useful exercise and a lesson learned. I am not sure of the latest date for the Department and the parliamentary draftsman to put forward legislation but the standards are being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leas Cross exposure was not simply important. It was a national scandal that brought shame on this country, in which the elderly, the sick and the frail were exposed to degrading and horrific treatment. I am informed by my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, who has been pursuing this for a number of years through the Freedom of Information Act, that there are serious questions about the adequacy of the existing inspectorate regime within the Health Service Executive. I understand that an independent review of Leas Cross, which was completed in June 2005, found, in simple terms, that it should not have been registered in the manner it was or, indeed, registered at all. The report found that nine of the 11 double bedrooms in Lea&rsquo;s Cross were below the required standard. That means <Col N="1551"/>half the rooms originally used were below the required size.</P>
      <P>To make matters worse, in August 2004, nine months before the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme, the health authorities were given specific warnings about serious inadequacies in the inspection regime and were alerted to the type of activities the nation saw on that television programme. I believe worse was seen by those who inspected that facility. We can only speculate on how much suffering the elderly in that place had to endure. The novelist Mr. Anthony Powell said that &ldquo;Growing old is like being increasingly penalised for a crime you haven&rsquo;t committed&rdquo; and unfortunately, in some cases in this country, that appears to be true.</P>
      <P>The Government has had massive resources at its disposal but has wasted obscene amounts of money in many areas. It has failed to draft legislation for an independent inspectorate. The Taoiseach opened this nursing home but he did not want those kinds of standards to pertain &mdash; I know he did not. It is his responsibility to ensure his Government introduces legislation to guarantee that standards are monitored and best practice prevails. When does the Taoiseach propose to introduce such legislation and when will the O&rsquo;Neill inquiry, which is investigating 97 deaths at Leas Cross, be finalised and its report published?</P>
      <P>This is not simply an ordinary legislative matter, it concerns the quality of life of those who built this country. In their last years, such people deserve comfort, high standards and the knowledge that the State takes an interest in their welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We all agree, and that is why the Government has invested enormous resources. I do not have to go through the details, including those in the recent budget, but I do not think the Deputy is correct that we wasted any of those resources. We have invested significantly in the care of our older people, as well as looking after them in terms of welfare payments. We invested an additional &euro;110 million in the recent budget, a sum of &euro;150 million at full cost, for packages to help elderly people. We are committed to maintaining older people in dignity and independence in their own homes, in accordance with their wishes, for as long as possible and to providing high quality, long-term residential care for older people, where necessary.</P>
      <P>The social inspectorate has been working on an administrative basis for the last six or seven years on protection issues but last year it highlighted that more needs to be done. Legislation is being prepared. I have already spoken about actions being taken prior to the enactment of the legislation, which will provide for the establishment of a health information and quality authority and a social services inspectorate, based on the current administrative arrangements. The social services <Col N="1552"/>inspectorate function will be vested in a new statutory office, to be known as the office of the chief inspector of social services, which will provide for the registration system in respect of residential services to make sure they adhere to all the standards I referred to at the outset for older people and those with disabilities. It will replace the existing registration system. We should not pretend there is no system in place, because there is, under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the function of the new office will be to monitor the standards for residential services for elderly people, those with disabilities and children in care. I do not have a date for the introduction of the Bill but the draft heads of the legislation are at an advanced stage, will be submitted to the Government and then hopefully the House will deal with it quickly. Legislation, however, is not the beginning and the end of the matter and all of these issues are being monitored closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to return to the issue of the M50. Yesterday the Taoiseach seemed to want to distance himself and the Government from the announcement made on television on Friday night by Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, and subsequent stories by him and inspired by him, to the effect the Government plans to lift the barrier on the West Link bridge and install four new tolls along the M50. The only thing that is clear from yesterday is that the hard-pressed motorist can expect no alleviation between now and 2008. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government proposes to take no action between now and 2008, despite the fact that additional trucks will spew onto the bridge from the port tunnel at a daily rate equivalent to the normal net annual increase in traffic, according to the Secretary General of the Department? The upgrade works have started and will take two years, which means it is now that motorists need the barrier to be lifted.</P>
      <P>As I said, the Taoiseach seemed to deny the Minister, Deputy Cullen&rsquo;s inspired statements. The <i>Irish Independent</i> on Saturday stated &ldquo;the Irish Independent has learned that motorists will face more than three replacement State electronic tolls situated at regular intervals along the motorway&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That was never said by me and the Deputy knows that. He is making it up as he goes along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The new system, according to <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>He is making it all up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to allow the Deputy to continue.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1553"/>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is wonderful research, reading the national newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>According to <i>The Irish Times</i>, &ldquo;The new system, which will be implemented by the National Roads Authority (NRA), will mean that the entire road will be tolled, with toll charges based on the amount of the route used&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying that the two journalists involved made up the story? Is he saying that it came out of nowhere and denying the veracity of the articles? I wish to quote back the sentence written by the Civil Service in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s note from yesterday, as distinct from his own remarks. The civil servant English reads as follows: &ldquo;The NRA will invite tenders for the design, building and operation of a multi-point, free flow, barrier-free toll regime on the M50&rdquo;. Amid all the Taoiseach&rsquo;s denials of the Minister, Deputy Cullen &mdash; I can understand why the Taoiseach would want to distance himself from the Minister &mdash; he planted that sentence from the Civil Service. What does that mean? What does a multi-point, free flow, barrier-free toll regime on the M50 mean if it does not mean what the Minister&rsquo;s briefing staff said it meant, namely that the Government proposes to implement a number of different toll points on the M50? What will the NRA be inviting tenders for, if the Government does not propose to do that? Is it inviting tenders for the amusement of finding out how much it will cost, like so many other projects about which we know? What does the sentence, &ldquo;The NRA will invite tenders for the design, building and operation of a multi-point, free flow, barrier-free toll regime on the M50&rdquo; actually mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The sources of Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s information are two newspapers and what civil servants have said. If he gives me a minute or two, I will inform him of the Government&rsquo;s position.</P>
      <P>We began this week to spend an additional &euro;1 billion on the M50, to increase capacity by 50% over the next number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>It will still be congested when it is finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This, coupled with the completion of the Naas Road project, will significantly help the flow of traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be gridlocked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is anxious to remove the toll plaza.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Travelling by bicycle would be faster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach, without interruption please.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1554"/>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputies do not really want to know what I think, they want to use their sources. The Government is anxious to remove the toll plaza as soon as possible. We will not get rid of tolling, but will move to electronic, free flow tolling on the motorway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach going to put the Minister of Transport in charge of an electronic system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot just walk away from the contract with NTR, which runs until 2020 and not pay the company. Legally, we cannot do that. We are advised it will take about a year to go through the procurement process and then to go through all of the technical arrangements. I personally believe that is an extremely long period of time, but I am advised that is the position. It should be possible to take a system operating elsewhere and do it quicker but I am told we must go through the EU procurement process so the NRA can get NTR out of the system. That is the reason.</P>
      <P>I clearly stated yesterday that between now and the end of the year &mdash; it stated October but from what I have heard it is likely it will run into November and up to the Christmas period &mdash; there will be an enormously detailed assessment of the traffic requirements on the entire M50, which has not been done as part of the original An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been done already and it predicted gridlock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>At the end of or during that the Government will decide how to move on. People in the NRA have views about how we best do that, but the Government will make the decision. There are views about many things in the NRA the Government disagrees with. We went along with some of them and got ourselves into plenty of hot water in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It did not want to build motorways but the Government did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s lousy planning caused the mess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It spent &euro;18 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will listen to its views, but the Government will make the decision. I cannot answer for what was stated last week or what people might have thought, I am stating the position of the Minister, my position and the position of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has disowned two reputable journalists, the NRA and the Civil Service, and then he tells me the Government position. Why is this procurement process necessary if the toll plaza on the bridge is simply being <Col N="1555"/>reinstated? It is private property. The Government must be going through the procurement process because it is erecting these gantries along the M50 that the Minister for Transport told us about. There is no other explanation.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach now comes into this House, after all the years of protesting on behalf of hard-pressed motorists trying to commute to work in the morning and get home in the evening, and tells us that there must now be assessments of traffic flows and a year spent on procurement. What have all the Ministers for Transport been doing down the years? How can we have reached a stage after nine years where the Government is now monitoring traffic flows? Tell the people the truth. The Government proposes to take no action between now and 2008 despite additional traffic from the port tunnel and the disruption caused by the refurbishment of the M50. Despite that additional punishment for hard-pressed motorists, no action will be taken.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has discounted the fanciful, inspired press briefings by the Minister for Transport, saying there is nothing in them, but why would he put this project out to tender through the public procurement process if he does not intend to implement a State-controlled electronic barrier-free tolling system around the M50, as has been reported by these journalists, who did not make it up, no matter what the Taoiseach says? Here we are after nine years with the situation getting worse, with the Minister saying one thing and the Taoiseach implying something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The scaremongering bloody Labour Party. This is typical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should come down to Lucan some morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>He should come down to the port tunnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To make a number of points in correction of Deputy Rabbitte, who is unusually poorly informed on this issue, the reason for the demand management upgrade is that the council, on which the Labour Party has a majority, made a condition that a demand management flow study be done as part of the upgrade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The upgrade was four years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a condition recently of the Labour-led council to have a demand management process. That is the reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a complete red herring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government wants to get rid of the present barrier plaza system and to replace it with an electronic system that will be far more efficient. More and more traffic is more efficiently using the M50, despite all its problems, <Col N="1556"/>all the time. Deputy Rabbitte asked what has been going on for the past nine years. I am sure he has travelled the road to see that the M50 has been going through its completion for the past few years, with the roads to Tallaght, in his constituency, to Leopardstown, the link to the Glen of the Downs and Baldoyle all under way. The tunnel on to the road has also been under way.</P>
      <P>It would have been convenient if, when people were dealing with this 20 years ago, they could have foreseen that we would increase from a population of 3.4 million and would have the best boom this country has ever imagined under this Government, but people did not see that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>They rezoned all the land around the M50 for profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A million fewer people were working when we started the plans for this road; the population has increased by 1 million and will increase by a further million. Things change and we have been all the time upgrading, planning and moving ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Rezoning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately when there is a contractual arrangement until 2020 we must negotiate ourselves out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a crooked deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not a banana republic where we can tell NTR to move on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>A banana republic made the deal in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are endeavouring and have started to put &euro;1 billion into the upgrade, finish the tunnel this year, finish the Naas Road and find a new electronic way of letting traffic through quickly. If that is not good for the motorist, I do not know what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should do his own research &mdash; An Bord Plean&aacute;la placed that condition on demand-side management. Given that we are hearing again of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s disagreements with the Minister for Transport on future plans for tolling on the M50, is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s main idea another orbital road that is not included in the Transport 21 plans?</P>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach listen last night to his colleague and, some would say, political ally, the President of the United States of America who stated that breakthroughs in technology will help America to reach another great goal, to replace more than 75% of oil imports from the Middle East by 2025? He said that America would have to move beyond a petroleum-based economy and make its dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past. If the Taoiseach thinks that oil will be around to make his orbital route viable in <Col N="1557"/>years to come, he is terribly mistaken. Peak oil production has effectively arrived and while $70 a barrel is expensive, it will become much dearer with demand outstripping supply.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should take note of the lack of vision, even within Sustainable Energy Ireland, which has just published its energy in Ireland report. It seems to be blind. Between 1990 and 2004, primary energy needs grew by 59%, with oil making up 55.8% of imported energy, gas 24.3% and renewables just 2.2% in 2004. Sustainable Energy Ireland can only manage to visualise in 2020 oil making up 53.4%, gas 35% and renewables just 3.3%. Given that European Union member states import on average 50% of their energy requirements, whereas Ireland imports 80% of its energy, does the Taoiseach not appreciate that he is leading us in the wrong direction? Will he agree to publish the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on the electricity market which has been on the desk of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, since before Christmas? Will he include the energy and environmental non-governmental organisations in the partnership talks? Will he sit down with all parties in the House to plan an energy policy to take the country up to 2050 given that such a step is needed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem working with the Deputy to examine future energy supplies because that is what the Minister has been actively doing. He has received a range of proposals from many organisations and their input is to be welcomed by everybody.</P>
      <P>The reason I support the orbital route is that the city boundary continues to move outwards as the population increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is due to bad planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Twenty years ago we were told the population would fall below 3.4 million. We now have more people because the country is doing better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Do they all have to drive to work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If having more people and not having emigration is bad planning, I disagree. The reason it is necessary to have an orbital route far outside the city is the growth in the greater Dublin area and counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Why stop at one orbital route? Why not have three of them?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1558"/>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to answer Deputy Sargent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am listening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree we have gone the wrong way. The resources available under Transport 21 are being invested in rail, the Luas, the orbital metro and all the areas which will move people off the roads and into public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Transport 21 is imbalanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We proved this could be done last year with the opening of the Luas lines, even though some Deputies thought it would never happen. More than 20 million passengers have used the service. Capacity on the DART has increased by 50%. The Deputy will agree that rail, the Luas and the orbital metro route are the ways to move on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>The electrification of the Maynooth line will take until 2015.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Will there be any new buses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We must deal with major issues in trying to guarantee our energy supply, which is a big issue all over Europe. As the Deputy knows, many countries are moving back to nuclear power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree with them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No. Across the water political agreement has almost been reached on that issue, while France has expanded its nuclear industry. We are actively engaged in determining how we will deal with these issues in the longer term. The Deputy is correct that energy prices are increasing. The Corrib gas field and other factors will help in terms of our energy supply in the years to come and I hope we will find a few more fields.</P>

	<P>I have heard what everybody else is doing but not what the Government proposes to do, apart from planning a road which does not even feature in the Transport 21 plan.</P><Col N="1559"/>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach hear President George Bush&rsquo;s State of the Union address in which he stated the following?</P>
      <P LI="1">Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy and here we have a serious problem. America is addicted to oil which is often imported from unstable parts of the world.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The US President used the term &ldquo;addicted to oil&rdquo;. Now that the T&aacute;naiste has banned magic mushrooms, will the Taoiseach agree that he is an oil addict and energy obese?</P>

	<P>Will someone sound the bugle and get us out of here? It is time to leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The first step to recovery for any addict is to admit the problem. Will the Taoiseach admit, as a start, that he is addicted to oil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sargent will continue to lead his motley crew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a serious matter and the Taoiseach will pay heavily for not dealing with it. He may recall &mdash; I was not born at the time &mdash; that T. K. Whitaker set out his vision for Ireland in the late 1950s. The Taoiseach now celebrates that vision through the Celtic tiger. Does he agree that we need to move beyond petroleum and show the same vision as T. K. Whitaker if we are to benefit in the years ahead? Without such vision, our economy will not be at the races and people will suffer badly on account of the Taoiseach. With 57 amber alerts last year &mdash; these signify near blackouts &mdash; we clearly need an energy policy. Will the Taoiseach, as a first step, admit we have a problem of addiction to oil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated, energy policy is being prepared for the longer term and we need to examine new approaches. Separate consultations are taking place on various aspects of renewable energies. Public consultation has occurred on combined heat and power and bioenergy. The proportion of energy produced by wind will increase to 13.2% by the end of the decade. All these issues are important.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the NGOs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not involved in the partnership process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but they are involved in the core organisation and have an input into it. I did not hear what the American President said during the night&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach usually listens very closely to what the US President says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s party is far closer to him, having stayed up until 3 a.m. to listen to <Col N="1560"/>him. I am glad it is moving closer to American policy. As I stated, if the Deputy wishes to have an input, I am sure all his suggestions will be closely examined. I promise him I am not addicted to oil. It would be very bad for me.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I travelled to Zagreb on 28 and 29 November to meet the Prime Minister, Mr. Ivo Sanader. We discussed issues on the EU agenda, including Croatia&rsquo;s accession negotiations and the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s economic and cultural relations with Croatia. The Government of Croatia expressed particular interest in learning from Ireland&rsquo;s rapid economic development over the past decade. I extended an invitation to the Prime Minister to visit Ireland in the near future. While in Zagreb, I also paid a courtesy call on the President of Croatia, Mr. Stjepan Mesic. I also had a meeting with the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Mr. Vlado Buckovski, who was visiting Zagreb at the same time.</P>
        <P>On 12 December, I met the President of Bulgaria, Mr. Georgi Parvanov, during his state visit to Ireland. Our discussions were useful and friendly and we covered a range of bilateral and economic issues. Of particular focus were EU enlargement and Bulgarian preparations for the country&rsquo;s accession to the EU and I assured the President of Ireland&rsquo;s continuing support for Bulgaria&rsquo;s preparations for EU membership. We also reflected on the 50th anniversary of UN membership for both our countries and our shared commitment to UN peacekeeping.</P>
        <P>I made an official visit to India on 16-20 January. This was the first official visit to India by a Taoiseach and the key aim was to enhance bilateral political and economic relations between Ireland and India. I was accompanied by the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin. We visited three cities during the trip, Bangalore, New Delhi and Mumbai. I attended business events hosted by Enterprise Ireland in each of the cities and made key addresses at the Nehru Memorial Library in Delhi and the University of Mumbai. The focus of the address in Delhi was on political relations while the address in Mumbai concentrated on business, academic and cultural connections between Ireland and India. During the visit I had official meetings with President Kalam and Prime Minister Singh. I laid a wreath at the Gandhi memorial and availed of opportunities to meet the Irish community in India.</P>
        <P>As the 11th largest economy in the world India is an attractive prospect for Irish companies seeking new markets for their products and services. India is currently our 37th largest trading partner. <Col N="1562"/>According to 2004 figures bilateral trade was worth &euro;262 million. The visit provided useful opportunities to further develop two-way trade. As with my visit to China last year I led a large business delegation, over 80 organisations drawn from a range of sectors including ICT, biotechnology, education, tourism, culture and arts. Significantly representatives from both parts of the island of Ireland participated for the first time in the delegation, emphasising the all-Ireland co-operation on economic and social developments. Whereas this visit was about exploring business potential, Enterprise Ireland has estimated that the deals signed during the week will be worth &euro;35 million in new business over three years. In addition 24 separate contracts and agreements were signed across a number of sectors including education, computer software and engineering. This visit also afforded opportunities to conclude a number of key political and business agreements, including bilateral agreements in the areas of science, technology and cultural co-operation.</P>
        <P>In 2006, I will travel to the United States of America next month for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day. I will also attend the European Council meetings in Brussels on 23 and 24 March and 15 and 16 June in my role as Head of Government. I will also attend the EU-Latin American Caribbean summit on 12 and 13 May in Vienna.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Government&rsquo;s view on continued enlargement after Bulgaria and Romania join the EU? There seems to be a divergence of opinion that there should be a breathing space before further countries join.</P>
        <P>On the Taoiseach&rsquo;s trip to India, which I assume was successful from a business point of view, did the Taoiseach engage in any discussions with his Indian counterparts about their nuclear capability and India&rsquo;s continued refusal to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty? Given the fact that countries such as Pakistan and Israel have never signed the treaty, were there discussions about that? They have international responsibilities and should not shirk them.</P>
        <P>It was reported yesterday that Iran said if a referral is made to the UN Security Council over its stand-off with the West it will end diplomatic relations. Does the Taoiseach have a view on that? I know the EU three &mdash; Germany, France and Britain &mdash; have been negotiating on behalf of all member states on this matter. Does the Taoiseach think a non-nuclear state such as Ireland has a role in those negotiations in view of their importance to global trade and politics?</P>
        <P>What specific changes does Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue propose to attract the &ldquo;Bollywood&rdquo; film makers to Ireland? It is a long distance for them to travel and they will not do so unless there are specific economic incentives to do so. Given that we had a successful film making business here for a number of years, which has now tapered off to an extent, how does Deputy <Col N="1563"/>O&rsquo;Donoghue propose to attract Indian film makers to Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To repeat what I said to Deputy Rabbitte yesterday, Bulgaria and Romania will join the EU in a few years and discussions have started with Croatia and Macedonia. From the Thessaloniki summit of a few years ago Europe is committed to ongoing talks in that region of Croatia, Macedonia and the other countries as they prepare initial association agreements. Talks with Turkey will continue for a long time. There should be deep consideration before we make any further commitments. Otherwise we will get into a host of enlargements which people have no appetite to fund, causing difficulties down the road. The problem with the EU is that somebody thinks up a bright idea, it takes off and everybody is linked into it. The bright idea that should be worked on is the EU neighbourhood policy, which we should develop before we embark on further enlargement. Otherwise we are straight into considering very large countries. One could argue, as Mr. Putin does sometimes, that some of the member countries are less European than Russia but where does one stop? Having seen the last round on financing issues, enlargement is a great idea but not when nobody wants to pay the cost so people should work that through. It puts unfair pressure on the Commission. It is asked to prepare the proposals but has no control because the European Parliament and Council are pertinent to financial issues. We are talking about the period 2010-20. As Deputy Kenny knows the European Council changes frequently, particularly with the new Eastern European countries &mdash; practically all the people who came in on 1 May are already gone &mdash; so one just gets more bright ideas. They know my view &mdash; I do not think they are very bright ideas and often speak against these ideas, which is not always popular. It does not make sense to me. The EU will get itself into an awful bind if it continues this way. We should develop the new neighbourhood policy.</P>
        <P>On the Iranian situation, the formal negotiations between the EU three &mdash; Britain, France and Germany &mdash; and Iran have addressed nuclear power. The view is that because Iran has resumed uranium conversion it is in breach of the Paris agreement. Iran had earlier rejected proposals by the EU three on the future of its nuclear programme. The board found Iran was not compliant with its safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and that the history of concealment of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear activities and the nature of these activities have given rise to questions within the competence of the Security Council. Iran has announced that it would recommence research into what it calls its peaceful nuclear energy programme and the IAEA removed the seals at several nuclear installations in Iran. The General Affairs Council met on <Col N="1564"/>Monday and expressed grave concern at Iran&rsquo;s decision to resume the enrichment related activities. The Council <i>inter alia</i> called on Iran to re-establish a suspension of all enrichment related and re-processing activities, as repeatedly called for by the IAEA board of governors resolutions, as an essential confidence-building measure. The Council also emphasised that the EU remains committed to a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue at which the IAEA will play a central role and that the involvement of the Security Council does not end the IAEA&rsquo;s responsibilities but strengthens them. The IAEA board of governors will meet in Vienna next week. Ireland is not currently a member of the board but the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will keep closely in touch.</P>
        <P>In India I asked the Prime Minister what his intentions are around the nuclear issue. I read the report and other related reports before Christmas. I explained our traditional position regarding the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. As the Indians see it, nuclear power can meet the country&rsquo;s huge needs for electricity. The Prime Minister described India as a responsible nuclear power. The Indian Government is trying to help 60 million rural people with new schemes, such as a new arrangement where people will be given 100 days work. Mrs. Gandhi explained that it would put billions into the rural communities. The only way this can be done, according to the Indian Government, is by providing nuclear energy. This has caused many problems with the Nuclear Suppliers Group. I stressed our track record on the issue of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and they were not surprised with our close association with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. We will not change the world for them, but they know our position on the issue. They are working hard to get a change in the position and they expect that the American President will come in early March and that this issue will be at the centre of discussions. They do not see themselves as being involved in nuclear proliferation, but in trying to look after the 800 million people who are not in the middle class and they see nuclear power as the only resolution to this problem. I think they will give any guarantee that is sought by the Nuclear Suppliers Group. They want to build nuclear power for their energy supply. The Prime Minister was at pains to point out that they were not into global proliferation. I know that this may create problems with Pakistan, which takes a different view.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct about the Indian film industry. It is a huge, competitive industry. The sums of money involved, even for the smaller films, are enormous. In 15 years, India has built up a very powerful film industry. I attended one of the functions with the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, and there were people from Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and many other countries. They get the best deals and the reason the industry has got competitive is that so <Col N="1565"/>many people have followed our arrangements. The Minister is pressing the Minister for Finance to make some changes in the Finance Bill. This business is about where to get the best deal. The size of the budgets is staggering. Going after the very big films is probably out of our league, in my opinion. However, there are sizeable films that would be very helpful. They will follow deals and will not come here out of sentiment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach know about the sequel to Lassie?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is reported to have been involved in discussions about UN reform. Did he offer support for India&rsquo;s membership of the Security Council? Did the matter arise at all?</P>
        <P>The trade and economic implications of the visit certainly seem to have been successful. What value will derive to this State in tangible terms as a result of the visit? What response does the Taoiseach have to the ICTU&rsquo;s position about outsourcing and the vulnerability of our call centres and so on? India has made extraordinary progress in recent years in the IT sector. Does the Taoiseach see that as a real fear here? Are there measures we can take to combat that within a global trade environment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As in China, UN reform is a big issue in India. In the question and answer session at the University of Mumbai, the students saw this as a burning issue. I did not give India support for a seat on the Security Council. I have been involved in discussions about this in the last few years. It is too easy to give support to one country, which then creates implications for another country. I explained our basic position that trying to run the organisation today on the 1945 basis is not workable. Almost all issues are dealt with outside the Security Council because it is known that if an issue is brought before the council, a decision will not be reached. It is a sad reflection on an organisation that is meant to promote global peace and deal with all these issues, that everyone tries to find other ways of doing things because they know we will never get agreement. It is happening again with the current Iranian situation and it has happened with every crisis in the last 25 years. We believe that there should be no more veto positions because that is what is causing the problem. The more vetoes in existence, the more problems are created. We also believe that small countries should not be isolated and that there should be a fair balance between the large and small countries.</P>
        <P>There are great tensions between the larger countries. The differences between India, China, Japan and how they see this issue is extraordinary. I do not see the way forward. Unfortunately, Kofi Annan, who has put in so much effort, is coming to the end of his reign. It will continue to be an issue in the future, which is <Col N="1566"/>unsatisfactory. Listening to everybody&rsquo;s position, as I have had the pleasure of doing over the past few years, I do not see a solution. We cannot let every country on to the council, yet the countries that will not be let on keep vetoing each other&rsquo;s arrangements.</P>
        <P>With regard to business, there are dangers but we should not become paranoid about them. We should try to seek some of the opportunities. India is managing to keep more of its graduates at home, is developing sizeable companies, opening new opportunities and bringing in much investment, so it will become a bigger threat. Every year, the country is producing 200,000 science graduates and 100,000 medical graduates. If these people are being kept at home, their power to innovate and to develop will be enormous. In the last ten to 15 years, 30,000 graduates have been going to Germany. India has 55,000 students currently in graduate or post-graduate studies in the US. They have people located around the world &mdash; only around 800 in this country &mdash; looking at how things happen, while students on government scholarships are going home. They have an educational programme for about 350 million people. There are tremendous difficulties, but they are creating wealth that is feeding into the rural communities and educating people. There is high attendance at education centres. People are staying longer in education and the rural communities are turning to education. Mrs. Ghandi, not having taken on the role of prime minister, is targeting her energies to convince communities that this is the road ahead. As the Deputy knows, she is a formidable woman and is highly regarded. Her theme is &ldquo;education&rdquo; so one can see the potential.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that they will take investment. On the other side, some of their companies have become so large that they have decided to start outsourcing from their bases. The difficulty for Ireland is that they do not know a great deal about us. We are seen to be a small adjunct to the British connection. That is the benefit of visiting India. One has to hard-sell the message that we have software industries and are capable of delivering. I visited three companies, one of which employs 46,000 people, another employing 51,000 people and the third, 3,000 people. For every one position in the company employing 3,000 people, some 5,000 people will have applied. The 3,000 employed are absolute experts at the high end of technology and bio-technology.</P>
        <P>We will not be able to beat them in terms of companies employing 50,000 people. However, there are many software companies in Ireland with good products and innovative ideas that could interact with such enterprises when they are outsourcing to try to get in on the action. There is great potential there and many of the companies that travelled with us recognise that. However, if we do not get out there and interact with these companies, there will be difficulties. There are problems involved in investing there, <Col N="1567"/>but there are opportunities, too, as they outsource. That is what our people have to address. I have told the people in the industry that it is not possible to do this from home. If one is in business the only place one can do it is out there. We, as politicians, can facilitate contacts now and again. However, Irish industry must realise that it has to get out and about. Other countries are doing it and our people have to, also.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach did not answer in any detail about the foreign visits he will undertake during 2006. He was asked to make a statement on that. In particular, does he have an invitation to visit the White House again, on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day? In view of the fact that even a majority of United States citizens have now abandoned support for Mr. Bush&rsquo;s disastrous occupation of Iraq, should the Taoiseach reconsider and perhaps not help to shore up his credibility on this occasion with the usual bowl of shamrock?</P>
        <P>Speaking as an opponent of nuclear power and weapons, I have a question about his talks on the nuclear proliferation issue, Fortunately, the Irish people stopped Fianna F&aacute;il going down that road. This is something that intrigues me and perhaps the Taoiseach could answer it. Has the Taoiseach ever remarked on the incredible hypocrisy of the United States, Britain and the European Union in coming down like a ton of bricks on Iran while being armed to the teeth themselves and powering their electricity grids through nuclear energy? I say this as someone who believes the whole world should disarm and seek alternatives to the nuclear option.</P>
        <P>On his visit to India, does the Taoiseach realise that from the extensive coverage in the Irish media, the impression given is that he rubs shoulders exclusively with the very privileged business and political elite, the establishment figures? What with the pink and white garlands, the fetching pink on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s forehead etc., one might have thought he was visiting Shangri-La. What about the hundreds and millions of Indians who live in the most appalling squalor and poverty? The Taoiseach was in Bangalore. I was there on political work a few years ago and saw the appalling hovels in which people lived. Did the Taoiseach offer any solidarity to the struggling hundreds of millions or comment on the Indian Government wasting billions on nuclear weapons, with this appalling poverty on its door-step?</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach give the House some more detail on how the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, got on with the Bollywood set? Did he entice any of them to make a film in Cahirciveen, for example? The pier in Cromane seems to me to be a very suitable location for a visit by people from Bollywood. Perhaps the Taoiseach might give the House more detail on that.</P>

	<P>On a number of issues raised by the Deputy, I put forward very clearly Ireland&rsquo;s record and the late Deputy Frank Aiken&rsquo;s work, in particular, on non-proliferation, and our continuing belief in those policies. I am very proud of the Irish people in India, both the NGOs I met and the religious who have spent their lives there working with the poor. We visited some of their schools, hospitals and outreach bases. The Department of Foreign Affairs through its programmes has helped a number of schemes there, which is much appreciated. Many of the Irish religious have worked in India through the years against a high level of suspicion about their role. They have worked extremely hard in establishing some of the best schools, hospitals and orphanages. No doubt there is mass poverty in India. A middle class and working class is being consolidated which is generating the incomes necessary for the population. It is, however, a full democracy. It is to the country&rsquo;s great credit that it is able to operate a democracy with 1.1 billion people, without any restrictions on childbirth or other issues, while taking on the challenges it does.</P>
        <P>There are opportunities in the film industry. It is where the action is, currently, and is being outsourced from there. It is not just Indian producers. Everybody is in there and if the incentives are right, there are definite opportunities. The Minister has made valuable contacts, as have the Irish film industry representatives who accompanied him and I know they will follow through in the months ahead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Taoiseach&rsquo;s trip to India, I want to follow up what I asked yesterday. The Brussels summit in the summer had a statement <Col N="1569"/>about climate change. It referred to the Gleneagles plan of action with its emphasis on technology transfer. It also referred to taking up the dialogue of technological co-operation with the likes of India, China, Russia and others. Did the Taoiseach take the opportunity in India to follow this up with regard to technological transfers that would help deal with the impact of climate change? Given that India is such a large democracy, as the Taoiseach has mentioned, did this matter arise in meetings with either President Kalam or Prime Minister Singh? I will not ask about the non-proliferation treaty because this has already been the subject of a question.</P>
        <P>Did the Taoiseach detect any level of co-operation or more practical help for the earthquake victims in Pakistan, given that India is a neighbouring country, and did he have an opportunity to relate the sense of sympathy and the urge to help on the part of Irish people? This Friday and Saturday in Balbriggan there will be another collection of sleeping bags, blankets and so forth to help the victims of the earthquake. Did this or any other humanitarian issues arise, given the huge level of poverty in that country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I discussed those issues with Prime Minister Singh. He informed me of the sequence of events in India and how India offered to help. India broke through its traditional difficulties with Pakistan to help in every way it could. It took a few days to get it off the ground but there is huge co-operation.</P>
        <P>I am aware from speaking with Pakistani representatives at the embassy here and from my attendance, with many other Members, at the occasion on Sunday that our help is deeply appreciated by the Pakistanis. The president has written to me to convey their gratitude for all the co-operation from Ireland in dealing with the horrendous difficulties. The level of assistance from a small country such as this has been acknowledged and noted.</P>
        <P>Both Development Co-operation Ireland and private donors have been assisting religious groups and non-governmental organisations in many projects. Many Irish lay people, particularly young people, go to Calcutta for the summer and work in many of the townships. That is acknowledged by the Indians. The Indian Government is conscious that as a small country we send a proportionally high number of people. Transition year students and others go there to help out in small ways. The efforts of the Irish are acknowledged.</P>
        <P>With regard to technology transfers, our discussions were general. Many of the companies that accompanied us produce technology and software products and they were anxious to co-operate. A number of the agreements signed will lead to further co-operation in this area, particularly with our universities. Trinity College and other colleges have signed agreements to provide for co-operation in academic research. There are <Col N="1570"/>many opportunities, including business ones, in this area from the point of view of assisting them with our technology and experience. In particular, we will have an opportunity to interact with Bangalore where an enormous amount of research is carried out. That will be useful for the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>In the course of his visit to India, did the Taoiseach have an opportunity to address any of the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan? Both countries possess nuclear weapons. Did the Taoiseach get a sense that relations between the two countries have improved, particularly given the widely reported measures of goodwill employed by India towards Pakistan in the course of the natural disaster recently visited on the latter? Did the Taoiseach inquire about progress towards nuclear disarmament in the region, not the energy needs on which the Taoiseach&rsquo;s earlier reply is based? It is not about energy needs but specifically about disarmament.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I had an opportunity to discuss the relationships. There have been many efforts over the past year or so, since Prime Minister Singh came into office, to improve relationships. There has been much dialogue in recent months, and even while I was in India there was much coverage in the newspapers of the indication by the President of Pakistan, who was in the United States, that there would be a round of discussions. Like many of these discussions there seemed to be debates about the agenda and how they would proceed. There is an effort to defuse the tensions that have existed in recent years.</P>
        <P>Everybody I spoke to in India is more concerned about trying to deal with India&rsquo;s problems and difficulties than building up these tensions. Their stated position was that they would prefer to improve relations with Pakistan and ease the tensions. They do not foresee any changes to boundaries in the future; they just want to stay as they are and build up friendly relations. That was the strong message from Prime Minister Singh.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Earlier the Taoiseach spoke about his discussions regarding the Indian nuclear programme. He emphasised the need to develop a peaceful nuclear programme in India for economic development. However, he did not deal specifically with the contradiction that exists with regard to UN reform and India&rsquo;s role in the Security Council. India is seeking a permanent position on the Security Council but is not a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty. Did the Taoiseach indicate to the Indian authorities that there is a contradiction in this regard in its quest to secure a permanent seat on the Security Council?</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach also discuss the important point made earlier by Deputy Kenny? The situation with Iran at present is very dangerous <Col N="1571"/>and it appears to be getting worse by the day. With hindsight does the Taoiseach believe that, given the history of the European three of Germany, France and the UK with regard to the development of nuclear weaponry, especially in the case of France and the UK, there is a role for a country such as Ireland, one of the creators of the NPT? Does he believe there is a role for non-nuclear countries in negotiations with Iran? While I would not go so far as to use the word &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo;, awful double standards and contradictions are being applied to what is a very dangerous situation. If it is not dealt with now, it is inevitable that nuclear weaponry will get into the wrong hands and will be a risk to everybody.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a dangerous situation. The General Affairs Council has discussed it. I do not wish to comment on the EU three because they have represented the EU for a number of years. However, all the discussions and policies were enunciated at the General Affairs Council, even as late as this week. The International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, is still involved, which is good because if there is to be progress, it must be involved. We will see what happens on this issue on 2 and 3 February when the agency meets in Vienna. Outside our role in the General Affairs Council, I do not envisage Ireland having a more enhanced role in this area in the short term.</P>
        <P>I spoke earlier about India and the nuclear issue. India is aware that if it wishes to make any progress on this, it must convince the nuclear suppliers group. India is prepared to do whatever it is asked to do by the suppliers group and the international community and to give whatever guarantees are required on proliferation issues, provided it can secure a deal on nuclear power issues. Obviously, the authorities will not show their hand but they made it clear to me that nuclear energy is necessary for energy requirements and for the future development of their huge country. They know they must give guarantees on the other side but they are prepared to do that. However, they are hell-bent on securing nuclear energy for those purposes so I believe they will comply with whatever the international agreements require of them.</P>
        <P>Did the Deputy have another question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a role for Ireland in the negotiations with Iran?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think so. We have continued to have a good relationship with Iran. Delegations from Iran have been here and the previous foreign Minister was a regular visitor. Our role must remain within the General Affairs and External Relations Council and the situation is being tightly monitored through that.</P>

	<P>There seems to be confusion about the legislation concerning random breath testing. Prior to Christmas, on the advice of the Attorney General, this matter was deemed unconstitutional. After Christmas the matter seems to be perfectly constitutional and legal. Is it the case that the Attorney General, who is a decent man, has given inadequate or incorrect information? What has happened in the intervening period? First it was unconstitutional, but now it is legal and constitutional. When will we see the legislation that will deal with this? A Garda representative was on television yesterday. It is not clear whether we can have random breath testing without legislation. If we cannot, when will we have the legislation? We will expedite and facilitate the taking of that legislation in the House.</P>
      <P>There is a breakdown in communications with the mediator appointed by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in respect of the Corrib gas field. Will that have an impact on the publication of the safety review with which the Minister must deal?

	<P>On random breath testing, the Attorney General has given advice that will allow for the development of a scheme that will allow for the operation of extended preliminary roadside breath testing, so called random breath testing. We are working through the constitutional issues that could arise with regard to this. As the Deputy knows, this is an issue that is fought on a significant scale in our courts. A large number of breathalyser cases are fought in the courts on any <Col N="1574"/>technicality. The Attorney General is quite satisfied we can do this and he has advanced work on a scheme. It will require legislation and that will be priority legislation. We must also deal with the camera issue in the legislation. The legislation will be brought forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are issues. Legal concerns have been raised with regard to the possibility of the introduction of a scheme of full random breath testing on an open-ended basis without any restrictions as to its operation. The advice given by the Attorney General allows for development of a scheme which will address issues of proportionality. The legal issue concerned how it could be proportional. It will require legislation to get the Attorney General&rsquo;s scheme in place. However, many other actions can and are being taken by garda&iacute;. To nail the issue down so that we can deal with what is going on in the courts will require legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation is still confused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, there is no confusion. To have full random breath testing that will allow us deal with what comes up in the courts will require legislation. The Attorney General&rsquo;s scheme will deal with this. Currently, garda&iacute; can have road checks. There is nothing wrong with that under the law. If they see anything untoward, they can breathalyse people on that basis. The current situation does not mean nothing can happen. Road checks can be set up anywhere and if garda&iacute; see anything suspicious they can carry out a breath test. However, the Attorney General is of the view that we can design a scheme to bring a random roadside breath test into areas where there are high accidents that will deal with the constitutional difficulty with regard to proportionality. He believes we should do that in legislation.</P>
      <P>I will have to check with the Minister on the position on the report on discipline.</P>

	<P>Is the Taoiseach aware that animals have protection against pharmacy malpractice while human beings do not? There are enough scandals littering the health service scene without our having a malpractice-related scandal in the pharmacy sector. Will the Taoiseach fast-track the legislation to provide for fitness-to-practice and fitness-to-operate guidelines for pharmacists? There is no legislative protection to ensure we do not have rogue pharmacists malpractising in this country.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach, on the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two Bills. The pharmacy No. 1 Bill is to provide for fitness to practice regulations for pharmacists and the removal of the restriction on pharmacists educated in other EU and EEA countries from owning, managing or supervising a pharmacy. That legislation is due this year. I understand the pharmacy No. 2 Bill, which is to provide for changes in the regulatory framework for pharmacy and pharmacy services, is being drafted. It is also due for 2006.</P>

	<P>I have questions on two Bills. In the last session it was expected the Medical Practitioners Bill, legislation pertaining to the Department of Health and Children, would be published in mid-2006, but according to the most recent legislative programme it is not expected until late 2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That question was raised and answered yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to know the answer. Regardless of whether the matter was raised yesterday or on any other day, I want to know why there is a further delay regarding the legislation.</P>
      <P>The former legislative programme indicated it was not possible to determine when the revenue Bill would be published. It does not appear on the current legislative programme. Will the Taoiseach please explain that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The heads of the Medical Practitioners Bill have been agreed. It is just that there are other priorities. The Health (Repayment Scheme) Bill is receiving all the attention on the legislative side. There is also a hepatitis Bill and other legislation. Other priorities have meant that the Medical Practitioners Bill has been delayed.</P>
      <P>Work is being done on the revenue Bill in the Department. The final decisions on the provisions to be included will have to be considered in the context of the timing and availability of the report of the Moriarty tribunal, the terms of reference of which overlap with the issues to be addressed in the Bill. The Bill is not expected to be advanced for some time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I note that discussions on social partnership are about to restart.

     <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 8, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) The Council shall, prior to the commencement of negotiation of agreements between the Government and the social partners, present to the Oireachtas an assessment of key strategic challenges relating to the efficient development of the economy and the achievement of social &rdquo;justice&ldquo; and set out a strategic framework for endorsement or amendment by the Oireachtas before the negotiations commence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">As I stated on the Order of Business, it is extraordinary that the last social partnership agreement never came before the House in any shape or form. It did not come before the House at the stage where we could influence the agenda to be discussed by the social partners, during the negotiations so that we could be updated on developments or at the end so that we could secure democratic approval for the deal. Why has this approach been adopted? Not only has it been adopted for many years &mdash; although this agreement came before the D&aacute;il in the past &mdash; but under the current regime, this complete insulation of social partnership from the Oireachtas has been an unhealthy development. It is being copperfastened in this Bill which makes no provision for the type of participation the Oireachtas ought to have in the development of social part<Col N="1586"/>nership discussions. It provides solely for a token membership of the Oireachtas in a research group looking at social justice. I have no problem with the Oireachtas having representation on a research group on social justice. I have been a member of that in the past and it does useful work. However, that is not a substitute for a proper and mature relationship between the social partnership process and the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>It can come as no surprise that the shortcomings in the social partnership mechanism have focused on issues where there is no representation. These areas include the needs of consumers, the growth of a rip-off culture in Ireland, the role of parents, the lack of attention to the needs of children in a mature approach to economic and social policy and the ignoring of environmental issues. The latter issue is highlighted in the National Economic and Social Council&rsquo;s report as an area where we have not developed an understanding of the issue or an adequate system of governance in respect of it.</P>
      <P>Social partnership has failed to deliver in respect of these issues and failed to address important challenges coherently. It is not good enough that we make arrangements today which exclude the citizen&rsquo;s representation from these important debates. It is not acceptable for us to make arrangements which slam the door in the face of representation for consumers, parents or those who use public services in the social partnership process. The reform of public services to deliver high-quality services has been poorly handled within the social partnership process and people recognise that. Even Ministers now concede that the way in which benchmarking was handled was inappropriate.</P>
      <P>We need to learn from what is going wrong and we need to make social partnership a more open, transparent and legitimised process by having genuine links with elected representatives, as well as representing important interests within our community. We must combine these processes to strengthen both. It is a mistake for the Taoiseach, in both this legislation and in practice, to insist on insulating social partnership from the Oireachtas. A fair observer could not fail to notice the dramatic contrast between the public accountability of Government to the social partnership process and its public accountability to the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In the case of the social partnership process, there are two implementation bodies, four research bodies and ten high-level policy committees working on issues of concern to the social partners. Ten progress reports have already been produced on an agreement which was only negotiated in the middle of 2003. There is, correctly, a very high level of accountability in this area. Contrast this with the rusty and creaky systems of accountability in this House. We produce Estimates in November which do not contain any information about what they expect to achieve and we are expected to approve them on the nod. We have no serious scrutiny of Estimates under <Col N="1587"/>the current process and the investigative powers of the D&aacute;il have been severely clipped. On social conflicts one would expect the Oireachtas to resolve, the Oireachtas has been virtually eclipsed and has less and less of a role to play in this regard.</P>
      <P>We need to reconnect social partnership, which is a crucial part of governance in this community, and the Oireachtas and strengthen both areas. The links can be mutually beneficial. I was pleased to participate in discussions with the Labour Party to produce an agreed new departure for social partnership. This new departure must recognise new challenges, introduce greater accountability in respect of the partnership mechanism and involve the Oireachtas on a more central basis. If we do that we will move forward and achieve more from social partnership than we have in the past.</P>
      <P>Sadly, I do not see any new departure reflected in this Bill. This Bill cements a flawed system instead of examining how we can overcome these flaws and build on successes. The Bill is disappointing. The Taoiseach will have his 118 representatives and a range of different councils and groups but the dynamism needed between the citizen and social partnership will be missing. My amendment would, in a minor fashion, begin this process. If we were to go down this route, it would need to be reflected in many other amendments to this process and many ongoing changes in the way we do our work in this House and the links we have with the important social partnership process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment. This Bill has been around since 2002. I presume it was taken out of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s cupboard and given an airing this week because we are about to embark on another round of social partnership discussions. In many ways, the purpose of this Bill is to set up the quango of quangos. It is the &uuml;ber-quango. It will unite all the other quangos which deal with social partnership. The new body will be a combination of the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance and related bodies. There are many bodies operating in this sphere, as well as those yet to be established, which the Taoiseach may deign to add.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s arguments in support of this amendment. Certain elements of social partnership have been extremely successful and have served the economy well. However, in terms of the social fabric and the type of issues the Taoiseach purported to address at the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting in County Cavan, about Robert Putnam and &ldquo;Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community&rdquo;, our country is at severe risk of becoming unhinged from the issues that face <Col N="1588"/>many people in terms of their struggle for a decent life for themselves and their families.</P>
      <P>The key failure of the social partnership process is that a plethora of issues are being addressed, but in effect the progress on many of these is more apparent than real. At the time of the previous social partnership, many promises were given on social housing initiatives, for example. The new body, when established, will probably have a whole section or group devoted to research and action on housing. The reality, particularly in working class areas of our cities and towns, is that social housing as a concept has collapsed, killed off by this Government. The amount of social housing is a fraction of what it once was. Tens of thousands of families are on waiting lists, and an initiative on affordable housing is good but limited. Whole sets of families and communities are effectively excluded from housing provision in the future.</P>
      <P>This is a critical issue for the people, and I presume this to be one of the issues that the set of quangos, either now or in future, could be expected to deal with. These bodies will not be accountable to the D&aacute;il on the issue, however. We will not even get the figures. What we will get are high-priced consultants&rsquo; reports and aspirational documents indicating new improvements but absolutely nothing in reality.</P>
      <P>We have had very important research carried out by the National Economic and Social Forum on the treatment of older people. It has been reflected in many Government statements that we only want a limited percentage of older people, who have no other choice, to end up in nursing homes. We all agree on this point. There has, however, been almost no provision in many counties for sheltered independent housing for people through local authorities which would enable older people to live independently with some community support.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton that there are whole areas of absolute importance to our national well-being as a cohesive society, and not just as an economy, which are apparently dealt with at partnership level. However, people feel badly cheated after nine years of this Government. One reason for this is an almost total lack of information. It is Government through public relations and quangos operate through a similar method. People who are ripped off, be they consumers, people on the housing list or others excluded from the workings of these important quangos, including the very powerful quango I referred to previously, feel they have no recourse. It is part of a growing fissure in society that is not conducive to any type of social growth leading to people having a sense of well-being and ownership in their society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support this amendment put forward by Deputy Bruton. Although he did not speak to me beforehand about proposals regarding the social partnership process, he might <Col N="1589"/>be pleased to know I agree wholeheartedly with what he suggested in his opening contribution.</P>
      <P>I speak as someone who, prior to election to this House, was a participant in the social partnership process. I was a member of the National Economic and Social Council for four years, having had my nomination endorsed by the Taoiseach. I served on the body with a degree of interest and frustration, as there is frustration in the manner in which social partnership worked. On the other side of the fence, here in the D&aacute;il, that frustration is compounded by a system that is not working because it does not involve all the democratic actors it should to serve the interests of citizens. Any suggestion that would make this system work better should be listened to and the Government should respond to it.</P>
      <P>My amendment, which will be addressed later, works on a similar principle, albeit under a different set of circumstances. It is frustrating as a Member of this House to see political issues being discussed and decided upon without any reference to this House. Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s amendment is excellent, but it probably needs to go even further. A debate and vote of this nature at the beginning or end of a partnership process should also have intervals of ongoing inspection of the process itself. The social partners are given regular updates regarding the commitments entered into by the Government in the social partnership agreements. This House is not.</P>
      <P>Any analysis of those agreements would show a specific bias in how the Government chooses to implement certain aspects of the partnership agreements and allows other parts wither on the vine. This could be particularly true of agreements that have been entered into with the community and voluntary sector, which I had the privilege of representing on the National Economic and Social Council. There appears to be a hierarchy, not only in terms of some partners being more equal than others but in the agreements entered into with each and the priorities given with regard to how these are implemented. There are political realities in this. Wage elements and issues concerning IBEC in particular are given some precedence.</P>
      <P>The Government has not followed through on many points of agreements in successive social partnership processes. Ironically, these would mainly fall under the social justice element, which appears to be the only area in which Members of the Oireachtas have a peripheral involvement in terms of making a comment. However, they have little influence on it.</P>
      <P>A real social partnership agreement should contain the actors mentioned by Deputy Bruton in his opening contribution. I make a special case for environmental actors. The hoots of derision coming from the Government benches during Leaders&rsquo; Questions shows the degree of ignorance that exists on many of the important environmental issues that we face as a society and economy over the next few decades. The absence <Col N="1590"/>of people interested in those issues who have a relevant expertise is leading to flawed national policy making. This is why we as Members of the D&aacute;il need to be more involved in this process. Without this involvement, bad policies and decisions will become apparent.</P>
      <P>In terms of the information made available on the partnership process, I ask that we not only have the normal distribution of information on how a social partnership agreement is proceeding, but that we adopt the same mechanisms as the social partners. A vote must occur within the ICTU, IBEC and individual organisations of groups before any agreement is reached. This applies to the community and voluntary sector as well.</P>
      <P>The one place where no vote occurs on social partnership agreements, especially in recent years, is in this Chamber. How can any agreement with such an enormous impact on economic and social policy in this country be allowed to develop without being discussed in the D&aacute;il and being subject to a vote? It is a nonsense. If the Government wishes to treat this House seriously, it must put in place mechanisms leading to the D&aacute;il being intimately involved in the workings of social partnership. It is in the nature of democracy that those on this side of the Chamber will, on another day, be on that side and the business of Government requires that everybody be involved and informed so that decisions are made in the national interest on the basis of that experience. The Government prefers to hold on to the levers of power and information and to control interaction with the social partners, which is not a good system. We must do better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my support to the amendment proposed by Deputy Bruton. It is a welcome amendment which I hope the Government is prepared to accept. It seeks to place within the functions of the NESC the responsibility of presenting to the Houses of the Oireachtas an assessment of the key strategic challenges relating to the economy and the achievement of social justice. It offers an opportunity for Members of both Houses to properly impact in the resultant debate which they may choose to endorse, but it is equally likely they may wish to offer key and critical amendments. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that Members of both Houses, given their extensive experience and broad sense of what constitutes social justice, would identify areas that were being overlooked.</P>
      <P>Such an exercise is imperative. It presents an opportunity for transparency and, most importantly, for accountability in the process. Real accountability is not achieved by the current relationship between Government and the various acronyms that exist. We are discussing a Bill that is creating yet another acronym, the NESD, to add to the already confusing array of acronyms such as the NESF, the NESC and the NCPP. In <Col N="1591"/>this instance we are being afforded an opportunity to create real accountability, which can only be achieved through the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is an important final assessment before the real work of negotiation on future social partnership arrangements gets under way.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment. We have to view it against the background of the relationship heretofore between Government and the NESC, as that is the body which is specifically the subject of the amendment. There is a serious dichotomy between the NESC strategy report, An Investment in Quality: Services, Inclusion and Enterprise and the Government&rsquo;s own self-congratulatory, back-clapping spatial strategy report. Similarly, the NESF report on health services shows the Government has a very poor record in adopting the wise and carefully considered proposals of these important bodies, which are there to inform and assist Government to better carry out its task. That will not be done by continually ignoring the best recommendations and most carefully considered positions these bodies have taken.</P>
      <P>Accountability is required. It will not be the panacea for all the ills and deficiencies that I have recounted but unquestionably it would be a good step. I commend the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for their contributions. Like others here I also spent some time on the NESF so I am aware of the background to the various points made and understand where they originate. However, we are dealing specifically with the relationship between the National Economic and Social Council and the Government</P>
      <P>I cannot agree to the amendment and will explain why, in the hope of achieving a degree of consensus as we do in the process of partnership. Deputy Bruton formerly served in Government in the key economic post of Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, but made no changes to the role of the NESC which, as now, was to advise Government. The distinction must be made between a Government seeking advice from the NESC, which is a representative organisation, and acting on it. As we are often told, we are here to govern.</P>
      <P>Broader issues concerning the nature of democracy were raised and, as Chief Whip, I have endeavoured to encourage more debate on a variety of issues, which Opposition Whips will confirm. At the moment a line of reporting exists from the NESC to Government but the Deputy suggests there should be another line to the Oireachtas. I cannot agree to that but the Oireachtas can debate any reports published and express its views, and the material in reports is not binding. However, we cannot involve the Oireachtas in a process before a report is finalised because of the responsibilities we have as a Government.</P><Col N="1592"/>
      <P>My party was heavily involved in setting up the process of social partnership and saw it as a good idea though other parties, including Fine Gael, did not agree at the time. Since then, however, it has embraced social partnership, as have all parties. The NESC produces important documents and strategies, and all bodies, such as the NESF and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, are very important for this country. The newest one, the NCPP, is looking closely at how we operate our workplaces from the point of view of innovation, work practices etc. The amount of work it has on stream will be helpful to whichever Government is in power.</P>
      <P>The NESC has completed its three-yearly strategic overview of Irish economic and social policy entitled the NESC Strategy 2006: People, Productivity and Purpose, paving the way for negotiations on the successor to Sustaining Progress, in which context it is timely that we are discussing it today. In May 2005 the NESC completed a study entitled The Developmental Welfare State and, in December 2004, a report on housing in Ireland, entitled Performance and Policy. The coming months will see the completion of a study on migration policy, which is well advanced. The NESC will also complete a report on the Lisbon strategy, focusing on the open method of co-ordination, and further studies nearing completion include a study of child poverty and child income support. Work should also commence in 2006 on the Council&rsquo;s first periodic social report and it will make a significant contribution to the knowledge society foresight exercise. The Council will also consider this year how best to address other items in its current work programme, including taxation policy and competition and regulation in networked sectors.</P>
      <P>I refer to those examples to emphasise that there are useful reports and strategies to debate. To address the points the Deputy has made I would be more than happy to talk with Opposition Whips and collectively select a number of strategies and reports to debate here in the months ahead. Governments, irrespective of their hue, are there to govern. This body exists to advise the Government and, while I strongly disagree with putting in another layer, I do not suggest that the Members of this House, as public representatives, should not discuss these reports in plenary or committee session.</P>
      <P>Having listened to Leaders&rsquo; and Ministers&rsquo; Questions, I disagree with the points raised because there are plenty of opportunities for accountability. It is important that this structured issue, which specifically concerns the NESC, goes to Government. That is not to say it should not be debated in this House and I would support such a measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether the Minister of State is being deliberately obtuse in failing to address the issues raised by the Opposition or if his head is so buried in the sand that he cannot <Col N="1593"/>see them. This amendment does not require the NESC to report to the D&aacute;il and that is not at stake. The crucial matter is that, prior to the commencement of negotiations on agreements, a debate should be held in the D&aacute;il on the agenda for social partnerships, a key ingredient of which is the NESC report. We have that report, so there is no question of interfering in its work but we do not hold debates on or bear responsibility for shaping the way in which social partnership develops, even though we have been elected by the citizens and have a genuine mandate which should influence Government policy. Ministers want to ignore the Oireachtas to continue dealing with these issues behind closed doors by means of an unaccountable system.</P>
      <P>I agree that ten years ago we might have changed this but, while the past decade has seen dramatic transformations, we have not effectively addressed partnership in areas of change. Ten years ago, people believed social partnership was successful because it focused on a narrow range of matters, such as, employment, public debt and competitiveness. However, current issues are much broader, concerning the environment, consumers and public reform. These are areas in which the Government has failed to deliver and in which partnership has not had the necessary impetus for reform. A mature change is needed in terms of the way this system operates so that we can build on the strengths of partnership and give a real role to the people who are elected with a mandate. The Minister of State deliberately chose to ignore all those issues in his reply and is pretending that we are trying to interfere with the way the NESC produces reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>We can have a debate. The Deputy is misreading what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the intention of this amendment. The Minister of State deliberately ignored all references to social partnership and pretended that the debate here merely concerned the relationship between the Government and the NESC. We have been debating the need to change the way in which partnership works through making it more dynamic, answerable to the people and willing to confront difficult issues. If the Minister of State thinks the Government is confronting these issues, I would ask him to look at this document. I do not believe he has read it because, if he had, he would see the sorts of challenges that face us, challenges which the Government is not addressing. The Oireachtas could have a real role in creating a more dynamic process.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State let himself down in his reply to this debate and I wish he would reflect on the matter. There is no point in the Government sending in a Minister of State who has no capacity to make changes. He may have been given certain directions and instructed not to concede this point. If this Oireachtas operates in that manner, <Col N="1594"/>he is not responding adequately to the D&aacute;il. We cannot have Ministers of State who do not have genuine authority to debate the issues put before them because that is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>With all due respect to Deputy Bruton, I have attempted to meet him half way by suggesting that this side of the House has no difficulty with holding debates on specific strategies arising from any NESC report. I referred to some of the important work being done by the council and I have no problem with that. Short of putting this into legislation, we have a process for agreeing D&aacute;il business and, if in terms of holding debates, I have no difficulty with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>If he read the legislation, he would know it does not merely concern holding debates about NESC reports. It is about shaping the way partnership develops, not about debating reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>If, in my capacity as Government Chief Whip, I can help this House by giving it greater involvement in some of these issues and by allowing public representatives to debate them here or in committee, I will do so. I am not in such a position because, as the Deputy is aware, the reports are not binding but represent viewpoints which act as a background to negotiations. A committee of the D&aacute;il can, obviously, express its views but that is as far as I can go. I acted reasonably by going some way toward addressing the concerns expressed by the Deputy. If he wishes to push it, that is fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course I will push it. We are not trying to hold another debate on the NESC strategy on housing. We are not looking for another debate on the reports on the welfare system or on the housing system, even if they are exciting and raise important issues that are not addressed by Government strategy, nor on the reports challenging the way we think about the environment and our capacity, as governing entities and communities, to address issues. I want serious efforts to be made by the partnership to address those challenges and to put them up in red lights. We are here with a mandate and I do not want to leave this House at the end of my career knowing that these issues exist but were ignored by the Government and the social partnership.</P>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Oireachtas has a role in creating the impetus because we represent citizens rather than interest groups and our job is to hold the Government accountable for the way in which it does its business and the partnership accountable for the issues it addresses. That is our role. We are seeking to exercise our rights, not to hold debates on a Friday afternoon about worthy reports which will have no influence on Government or the partnership process. We want to stake out ground for the Oireachtas by shaping the development of <Col N="1595"/>partnership. We want a proper and mature relationship with the social partners which benefits those who partake in the partnership, as well as our electors. Let us not forget that many people are disillusioned with partnership. Small businesses feel they are not represented by IBEC. Rank and file union members feel disenfranchised. Consumers, users of public services and environmental interest groups feel that their voices are never heard.</P>
     <P>The Minister of State, by attempting to deflect these real issues into a few more debates on a Friday afternoon about NESC reports, has deliberately misinterpreted the remarks of speakers from this side of the House. I will not delay the <Col N="1596"/>House because I do not believe he has the authority to concede on this, even if we succeeded in persuading him on it. It is not acceptable to conduct debates in such a manner. These are important issues and someone should be present who has the capacity to make decisions when we want to put forward amendments.</P>
      <P>I thank my colleagues on the Opposition benches for their support of this amendment. It is an important one but, as others have noted, it represents the start of a process and will need to be complemented in many other ways. This issue is of sufficient importance to require a division of the House.</P>

	<P LI="1">I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 13, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(8) A disqualification pursuant to an order of a court referred to in <i>subsection (7)(d)</i>, <i>(f)</i>, <i>(g)</i> or <i>(h)</i> shall not take effect until the ordinary time for appealing against any such order has expired, or if an appeal is lodged within that time, until any such appeal, or a further appeal therefrom is determined.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment would permit the usual opportunity to appeal a decision that would disqualify a person from membership of a body. The Minister of State said the paragraphs referred to final situations anyway but this is wrong in law. A clause similar to the amendment is set out in other legislation, such as the Electoral Act 1992. This clause was necessary as a conviction stands pending an appeal. The Minister of State&rsquo;s comment in committee, therefore, was misleading if it suggested that a disqualification would not operate even though an appeal was pending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The official position is that all the situations in section 18(7)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>h</i>) deal with circumstances that have occurred and are regarded as final solutions. I would not consider that the section needs to be amended in the way proposed. If a matter has not been resolved and an appeal mechanism is still in operation, the matter is not finalised and the section would not come into effect. It is not drafted as in other similar legislation because it is taken in these cases that the full legal procedure has taken place. I will take the Deputy on good faith and ask my officials to check the Electoral Act 1992. I have no difficulty in accepting the amendment because <Col N="1599"/>it does not make any substantial difference to what we are trying to achieve.</P>
</Speaker>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P LI="1">I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 13, to delete lines 30 to 32 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(13) Not less than 40 per cent of the members of a Body shall be men and not less than 40 per cent shall be women.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment will ensure there is equality of representation between women and men so that at least 40% of members of the body shall be men and 40% shall be women.</P>
      <P>This is the quango of quangos, it brings all the other quangos involved in social partnership together, and it is extraordinary that the Government would not rush to embrace a situation where, given the bodies and people party to the partnership process, we would not need to keep an eye on the number of women to be on these bodies, and we could look naturally for strong representation from men and women, with at least 40% of each.</P>
      <P>The Government has a poor record of promoting equal participation of women in bodies under its control. Following long arguments with the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, the position in the financial sector improved marginally. However, the proportion of women on many bodies is 20% or less. We are still at a stage when Ministers seek to appoint to bodies a couple of women who may have come to their attention through party organisations. It is unacceptable that this should be the case in the type of economy we now have and at a time when women participate at every level of society, whether at home, in the workplace or through caring agencies.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to argue for this amendment in the House given that it ranks close to the bottom of the international league in terms of the proportion of women in Parliament and that the major Government party, Fianna F&aacute;il, has few women in its ranks. Unless women are strongly represented, one will not enjoy the full benefit of their participation, advice and expertise.</P>
      <P>In commenting on neglected areas of public policy such as the crisis in the provision of housing, particularly for those who could traditionally acquire social housing, I was not trying to start a debate. The quango structure the Taoiseach is establishing to facilitate social partnership is meant to be representative of the whole population. There is no reason at least 50% of the body&rsquo;s members should not be women. It would be a cause of considerable surprise if only four or five of its members, who will number approximately 100, were men. People would sit up and ask what was going on, while Kevin Myers would <Col N="1600"/>have a rush of blood to the head and worry that men were losing out in society.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks only that the quango structure include a critical mass of women from all strands of life. I cannot understand the reason the Government will not agree to this proposal. While I accept it could cause some soul searching and necessitate looking beyond the party lists to find candidates, there are many lists of non-affiliated women who are available and willing to assume such roles. Why should candidates have party affiliations when women are involved in many organisations throughout the country?</P>
      <P>Although the Minister of State is undoubtedly sympathetic to the objective of the amendment, it is time to recognise in legislation the need for significant numbers of women to be active in the policy formulation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment and Deputy Burton has articulated the reasons for tabling it. The Deputy has consistently introduced amendments to provide for the introduction of similar arrangements to apply to various bodies which come before the House. Although the Government should accept these kinds of provisions, it has consistently failed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment. Unfortunately, those elements of nominating bodies, including the Government, which should be most flexible in achieving the goals set out in the proposal tend to be the least responsive. I was a member of the National Economic and Social Council, which is composed of five nominees from each of the five representative pillars, namely, IBEC, ICTU, the farming sector, the community and voluntary sector and Departments. From my recollection, the representatives of IBEC and the farming pillar were all male, those of the ICTU pillar were 80% male and those of the community and voluntary pillar were 60% female. As there are only two female Secretaries General in government service, just 20% of the Government representatives were female, with the sole woman representative an assistant secretary general in the Department of the Taoiseach. The Government was invariably represented by Secretaries General from key economic Ministries. Strangely, the community and voluntary pillar came under the greatest pressure to increase its female membership as a means of boosting the overall proportion of female members on the NESC, despite the fact that three of its five representatives were female.</P>
      <P>Not only should the figure set out in the amendment be attained for the new body but the social partners and, specifically, the Government must provide evidence to show they are prepared to meet gender balance targets such as that set out in the amendment. Perhaps the amendment needs to be strengthened in some respects given that the experience to date has been that these <Col N="1601"/>sectors have not been prepared to work towards this goal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Burton&rsquo;s amendment. The arguments for moving towards and accepting gender equality have been articulated in the House time and again. The Government has continuously kicked to touch, showing a sympathy with the aspiration but no willingness to take on board the concrete, practical stepsthat would facilitate such a transition. The House has an opportunity to address the matter with regard to the various bodies to which the Bill refers. The Government should grasp this opportunity to ensure that men and women make up at least 40% of the membership of any and all of the bodies in question. If it transpires that 60% of the membership of any or all of them are women, all the better.</P>
      <P>We need to create opportunities and platforms to give people access and allow them to play their part to their full potential in the broad interest of civic society. That can best be reflected in terms of the roles envisaged for the various bodies, not only in the interest of civic society but in helping to guide Government in the broad interest of society and its needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>While I agree with the sentiments behind the amendment, as I indicated on Committee Stage the difficulty with the proposal is that it is not practical. I am confident, however, that we can work towards achieving the excellent balance referred to in the Bill. As Deputies will be aware, appointments to a body may not always be at the discretion of the Government because they may be nominated by representative bodies. I have encountered such cases in other Ministries and Deputies with experience of ministerial office will have been in a similar position. For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>I undertook on Committee Stage to ask the Taoiseach to write to nominating bodies to convey the views of the select committee on the matter of gender balance. A letter to this effect issued on 31 August 2005, a copy of which I will make available to any Deputy who wishes one. I have endeavoured to follow up on the comments made on Committee Stage when the amendment was not pressed. I hope we will achieve gender balance as a result of the initiative taken by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>While I thank the Minister of State for following up on the matter, it is not acceptable that it should almost unthinkingly be the case that, as Deputy Boyle described, many of the key participating bodies have low female representation or no women members on their delegations.</P>

        <QRef>[3566/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The national roads improvement programme, in line with the national development plan and, more recently, Transport 21, provides for the procurement and construction of a number of major national road projects as toll public-private partnership projects. The current position is that three projects &mdash; the second West Link bridge, the Dundalk western bypass and the Kilcock-Kinnegad section of the N4 &mdash; have been completed. Work is under way on the Fermoy bypass and work is due to start on the Waterford city bypass and phase two of the Limerick southern ring road this year.</P>
        <P>A number of other toll PPP projects &mdash; the N6 Galway-Ballinasloe, the N7-N8 Portlaoise-Cullahill and the M50 PPP upgrade &mdash; are at earlier stages of procurement, but I understand the National Roads Authority expects these schemes to be in construction by early 2007. The Clonee-Kells section of the N3 is before the courts and the timeline for commencing that scheme will depend on the outcome of the hearing. In addition, the Dublin Port tunnel will open this year.</P>
        <P>Toll charges are being applied to the tunnel for traffic management purposes. The NRA estimates that private sector investment in the toll PPP projects completed to date amounts to approximately &euro;500 million. Private sector investment in toll PPPs over the period to 2010 is estimated to be approximately &euro;2 billion.</P>
        <P>The projects to be undertaken as toll PPPs have been selected by the NRA having regard to a number of principles. One of these key principles is that toll roads should be spread across the main national routes to create an equitable distribution of user charging on the newly constructed network along with the benefits of the accelerated delivery of the new roads. Another fundamental underlying principle of the NRA PPP programme is that an alternative toll-free route be available for road users.</P>
        <P>Toll PPPs are only undertaken following rigorous assessment in line with Department of Finance requirements and guidelines relating to PPPs and capital appraisal and when it is deter<Col N="1603"/>mined that the toll PPP approach offers value for money. The toll programme is making a significant contribution to the accelerated implementation of the national roads upgrade programme. It has also facilitated the more extensive use of private sector expertise in the design, construction and operation of facilities.</P>
        <P>While the scope for additional toll road PPPs is limited, the scale and cost of the national roads programme, combined with the demands of the other sectors which limit the capacity to allocate more Exchequer funding, require that all possibilities for generating additional funding to accelerate the implementation of the national roads programme be considered and kept under review. It is a matter for the NRA in the first instance to consider and propose projects to be undertaken as toll PPP projects. In summary, the toll road PPP programme will continue to make a significant contribution to the implementation of the national roads improvement programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and welcome the clarification but I question the need to continue. While I understand the original rationale behind using tolling to pay for roads, we no longer need the money. Last year we had a surplus of &euro;1.8 billion as a result of a more favourable budget outcome than expected. The Stability and Growth Pact restrictions have been removed so there is no reason to continue tolling except, perhaps, as the Minister said, to benefit from private sector expertise. Can that not be achieved through design, construction and operation without also asking that the private sector finance roads? On the M50, whatever about the obscene profits made by the private sector, my real objection is the loss of control of the road and the traffic management as a result of giving a ransom strip to a private company.</P>
        <P>The Minister said one of the requirements is that toll roads would be spread equitably throughout the country. Clearly that is not the case. The Galway road will have two tolls, and drivers on this route might also face tolls at the M50 and the East Link. I am not sure it meets any of the criteria originally envisaged as a reason for tolling. Would the Minister agree that the diversion rates on roads outside Dublin are high? The diversion rate on the newly opened Kinnegad bypass is still growing. Has there been any calculation of an acceptable diversion rate? The level of traffic that can be generated outside the populous Dublin area is such that it requires a high toll to give a return to the private sector and the higher the toll, the greater the diversion rate. Are we trying to milk it for all it is worth by persisting with tolling when we have the money and could maintain control while benefitting from private sector expertise by using another model?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>A fair assessment would say that my Department received a major contribution <Col N="1604"/>from the Exchequer in Transport 21 and we have laid out &euro;34.4 billion. In a perfect world with no competing demands from other Departments, one might be able to take all the State&rsquo;s resources and put them into infrastructure, but that is not the case. We have outlined a major investment programme in a range of areas, specifically in roads, over the next few years.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that the added capacity we can get through accelerated delivery of roads throughout the country has been enhanced by the availability of PPP projects to us. Many Deputies from both sides of the House ask me to speed up the delivery of their projects and are open to their delivery as a PPP if it means they can be moved up in the programme. Even businesses from local areas have made the same case because they think advancing and accelerating these projects delivers an economic benefit to everybody, even with a toll, rather than waiting six, seven or ten years to get the project. It is built into the programme. Everybody accepts that our share of the taxpayers&rsquo; contribution to the Exchequer is massive.</P>
        <P>The Deputy raised an interesting question on diversion rates and it is important to put this on the record. The main cause of diversion from toll roads is gridlock.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am telling the Deputy what the research and facts indicate. The figures on the Dundalk bypass are way beyond expectation. They are running at approximately 26,500 cars per day on the Drogheda and Dundalk bypass. I do not have the final Kilcock-Kinnegad figures yet but they are running at 16,000 to 18,000 per day, exactly the level expected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is dropping on that road.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no such figures. Much notional debate occurs around these issues. People speculate and make comments but in fact &mdash; we should all deal with facts &mdash; the volume of traffic using the Kilcock-Kinnegad road is exactly in line with expectations. It is untrue to say that where tolls are in operation, they are not having an impact on the local communities by taking traffic out of those communities. They deliver a positive return for the NRA and for the toll users. Expected figures are being met on all tolls and are way ahead on most.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>

        <Quest>if, in view of the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice to the Garda Commissioner that under existing legislation the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the power to set up random road checks for the purpose of detecting drink-driving, he will launch an immediate campaign to tackle drink-driving in order to reduce the number of road deaths.</Quest>
        <QRef>[3475/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Attorney General has provided advice on the exercise of the powers currently available to the Garda to stop vehicles both on a general basis and in particular in connection with the enforcement of drink driving laws. Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may stop any vehicle using a public road for the purpose of detecting offences under the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2004. Those Acts provide for a legislative basis for the operation by the Garda of preliminary roadside breath testing for the purpose of detecting drink-driving offences. The legislative provisions establish that a driver may be required to submit to such a test where a vehicle has been involved in a traffic collision, where a traffic offence is committed, or where a member of the Garda is of the opinion that the driver has consumed intoxicating liquor. The requirement that a driver must submit to a preliminary roadside breath test, following the formation of the opinion of a member of the Garda that he or she has consumed alcohol, may be applied through the stopping of vehicles on an individual basis or through the establishment of dedicated checkpoints.</P>
        <P>During his contribution to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport on 25 January, the Garda Commissioner indicated that he welcomed the clarity of the advice from the Attorney General and gave a commitment to the pursuit of enhanced levels of enforcement of drink driving offences as a result. I welcome this commitment and look forward to a significant and immediate increase in the levels of enforcement of drink driving laws. The extent of such enforcement campaigns is an operational matter for the senior Garda management. The Attorney General has also given advice that will allow for the develop<Col N="1606"/>ment of a scheme for the operation of extended preliminary roadside breath testing, or &ldquo;random&rdquo; breath testing. Such a scheme, in which the Garda will not be required to form an opinion on alcohol consumption, will operate in a targeted manner.</P>
        <P>I will now bring forward legislative proposals to allow the Garda to establish road checkpoints for &ldquo;random&rdquo; breath testing at which drivers will be required to submit to a preliminary test. The legislation will provide the basis for the production of clear guidelines that will establish definitive parameters for the application of these proposed checkpoints, in order to prevent any arbitrary use of these statutory provisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The advice received by the Garda Commissioner last week conveniently seemed to get lost in the announcement by the Taoiseach about legislating on this issue. The Commissioner was very clear last week. The Attorney General told him that members of the Garda could set up random road checks for the purpose of detecting drink driving and that they could test people if they have reasonable suspicion that they have been drinking. If the person failed that test, it could provide the grounds on which they could pursue the issue by having a further test in the station. It seems to be the case that the Garda has all the powers it requires under existing legislation to dramatically change the approach to drink driving. This is welcome news and I cannot understand why the Minister for Transport and the Taoiseach are continuing to obfuscate and talk about legislating for it in the long term. There are substantial powers available to the Garda right now, as has been clarified by the Attorney General. If the Minister was serious about tackling the problem of drink driving, he would give a very political instruction to the Garda to launch an immediate campaign to clamp down on drink driving.</P>
        <P>The Minister received that advice from the Attorney General some time ago and the Commissioner clarified that the advice had come from the Attorney General through the Minister. It is now several months since he got that advice and I wonder why he remained silent about that. Why has he not welcomed the fact that the Garda now has much stronger powers than presumed heretofore? Why is he not acting on that? Why does he continue with these delaying tactics, talking about legislating at some point in the future? All of the powers already exist for the Garda to tackle the scourge of drink driving.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with most of what the Deputy said. I am interested in why she has criticised me so heavily for amplifying the powers that the Garda had for random breath testing before the Commissioner spoke last week. I said all of that before the committee, yet the Deputy laughed at me, claiming it was nonsense. The Attorney General has amplified the Garda <Col N="1607"/>powers and has made that perfectly clear. The missing piece was that members of the Garda do not have an ability to stop a line of traffic and without forming any opinion on whether someone has consumed alcohol or not, can request every driver to submit to a random breath test. Heretofore, I set out the conditions on how garda&iacute; can administer a random breath test. The key condition that has caused a problem and had been challenged consistently in the courts is the opinion formed by the garda whether the person has consumed drink, which is either based on smelling alcohol off the person&rsquo;s breath&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has not read the advice. An opinion does not have to be formed before giving a breathalyser test.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>There only has to be reasonable suspicion. Someone walks out of a pub or someone who smells of alcohol can be bagged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows that this is the issue that is constantly being challenged in the courts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not right.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>He does not have to stagger, he can walk out of the pub, yet the garda can have a reasonable suspicion that he has been drinking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If I walked out of a pub, the garda might form that reasonable suspicion but he would be wrong because I do not drink. We cannot have an arbitrary basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What has the Minister done about getting garda&iacute; on to the road and tackling the problem?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not responsible for the operational matters of the Garda and the Deputy knows that. There are cases where we have had to increase the number of garda&iacute;.</P><Col N="1608"/>
        <P>It has been pointed out that there are many forms of alcohol that do not emit a smell of alcohol, while some forms of alcohol consumed are more obvious than others. A garda can immediately form an opinion because he or she can smell the alcohol off the driver, but that is not always the case. I want to eliminate that doubt so that any driver stopped under the new legislation, whether he or she has had a drink or not, will be subjected to a breath test. That is the form of random breath testing that everyone in this country wants, including the Deputy. I agree with that and I have told her three or four time previously that I wanted to get to that situation. There were questions on the constitutional issues surrounding it. The Attorney General has worked out a way of going forward with this so that it is not seen to be arbitrary.</P>

	<P>Has he met the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to see how it may be ensured that the Garda operates the law as it currently exists? I have never seen a checkpoint outside a licensed premises. Garda&iacute; have the power to set up checkpoints anywhere they like tonight if they so wish. However, the Minister knows perfectly well there have been complaints from vintners and his publican friends. For that reason no clear direction has gone out from the Garda to enforce the law that exists. That is the nub of the problem. When is the Minister going to take action and stop making excuses, which leads to considerable numbers of people being killed on the roads as a result of drink driving?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for the question because it was I who called a meeting with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and all of the senior members of the Garda. I spent hours discussing this issue with the Garda on precisely the points the Deputy has raised. I wanted to establish from the Garda the actual training and methodology it uses in doing this. Much of the discussion before Christmas led to the conclusion, expansion and greater amplification from the Garda of the powers it already has and that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am the Minister for Transport. The Deputy asked me whether I had done anything about it. I have confirmed to her in a very open manner that I called a meeting and met not just the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform but all of the senior garda&iacute; from the Commissioner to the deputy and assistant commissioners. It was the correct thing to do and clarified a great many issues. I expect, as does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that there will be a clearly enhanced number of road checks in evidence to every commuter and motorist throughout the country as a result of the current situation. We will introduce legislation in the House, which the Fine Gael leader said they will be quite happy to facilitate, as I am sure the Labour Party will be, so as to ensure everybody, regardless of whether they have had a drink, will be subject to randomised breath tests.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 108 together.</P>
        <P>I am committed to the further expansion of bus services both in Dublin and nationally. In this context, Transport 21 provides for significant Exchequer investment in expanding bus services in the greater Dublin area and in other urban and rural areas outside Dublin. As regards the bus market in Dublin, as I have indicated to this House previously, I requested Dublin Bus to carry out a network review to examine the impact of recent investment in rail infrastructure and demographic changes and if the existing bus fleet was being utilised to maximum effect. The review is also a necessary first step in the new investment programme set out in Transport 21. I understand the company is currently finalising the review<?oasys _jy ?>and I expect to receive the completed report shortly.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, Dublin Bus has recently submitted an application for funding to me for additional fleet requirements, which has due regard to the emerging findings of the network review. I will make a decision on the number of buses to be provided in 2006 when my Department&rsquo;s assessment of the application has been completed. I understand Bus &Eacute;ireann is also finalising proposals for the expansion of its fleet and an application will be submitted to the Department shortly.</P>
        <P>I appointed Professor Margaret O&rsquo;Mahony of Trinity College Dublin, as chairperson of the Dublin Transport Authority establishment team, which will make recommendations to me regarding the structure, remit and responsibilities for the new authority. I will make my decision on the future regulation of the bus market throughout the country after Professor O&rsquo;Mahony&rsquo;s team has reported on the structure, remit and responsibilities of the Dublin Transport Authority and the Government has made its decisions in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it the Minister does not have a bus policy and is just thinking about one. I know Dublin Bus is carrying out a review. A review was undertaken in 2000, the Scott Wilson report, which recommended that by 2006, this year, Dublin Bus would need around 1,500 buses. Of course that was a gross under-estimation of requirements, but nevertheless it has nothing like that, with just over 1,000 buses today. That report was ignored. Even the 180 buses promised under the national development plan was ignored. Prior to that the Government had announced policy based on the Bacon report on the liberalisation of the bus market in Dublin. That was accepted as Government policy. Another report was commissioned at great expense to show how it might be done. That was accepted by Government and subsequently ignored. In view of the latest report from the Competition Authority recommending <Col N="1611"/>the liberalisation of the bus market in order to get rid of the inefficiencies that are endemic in the current system, which is not serving the public well, does the Minister intend to ignore this report as well or will he liberalise the bus market as announced several times as Government policy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The supplementary question asked by the Deputy is very different from that submitted, but I am happy to deal with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Mr. O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister a policy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course I have and she well knows the policy. It is set out for her benefit quite clearly in Transport 21.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Mr. O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not a mention of a bus in Transport 21.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Between the two of ye, every time ye get up and ask a question, ye want to keep going. Does the Deputy want me to answer the question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Never mind referring to us as &ldquo;ye&rdquo;. There is nothing about buses in Transport 21.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is in possession and should be allowed to answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy want me to answer the question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is nothing in Transport 21. The Minister should stick to the truth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy wants me to answer, I have no problem, but she might allow me the same respect I have given her in putting the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I can try to ignore that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not prepared to give to any agency under my aegis resources belonging to taxpayers without a basis and proper business plan for doing so. That is a reasonable position. Dublin Bus was made aware of this, as was Bus &Eacute;ireann. They accepted the challenge. They accept that they have a responsibility to make a business case to me based on the network review they are carrying out. They say this is almost finished and expect to submit it to me shortly. On 20 January, some days ago, my Department received an application from Dublin Bus for a substantial enhancement of its fleet in Dublin. It is based on projections in advance of its completion of the network review. We are looking at that application in anticipation of the network review.</P><Col N="1612"/>
        <P>The second point of the Deputy&rsquo;s question is about my view, which I have stated to Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann, unions and management. I want market opening in Dublin and around the country. I have no doubt about that. That is what I want to achieve. It is for the benefit of the customer and the commuter and we can have greatly enhanced capacity in terms of the delivery of the bus model as a transport mechanism both for Dublin and around the country. That must be part of the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting the Minister says, as regards buses, that he wants market opening. The public wants buses and it does not care who owns or operates them. If the Minister goes to Westmoreland Street this evening between 5 o&rsquo;clock and 7 o&rsquo;clock he will see hundreds of people being turned away from buses because they are full. That is happening on a daily basis. It is being repeated in the morning all over the city of Dublin.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Minister is changing the goalposts. He promised under the national development plan to provide a certain number of buses to Dublin Bus. He still owes them 180 buses before the end of this year, as the figures show. He has welched on that undertaking. The Government was supposed to provide funding for those extra buses and has failed to do that. The Minister has 11 months left to honour that commitment, if he intends to do so. Is the Minister aware that three new quality bus corridors have been created by Dublin Bus in the last year on which there are no buses? The road space has been provided, the white lines have been painted and the signs are up but there are no buses because the Minister continues to stall on this issue. He has failed to provide the additional buses that were promised.</P>
        <P>It is time to end the excuses. People are sick and tired of the fact that they cannot travel to work or move around the city because there are not enough buses to do so. When will the Minister deal with the immediate situation? It is all very well to have grand plans for the next 15 years but we need solutions now to Dublin&rsquo;s traffic gridlock. In the short term and for the foreseeable future, that solution must be bus-based. When will the Minister provide the buses?</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;so long as they are available. I have urged both Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann to send me the plans so I can release the buses. It would be irresponsible of me, or any Minister, simply to waste taxpayers&rsquo; money on no basis. The cost of the application that has arrived from Dublin Bus is &euro;120 million. The Labour Party Members speak every day about value for money in expenditure on health and education. Is it the Labour Party position on transport that there should be no value for money, that the buses should simply be provided and that we should have no business plans, no demonstrable use for the buses, no way of showing how they will be paid for and no way of considering what the subvention is for the buses?</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If Fine Gael and the Labour Party want value for money in every aspect of what the Government does, I agree with them. Do not, therefore, suggest in the House that I, as Minister for Transport, with no basis of a network review and without a business case should willy-nilly spend &euro;120 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money immediately. The Members are contradicting themselves and it is time it stopped. They have been getting away with it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It was.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister cannot count either. In 1998, the Government decided to liberalise the bus market. It is now 2006 and the Government has been in power consistently over that period. When will the bus market be liberalised? There are thousands of new communities consisting of newly married couples and new house owners. These communities have no buses; they are utterly bereft of any form of public transport. The first thing the people must do is buy a car and then the Minister wonders why there is congestion and why an outer ring road must be built. The reason is that these communities are bereft of services. The Minister has already spent &euro;117 million building bus lanes. Another &euro;40 million is to be spent this year but there are no buses, and no prospect of buses, to travel on them. When will the Minister liberalise the market?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure in what part of the country the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party live but since 1998 the liberalisation in the bus market in this country has been phenomenal. The number of private operators operating in the bus market has gone through the roof in that short period. Ask the customers. Private operators are running services from practically every part of Ireland today and from places where there was no service. They have brought tremendous competition to the market, lowered prices on the routes and forced the State bus companies to change their ways.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>They are frustrated at every turn by the Department and Dublin Bus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>They have expanded dramatically. The number of services available has had a huge impact in liberalising the market. An issue remains and that is the on-street delivery of bus services in Dublin, on which both Fine Gael and the Labour Party have diametrically opposed views. One party wants the market liberalised to allow private operators onto the bus market in Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Minister is using it as a cover to distract attention from the fact that he has not delivered the 180 buses which were promised to Dublin Bus under the national development plan. They are supposed to be in place at the end of this year. Furthermore, despite the huge demand for bus services throughout this city, the Minister has failed to provide a single extra bus for the Dublin Bus fleet since 2001.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true. We have provided hundreds of buses.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should not be disingenuous. There is a difference between a new bus and a replacement bus. There has been no net increase in capacity or in the number of buses in Dublin Bus since 2001. That is entirely down to the Minister. The reason people are squashed on buses or not allowed onto them and have no option but to take their car into the city centre is that the Minister has failed to provide the adequate number of buses that were promised. He has reneged on that promise.</P>

        <QRef>[3601/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of &euro;100 million will be available for investment in development and safety related infrastructure in regional airports, including Knock, under the Transport 21 framework. As well as the continuation of grant assistance for essential safety and security capital expenditure, all six regional airports will be eligible for targeted investment where demand for additional air services can be demonstrated and where an economic case can be made to justify increased investment. A new grant scheme is being devised and all regional airports will be consulted by my Department before the revised grant scheme is finalised. Apart from capital investment, the regional airports will continue to benefit from a range of non-capital support measures, such as operational grant assistance and public service obligation, PSO, air services.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department are working closely with the management at Ireland West Airport Knock and the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, to ascertain the precise scope of the infrastructure required to allow the airport to conform with all relevant safety standards as it develops into the future. Funding for runway safety improvements and enhanced navigational aids was provisionally approved under the national development plan in February 2005. Project specifications and costings in respect of the approved works are awaited from the airport. A final decision on the funding proposal cannot be made until the Department has an opportunity to consider the IAA approved specifications and thereby assess the relevant costings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his reply. The difficulty arises when we consider the money invested in the other international airports. Ireland West Airport Knock is Ireland&rsquo;s fourth international airport and has the third longest runway. Therefore, its potential is massive. If the Minister looks at the map I have he will see that, <Col N="1619"/>annually, 6 million people go through Northern Ireland airports, in the east and the south 25 million people go through the airports, but in the west only 500,000 go through them. This demonstrates unbalanced regional development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Knock airport would have great potential if it got some of the money that should have been given to it. If it got the Aer Rianta &euro;3 per passenger, it would have got between &euro;115 and &euro;190 million in the past decade. However, it got &euro;5 million. The Minister should consider the effect over the next three years of the &euro;29 million investment the airport requires. The airport could have Cat. 2 status. Even on the day we celebrated fire engines arriving at Ireland West Airport Knock, aircraft had difficulty arriving because of weather conditions &mdash; they cannot land in all weathers. The airport lacks Cat. 2 navigational status which would make a major difference and would allow Ireland West Airport Knock to compete with other airports, which it cannot do at the moment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The investment would allow an enlarged apron area. Aircraft and airbuses which can land at the airport cannot turn around quickly enough to suit the fast turnaround time their schedules require because of the lack of apron space. The airport also requires essential safety requirements and enlarged terminals. The airport has enormous potential because it serves 13 counties and is close to nine large urban centres or gateways.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister cannot give a decision now, but is he well disposed towards allowing balanced regional development to occur? There is a &euro;3.9 billion underspend in the BMW area. The population of the North is almost the same as that of the BMW area, yet 6 million people travel through Northern Ireland airports. People find it difficult to get in and out of Dublin, but &euro;150 million will be spent on another terminal and other facilities there. Will the Minister commit to this investment and does he believe in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to balanced regional development?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this question. I am hugely committed to the development of airports, in particular regional airports. That is the reason I believe we need to secure funding, as I did &mdash; over &euro;100 million &mdash; in Transport 21. The Minister for Finance is equally committed to regionalisation and our regional structures. We see airports as key to that.</P>
        <P>I am happy to fund the projects outlined by the Deputy. In February 2005, I approved the moneys and costings for what is required on the technical side. Unfortunately, I have not got back the final proposals from the airport, which is not my fault. I want to spend a substantial amount of capital moneys on further enhancement. Knock airport has a big future and local and business communities have been correct in identifying that. We will work on that.</P><Col N="1620"/>
        <P>I wish to point out something that applies to all the airports. Because of the consequences of issues that arose from the Ryanair case regarding subventions and moneys and grants to regional airports, the European Union has issued stringent new rules on state aids which make matters difficult with regard to how Governments put moneys into airports. That said, I am confident we will be able to support the regional airports in Knock, Waterford, Kerry etc. I want to do that. I strongly believe in the spatial strategy and the benefits regional airports bring economically into regions, from both the business and tourism perspective. This can and will be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>Previous investment into Ireland West Airport Knock has related to safety. In other airports to the south and east investment has gone towards expanding the existing aprons rather than towards safety and security. I understand what the Minister said with regard to the European Union. Surely, however, with the deficit of &euro;3.9 billion in the BMW area, with such an important catalyst and with such a low figure of only 500,000 passengers compared with 25 million in the south and east, there is a pressing case for Ireland West Airport Knock. Will the Minister put pressure on the European Union to ensure that the airport gets the money it deserves for balanced regional development?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am ready, willing and able on behalf of the Government to invest in Knock airport. There is no issue between us. However, I need Knock airport to start drawing down what has already been approved in 2005 so that we can move to the next stage. A number of proposals have come from Knock airport from different groups. We are trying to co-ordinate these and get to the key points of investment in the airport, and we will do so. That is the reason I secured a specific funding arrangement in Transport 21 for regional airports. That sum is &euro;100 million, which will have a substantial impact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that the developments I outlined are essential, the apron turning area and CAT.2 status, which will cut down diversions and allow aircraft to land?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not a technical expert, but in general these issues arise in regional airports. The more technical equipment on the capital side that we can put into an airport, the better the airport can function. That is what we want to do and I want to do that for Knock airport. There is no equivocation on Knock on my behalf.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Trans<Col N="1621"/>port</askee>
        <Quest>when the coast guard will move its headquarters to Drogheda; the number of positions and staff who will transfer; the arrangements being made for the Dublin marine rescue co-ordination centre; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[3134/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme the decentralisation implementation group has identified the transfer of the headquarters of the Irish Coast Guard and maritime safety directorate to Drogheda as a phase one project. The Office of Public Works is currently seeking a suitable site in Drogheda for the development with the objective of completing the move as quickly as possible. The decentralisation project will involve 47 posts composed of both coast guard and maritime safety directorate staff.</P>
        <P>Separately, a decision to transfer the services of the marine rescue co-ordination centre from Dublin was taken on foot of a study of the coast guard undertaken by independent consultants. Reflecting advances in modern communications technologies, the consultants recommended that the coast guard should operate two control centres as opposed to the three centres that exist at present. Communications technology today is such that the geographical location of the co-ordination centres is less important now than in the past.</P>
        <P>The intention is that the remaining two centres would be developed to handle all emergencies around our coast, including the Dublin and the east coast area, on inland waters and mountain, cliff and cave rescue. There would be no consequent reduction in the capability of the Irish Coast Guard to co-ordinate and manage incidents as a result of the relocation away from Dublin.</P>
        <P>In this context, coast guard management would address all issues relating to the operation of two control centres, including establishing the measures that would be necessary to effect a smooth transfer from Dublin while ensuring that full co-ordination capability is maintained at all times.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decided to transfer responsibility for maritime transport matters, including maritime safety and the coast guard, to the Department of Transport with effect from 1 January this year. In this context, and with a view to the closer integration of maritime transport functions into overall transport policy, I have asked my officials to review current and proposed arrangements for the delivery of maritime transport services, including marine rescue co-ordination, and to report back to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it from what the Minister has said that the plan is to scrap the proposal for the Dublin marine rescue centre and that services will just be provided from Valentia and Malin Head. It seems an extraordinary decision that there will be no service on the east coast where <Col N="1622"/>the bulk of activity on our seas takes place. The Minister had the option of going ahead with the Dublin centre as proposed or he could have moved the service to Drogheda. Is the Minister saying there will be no marine rescue service operating along the full length of the east coast?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are at cross-purposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The radio centre&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy referring to the Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. Will the centre not have two bases?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>No, but perhaps I conveyed that. I was saying it is a question of whether the centre in Dublin should be located at the big headquarters in Drogheda and whether we should marshal the centres in Valentia and Malin as two other centres. Rather than recommending having the Maritime Safety Directorate on its own in Drogheda, the review stated the big Dublin centre might be incorporated into it such that there would be one body in the same area. That would be based here and then one would consider the other two centres. That is how I understand the matter and I hope I have conveyed it correctly to the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The service is to go ahead in Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>No. The service exists in Dublin but when the decision was made to move the Maritime Safety Directorate to Drogheda, those involved also considered moving the centre in Dublin. A proposal, which has not been signed off, has been made to include the latter with the development in Drogheda as opposed to leaving it in Dublin. There would also be two outreach centres, in Valentia and Malin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the Minister said in his reply there would only be the two centres, at Malin and Valentia.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, because there are effectively three independent centres at present. If I put together the two headquarters, that is, the Dublin Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre and the Maritime Safety Directorate, this would effectively leave two independent centres elsewhere. However, these two independent centres would be under the auspices of the main centre in Drogheda. That is how I understand it and I hope I have stated it to the Deputy correctly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The staff in the Dublin centre are in limbo. Will they definitely be moving to Drogheda?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1623"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The final decision has not been taken. I have only received the information. The proposal was teased out and it was recommended that the centre in Dublin should move in that direction. However, it is not finalised and it has only come to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the Minister finalise it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to do so very quickly because the staff need clarity in terms of the decentralisation programme. The proposal has just been forwarded to me and, having gone through it very quickly, my sense of it is as I have outlined. If the Deputy tables a parliamentary question, I hope I will have reached a definitive position when making my response. I hope I have conveyed the position to the Deputy correctly but I have not immersed myself in the detail. I have outlined my grasp of the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>On emergency co-ordination, the plan was to close the Dublin centre and transfer the staff to Valentia. The reality is that there is no appetite among the staff to transfer there. It has been pointed out that it would be extremely dangerous to transfer the centre to Valentia given that the vast majority of emergency-related activities take place on the east coast. The connection between the men on the ground and those who co-ordinate rescue missions would be broken entirely. Whatever the plan is for Drogheda, it has absolutely nothing to do with the co-ordination of sea rescue. There are nuclear ships and other vessels passing along the east coast and this is where the demand is. I urge the Minister to re-examine the report. It stated two centres would be sufficient but it was never dreamt that the centre in Dublin, on the east coast, would be closed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have outlined to the Deputies my understanding of the issue. Frankly, am not convinced the matter has been thought through to the nth degree. If Deputy Olivia Mitchell tables a parliamentary question, I will tease out the matter with her. I would be a bit concerned if the entire east coast were not party to the new arrangement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what the Minister&rsquo;s reply said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;such that there would be a minimum of one on the east coast and one on the west coast.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be rational.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding was that the Maritime Safety Directorate in Drogheda would form part of that arrangement &mdash; maybe this is an assumption and I could be wrong.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1624"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what the Minister&rsquo;s reply said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may be correct but that is how I understand the matter. I promise I will return to the Deputy on the matter and try to give her a fuller answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister communicate directly with our offices in the next week to clarify the position?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I would appreciate that also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As soon as I know the position I will try to clarify that point. If the proposal is to have no centre on the east coast and two elsewhere, I would be concerned about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister will clarify his reply in the next few days.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 202, 206 and 265 together.</P>
        <P>The report on the outcome of the mid-term review of the national car testing service conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers for my Department was received in the Department at the end of October 2005. The Department is now in discussion with the National Car Testing Service with a view to implementing the recommendations contained in the report as soon as possible. The discussions are being conducted in accordance with the contract change procedures provided for in the project agreement between the Minister for Transport and the NCTS for the operation of the car testing service. While these <Col N="1625"/>discussions are ongoing, it would not be appropriate to outline the recommendations contained in the report. However, as soon as the discussions are concluded I will publish the report on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>I have already indicated in reply to Question No. 302 of 13 December 2005 that, as recommended in the report, it is the intention to establish a technical standards forum to consider and make recommendations on vehicle technical matters associated with the national car test. I will establish such a forum in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am quite disappointed to hear how the Minister intends to handle this issue from now on. The national car test has been an issue for some time and there is much public concern over its operation, including over the fact that 49% of cars fail their first test. One hears much anecdotal information and complaints from constituents that there is a lack of uniformity in the approach taken. It is believed that strange decisions are sometimes made in the testing procedures such that a car that fails under one tester would be passed by another without any work having to be done on the car. There is concern over quality standards.</P>
        <P>The review has been proceeding for some time and I do not understand why the Minister is not publishing the result. It will be up to him and others involved to decide how to implement recommendations but surely the public is entitled to know the outcome of the review of the national car testing service. Will the Minister publish the report prior to making any decisions on how he intends to proceed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not disagree fundamentally with the Deputy. The key sentence in my reply is, &ldquo;The discussions are being conducted in accordance with the contract change procedures&rdquo;. I am tied to the procedures, which were agreed previously, relating to how the changes are to be brought about. This is what the mid-term review report feeds into. I have said to the Deputy and give my word that I would like to publish the report as quickly as possible. I have allowed some space for the Department and the NCTS staff to discuss the contents of the report. I intend to bring the discussions to a conclusion as quickly as possible and I would like to circulate the report in the public domain. One should allow reasonable time for discussions between both parties to ensure they understand the issues. The public has a right to know what was recommended in the report. The report has been produced and it has been discussed by both parties as per the procedures agreed under the existing contract and I would like to see the discussions concluded and the report published.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Shortall. I am sure my office is no different to that of anybody else in terms of the <Col N="1626"/>number of complaints it receives about the national car test, particularly about the variation between centres. There is very high failure rate although the average age of cars is extremely low and falling all the time.</P>
        <P>The issue of non-nationals having accidents while driving cars registered abroad has come to national prominence in recent weeks. The Garda highlighted that there is no test for these cars to determine their quality and no certification as to whether they passed a road-worthiness test in their country of origin. I understand the authorities in Northern Ireland have dealt with this problem by introducing the equivalent of an national car test for cars entering that jurisdiction from other countries. Has the Minister made any inquiries into this? Is it possible for us to introduce a similar system to deal with the many cars coming into the State from abroad?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy raised a serious and important issue, of which I am well aware. I have heard much evidence about the context of how cars coming into the country are insured, the powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to impound cars and the issue which the Deputy rightly raises, namely, the quality testing standards to which these cars should be subject. I have initiated consideration of this issue, which I would like to bring to a speedy resolution.</P>
        <P>It is clear that due to the quality of the vehicles or the quality of the driving, or a combination of the two, the sad reality is that the number of foreign nationals &mdash; who are working in this country and welcome to do so &mdash; involved in fatal or near-fatal accidents has grown substantially in recent times. It behoves us from a legal perspective to ensure that the necessary laws are in place so the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other authorities can ensure that poor vehicles are not on the road and the Garda has the power to act against such vehicles. Insurance issues also need to be considered.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is bang on the money with regard to this issue. If all Irish drivers are subject to a high standard vehicle test, it is unconscionable that somebody from outside the country who comes to work here would have different criteria applied to him. That is unacceptable and bad for road safety.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree with the welcome comments made by Conor Faughnan with regard to the real concern that existed due to the comments from the National Safety Council about the incidence of accidents involving non-national drivers? Does he agree with Mr. Faughnan that it is premature to comment on this matter as the relevant statistics have not yet been produced? We must be careful not to add to the culture of concern in this country with regard to non-nationals by bringing road accidents into the picture and depicting non-nationals as having a higher incidence of accidents, when the evidence has not been produced <Col N="1627"/>and when we cannot, as Mr. Faughnan noted, point the finger at anyone in terms of drink culture. Will the Minister support those comments and express concern about the original comments and how they were reported?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I must be clear on this point. My concern is for everybody on the roads, irrespective of nationality. That is the position in which I find myself and I have no difficulty with it. I agree with the Deputy that I would not want to be seen to be picking on one sector or another. Deputy Olivia Mitchell raised a legitimate and important question in the context of the application of the NCT. No driver resident in this country should be outside the law applying to all who live here. That is not to point the finger; it is a legitimate point and simply an issue of law with regard to the process of how we develop our road safety and testing standards.</P>
        <P>I want to be clear that I replied in that context to Deputy Mitchell. It was a fair question which got a fair answer.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 126 together.</P>
        <P>Since the launch of Transport 21 in November last, I have received applications for two railway orders for Luas extensions to docklands and Cherrywood. The public inquiries for these projects, are expected to be completed by the summer and contracts awarded by the end of the year. The Cherrywood extension is expected to commence construction this year. An announcement on the preferred route for linking the red and green Luas lines in the city centre should be made later this month, while the public consultation on the route of metro north should also commence later this month.</P>
        <P>The first phase of the DART upgrade project has been completed on time and within the budget of &euro;176 million. Delivery of the 67 new intercity carriages for operation on the Dublin-Cork route will be complete later this year and they will be introduced into service gradually, allowing Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to provide a service every hour on the route by the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>The public inquiry for the Kildare route project began on 23 January and construction work on <Col N="1628"/>the project is expected to commence in 2006. I expect to receive, in the next few months, a railway order application in respect of the re-opening of the railway line between Glounthaune and Midleton. Other rail projects, expected to commence construction in 2006 are the new docklands railway station and the new intercity railcar depot at Portlaoise.</P>
        <P>With regard to buses, Dublin Bus recently submitted an application for funding to me for additional fleet requirements, taking account of the emerging findings of its bus network review, which is nearing completion. This is being examined in my Department at present. I understand Bus &Eacute;ireann is also finalising proposals for the expansion of its fleet and I expect an application from that company shortly.</P>
        <P>Three roads projects have opened to traffic since the launch of Transport 21. These are the N6 Kinnegad-Enfield bypass, N22 Gortatlea-Farranfore and N6 Loughrea bypass. Work has commenced on three further projects, namely, the N5 Charlestown bypass, M50 phase 1 and the N51 Navan inner relief road. During 2006, the NRA expects to complete 13 projects with a combined length of more than 82 kilometres and the major impact of Transport 21 will be felt this year with the commencement of work on 15 projects with a combined length of 334 kilometres. Deputies will appreciate the scaling up of delivery of the roads programme.</P>
        <P>With regard to costs, I have stated previously that I do not consider it prudent to release commercially sensitive information on the cost of individual projects within Transport 21 until the public procurement processes are complete. I must maintain that position in the interests of protecting the taxpayer and ensuring Transport 21 is achieved within its budget of &euro;34 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that the two Luas lines to which the Minister referred, the link between the A and B lines and the B1 line, were well advanced long before Transport 21 was thought up, as were all of the projects mentioned. My concern centres on the projects which have not yet commenced but which have completion dates as part of Transport 21 that are looking increasingly unrealistic. For example, the first phase of the metro between Clondalkin and Tallaght is to be operational in four years&rsquo; time and the full north-south metro link to the city centre, the airport and beyond that to Swords is scheduled to be operational in six years&rsquo; time. The Minister would need to order the trams now to have them delivered in six years. Is it realistic to expect to have that project completed in time? If it is his intention to do so, what has happened to make it happen? Have the project teams been assembled? Is anybody driving the projects forward?</P>
        <P>The Minister announced the setting up of the Dublin Transport Authority and the appointment of Professor O&rsquo;Mahony as its head. However, the <Col N="1629"/>Minister had no thoughts on what the job entailed but instead asked Professor O&rsquo;Mahony to come back in a few months and explain to him what it entails. Is Professor O&rsquo;Mahony the person who is supposed to drive all of these projects? Is it realistic to expect them to be completed within the timescale outlined in Transport 21?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s opening remarks were correct in that many of these projects had been in planning. There was no certainty of any of them going ahead. Transport 21 provided immediate funding to get the projects up and running, which is what has happened. Later this month the public consultation on the metro north route will commence, which is quick progress. In terms of the framework scheduling in my Department, which I released in broad terms into the public domain, we are well on schedule or ahead of schedule.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>We will quote the Minister on that in ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>We will see him in 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputies want to tell me we are behind schedule, they should point out where we are behind. We are not behind.</P>
        <P>With regard to the ordering of rolling stock, last year we placed huge orders for intercity carriages for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, which will be delivered in 18 months. We do not need six years to place orders. Moreover, we want to get the most modern equipment available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister anticipate the tunnel being completed in six years given that is has not yet gone to public consultation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Major international tunnelling projects have been completed well within that timeframe. I have no doubt it is possible to do this. My expectation is that we will deliver it. I do not, however, underestimate the complexity of delivering the projects. One of the major tasks assigned to Dr. Margaret O&rsquo;Mahony was identifying a key person with the necessary hands-on project experience, particularly in the area of tunnelling, to head the Dublin Transport Authority. Very few people around the world have this experience. I have spoken with individuals from the UK, US and elsewhere about this type of experience and capacity. Deputies are aware that I visited the UK to understand the scale behind the development of terminal five at Heathrow Airport. This project is akin to, but of a lesser scale than, the two major tunnelling projects in Dublin &mdash; the metro and the intercity connector. Connecting the stations involved is a significant project.</P>
        <P>We examined the matter in detail before Transport 21 was published and there is no doubt we can accomplish it. We have learned lessons <Col N="1630"/>from our earlier projects. The roads programme is indicative of the scale of delivery on budget and well ahead of time. I would be more than satisfied if&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Transport 21 contains a &euro;32 billion envelope. The Taoiseach clearly wishes to see an additional project introduced as, at a crucial time in planning, he is talking about the need for an outer orbital motorway for Dublin, which is yet another motorway. How does this work within Transport 21? Will the Taoiseach automatically get his way? Will we be forced to drop another project and will the Minister be forced to ask the Minister for Finance for additional funding for the outer orbital motorway? Alternatively, is the Taoiseach simply trying to distract attention from the central issue? I agree with the Minister that we need tolls to manage congestion on the M50 but is the Taoiseach unwilling to address this political reality and, therefore, distracting us by discussing other outer orbital roads, which were not included in Transport 21? What will happen with regard to that outer orbital motorway?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Taoiseach with regard to the outer orbital motorway. I have quite strong views on the matter. We also agree on the need for significant investment in public transport in Dublin. There is no question about the need for this investment, which is a significant element in the way we resolve many of the issues. Such an investment would persuade people to leave their cars at home by giving them an alternative to motor transport in the form of good quality public transport systems. We can accomplish this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is dealing with the matter at a late stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We may be late in doing so but does this mean we should abandon it? Whatever about the sins of the past, we should not make the same mistakes going forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Where will the money for the outer orbital motorway come from?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The outer orbital motorway is included in Transport 21.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>No, it is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy wish me to answer his question? It is clearly stated in Transport 21 that we need an immediate study on where the route is to be, its impact, its interaction with other roads and its impact on the M50. This study has commenced. Once this study is completed, there are a myriad of funding mechanisms which could be put in place. We must first establish the location of the outer orbital motorway, its length and its route. Having decided this, we must examine its impact on other traffic in Dublin. We need to know about this so we do not build the wrong road.</P>

	<P>I apologise to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, although the question was mine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>My question concerns the proposed metro to Dublin Airport and Swords. In the Minister&rsquo;s plan, the completion date is 2012 and we have been informed that it will take a minimum of seven years to construct. By any reckoning, we are behind schedule. I understand the metro&rsquo;s route had already been agreed and that the RPA was working on proposals for a route from O&rsquo;Connell Street, taking in the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, the National Botanic Gardens, Dublin City University, Ballymun, Dublin Airport and Swords. Work is underway on planning this route. The Minister appears to be suggesting that alternative routes could be examined and I understand he is inviting tenders today for some geotechnical testing on three different routes. Will the metro take the original route?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct in stating that metro north is one of the most advanced projects. A considerable amount of work has been carried out on this project. We are not starting with a blank piece of paper on this route. A considerable portion of the route has already been decided. It is quite clear how one gets from Dublin Airport to Swords as the local authority has preserved this route.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister stick with the route I mentioned?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. I am not involved in day-to-day technical operations but there have been discussions with the local authority and the county manager told me the instruction is to ensure the route identified by the authority, which is overground, will not be touched. I have no reason to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>In his reply, the Minister spoke about examining three different routes, public <Col N="1633"/>consultation and route selection. What did he mean by this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>All I said was the public consultation on the route for metro north will commence later this month.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Will there be any deviation from this route?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody has told me that the route has been changed. If one examines the section of the line from Dublin Airport to Swords, the route is obvious and speaks for itself. As far as I am aware, the local authority has preserved this route for metro north. I hope it brings maximum additionality to the route but the Deputy is correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the D&aacute;il suspended, we debated the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposal that there should be a 40% quota for both men and women, respectively, in the new super quango, with the balance to be chosen by the parties to the body in whatever fashion they choose. The Minister of State spoke about the difficulty involved in persuading various bodies to adopt a quota. Deputy Boyle spoke about his experience as a member of the National Economic and Social Council. Neither IBEC nor the farmers&rsquo; organisations had women representatives and 20% of trade unions were women representatives. In the voluntary and NGO sectors, about 60% were women representatives.</P>
      <P>It is absurd if the major bodies representing industry and farming are allowed to have no women representatives at these ongoing discussions. As far as I know, there are thousands of women very actively involved in farming, and many women are also involved in business. The trade union record of women representation is somewhat better but not by much. The Government, with this legislation, should not pander to the failure of these bodies to provide for the inclusion of women. It is not good enough. The Government spends a vast amount of money on this structure and all these bodies have signed up to lengthy reports, with significant participation by women. However, the Government, through legislation, allows these bodies a free hand to completely exclude women.</P>
      <P>At this time, it should not be necessary to make this type of comment. Part of the reason there is no sense of urgency on the part of the Government or the Taoiseach, who is sponsoring this Bill, is perhaps that there are so few women representing Fianna F&aacute;il in this House. The Taoiseach is concerned with social inclusion, which is fine as long as women are included. I do not accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s explanation of why he is not prepared to insist on appropriate, adequate and serious representation of women, on a par with men, in a consultative body. As <Col N="1635"/>the Minister of State stated, this body produces reports on everything from child care to migration to housing and women&rsquo;s participation in the life of this country.</P>

	<P>In discussing the issue earlier I outlined that in the debate on Committee Stage, I gave an undertaking that the Taoiseach would write to the various bodies. I share Deputy Burton&rsquo;s sentiments on the matter. However, this is the only practical way to tackle the issue.</P>
      <P>I accept that some bodies have unfortunately sent forward male representatives in more cases than they should have. That has been my experience in other Ministries, in particular when I was Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I made every effort, as did many of my colleagues, to have a gender balance, but in some cases nominating bodies did not fulfil the wish of the Minister of the day.</P>
      <P>I understand that some of the bodies have performed well in this area, such as the National Economic and Social Forum, which has 44% representation by women. As a result of constraints and the number of nominating bodies, I cannot concede on this issue. I will raise the matter with the Taoiseach again and the aforementioned letter has been issued. I hope the bodies will respond positively.</P>

      <P FLI="0">It is constitutionally dubious for the head of Government, the Taoiseach, to require by legis<Col N="1636"/>lation the consent of his own Ministers to take action in pursuit of a specific statutory power. There are detailed discussions on this in the standard reference book, <i>J. M. Kelly, The Irish Constitution</i>.

      <P LI="1">In page 21, lines 26 to 28, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; in line 26 down to and including &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; in line 28 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;shall lay a strategic plan which has been approved by him or her under <i>subsection (1)</i> before the Houses of the Oireachtas, to debate the contents and to vote upon its implementation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">In keeping with previous debates on Report Stage, this amendment is an attempt to engage the D&aacute;il in the general, but not specific, workings of the organisations referred to in this Bill. It would help in terms of engagement and greater public knowledge of the work these bodies carry out if there was general debate on the work programme of each of the bodies on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>In an earlier reply, the Minister of State was reluctant to discuss specific reports and having such reports voted on in this Chamber. I fully accept that these are advisory reports to the Government, but they help to inform general political debate. For example, NESC is a body that produces concepts that are generally not discussed in normal political debate as they are ideas that carry a political consequence. This body first raised the prospect, still unrealised within our fiscal system, of the possibility and effectiveness of taxes on energy and property. For various political reasons, political parties in this House would evade these ideas during normal discourse.</P>
      <P>If the strategic plan referred to in the Bill was to be laid before the House and subject to a regular debate, the plan would build upon the previous experience of bodies such as NESC, NESF and the National Centre for Partnership and Per<Col N="1637"/>formance. It would detail how it intends to build on such work in future.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>This is particularly important with regard to NESC. Every five years or so this body produces a major report or strategic document. When I was a member of NESC, it was entitled Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Choice. The body has recently released a similar document. These are major documents that inform the partnership process and the talks to secure future partnership agreements. We should, in line with the previous amendment tabled by Deputy Bruton, debate regularly in the House what these organisations intend to do and how they intend to do it. In the course of such a debate we should refer to the reports they have issued as part of their general workload. I hope the Minister looks on this amendment favourably, on the basis that the debate itself is important. I am open to suggestion on the second element of what I propose, namely, that a strategic plan be voted on in the House. I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment, though the Oireachtas is settling for half a loaf rather than nothing at all. Deputy Boyle&rsquo;s proposal is very solid because it would give us the opportunity to debate the NESC strategy and the present one is worthy of study and debate.</P>
      <P>These bodies are essentially ingredients of social partnership but the key activity is the agreement hammered out in negotiations. It is important to hear from the research bodies that advise the social partners. Some have executive roles but they are primarily research and study bodies. The key is to go beyond that and learn how they and their findings influence policy. While Deputy Boyle&rsquo;s recommendation would ensure the D&aacute;il would at least be active in the debate, the D&aacute;il needs to be active further up the pipeline to shape the way discussion at partnership level focuses on the issues.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to support the amendment but regard it as second best to our having a real role in the making of policy in that we will only debate matters relating to these research bodies. Consistent with what the Minister of State said this morning about his desire to facilitate the House, I am sure he will accept Deputy Boyle&rsquo;s amendment which puts into legal form what the Minister of State said he would be happy to support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Boyle&rsquo;s amendment. Will the Minister of State say what will be the position of the new body under the Freedom of Information Act 1997? It is critical that the reports and research material of these bodies are freely accessible.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to summary reports and the amendment in the name of the Taoiseach mentions reporting to a relevant Oireachtas committee. The Freedom of Information Act 1997 is mentioned and I hope these bodies will come <Col N="1638"/>under its ambit because that represents the only way to gain access to such material.</P>
      <P>What are the chances of Opposition Deputies accessing this information if, for example, under the revisions in the Freedom of Information Act 1997, reports of such bodies are deemed to be deliberations on ongoing Government policy? As Deputy Bruton said, the work of the NESC is primarily to produce research papers and documentation. We can get reports on how many times the bodies met etc. &mdash; somebody might be interested in that though I am not &mdash; but the House will want to access the documentation and the information on which the reports to be made by this super body are compiled. There has been a huge row-back on the part of Government on how much information we can access under freedom of information, on top of the fact that it has imposed severe costs for that access. If social partnership is not fully subject to freedom of information it would be a sorry comment on the notion that this Government was open to giving information to the public about bodies its tax is paying for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take Deputy Burton&rsquo;s question first. She will see that section 36 brings this matter under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 so people will be entitled to information subject to the normal conditions.</P>
      <P>We are grouping amendments Nos. 23 and 24 but, if it is in order, I will refer to a discussion with Deputy Bruton on an amendment he tabled on Committee Stage, following which I have come forward with amendment No. 24. It was proposed that the officers in each body should submit a report of progress on its strategic plan to the relevant Oireachtas committee each year and make themselves available to present it to the committee for examination. In the course of Committee Stage debate on this section it was agreed that the progress report on strategic plans would be presented to the Taoiseach before submission to the relevant committee. I am trying to encompass the views of the committee in putting this amendment forward.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Boyle for his comments and his amendment. My initial advice was not to accept it because we incorporated his proposals into our amendment but it is acceptable if he agrees to end with the word &ldquo;contents&rdquo;. The section would then read: &ldquo;The Taoiseach shall lay a strategic plan which has been approved by him or her under <i>subsection (1)</i> before the Houses of the Oireachtas, to debate the contents&rdquo;. Deputy Boyle has acknowledged there would be an objection from me if we had to go into the area of voting on implementation. If we can agree the matter in the House I will accept Deputy Boyle&rsquo;s amendment subject to it concluding with the words &ldquo;the contents&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for giving consideration to this matter. I <Col N="1639"/>would be happy to remove the final clause but the last phrase should be &ldquo;its contents&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;the contents&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 22, to delete lines 4 to 10.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This section allows the Taoiseach, after consultation with the office of any relevant Minister, to dissolve any of the bodies in question. Later, in the transitional provisions, it provides for the dissolution of the bodies on establishment day. It seems odd the Government will have the power to dissolve the social partnership bodies established by the Bill without debate. I am sure this Bill was given its latest outing as a consequence of the commencement of the social partnership talks but I do not know what discussions have <Col N="1640"/>been conducted with the partners on the abolition of the bodies. Of course, we do not know whether the establishment day will be many moons hence or quite soon. Perhaps the Minister of State would care to comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>This could refer to existing bodies or to newly established ones. It depends on the Deputy&rsquo;s opinion of this motion and the motivation for the Taoiseach of the day in abolishing a body. It is entirely appropriate that a Taoiseach has the right to dissolve a body where circumstances alter its role or agreement to this effect is reached in the context of social partnership.</P>
      <P>As the bodies will have a statutory basis following the enactment of the Bill, there is need for a section which would facilitate their dissolution because they would otherwise exist indefinitely. It is, again, a legal point in terms of the statutory nature of these bodies and we have to provide for it. Any proposal to dissolve a body will require the approval of the Oireachtas. If we do not make this provision, a body that, for example, became unnecessary could continue indefinitely. It is a reasonable proposal and I hope my explanation clarifies the matter.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill does not contain any practical proposals to tackle the enormous market power of large multiples nor any effective mechanisms to prevent them from abusing that power. If this legislation is enacted in its current form, it <Col N="1641"/>will lead to less choice for Irish consumers, greater consolidation of the market place and, ultimately, fewer Irish food products. The Bill will not provide any safeguards to ensure fair play in the food market and will give the largest retailers a legislative basis on which to squeeze out competitors without fear or sanction. They will be able to use every means at their disposal, including predatory pricing, demands for hello money and the abuse of credit terms or imposition of unfair contract terms on suppliers. If the Minister wants to ensure consumers benefit from cheaper prices, greater choice and competition in retailing, he needs to put real and meaningful controls in place to prevent unfair play in the food sector and to ensure meaningful competition in retailing.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill because, when the Minister decided to remove the 1997 groceries order and to strengthen the Competition Act, he originally intended to push the proposals through the Seanad and the D&aacute;il but was threatened with revolt by the Opposition. The Bill has now passed through the Seanad but, during the debate, the Minister refused to accept any amendments. He reiterated his claim that predatory pricing is already covered by the Competition Act and does not merit further mention. He also maintained that the order is no longer needed. I agree that free trade and competition is important but predatory pricing could easily be incorporated into this legislation without restricting the market.</P>
      <P>The seeds of Ireland&rsquo;s booming economy were sown by the rainbow Government and we currently have full employment, a GDP growth of twice the EU average and interest rates at a 50 year low. We are spending more money than ever and people in many areas are experiencing a fantastic quality of life. However, while the phrase &ldquo;rip-off Republic&rdquo; is regularly referred to, we have instead a rip-off Government.</P>
      <P>We are looking in the wrong place for an explanation for the higher prices in Ireland compared to anywhere else. This week, it was reported that Dublin is one of the most expensive capital cities in Europe. That is one reason for the high cost of doing business here. We need to look at the facts, put aside flawed analyses and hold a serious and balanced debate on why prices in Ireland are higher than elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Small businesses are no different from any other consumer group. They too can feel pressure or go under. The reality is that, to survive, small businesses have to put the consumer first because the customer is the bottom line and backbone of any successful company. The boom in the economy was driven by small companies with fewer than ten staff. The definition of SME in this country differs from anywhere else in Europe, yet there is little or no support for service or manufacturing companies with fewer than ten employees. That is a major mistake because large oaks grow from small acorns. The small compan<Col N="1642"/>ies that drove this economy not only work 40-hour weeks but also 40-hour weekends.</P>
      <P>A company operating in the trading sector of the economy has no opportunity to increase prices because the market and competitors will not allow it to do so. This is evident in figures which reveal a 12% decrease in factory gate prices and the loss of 38,000 Irish manufacturing jobs since 2002 and is a result of this high cost economy. People can go to Mexico or European countries with lower business costs. The high costs here are driven by the economy and by indirect taxation but the Government has the ability to drive down those costs. Consumers pay higher prices where there is inadequate competition within the regulated services sector. Sectors of the economy which are self-regulated have seen prices rise faster than inflation. This occurs mainly in State monopolies. The entire economy must be subjected to the same level of competition to provide a level playing field.</P>
      <P>It is often forgotten that price increases by Irish business do not necessarily mean profit increases. Irish businesses are also vulnerable to cost increases, which are reflected in prices. The reality is that most of the price increases borne by businesses and consumers in Ireland are direct results of Government and public sector utilities. We need to compare like with like. Prices are different in Spain and Portugal because the costs there are lower. Irish wage costs are 134% of the EU average and our VAT rate is 4% higher.</P>
      <P>Irish businesses now pay energy costs that are 25% higher than the EU average and 41% higher than those in the UK, including Northern Ireland. These costs are controlled by the Government and ultimately the customer pays. These are the stacked-up costs that affect profitability. Water and waste charges have increased by 31% over the past two years while rents have increased by 22%. Insurance and distribution costs are also way above the EU average. The list goes on.</P>
      <P>As someone involved in the retail sector, I do not want protection from my competitors but I want a fair chance to compete. Small retailers do not need different rules or interference in the marketplace but neither do they need the bureaucracy, the stacked-up costs and the excessive regulation. While some regulation is welcome, much of it is not needed. I do not think it is right that some of the larger competitors can avail of a regulatory environment that effectively copperfastens their enormous scale and significant market power.</P>
      <P>I have first-hand knowledge of some of the practices that are banned under the groceries order and which the Minister is purporting to outlaw in this legislation. It is time that he and his officials recognised that large retailers are not charitable institutions. They increasingly put pressure on suppliers to extract terms that are often unfair and disproportionate. It is important that the rebates and LTAs are passed on at the end of the year. While I fully agree with the abol<Col N="1643"/>ition of the 1987 groceries order, it is important that we pay attention to LTAs and the other benefits enjoyed by the large multiples, particularly when we look at the scale of some of them.</P>
      <P>The top four multiples in the UK operate in forecourts and small stores and sell newspapers, groceries and much more, but in some small towns in Britain there are no retail outlets. This is not just about the development and retention of small grocery stores but also about retail distribution and the life and soul of towns and villages. This issue is especially important in light of the suburban development throughout this country, with thousands of houses being built every year. In that context it is very important that a local retail culture is promoted and encouraged to avoid traffic congestion such as that which will occur on the M50 with the Ikea development. The new cathedrals of this country are the shopping centres, which are full on Sundays, with people driving 50 or 60 miles to get to them.</P>
      <P>When one looks at the level of development throughout this country, one should bear in mind the example of the UK. Small retailers do not want a form of protectionism, but they are concerned with equality of access for customers in small villages and towns. With regard to the provision of comparable services, companies such as Musgraves, BWG Foods and similar groups are well able to compete with the multiples on terms, merchandise and price but they cannot compete with unfairness or predatory pricing.</P>
      <P>Some multiples with enormous buying power run a promotional offer in only two stores, even though they have 100 outlets. For the sake of fairness, they should be obliged by law to run such offers in every store for the same period. There should also be no restriction on such offers, where a customer can buy only two products, for example. If a customer wishes to buy ten products, he or she should be allowed to do so. The multiples&rsquo; practice of allowing only two items per customer on a promotion is predatory pricing. It is a way of attracting customers with lead-in pricing and minimising risk. I am amazed that the Minister has not taken this issue on board. We must remember that the retail space per head of population in Ireland is nine times greater than in the UK.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the practice of demanding so-called hello money and of the abuse of credit terms and the devastating impact these can have on cash flow and investment by food companies. I am alarmed that the Minister, in this legislation, is only introducing an equivocal ban on the demanding of hello money and the imposition of unfair contract terms while expressly omitting any provision to deal with the abuse of credit terms. The legislative provisions categorise such unfair practices as misdemeanours, which renders enforcement very difficult.</P>
      <P>It is inconceivable that any supplier would initiate legal proceedings against a retailer to seek <Col N="1644"/>redress. It would be commercial suicide for any food supplier to sue a retailer, even if the process were more straightforward than that provided for in this Bill. This is why an impartial referee is so important for the effective implementation of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Sadly, I do not share the Minister&rsquo;s belief that the Competition Authority can deliver the goods for consumers or act as an arbiter of competition in this sector. When I was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Competition Authority appeared before that committee to discuss its work progress. It was a sad, disappointing and uninspiring performance by the authority, which indicated that it had a very low expectation of its work output and a very strange set of investigative priorities. In fact, the authority had done little or no work at that point. There seemed to be an unwillingness to tackle large problems within the economy but a preparedness to go for softer targets. The authority was unable to take on the big guns but could deal with the small fry. The Minister&rsquo;s confidence in the Competition Authority is misplaced. Such confidence should be earned rather than given without question.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the Minister has not made any provision to deal with unfair trading practices by larger companies in the retail grocery sector. The Competition Act does not provide an effective mechanism to deal with such abuses. It requires a finding of dominance at either national or local level, which can be difficult to secure. Without effective controls over abusive behaviour by non-dominant multiples, significant damage will be inflicted on the indigenous retailing sector. Ultimately we will see less competition, employment and investment in the retail sector.</P>
      <P>The primary effect of this Bill will be to consolidate the retail grocery trade, to make the big players even bigger, to reduce the choice of retailers and to impact negatively on the food industry. The Minister needs to face up to this before he blindly walks us into more difficulties.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the operation of the provisions of this Bill and also about the fact that it only applies to food and drink and excludes household and personal hygiene products. The groceries order applied to food, alcohol and household necessities, but now a swathe of products formerly covered by the order can be subject to unfair trading practices without recourse to the new protection offered by the legislation. The Bill contains no provision to deal with predatory pricing. The Minister has argued that predatory pricing is adequately dealt with under existing competition law but I dispute that. It is very disappointing that he has not acted on that issue.</P>
      <P>The Bill outlaws resale, price maintenance, the demanding of hello money and the imposition of unfair contract terms, but only for goods covered by the legislation and only if it can be shown that these practices reduce competition in the State. In other words, the legislation does not impose <Col N="1645"/>an outright ban on such practices. Furthermore, the Bill does not treat engagement in such practices as criminal offences, contrary to every other prohibition within the Competition Act. It effectively treats these practices as misdemeanours that will not attract any criminal sanction. No one will be fined or imprisoned for breaching the provisions of the Bill when it is enacted and that is a major deficit.</P>
      <P>The removal of the 1987 groceries order was a good thing. It served the retailing sector effectively but the grocery sector has changed with the huge growth in the economy. The experience in Britain, where the four main players are totally dominant, is that very few retailers are second generation traders. It is important that the Minister realises that the retailing sector in Ireland is not afraid of competition but it wants fair terms by which people can compete. We do not want a monopoly within the State. Up to 70% of the market in Ireland is controlled by three main players and the Minister must strive to increase this number in the coming years. The alternative would be regretted by the small communities that have invested in and been served by economic growth in the retailing sector.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this Bill while being sensitive to and saddened by the fact that I do so on a day when we mourn a former Deupty for the Tallaght area, Ruair&iacute; Brugha.</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the debate and I have heard supermarkets mentioned repeatedly. The presence of Deputy Finian McGrath reminds me that if it were not for Tesco, Down&rsquo;s Syndrome Ireland would not have done so well from the sales of more than 3,000 CDs that the Deputy managed to sell before Christmas. When I got into my car this morning, I played &ldquo;Bad, Bad Leroy Brown&rdquo; all the way in from Tallaght. It shows that supermarkets have their uses. Tesco outlets all sold that CD on behalf of Down&rsquo;s Syndrome Ireland and I compliment all concerned. I look forward to hearing Deputy Finian McGrath&rsquo;s plans for his recording career.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I always try to bring my own experience to D&aacute;il debates. I have a background in the grocery trade. My first job after I left school was in a grocery shop in London. When I came home, I got a job with Carton Brothers, an old Irish company with connections to Carrickmacross, in Halston Street where it had a cash and carry. After that I progressed to another company, Lee and Company, which held the Mace franchise. There were at least two Mace shops in Carrickmacross so the Ceann Comhairle will be aware of my experience. Over the years I always took an interest in the grocery trade. Had I not been working in Lee and Company in 1969, I would not have moved to Tallaght and would <Col N="1646"/>not live there now. God only knows what I would be doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy would have been an MP, like George Galloway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I moved to Tallaght with an employer in 1969 and got involved in the community. Unlike some colleagues, I did not sit at my school desk saying I wanted to be a Deputy. That was never in my plans. All I wanted to do was succeed in the grocery trade. Life turns in all sorts of directions, although I have not been offered a record contract yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has a safe seat, unlike me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a safe seat. The Deputy should not put that about. I say that about my former career because I have concerns about this business, not only from my background but also because over the years I have tried to support in my own small way the neighbourhood shop.</P>
      <P>Tallaght is now the third largest population centre in the country and is dominated by the Square, which opened 15 years ago and which has attracted more than 130 shops and several department stores. Tallaght is a mixed area. In 1990, when we were preparing for the opening of the Square, many people said the neighbourhood shops would not survive and would close within months. Now, in 2006, the local community in Springfield is served by numerous local shops. There must be a balance in this business.</P>
      <P>There are mixed views on this, something we should encourage in a democracy. I hope to attend the briefing on this Bill by executives from RGDATA tomorrow morning because it is important that we listen to what people are saying. We have received correspondence from RGDATA, which does a good job of representing small grocers, and it is concerned about the repercussions of this Bill for the trade and consumers.</P>
      <P>The Minister should try to strike a balance. The consumer is important and prices should be controlled. I know of the concerns about competition and prices, we all listen to our constituents talking about them. Deputy Perry made the point that the economy is growing and people are working but there is always a need for the Government to keep an eye on prices and to ensure people get value for money.</P>
      <P>I note the provisions in the Bill to prevent unfair trading. Considerable media attention has been paid to this subject and not all of it has been well informed. It is easier to make allegations than to sustain them and there is always an audience for those who play to the gallery. It is good to note that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been working progressively in the area of unfair trading, updating legislation <Col N="1647"/>soon after it is enacted to reflect the rapidly changing circumstances in every sector, not just the grocery trade, in a period of rapid economic development.</P>
      <P>I am accused of praising Ministers but I am not afraid to do that. They do their jobs well. Deputy Martin is a good Cork person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Are the rest of us bad Cork people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is a good man who visits Tallaght occasionally. He helps create an awareness of the area&rsquo;s requirements and promotes the need for more jobs.</P>
      <P>After Dublin and Cork, Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the State. Given the area&rsquo;s young population, with 25,000 young people still at school, we need to continue to apply pressure for further job creation, as I have done for the past three and a half years and intend to do in a positive manner in the 500 days leading up to the next general election. I hope the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, as he travels from county to county, including Cork on occasion, will remember the many needs of Dublin South-West.</P>
      <P>I remind Deputies that my constituency also includes Firhouse, Greenhills, Templeogue and Brittas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Finian McGrath always mentions every street in Marino and Fairview. I merely do my best to emulate him and other greats in terms of promoting my area. I am positive about Tallaght and if Deputies wish to visit it, they should jump on the Luas and I will show them the 20 cranes at work in the town centre. It is a positive place and long may that continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy return to the debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>If my comments were not part of the debate, the Ceann Comhairle would correct me. I must be within the parameters of parliamentary debate if the Ceann Comhairle is satisfied.</P>
      <P>I welcome the focus in the legislation on areas such as resale, price maintenance and practices such as compelling other parties to pay advertising allowances and providing what was described yesterday as hello money. All repellent, anti-competitive practices engaged in by those concerned with maximising their profits demonstrate a complete indifference to the effect such practices have on the retail customer.</P><Col N="1648"/>
      <P>I am pleased to note the Bill gives aggrieved persons and the Competition Authority a similar right to take an action against would-be rip-off merchants, either in the Circuit Court or High Court. Also welcome is the removal of a number of limitations on the functions of the Competition Authority connected to its right to pursue in the courts those engaged in anti-competitive practices. As is evident from the Bill, some of the anti-competitive practices to which I referred have been the subject of statutory orders in the past. It is good they are being addressed in this legislation to amend the Competition Act 2002. The Bill is welcome as it will undoubtedly work towards removing anti-competitive practices which work against customers at the supermarket check-out and grocery shop counter.</P>
      <P>We are all committed to ensuring citizens continue to take an interest in the business of the Houses and I make a small contribution in this regard. Wiser colleagues have advised me to ensure groups, organisations and schoolchildren from our constituencies visit the Houses as often as possible. I note it is quiet in the Visitors Gallery today, which is fine. Perhaps I should not repeat the words of my constituency colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, who once stated that those who watch &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; are either insomniacs or have taken a couple of drinks. The Deputy&rsquo;s remarks may be half accurate. Unfortunately, the image projected of the House sometimes is that no work is done here and Members are largely absent. I hope Deputies will continue to make an effort in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is important that members of the public are aware of what is said and done in the House. This legislation has generated considerable public interest. It will impact on people&rsquo;s pockets on a daily basis given that every family spends some time each week shopping. People will follow this debate and will come to regard this important legislation as a step in the right direction. A certain amount of tweaking of it may still be necessary and new measures may need to be introduced.</P>
      <P>I was brave enough to express some concern about the legislation arising from my background in the grocery trade and the responses I have heard from people who used to work with me. The Minister&rsquo;s role is to exercise vigilance about prices. This Bill will affect prices. In a colourful contribution yesterday, one of my colleagues described how people are lured into supermarkets by the prospect of items being given away only to be ripped off on the price of other items. I hope the Department will be vigilant about such practices. Ultimately, the priority must be to ensure consumers reap benefits and enjoy value for money.</P>
      <P>It is universally accepted that the economy is in good shape, people have work opportunities they did not have in the past and the requirements of young people seeking jobs are being met. Moreover, unlike many Irish people in the <Col N="1649"/>past, including me and members of my family, we no longer need to emigrate. We must ensure economic progress continues and people get value for money. In this context, I am not afraid to criticise when criticism is necessary. Constituents of mine and visitors to the country complain that while Ireland has made significant progress, it has become a different place and one is ripped off in restaurants and other businesses. The focus of the legislation is on the grocery trade but it is also necessary to examine these wider issues. We must ensure people continue to benefit from the progress which will, I hope, be sustained as a result of another partnership deal.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate and I intend to listen to many more contributions. The Minister and Minister of State are on the right track, although it may be necessary to tweak the legislation. As always, a debate will be necessary as people voice their views on the Bill but it will secure broad support. I hope the Minister will ensure it is properly implemented and prevent businesses from running amok with prices in order that the public will come to regard it as progressive legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Small shops are being wiped out by big business, which has the ear of Government. Recently at the Galway Races big businesses went into the tents and got their way because the Minister gave in as he did a long time ago. Dunnes and Tesco control most of the market now. Not long ago we had no Sunday shopping. Now we have shopping seven days a week and 24 hours a day. People used to say England was a pagan country. In England there is respect for Sunday as a day for religion or family. Small businesses will be badly affected by this Competition Bill. While I want to see competition I also want to see fairness and protection for small businesses but that will not happen. Instead the big companies will grow bigger.</P>
      <P>I recently read in the newspaper that Tesco has identified another 100 stores for Ireland. Not alone is it entering big towns and cities but it is now prepared to go into small towns of 2,000 and fewer. In County Mayo there are three major towns, Castlebar, Ballina and Westport. Ballina has Tesco, Dunnes, Aldi and all the supermarkets. What will happen to Kiltimagh, Swinford, Westport and Louisburg? All the shops in these areas have been put out of business by supermarkets. It was bad enough in the past when Dunnes was at it, and now we have Tesco which takes its profit out of the country, pays little tax and operates its business outside the State while our own people are not protected.</P>
      <P>I remember a factory in Westport that made underwear for a certain store here. Every week the store said it could buy this product cheaper elsewhere and of course it did. It closed the factory and the industry and avails of cheap labour abroad to bring cheap clothes here. Dunnes did <Col N="1650"/>the same with bread. It bought its bread for the entire country from Neville&rsquo;s of Cork. That bakery is no longer in operation but meanwhile every small bakery in the country &mdash; and one must remember that each bakery employed people who worked, lived and shopped in that town and sent their children to school there &mdash; closed because big business grew bigger.</P>

      <P>These multinational stores are coming into Ireland and wiping up. I welcome competition, but it must be fair. The concept of &ldquo;hello money&rdquo; did not begin in the supermarket business but migrated there from politics. If one did not offer money to the buyer one&rsquo;s goods were not put on the shelf or on the market. That is not a fair system and it probably still happens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Dunnes or Tesco should not put on special offers in a small rural town because they want to close down a few rural shops. If Dunnes or Tesco put on offers they must do so throughout the country and they must be fair, and not just target the people they want to put out of business. Rural Ireland will have no rural schools, Garda stations or shops and if the planners get their way we will have no rural people. If Fianna F&aacute;il is left in government much longer nobody <Col N="1651"/>will be left in rural Ireland because it wants them all in Dublin city.</P>

	<P>Although Dublin has the best roads and cars people cannot drive them anywhere because they are in traffic jams for two or three hours every day. If that is what the Government wants to offer, good luck to Fianna F&aacute;il but the people will soon speak.</P>
      <P>If the Competition Bill was introduced by anybody other than the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, I would be happy. He made a mess of education and health and has already made a mess of his current ministry.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister, Deputy Martin, visited my constituency but did not invite me to meet him although I had invited him to visit. As I would not go anywhere I was not invited I did not meet him although he met all the Fianna F&aacute;il lap dogs. I was surprised the Minister did not want competition when he came to my town as he wishes to administer competition in the country. I will tell the Deputies what he did and what RTE &mdash; which must not have had much to cover that day &mdash; did.</P>
      <P>There is a company in my town, Westport, that employs 120 people and the Minister promised them 20 jobs next year. There was no mention of the 400 jobs we lost in Allergan last year. The Minister went to Cork the next day and announced 1,000 jobs. If that is what we depend on, God help this country and that Department. As I said, the Minister, Deputy Martin, made a mess of education and health and will make a mess of trade too. The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, was welcome to the west last weekend where he received a stormy welcome, although not in my town.</P>

	<P>I was glad to see him there. I ask the Minister of State to take a message to the Minister. If we are to have no barriers or protection for the small people then let us have open competition. There is no point bringing this legislation through the D&aacute;il if we will not put an inspectorate in place. How many people have been prosecuted for overcharging, below-cost selling or failing to have proper signage? There is no point talking about competition if the Department does not implement the law and give the inspectorates powers to inspect what the supermarkets are buying, where and how they are buying it and the price at which they sell it. We must have fair competition. I am sad to speak on this legislation because it is the death knell for small shops. I am disappointed in Fianna F&aacute;il, which always looked after the small man and woman.</P>

	<P>I always enjoy listening to Deputy Ring&rsquo;s contributions. A former Member of this House who is now deceased, Se&aacute;n Doherty, used to say that he taped Deputy Ring&rsquo;s contributions and played them in bed on a Sunday night. I think I will start taping him as well because not too long ago he said that there were too many inspectors in the Department of Social and Family Affairs and that they were going out like little generals annoying his constituents. I am glad that he has changed his stance on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is attacking the small man again, not the big fellow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with him on some issues and he speaks a lot of sense. I welcome the modification of the competition law. There is now an onus on the Competition Authority to prevent predatory or abusive behaviour in the retail grocery trade. In my constituency of Dublin North-East, there are 26 shops belonging to RGDATA. We did numerous surveys in Dublin and other parts of the country. I was in Athlone one evening and I went into a Costcutters shop in Connaught Street and there were two jars of coffee that were cheaper than coffee on special offer in a larger store. As Deputy Ring pointed out, the customers are being conned and consumers are being cajoled into these large stores. They often spend half an hour queueing to buy three or four items and some of these people are elderly and living on their own.</P>
      <P>It is very important to protect small businesses and to ensure that there is a level playing pitch. If small businesses in rural areas are put out of business, the people in those areas may have to travel two or three miles to the big store. This may be impossible for some elderly people who then become isolated. There is a social aspect to it as well. Many small shops in villages in Great Britain have been wiped out completely and even the villages have been wiped out. People must travel five to ten miles away from the village to purchase goods.</P>
      <P>Businesses such as bakeries and so on were put out of business not so long ago because the people were treated like slaves. The person <Col N="1653"/>delivering bread to a large store today must stock the shelves because suppliers are treated like slaves. That does not happen in the small central store, which is very important to the local community. Having said that, I welcome the decision by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to strengthen the Act to ban predatory and abusive behaviour. I have long contended that the Competition Act 2002 was deficient in dealing with anti-competitive behaviour in the grocery sector. I lobbied the Minister to ensure that any repeal of the groceries order is matched by a strengthening of the Competition Act. We are pleased that he has responded.</P>
      <P>It is good to listen to the Opposition, especially Deputy Ring. He gives me a little spurt now and then that revitalises me in a certain way. Sometimes he is better than a tonic. He makes sense because he is a rural TD and he knows what is going on. Many of these large stores have buyers that are travelling to Korea and other countries where there is slave labour, with children of 12 to 14 years of age sleeping on the job, not being properly paid nor properly fed and who are abused in every sense imaginable. The consumer should be made aware of what these stores are engaged in. I believe that the consumer should be given a choice on price, but price is not always the biggest issue. Sometimes consumers change their minds when made aware of where the goods come from. We do not support goods on the shelves that have arrived as a result of slave labour and the abuse of young children. As a former trade union official, I would never condone that.</P>
      <P>The groceries order was brought in as a temporary measure in 1987, but it has survived numerous reviews and assessments. It has been a positive policy instrument and has attracted widespread support from many organisations and individuals. Deputy Ring said that everyone will be put out of business, but I doubt Deputy Ring will be put out of business. The order has left a positive legacy because it has given us an opportunity for debate. I hope that we support the small player in this business. Since the Lemass era, Fianna F&aacute;il has always supported the small businessman or woman. Such people represent the backbone of this country and if we lose sight of them, we will pay the price, both economically and otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill. I welcome the timely arrival of the Bill in the House. I lobbied very strongly for the retention of the groceries order because I felt that protection was vital for many of our smaller traders. I accept and respect the decision of the Minister, Deputy Martin, because he felt that there was a better way to protect these people. He has pointed out that during the lifetime of the groceries order from 1987 onwards, approximately 2,000 small shops closed down. The Minister felt, therefore, <Col N="1654"/>that the order was not giving the necessary protection. I am not perturbed about how we protect the small trader, whether it is by the groceries order or by the Competition Act, we just need a level playing pitch.</P>
      <P>Coming from a rural constituency in west Limerick, I am very conscious of the contribution made to the local economy by our small shopkeepers and small supermarket owners. These people have been plucky enough to invest substantial money in business in a small town or village in west Limerick and elsewhere. They have given employment to ten to 20 local people, which is very valuable. It is for those reasons, as well as for the convenience of the local consumer, that we should give every protection possible to those businesses to make sure that they can be sustained in the future. I have no doubt the Minister is setting out to do that and I wish him well.</P>
      <P>As one who faced the decision recently, before I left Limerick County Council, to rezone lands for the arrival of Tesco in the county town of Limerick, Newcastlewest, I welcomed the multiple because I believed consumers there and in surrounding areas were entitled to a choice. It was Tesco&rsquo;s first venture into County Limerick and it came to Newcastlewest. I wish it well provided the playing pitch remains level.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring referred to Fianna F&aacute;il having the ear of big business. I did a radio interview recently, the day the building regulations were announced. The first question Matt Cooper asked me was what our builder friends in Fianna F&aacute;il thought of all this. Sometimes I ask myself why developers and builders and 40% of the public support Fianna F&aacute;il. Is it not perhaps because Fianna F&aacute;il has got the climate right in Ireland for many years and supported small business? By supporting small businesses, we have helped them grow into big businesses. We have got the climate right and Commissioner McCreevy has made this point consistently about support for business. We are seen as a rich man&rsquo;s Government, but when those businesses are thriving, they give employment and the knock-on effect is felt all along the line. It is the right policy and I commend Commissioner McCreevy on adopting it while in government.</P>
      <P>Mention was again made of the Galway races and the Fianna F&aacute;il tent, which I cannot understand, since I believe Fine Gael is to have a tent at the Punchestown races. We did not hear any mention of it. Perhaps that party is taking a leaf from our book, and I welcome that. There is nothing wrong with it. I have never been fortunate enough to be in the Fianna F&aacute;il tent, but perhaps I may at some stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Deputy was not rich enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to outline some of the concerns raised by some of the traders and shopkeepers in my constituency. There appears to be <Col N="1655"/>a great emphasis on outlawing predatory pricing, irrespective of the market share of the perpetrator. This issue in particular needs to be dealt with under the Bill. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the abolition of the groceries order when he said predatory pricing was anti-competitive and outlawed by the provisions of the Competition Act. The groceries order was incapable of addressing the threat of predatory pricing, so I welcome the fact that the problem can be dealt with by amending the legislation in this way.</P>
      <P>Another issue people are concerned about is the definition of grocery goods and they say it needs to be widened to outlaw so-called hello money comprehensively. Again, my colleague, Deputy Ring, alluded to hello money being offered to Fianna F&aacute;il politicians. I believe others in the grocery trade offered such money as well to politicians from other parties. The precedent was probably set in that instance as well. The Minister, on the subject of &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money, announced that the Government will publish new legislative proposals shortly to strengthen greatly the provisions of the Competition Act 2002 to prohibit specifically the fixing of minimum retail prices by suppliers, resale price maintenance, unfair discrimination and the payment of advertising allowances and &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money. I welcome that very much and hope this legislation can succeed in its purpose</P>
      <P>Restriction of offers of discount items must be outlawed along with confining a loss-leading campaign to a geographical market or single location. The latter practice is quite unfair and if it must be done, it should be undertaken nationally to level the playing pitch further. Advertisements for loss-leading items should state whether the reduction in prices is being recovered through other items in the basket, which often can amount to quite a number of grocery items. The issue of prompt payment to suppliers needs to be especially addressed, as it was under the groceries order.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity of participating briefly in this debate. I commend the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, and his two Ministers of State, Deputy Killeen and Deputy Michael Ahern, on the work they are doing in the Department. Deputy Ring referred to the Minister coming to Ballina and announcing 20 jobs. When my constituency was in difficulty about 11 months ago and some 120 poultry jobs were lost in Kantoher, west Limerick, the Minister took time to meet people there. He gave a local group encouragement. He made the various State bodies available to this group. I am glad to report that before we arrive at the first anniversary of this occurrence, three separate indigenous companies have been installed on the site of the former Kantoher chicken processing plant and that news is very welcome.</P><Col N="1656"/>
      <P>It is unfair of Deputy Ring to say he does not trust the Minister. I trust him wholeheartedly and wish him well. I am quite sure he will do what Fianna F&aacute;il and this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government has always done, namely, protect the smaller businessperson. It will ensure that smaller shops will not close. Such shops have provided vibrancy in communities and underpinned the local economy. They provide gainful employment and choice to consumers and this must be acknowledged. It is not all about price, it is about convenience as well. Many consumers like to have the option of convenience and choice. I believe there is the best of both worlds in this country. We should protect what we have to ensure this continues and that we have sustainability for smaller shops so that they may survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>To refer to the previous speaker&rsquo;s point about it not being just a matter of price, that is the entire argument. Ultimately that is what the debate is about. No one will be exercised too much about the competition amendment before the House, yet it is something about which we need to be seriously concerned. The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, on which I serve, did a year-long trawl of the grocery trade and asked all of the major operators to come and speak to it about barriers to competition and what they believed should be done. Apart from Dunnes Stores, all the major stakeholders of the grocery industry attended and made substantive presentations to the committee. Not one of them asked that the groceries order be revoked.</P>
      <P>Aldi and Lidl said that were it not for the groceries order, they would not be in Ireland today. They made a very clear, coherent case. They said they deal in a limited range of goods &mdash; 1,000 approximately. Deputy Hogan may correct me if I am wrong. That figure may change over the course of the trading year. However, that is basically the volume they deal in. If the groceries order had not been in place, then any of the multiples could simply have reduced their prices dramatically on the range of goods Aldi and Lidl limit themselves to and forced them out of business or compelled them not to enter the market in the first place.</P>
      <P>If something works, why change it? If it is not broken, why say one is going to fix it, for the sake of publicity, gloss or spin? That is exactly what this is about &mdash; publicity, gloss and spin. That committee came up with a comprehensive report before the Minister made his decision. In the meantime, a supposedly parallel investigation was being carried out by the consumer strategy group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. N. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Who?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly. That group was running a parallel investigation. My information is that it did not speak to any of the multiples or to Aldi or Lidl. It simply put a basket of goods together. <Col N="1657"/>Deputy O&rsquo;Connor spoke earlier and I feel slightly car sick after the journey, given that he has been everywhere in the country with regard to his position on the grocery trade.</P>
      <P>I have a background in groceries too. It is called doing the weekly shopping. I have never considered a bottle of Bacardi to be a grocery item in my weekly shopping. I fully accept that the people in the consumer strategy group are of a different breed. I have a family to feed so I cannot sit down with electric toothbrushes &mdash; another item in the grocery basket &mdash; drinking Bacardi and whiling away the hours watching Oprah Winfrey.</P>
      <P>The group&rsquo;s statistics were off-beat and wrong. It got the VAT rate wrong, for example, which seems incredible for a group that was established by the Minister to examine the grocery trade and the cost of groceries for the average shopper. If that flawed information were a poll taken about a political party, it would be dismissed out of hand as being too narrow in focus, not addressing the issues and getting the candidates wrong. However, on the basis of this group&rsquo;s recommendation, the Minister decided to revoke the groceries order. It is quite staggering.</P>
      <P>The group was incorrectly informed on the issue of predatory pricing. The Competition Act does not ban predatory pricing but bans unfair pricing by companies in a dominant position. As none of the supermarket retailers is in a dominant position, that is, owning 40% of the market, they could not be prosecuted for engaging in predatory pricing under the provisions of section 5 of the Competition Act 2002. The group got that wrong. I believe this group is still in existence. If so, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, should not listen to it again unless its members can prove their credentials or at least prove that they can do the type of research a first year commerce student is expected to do.</P>
      <P>We should be aware of food poverty. There are different types of poverty in society. There is the obvious poverty of lack of money but there is also food and fuel poverty. There is a clear definition of food poverty. Living in poverty and social disadvantage imposes constraints on food consumption in three main ways. It affects food affordability through the choice and quality of food that can be bought and the share of the household budget that is allocated to food. That is straightforward. It impacts on access to food through the retail options available and the capacity to shop in terms of transport and physical ability. It impacts on the availability of storage and cooking.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cregan said the issue is not just cost. I could not agree with him more. It is about access as well. The committee of which I am a member and which produced a comprehensive report deals with all these matters. Its sixth recommendation states that while price is important, the joint committee believes there are broader social issues which need to be considered in the context <Col N="1658"/>of the ban on below cost selling. These relate to the need for the consumer to have a choice of grocery shops within a reasonable distance of his or her home.</P>
      <P>I read the Minister&rsquo;s speech to the Seanad on this issue in which he tried to debunk the argument about what has taken place in Great Britain with the arrival of massive retail parks. He said that every household in England now lives within 4 km of a petrol station with an attached convenience store. Sometimes people lose the run of themselves when they take certain positions. What if one does not have a car and one runs out of milk at breakfast or tea time? We have all been in that situation. Would one run to the shop for a litre of milk when it is 4 km away? The notion that this is the type of access people should have to provide food for themselves and their families is outrageous. The arguments the committee heard on this were such that it unanimously pleaded with the Minister, through its detailed report and recommendations, not to revoke the groceries order.</P>
      <P>Why did the Minister do it? When he was Minister in the Department of Health and Children he had more publications than Rupert Murdoch. He revoked the order because it was populist to do so, not because it was right or wrong or because of the effect it would have. A television programme had heightened awareness about how we are being ripped off. I believe the programme, even though it was presented by a Cork man, was misinformed on the groceries order. However, it was popular and it was a quiet time for news so the groceries order was revoked.</P>
      <P>As with the lack of protection for workers and the lack of an increase in the labour inspectorate, this is about the philosophy of letting the market rip, so to speak. The theory is to let others in because it will drive down prices. It will not drive down prices for me and the Minister but it will drive wages down for the ordinary working person and those trying to support their families. Now the groceries order is removed to let competition rip. The view of the Labour Party is that competition is about more than price. It is about good planning and access.</P>
      <P>Crosscare and the Combat Poverty Agency came before the committee. They pointed out that many elderly people of a certain age do not drive. If they do not drive and there is no corner store or convenient Spar, Mace or SuperValu, where will they get their food? It is not as if we have a social service to support their needs; we do not. There have been cutbacks in the home help service. Even if one has a home help for an hour a day, it will take longer than an hour to travel to the retail outlet and return with the shopping. Why did the Minister do it?</P>
      <P>Inflation in groceries was 1% in the negative up to May last year. Does the Minister hope to drive it down further? The &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme this morning should have made the Minister pause and, perhaps, change his mind. <Col N="1659"/>Statoil is about to sell its interests in Ireland. It says it is because of competition from the multiples. Statoil does not just sell oil but also groceries in convenience shops attached to the petrol stations. These are supposed to be 4 km from everybody&rsquo;s home but now they will be gone. If anything should rouse our interest, this should. This is about lack of access and lack of availability in the grocery industry.</P>
      <P>There is no need to revoke this order aside from the Minister&rsquo;s need for another headline. A Fianna F&aacute;il backbencher spoke some time ago about the Minister&rsquo;s promise to introduce legislation to protect the consumer. Why would he do that when he has revoked the groceries order? It is not related to predatory pricing so why do it? We are still trying to sort out the mess with the nursing homes after this Minister. Why are people so confident he has got this issue right? None of the multiples asked or said anything about the groceries order when they appeared before the committee. They spoke about hello and shelf money etc. They spoke about waste charges and the disposal of waste as additional costs that their counterparts in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom do not have to carry to such an extent. However, none of them asked for the removal of the groceries order.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the Competition Authority came to talk to the committee. He said he was not interested in access or planning, just in prices. He said he was not interested in anything except prices. I hope he does well with the fair trade commission in England. He was on his way out when he made that statement of course. He also told us that the abolition of the groceries order would save average shoppers &euro;1,000 per year on their shopping basket. We have heard nothing about that since.</P>
      <P>I advise others to do what I am going to do. When the Bill is enacted I will do a big shop and stick my receipt on the back of the kitchen door. In a year&rsquo;s time I will ask the Minister, Deputy Martin, or John Fingleton for my &euro;1,000 because I guarantee the cost of my basket of groceries will not have reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. N. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>John Fingleton has gone to the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but with Ryanair we can get there easily. This Bill is not about the protection of consumers, it is about letting the market rip. It is an outrageous stroke when this is an area the Minister did not need to tackle. He should be increasing the labour inspectorate with a view to the protection of workers, but that would cost the Department money. Who would see that money spent? One cannot unveil 30 inspectors, they would not stand for it, but that is what the Minister would like to do. I would like more detail on the reasons Statoil is leaving Ireland.</P><Col N="1660"/>
      <P>I believe the abolition of the groceries order will ensure we will have loss leaders in the trade. These will be deliberately advertised, something we see every day, but now there will be no holds barred. The corner shop we all knew will exist no longer. We accept the grocery trade has changed dramatically and that it is no longer the trade we knew. The symbol brands have taken the place of the corner shops. They are now a better convenience store. We drop into those stores on our way home when we have forgotten to get something. They provide a large range of commodities and a service to the community, not just to people like me but to people without transport and those who do not need to shop in bulk but who still want good quality food and service. There is no doubt these shops will now disappear, and their demise is being facilitated by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I often remind people that few of us get the chance to make a mark or be remembered for something significant. This Minister will be remembered for many significant changes, all bad. It is amazing that someone who showed so much promise and potential cannot get it right. The Minister has gone through three Departments and I wonder which will be the next casualty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. N. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill which deals with an area close to my heart. Given my background in the food industry, both as a producer and in the context of my role in the Department of Agriculture and Food, it is an area in which I have first-hand experience.</P>
      <P>It is important to record some general observations at the outset. I differ from my colleague, Deputy Lynch, with whom I sit on the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, with Deputy Hogan, and I compliment the Minister, Deputy Martin. It was an all-party committee that came up with the final result. I must praise the Minister, Deputy Martin. He inherited this legislation, but I believe he would not have produced it if he had been in the Department from the time the Government came into office. The Minister, Deputy Martin, is an innovative, modern and successful Minister who has done great work in all areas. However, I question his knowledge of the groceries order and the Irish food industry.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Cassidy, the chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. He is an innovative Chairman who runs a successful committee and challenges many areas and reports before the House. The report on the groceries order was a comprehensive document but it has been ignored by many in high office and positions. If it had been taken on board, we would not be here discussing this legislation which will destroy not only our retail sector but also our small food industry. Bord Bia and IBEC would agree with me with regard to this legislation. It is legislation the Minister has <Col N="1661"/>inherited that will make the rich richer and the poor poorer.</P>
      <P>The food and retail sectors here have special importance in the State. For a country that is primarily a producer of food, the output of the food and drink industry is a significant contributor to our GDP. Currently, the agri-food and drinks sector account for more than 8% of Ireland&rsquo;s GDP, 8.4% of our exports and 9.1% of total employment. In employment terms there are nearly 110,000 people employed in agriculture and a further 47,000 directly employed in the food and drinks sector. In addition, there are more than 65,000 people employed in the distribution and sales of food in the retail grocery sector, with the lion&rsquo;s share of more than 40,000 employed in the independent retail grocery sector.</P>
      <P>With in excess of 200,000 employees in total, the food and retail sector is a key and critical sector of our economy. It is also by its nature a labour intensive sector and one that has faced increased regulation from the EU. Increased regulation and high labour involvement inevitably lead to high labour costs. This has significant impact on competitiveness and the funds available for investment. The sector is volatile, given a high dependence on exports and a need for attractive routes to market in the home area.</P>
      <P>I mentioned these aspects by way of background because it is important for us as legislators to understand the sometimes difficult market in which Irish food companies operate. We are not just talking about the large co-ops or food industries that have come to dominate key parts of the food market. There are many small and artisan producers, including many in my area, that have developed new and innovative products which they are anxious to bring to consumers. There are many small and medium sized food companies that benefit from supports from county enterprise boards, some of which will develop into more substantive production and manufacturing operations, supported by the Department &mdash; there goes another waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money. It is important for such firms to have confidence in their dealings with retailers and that they are not subject to arbitrary, unjustified or unfair trading practices.</P>
      <P>What will happen to the small retailers I have mentioned? The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, was in my town recently to launch three small units involved in the food industry. They have no more future than today&rsquo;s newspaper in that locality because they will not be wanted. Currently there is some friendliness from the large multiples towards small food manufacturers and cottage industries that make marmalades, jams and brown bread &mdash; something which is important to our tourists &mdash; and a range of other products. They may be a nuisance at the moment, but they will become a bigger nuisance when this Bill is passed. Whether they are in Cahirciveen, Waterville, Listowel, Mitchelstown, Cloyne, Dungarvan or wherever, they will be told <Col N="1662"/>that the multiples will accept certain products at their central distribution centres.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Mrs. Murphy, or whoever, will be told to take her goods to the multiple&rsquo;s local distribution centre. How in God&rsquo;s name can someone running a small operation, with profits of &euro;10,000 to &euro;20,000 per year, whose produce is rightly acclaimed in his or her area, afford to travel to the central distribution centre? That has been the trend of the Irish multiples, especially the new ones coming to this island.</P>
      <P>Large retailers are not charities and many use all means possible to extract the maximum saving from suppliers through the imposition of particular terms and conditions. We should never forget that we have a population of only 4 million and, bearing that in mind, we should note the three main areas of concern, namely, predatory pricing, the demanding of hello money and the abuse of credit terms.</P>
      <P>The <i>Financial Times</i> is a paper of repute and is widely read not only in this country but across the world. I picked up a copy on Wednesday, 7 December 2005 and noted the following headline: &ldquo;Cash benefit: how big supermarkets fund expansion by using suppliers as bankers&rdquo;. By God, the article has something to say on the matter. What have we done in this country of 4 million people? The article, written by John Plender, Martin Simons and Henry Tricks states: &ldquo;Examining the accounts of multinational retailers shows the increasing extent to which they draw on trade creditors to provide working capital for their stores.&rdquo; Who read that article in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment?</P>
      <P>The practice of demanding hello money, the abuse of credit terms and the imposition of unfair trading terms can all have a seriously negative impact on any existing or fledgling supplier businesses. It is important that such companies have the confidence and assurance that their businesses will not be undermined by avaricious behaviour by multiples. While they should not be cosseted from competition, it is essential that they be given a fair chance to develop and expand so as to encourage innovation and employment. I hope this is an objective with which the Minister can agree.</P>
      <P>It is also vital that we understand that relationships within the retail grocery trade are often skewed by the enormous market power that a small number of large retailers have over a multitude of suppliers, consumers and competitors. This is relevant to the cottage and small food industries in Ireland. Given that two major multiples in the grocery trade have over 50% of the market, the power of these companies in terms of giving new and existing suppliers routes to market is considerable. The potential for a large retailer to abuse that power is ever-present and needs to be watched and controlled for the public good.</P>
      <P>It is also important for suppliers to have access to different routes to market and that they not <Col N="1663"/>be solely dependent on large retailers. There are many significant food businesses in Ireland that secured their first break through a local shop. This relates to my point on small manufacturing industries, which will be a thing of the past if this amending legislation is passed in its entirety.</P>
      <P>Ensuring that there is diversity and choice in retailing is critical, not just to the provision of shopping facilities locally but also to the supplier and production base. Innovation and change are part of modern commerce and this is nowhere more evident than in the retail grocery trade. There are new forms of stores, stores of new sizes and new operators trading at a time that has seen the advent of Internet retailing and various other retail formats. At the heart of it all, there is still a special place for local, independently owned retailers, who trade in their own town, as members of a symbol group or otherwise, and who are part of the community in which they operate. They source goods locally, employ locally, bank locally and invest locally. They provide a critical community service to a locality and while many compete on price, their primary hallmark pertains to service. In my constituency, Cork East, I have witnessed the manner in which the traditional independent retailers have been put under increasing pressure by other independent retailers, the multiples and the discounters.</P>
      <P>I serve a constituency including Mallow, Cobh, Midleton, Youghal and Fermoy. Carrigtwohill has emerged as the fifth or sixth biggest town in the constituency and it has 3,500 people on the register of electors. Mitchelstown has 3,300 people on the register. Youghal is probably the darkest town in Ireland at present in respect of manufacturing jobs. Out of town on the Waterford side, there are Lidl and Tesco stores. There were two Supervalue stores in the town and one has closed. We have seen increasing fall-out in the retail sector in the town centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should listen to his fellow Corkman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. N. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Our town centres will be denuded of their businesses, which we cherished for years, thus resulting in ghettos and apartments. They will be destroyed. Many of our local authorities are dependent on parking charges in the centre of towns to allow them run those towns. However, there is free parking in the out-of-town developments and this militates against the little shops and stores, such as Supervalue. In east Cork there are probably six Supervalue stores and other such stores. I have spoken to representatives from all these since I became a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and they told me they are under real pressure. Some of the shops will not survive. There are Centra, Mace and Spar stores also.</P><Col N="1664"/>
      <P>In Mitchelstown, from which I come, there is a Tesco store. For 18 years, there have been 3,300 people on the register of electors in the town. There is a Lidl store in the town and there is to be an Aldi store but there will be no shop in the main street before the next general election. I will be proved right in saying this because the shops on the street are under pressure because of parking restrictions and attractions in other locations, which I believe are not desirable.</P>
      <P>In Youghal, for example, we have, over the past three years, seen the opening of a Lidl discount store and an out-of-town Tesco store. These are now competing alongside the existing town-centre retailers. There is no doubt in my mind that the location of out-of-town retailers has had a negative impact on the vitality and vibrancy of town centres.</P>
      <P>A nail would be driven through the coffin of many town centre retailers if large retailers operating on the outskirts of towns were given additional ammunition to help undermine competitors within specific localities. For example, if Tesco and Lidl became involved in below-cost selling or predatory pricing in Youghal, they could inflict considerable damage on the viability of the existing town centre retailer, which is going out of business in spite of its high level of service and high quality produce.</P>
      <P>The issues for discussion in this Bill go to the heart of the provision of retailing, not just in Dublin but in every town and village throughout the country. Issues arise as to whether competitors will be allowed to compete on the basis of fair or unfair market rules. I am concerned that this Bill is disjointed, in particular the provisions that suggest conditional prohibitions on appalling activities such as the demanding of hello money, the demanding of unfair contract terms and so forth. Under the groceries order these measures were banned outright, but in this legislation they are tolerated, except under certain conditions which I suspect will be complex.</P>
      <P>I am deeply concerned that the Bill does not deal with the issue of predatory pricing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is falling asunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. N. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister assures us that predatory pricing is covered by existing competition legislation but I have heard views from eminent senior counsel that contradict this contention. The Minister also says he is limited by EU rules in what he can do to strengthen competition legislation regarding predatory pricing. I doubt this and have heard contrary opinions from eminent senior counsel that do not support this view.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the drive to introduce this legislation and repeal the groceries order was borne out of comments by the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority to the effect that the changes would produce lower prices for consumers. The chairman of the con<Col N="1665"/>sumer strategy group should lease a Centra store in Dublin and go into business. She would then find out how hard it is to run a business and make a margin while satisfying the supplier and consumer. I am convinced that the business would not be long in existence.</P>
      <P>It concerns me to see the pace at which commentators and observers are retracting predictions of a boon for consumers on foot of the disappearance of this measure. I am deeply suspicious of the view that consumers will win as a result of the changes in this legislation. I am inclined to agree with comments contained in <i>The Grocer</i> magazine in the UK to the effect that the real winner of the changes will be Tesco. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has not agreed that Tesco has dominated the UK market. I have been in London and all over England and have noted that it has. If the retail sector in England is doing so well and is as vibrant as the Minister and his advisers believe, why has the House of Commons put together an all-party committee to investigate the retail trade in the United Kingdom? There are many cities, towns, small hamlets and villages in the United Kingdom and, in some, Tesco has three shops, thereby dominating the market&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The UK and US models of out-of-town shopping do not suit a country such as Ireland and never will because of our small population and rural identity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. N. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is worth recalling that the global turnover of Tesco is twice the entire output of the Irish agrifood sector. This cannot be doubted and it indicates Tesco&rsquo;s power and the control it has over suppliers, consumers and competitors. We all know the history of Tesco. It was established in the 1930s by a London barrow boy, Jack Cohen, and has developed into what it is today.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to give open-minded consideration to the concerns that have been expressed by many of the groups that lobbied us in regard to this legislation. In particular, I ask the Minister to address the specific suggestion that the Competition Act 2002 does not provide <Col N="1666"/>adequate protection against predatory pricing and ask him to be inventive in seeking to bring forward solutions to address this situation.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to Statoil. We all believe in profit. If one does not have money, one is in trouble. Today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> contains an article headed: &ldquo;Statoil to exit Irish petrol market in &euro;250m sell-off.&rdquo; Why is this the case? The article states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The after-tax loss for the financial year amounted to &euro;3.44m. This loss meant profits carried forward at the end of the year dropped from &euro;28m in 2003 to &euro;21.8m in 2004. Statoil&rsquo;s decision to exit Ireland is seen as a reaction to competition in a market which has become intensely competitive in the past number of years. Tesco&rsquo;s entry into the retail petrol market has put particular pressure on the profits of the major oil companies.</P>
      <P>Statoil is a Norwegian company, more than 50% owned by the Norwegian Government. If the article is correct, Ireland will be in trouble. A further issue arises with regard to Wal-Mart, which we are told is one of the most competitive organisations of all. It is also the subject of an article in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>, which is headed: &ldquo;Wal-Mart chief faces 28 years in prison for tax fraud.&rdquo; I will say no more on that matter.</P>
      <P>The Bill will destroy rural villages and towns. We must address the issues of predatory pricing, hello money and abusive credit terms. When this legislation is passed, the major retailers will sing all the way to the bank because they will take over the whole business and make huge profits, and the stock market will boom &mdash; I have an interest in the stock market, but I like to be fair about it. All a retailer would have to do in any town is to single out the shop that is competing with it, change its prices to make them more attractive, and the other shop would be ruined and out of business in six months. After two years, the retailer could raise its prices because it would have a monopoly.</P>
      <P>Tesco is no angel &mdash; everyone knows that. We have seen what happened in the UK retail market with regard to Somerfield, Sainsbury&rsquo;s, Morrisons and Asda, which is owned by Wal-Mart. The Bill is not dealing with a simple task. The consumer strategy group which is in place has a right-wing approach which does not fit with the Irish way of life. We are trying to destroy the Irish retail sector. When we make the rich richer and the poor poorer, and get rid of the small retailers, we will have done a great job. Small cottage industry in rural Ireland &mdash; I say this to Deputy McHugh &mdash; which is run by those whom we cherish and admire for their innovation and lovely products, will be gone because the simple production centres will be targeted by the multiples, which want to get rid of them.</P>
      <P>I am a close friend of the Minister, Deputy Martin, for whom I have great admiration and for whom bigger things may be in store. He must <Col N="1667"/>consider the legislation and not be advised and assisted by those who have advised him to date. He has been abused in this debate by my colleagues in the Labour Party with regard to the way he ran the health services. He ran the health services with distinction and credit and left a substantial health structure in place that we can be proud of into the next decade and beyond. His health systems, which did not receive funding at Cabinet level, are now being put in place by some of his colleagues. I feel annoyed about this issue. I wish the Minister well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and McHugh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is well known that the Minister, Deputy Martin, and I come from the same community and parish. Our family homes are no more than 100 m apart. We share the same sense of affection for the community in which we were brought up, as well as sharing a sense of the character of that area. It has a combination of charms in the sense that it is only ten minutes walk from Cork city centre but it managed to maintain a village quality.</P>
      <P>While much of that character remains in its people and its houses, in the past 20 years the economic life of Turner&rsquo;s Cross has all but evaporated. In that period, which coincides with the Minister&rsquo;s political career, within a quarter mile radius of both of our family homes 15 corner shops have gone out of business. One could say that this is the normal cut and thrust of economic life and that the groceries order, as it stood, did nothing to defend those businesses &mdash; I will address those points presently. However, not only were these economic outlets, but they played an important social role in my local community. They were places where people went to get their pint of milk &mdash; usually just one pint &mdash; a loaf of bread, a tube of toothpaste or an evening newspaper. As they dealt on that scale, it was unlikely that the type of savings that large multiples make and pass on to consumers were possible in those shops.</P>
      <P>They were also places where people, being creatures of habit, would visit on a regular basis as a matter of ritual, and a person&rsquo;s absence would be commented on. On foot of that, visits were made to people who had not been seen of late in their local corner shops. These local shops were part of a social infrastructure that we have lost, with milkmen who deliver milk and regular post in local areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, might find this amusing, but as Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe, his constituency colleague has just described, the same phenomenon is happening in the rural towns he represents.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1668"/>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should not talk such rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the same phenomenon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I come from the country also and I know more about this than the Deputy. I know more about Youghal than either the Deputy or Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The path the Government has embarked upon does not concern competition. It will lead us down the path of cartels to duopoly and, eventually, to single companies controlling the operation of retail activities in towns and villages.</P>
      <P>The Minister, if he was so inclined, would have found the recent documentary about the Wal-Mart chain on RTE 2 television instructive. Wal-Mart is the supermarket chain that is all-pervasive in the United States. Not only has it seen off competition from other retail outlets and the American equivalent of small corner shops, it uses its economic muscle to put out of business suppliers within the US economy by putting constant downward pressure on the prices at which suppliers are asked to supply their goods. That same phenomenon and the same economic forces are in operation within the Irish economy. They will be stronger as a result of the policy route upon which the Government has embarked.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I come from a part of the country that was home to the first Dunnes Stores, is home to Roches Stores and is headquarters of the Musgrave operation. Ironically, Musgrave is very much opposed to what the Government suggests because it knows that the threats to retail activity and the provision of proper service and price comparisons to the consumer are at the heart of what the Government proposes. In reality, a situation exists whereby there are no more than three or four multiples in Ireland. As a result of the Government proposals, I foresee this number reducing to one or two. Then, as Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe described so articulately given that he is a Government Deputy, we will eventually see the &ldquo;Tescofication&rdquo; of the Irish retail market. How would that serve the interests of the Irish consumer?</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>This is a knee-jerk, panic reaction on the part of the Government on foot of the successful television programme, &ldquo;Rip-Off Republic&rdquo;, hosted by Eddie Hobbs. Again, there is a useful link in that while the Minister was studying for his leaving certificate and I was studying for my intermediate certificate, Mr. Hobbs was in fifth year in the same school as both of us. This does not mean that everything uttered by Mr. Hobbs in &ldquo;Rip-Off Republic&rdquo; was correct. Most of what he said in highlighting much of the inefficiency and fraud at the heart of retail and services was correct. However, his belief that simply getting rid of the groceries order instead of strengthening it and <Col N="1669"/>making it more socially useful will benefit the consumer is fatally flawed.</P>
      <P>The long-term effect of abolishing this type of social protection for local communities will be the scenario described by Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe, myself and many other Deputies. The Government should be warned. The Minister of State should not sneer at this approach.</P>

Sinn F&eacute;in is adamantly opposed to the revocation of the groceries order. As my colleague, Deputy Morgan, stated, we believe it will result in less rather than more choice for the consumer. It will drive small independent shops out of business and out of the community.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>We should examine the reasons behind the introduction of the groceries order. It was introduced in 1987 to prevent larger supermarkets using their muscle to pressurise suppliers and force competing retailers out of business. It was introduced after a number of high-profile traditional Irish businesses went out of business. It banned the predatory practice of selling goods at below cost price. It banned large retailers pressurising suppliers to pay so-called &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money or rental for shelf space in stores and abusing their suppliers&rsquo; payment terms. It also banned price fixing of grocery goods and boycotts of suppliers and retailers. We should remember this.</P>
      <P>The order aimed to protect small and medium-sized independent businesses and consumer choice. It is logical that a high market share for multiples means less choice for consumers. The market share of multiples is clearly increasing. For example, 40% of the groceries market in the State is controlled by two supermarket chains. When the groceries order is abolished, this percentage will increase. In the Dublin market, 75% of the groceries market is controlled by two supermarket chains. This is not competition and it is certainly not in the interests of customers or suppliers of goods and services.</P>
      <P>The closure of community stores will have additional knock-on effects. It will lead to an increase in out-of-town shopping centres which will, in turn, lead to additional commuting traffic and congestion. As other speakers have alluded to, RTE aired a documentary last weekend about the impact of Wal-Mart stores in the US. I watched it with interest, knowing that this debate was due and being intent on reflecting the strong lobby I have been subjected to for a long period. This is a deserving lobby which I am happy to reflect and support.</P><Col N="1671"/>
      <P>I was struck by the use of the phrase &ldquo;the race to the bottom&rdquo;, a phrase heard frequently in recent times, which Wal-Mart and, by implication, other megastores are leading. Their relentless pursuit of the bottom line leads them in search of the cheapest product. This inevitably leads them out of the country and the western world into the underdeveloped nations where children labour for a few dollars a day. Quite apart from the significant ethical considerations, this harms indigenous industry, with jobs disappearing as production moves overseas. It is a road few of us wish to travel. Representatives of all parties and none have reflected on this position. None of us wishes to travel down this road but that is where this Bill will bring us.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that employment in the food production industry has increased by 100% since the introduction of the groceries order. In the five years before its introduction, employment in this sector had fallen by 15%. The Government claims that revoking the groceries order will increase competition. We heard this argument before when Telecom &Eacute;ireann was privatised. More than five years later, we have a private monopoly in which consumers pay higher prices for inadequate services while the State repeatedly claims it is powerless to intervene. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources all but admitted recently that the privatisation of Telecom &Eacute;ireann was a mistake.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to confine myself to section 4 of the Bill which proposes to revoke the groceries order. I record my belief that in coming forward with a proposal to abolish the order, the Minister allowed himself to be unduly influenced by the report of the consumer strategy group. This report contained many inaccuracies, which were highlighted by the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, of which I am a member, in its submission to the Minister in July 2005. I will quote from the submission so that even if the Minister sought to bury it, it will be put on the record. According to the committee&rsquo;s submission:</P>
      <P LI="1">The Joint Committee met with Ms Ann Fitzgerald, Chairperson of the Consumer Strategy Group, and other CSG representatives on 22 June 2005.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">The Joint Committee has concluded that there were a number of misunderstandings and errors in relation to the Groceries Order in the CSG Report.</P><Col N="1672"/>
      <P LI="1" el="0">These include:</P>
      <P LI="2">1. The CSG stated that Ireland was the most expensive country in the eurozone for food and retail non-alcoholic beverages (page 7).</P>
      <P LI="2" el="0">The Joint Committee&rsquo;s Report found that the Eurostat Price Level Indices Report, (from which the CSG obtained its information):</P>
      <P LI="3">a) Reflects consumption patterns as well as prices</P>
      <P LI="3">b) Was a survey of prices in Dublin only (recent surveys by the CSO show that Dublin prices are more expensive than prices outside Dublin)</P>
      <P LI="3">c) Was undertaken in outlets that may not now be representative of outlets in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business considers that the Eurostat report cannot be regarded as reliable evidence of Irish prices compared with those of other countries.</P>
      <P LI="2">2. The CSG ignored the recent very low inflation in Irish food prices. Since August 2003, the annual inflation rate has been less than 1%. For the most recent year, the annual Consumer Price Index rate was<?oasys _jy ?>&minus; 1.4%. These low inflation rates are not indicative of a non-competitive market or a market that needs fundamental regulatory change.</P>
      <P LI="2">3. The presentation of the prices of international and national brands ... is misleading due to the inclusion of alcohol products without the exclusion of excise duty [These products are rarely bought in a grocery shop].</P>
      <P LI="2">4. The CSG is incorrect in stating that the Competition Act, 2002 prevents predatory pricing in the Irish grocery trade.</P>
      <P LI="2">5. The CSG incorrectly assumes that convenience stores account for a much larger proportion of food sales than is the [reality].</P>
      <P LI="2">6. The CSG Report incorrectly states there is no ban on below cost selling in Germany, Spain and Italy.</P>
      <P LI="2">7. While the CSG notes the entry of Aldi and Lidl to the market, it does not appear to understand that the entry of [these businesses] was facilitated by the existence of a ban on below cost selling in Ireland. Without the ban, the discounters would have been subject to attack by existing multiple groups. Without the ban, the benefits of the competition from Aldi and Lidl would not have been realised.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The chairperson of the consumer strategy group, during questioning by the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, appeared to con<Col N="1673"/>sider that the groceries order could not be amended, with the choice being to retain or revoke it. If the consumer strategy group had been aware the order could be amended by legislation, its recommendations to the Minister may have been completely different. The Minister happily ignored the submission from the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and instead undermined the committee by accepting a flawed report from the consumer strategy group. He ignored the committee&rsquo;s submissions, which had some very strong input from members of his party. He also decided to ignore that. So much for the Minister respecting the views of his party colleagues.</P>
      <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>I also heard the former head of the Competition Authority, Dr. Fingleton, specifically state that the groceries order was anti-competitive and did not facilitate competition in the groceries trade. When Dr. Fingleton was challenged on this, he had no evidence to back up his claim. The Minister&rsquo;s actions in bringing forward this Bill and including the abolition of the groceries order was based on flawed judgment, an inaccurate report by the consumer strategy group and a fresh air view of the Competition Authority based on nothing.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>Why does the Minister feel he has to meddle in this matter? It is something which is working well and serving the public. His actions will lead to the largest and greediest players putting small community-based operators out of business.</P>

	<P>This Bill represents what is good about the Legislature. A problem existed, it needed fixing, legislation was drafted and we are now enacting it. If only all legislation were dealt with as quickly, we would all have a greater sense of job satisfaction.</P>
      <P>Competition, the groceries order and reforming legislation are all topics which allow political parties to demonstrate their commitment to promoting the consumer interest. The view of the Progressive Democrats is that the groceries order has failed in its primary function of preventing consolidation in the grocery sector and protecting a vibrant independent sector. We also recognise that the order contributed to <Col N="1674"/>higher price inflation and, ultimately, increased the burden on consumers. Therefore we called for its abolition.</P>
      <P>The parties opposite have unfortunately struggled in this policy area. Fine Gael stated, astonishingly, that the groceries order illustrated the Government&rsquo;s complete inability to tackle vested interests and its complete antipathy to consumers. I again remind Fine Gael of its record. In May 1996, when the party was last in Government, it sought derogations from EU law to protect a State monopoly at the expense of consumers. The party attempted to protect Telecom &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s monopoly for an extra two years. More recently, the groceries order became an embarrassing issue for Fine Gael. We have more of this today in the party demonstrating its paralysis in making a decision.</P>
      <P>Although it risks becoming a mantra &mdash; but like many a mantra it is true &mdash; the Labour Party is certainly no friend of the consumer. Its rusty statist economic policies are a sure way of repressing competition and harming consumers. Indeed, the classic competition success story, the aviation sector, is one that particularly upsets the Labour Party. The approach of the Progressive Democrats is different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>This would upset certain groups, but it is undoubtedly the correct step.</P>
      <P>Like many Members of this House, I have received correspondence from retailers expressing their concern about the effect of this proposed action on their businesses. Retailers should know that their clearly articulated concerns were considered during extensive deliberations on the future of the order last year. I further reassure these businesses that, notwithstanding recent steps on the order and competition generally, the Progressive Democrats will continue to work to support all businesses. This will include smaller traders and garages, etc. who appear most vocal in their concern about developments.</P>
      <P>My party is acutely aware that our successful economy, based as it is on initiative, enterprise and development, requires a mixture of business types, such as the sole traders, the small and medium enterprises, larger concerns and multinationals. The Progressive Democrats will pursue policies nuanced enough to ensure that all business types have the correct level of support to allow them to get on with their work in trading, generating revenue, profits, jobs and wages. The <Col N="1675"/>same cannot be said, unfortunately, of parties in opposition.</P>
      <P>A weekend media report referred to research showing that a key barrier to voters opting for the Labour Party was nervousness about its ability to manage the national economy. This nervousness is understandable and is something I share. How would Labour in Government deal, for example, with yesterday&rsquo;s advice from the ESRI? Would we see some sort of internal schizophrenic meltdown as it considers which union group to appease? Would Fine Gael throw straw in the wind to judge how its vote might be affected and its reaction?</P>
      <P>Here we see the stark reality of the choice facing the electorate. The Progressive Democrats want to let business get on with it and let the economy progress. The party wishes to keep the burden on business and workers low and generate the economic activity that fuels public revenue, which in turn is used to assist the most vulnerable people in our communities. Letting the economy progress is what has been good for Ireland and its citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy was not listening to Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The policy has created more than 450,000 net new jobs under this Government. It has produced the most generous tax and welfare systems in the world for single income families on the average industrial wage. These are extraordinary facts.</P>
      <P>The Opposition may be correct in stating that a clear alternative is emerging. This alternative is an unsure taxation policy for the future, an appalling record on taxation in the past, a rebalancing &mdash; or unbalancing, rather &mdash; of the income tax system, and a wealth tax that would operate as a property tax. Under this Government, in contrast, an expert group has made recommendations and there has been consultation, notice, action and now legislation. Problems are identified and dealt with, fairly. This Bill is an example of that process.</P>
      <P>The consumer strategy group&rsquo;s recommendation was followed by a public consultation process. This review generated in excess of 550 submissions to the Department. They were received from a wide range of parties including trade union groups, producers and retailers, as well as many from the public. Concerns expressed to my party were considered during the extensive deliberations on the future of the order last year. A fear of so-called predatory pricing, even by those not in a dominant position, was a common thread in the correspondence I received. There are fears that sections 4 and 5 of the Competition Act 2002 may not capture certain unilateral conduct on the part of non-dominant undertakings in the grocery trade and this is a result of a revocation of the order. This amending Bill addresses those fears.</P><Col N="1676"/>
      <P>I repeat the advice of the Minister that measurement of dominance does not have to be at a national level as legislation now provides for dominance to be measured in the context of smaller areas or towns. Nor should dominance be measured simply in terms of mathematical majority. As has been pointed out previously, a business with a 25% share of a particular market may be a dominant player if other operators have only a 1% share of that market. Ultimately, competition legislation allows the Competition Authority to tackle predatory pricing in all circumstances. That is as it should be and is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Of course, legislation is merely one half of the process. Its implementation and enforcement are the other. A true test of this Bill, when enacted, will be how adequately it enables the Competition Authority to tackle predatory pricing, to end inappropriate dominance and ensure competition. Adequate legislation and adequate enforcement are both necessary. Nevertheless, we have a duty to allay the fears of those in the retail trade. We must get the message across that the removal of the groceries order gives freedom to retailers. Retailers themselves know their business best. They know their customers and their trade best. They are best positioned to determine the prices that they should charge their customers for goods and services, to keep those customers.</P>
      <P>The groceries order did not protect retailers. Some 2,500 stores closed in the nearly 20 years since the groceries order was introduced. It did not act as it was intended, and it did not prevent the move toward the increasing concentration we currently see in the Irish market. The legislation before us today provides balance in the market between the prohibition of certain practices that might be considered undesirable and ensuring that the new competitive environment will be fair for all. The groceries order kept prices artificially high. If it were left in place, it would continue to do so.</P>
      <P>For the balance it provides and for addressing the potential negative conduct of non-dominant undertakings in the grocery trade, this is a necessary Bill which I welcome and support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley has dealt with technical aspects of the Bill. I will comment on some things that were said earlier. Deputy Boyle said he was a neighbour of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, and referred emotionally to the number of corner shops that have closed down in his locality. The area in question has done very well in terms of representation as I lived about 300 yd on the other side of Deputy Boyle, on High Street, and am aware of all the shops he mentioned. In that context it is important to note the figure quoted by Deputy O&rsquo; Malley of 2,500 shops that have closed under the existing legislation in the past ten or 12 years. We are all aware of the reasons for that and need to be totally hon<Col N="1677"/>est about it. The primary reason for their closure is their customers exercised their option to shop where they felt they would get the best value, as they are entitled to do. One can argue about the effects of advertising, among other things, but the bottom line is the consumer will go where he or she wishes and is correct so to do.</P>
      <P>Those of us who have concentrated on work and, in an old-fashioned way, have left the shopping to the partner might not be as aware of the need to look for value for money as, say, a housewife. Everybody is involved in shopping now, however, and their primary objective is value for money. This legislation will assist in that regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boyle was surprised that Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe had concerns about this legislation. He should not assume there is a monopoly of concern on any issue on the Opposition side of the House. Regardless of who forms a Government, there will be concerns on the part of every elected Member on any legislation. Our job is to thrash it out and to get as many of our concerns taken on board to reflect the views and concerns of everybody outside the House, such as traders, suppliers and, most of all in this context, consumers.</P>
      <P>I received the same lobbying material and some of the difficulties have been or can be dealt with quite easily. I am surprised that some large traders were concerned about the prompt payments legislation. Again, that can be taken care of quite effectively.</P>
      <P>Below cost selling and the ability of foreign conglomerates to come in and put our local traders out of business are the primary concern for the future. The fact, as referred to by Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe, that Statoil is withdrawing shows that the large foreign company is not always successful and cannot always compete effectively with our people. One of the most successful groups in the country, Musgraves, is based in my area, the Tramore Road in Cork, and trades under a number of business names with various partners. They started with a modest store, Smiths, and developed with professionalism, commitment and hard work. That can be done if there is protection from unfair practices and trading and we will have to ensure that that is the case. If there is a need to come back to the legislation with amendments, so be it.</P>
      <P>It is neither accurate nor necessary to paint the picture of the deserted villages in parts of England. I was confronted with such prophecies on two occasions. Ten years ago, RGDATA came as representatives of all the small shops in Douglas village in Cork and said they would be gone within two years if a major supermarket developed there. A large shopping mall was proposed. Now, nobody can afford to buy a square foot of space in Douglas. It is probably the most expensive area in Cork and every shop there trades very well.</P>
      <P>When I was Lord Mayor of Cork in 1983 there was a joint proposal by the city council and a <Col N="1678"/>private developer to build the first multi-storey car park in the region. The development, which now includes shops, is known as the Paul Street development. At the time I was summoned by the traders of Patrick Street and their representatives and was told it would be like a deserted village after a couple of years, that the new development would suck the life out of Patrick Street. Again this was obviously incorrect and we have since had Mahon Point, Wilton and various other developments.</P>
      <P>We can cry wolf and paint a frightening picture, but it is not fair. As I said, 2,500 shops have closed under the existing legislation. Over the summer, I discussed with suppliers and traders their fears in terms of the proposals and raised these with the Minister at our parliamentary party meeting. Every Member of this House wants a successful trading system for groceries and other goods which will give consumers the best possible value for money. I listen carefully to the Competition Authority and do not try to second-guess it or prove it wrong. We need to look to the future and it is not helpful to look at shoe and clothing factories in Cork or Donegal because these are separate issues which have no relation to the legislation under discussion. It does the debate no good to raise these issues. While we should be proud of our minimum wage levels, these affect that kind of trading.</P>
      <P>I have examined all sides of this legislation and, as far as I can determine, it makes a positive contribution. Difficulties may crop up and accusations of dominance arise, although we were told the arrival of Lidl would result in the closure of everybody else but that prediction proved wrong. In the context of this relatively small country, we need to monitor these matters constantly. However, I do not believe in the old-fashioned idea that any competition will kill off everybody. With regard to the picture of closing shops painted by Deputy Boyle, my neighbour, a young married man, operates a small shop attached to his house. Last week, this single-handed operator doubled the size of his business. He is successful because he works extremely hard. There is room for people to progress.</P>
      <P>The debate on this and earlier legislation boils down to one issue, that is, controlling unfair trading, and all other matters are extraneous. Our job is to ensure that trading is controlled, an objective which is shared by everybody in this House. Like any legislation, this Bill may need amending. Longer serving and wiser heads in this House have seen previous occasions in which legislation had to be revisited.</P>
      <P>We heard a harrowing description of four major suppliers in the UK who control the entire market, yet three sentences later, we were told that 80% of the trade in Ireland is controlled by three enterprises. Effectively, the situation already exists here.</P>
      <P>I do not set myself up as an expert because my experience in this comes from buying goods in <Col N="1679"/>shops but we need to bring benefits to the consumer and I am hopeful that this legislation will achieve that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to say a few words about the extraordinary speech given by Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley which must qualify as the most brass-necked of the year. She regards it as somehow old-fashioned not to leap towards the abolition of the groceries order or to take a number of important and innovative steps which have aroused the intellects of the Progressive Democrats. The party she represents is extraordinary but is not particularly economically innovative. For example, it is in favour of private health care on public sites. In the case of transport, it favours an unending transfer of resources from the taxpayer to monopoly controllers of tolls. With regard to housing, its members are probably delighted that we have had approximately 81,000 housing finishes but have provided fewer than 6,000 public houses. It is a recipe for radical and unmitigated individual greed.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to hear the brash presentation of all this by a young Deputy who has not learned much from her short time in this House. The analysis she brought to bear on the grocery trade is extraordinary but I will say little more on this because I wish to address the inappropriate amendment this Bill brings to section 4 of the Competition Act.</P>
      <P>In 1967, when I was a young postgraduate economics student, I remember doing work on the changing structure of the retail trade. Nobody then could have anticipated the degree of change that has since taken place. The suggestion that consumers are interested solely in price is an appalling distortion of the nature of consumption in this and other sectors. Purchasers in the retail sector are interested in other issues, including convenience, time and packaging. A debate was held, for example, on the quantities in which goods are provided. Reports by the National Economic and Social Council and others have been compiled on the relationship between aged people and the retail sector.</P>
      <P>It is nonsense to suggest that consumer interests are served solely by issues of price. However, such a suggestion recommends itself to the Progressive Democrats Party which, in addition to abolishing the groceries order, wants to reassure every small garage, shop and stand-alone business that it is available for contributions. That is what may be called classical Progressive Democrats hypocrisy &mdash; a mixture of radical individualism and a longing for a kind of Poujadist appeal to the Irish political scene.</P>
      <P>The bright young Deputy from D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown did not reply to any of the issues raised by my colleague from County Galway on, for example, the systematic ignoring of the Oireachtas joint committee or the areas in which the consumer strategy group may have been <Col N="1680"/>wrong. I share the view of my colleague, Deputy Howlin, that the proposed amendment to section 4 will not achieve what it is purported to do and will have a structural effect in terms of changing diversity of choice and supply.</P>
      <P>Serious questions arise with regard to shifting the burden of regulation to the Competition Authority, which has disgraced itself. Last November, in a move which no doubt will recommend itself to the Progressive Democrats philosophy, it pursued a specific target, credit unions. After that it pursued artists, including musicians, freelance actors and photographers. In December 2003, it decided to initiate a review of the members of such groups.</P>
      <P>It went to the steps of the courts, effectively, with regard to Equity, the actors&rsquo; union and members of SIPTU in general, to insist that the union had no right to represent freelance actors. We should bear in mind that the number of registered actors is probably approximately 5,500. It was argued that because freelance actors were not regarded as PAYE workers by the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; this was the beginning of the Competition Authority&rsquo;s analysis &mdash; they were, therefore, independent contractors. The judgment is interesting in that it argues that because such people are not entitled to security of employment, maternity benefit, holidays or any other benefits associated with regulated employment, they are, in effect, contractors. The decision of the Competition Authority will not be confined to the artists I have mentioned. It will be applied to others who lose their jobs and are asked to contract back their services.</P>
      <P>The decision and the arguments made by the Competition Authority are very interesting. Section 2.15 of the decision reads as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1">As a starting point, we consider whether the Revenue Commissioners treat actors as employees subject to PAYE or as independent contractors. The Authority&rsquo;s investigation revealed that the vast majority of actors in the State are not treated as PAYE employees. While this one factor is not outcome determinative, it is a useful starting place.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It was a vicious starting place, based on a new kind of ignorance being imposed on practice. Very few actors are in permanent employment. The authority went on to state, in section 2.16 of its decision:</P>
      <P LI="1">Actors providing advertising services generally are not obliged to work for a single advertising agency. They may work for several at the same time.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Such actors generally do not receive the benefits one usually associates with a contract for labour. For example, they generally do not receive holiday pay, health insurance, maternity leave and the like.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Such actors generally do not have employment security.</P><Col N="1681"/>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Such actors are free to accept or decline a specific piece of work as they see fit.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <P FLI="0">An actor is expected to go from one source to another, for example, for recording an advertisement. The argument is based on the fact that actors do not have continuity of employment, but anyone who knows a whit about the nature of performance, acting, musicianship or photography will know that artists take work whenever they can get it and pay their taxes. Serious issues have been raised by this decision and the only way of dealing with them is to amend section 4 of the Act. Such an amendment will be proposed by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In March 2003, the Competition Authority initiated an investigation into alleged price-fixing between self-employed actors and advertising agencies. It struck down an agreement between SIPTU and the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland. The agreement in question suggested that before an actor accepted a fee less than that mentioned in the agreement, he or she would revert to the secretary of the union to determine whether to do so. The authority heard the complaint and made its decision. SIPTU had to give a signed undertaking that it would not represent freelance actors, including members of Equity. This tears apart a whole section of our trade union legislation. It is also in complete breach of a convention of the International Labour Organisation, details of which I will provide later. The decision is also an abuse of the right to trade union representation, as established in European law by the European Union.</P>
      <P>The Competition Authority&rsquo;s starting point, based on information from the Revenue Commissioners, was the startling discovery that the majority of artists were not PAYE workers. It went on to argue that under section 4 of the Competition Act, each individual artist was an undertaking. It extrapolated from this that what existed was a contract. I believe that Members of this House are humane and will want to support the amendment proposed by the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>Thankfully, the then head of the Competition Authority is now gone, and good riddance is my response, given his ideological choice of targets to establish competition, namely, credit unions, actors and occasionally, for the sake of appearances, the producers of food that Chihuahua dogs might eat.</P>
      <P>The right to collective representation cannot be swept aside in the name of competition, unless one is defining and construing competition improperly. The correct response to the position artists find themselves in is to change the Competition Act by amending section 4; to vindicate the Industrial Relations Act of 1990 and the basic Act of 1901; and to uphold the ILO convention, which is Regulation 87 of 1998, as well as the EU directive which the authority&rsquo;s decision breaches. <Col N="1682"/>The appropriate amendment to the Competition Act would be to insert after section 4 a provision establishing the right of a trade union to represent an individual who should not be defined as an undertaking.</P>
      <P>The implications of the case to which I have referred are important not just for artists but for all who are engaged in atypical employment, who find themselves under increasing pressure from the likes of the party Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley represents, which would like to destroy the security for workers that has been built up over 150 years. That is where the Progressive Democrats are coming from, be it in terms of justice or economics, it is somewhere out of the dark recesses of the 18th century. The decision will affect those who have been forced to trade in their jobs and who are being asked to offer their services as self-employed contractors. All such people, under the interpretation of the decision, will not only lose the benefit of employment protection legislation, they will also be prevented &mdash; I emphasise the scandal of this &mdash; from organising collectively to better their terms and conditions of service.</P>
      <P>The very same grounds that justify trade unions receiving recognition and immunity a century ago under the Acts to which I have referred also justify organising and collective bargaining by self-employed persons. How dare the Competition Authority insist that somebody who is forced not to have continuous employment &mdash; an artist, musician or anyone who as an individual has to sell his or her labour &mdash; does not have the right to be represented by a trade union. That is what was sought on the steps of the court by the authority to avoid the SIPTU representative, Ms Jane Bushell, going to jail. This is the body that will be the regulatory authority, a scandalous, discredited bunch of people, operating ideologically and directing their powers to date against easy and cheap targets. This does not mean I am opposed to competition. At the outset of my remarks I stated that I am in favour of diversity of supply and consumption, but I am not illiterate enough economically to suggest that we should all be governed only by price.</P>
      <P>If we accept the consequences of what I have described and if such people as I have mentioned are not allowed to organise and be represented, individually they are weak. United, however, they can achieve some rectification of the institutionalised inequality of bargaining power. If people wanted equality of competition in the supply of labour services, why should one side of the equation be allowed to organise but not the other?</P>
      <P>Our view in the Labour Party is that trade unions should be free to organise and negotiate collectively on behalf of their employed membership and on behalf of individuals who enter work under contract personally to execute any work. Such individuals, for the purposes of section 4 of the Act and of the decisions of the Competition <Col N="1683"/>Authority should not be classed as undertakings. The self-employed should continue to be prohibited from price-fixing against consumer interests, but it will be interesting, as we are on the verge of talks between the so-called social partners, to see whether this issue will be resolved before the talks begin. Any partnership model worth its salt should incorporate an openness to trade union membership.</P>
      <P>I founded a section of the WUI to represent lecturers in 1968-69. That union became the FWUI and then SIPTU. How could my brothers and sisters in SIPTU sit down and accept a situation where many of the people who had been in the trade union movement for such a long time would be denied the right of representation? It should be impossible but that is where we are, and it is interesting to be direct about it in this House.</P>
      <P>Everyone has the right to be represented in here but it is time to recognise the extreme views that support the situation I have described, the extremists in law, housing, health, trade union rights and competition, who reduce everyone to their price. One can imagine the Progressive Democrats standing outside the supermarket saying there is a penny off something today. We live much better, and their arrival on the political scene considerably cheapened it.</P>
      <P>The amendment I have suggested is essential to the Bill and I look forward to hearing the debate on Committee Stage. I was moved by the speeches of Members on all sides of the House representing a more generous time when they recognised the provision of retail activity as something that was not measured entirely by price but by the length of time a place was open, its proximity to those who needed it, good planning and physical and spatial factors such as access that are dismissed by the Competition Authority, factors as important as those praised by the cheapskate merchants who are trying to impose their economic misery on the rest of us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree to an extent, competition is a false god worshipped by some. It has distorted our views of the economy and society, two words I use deliberately because they do not mean the same thing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Higgins criticised the Competition Authority, talking about workers who are not always in the marketplace, such as actors, and the way in which the authority has dealt with their issues. In a previous life, I was in that category as a barrister. The Competition Authority has made recommendations that are ignorant of the circumstances and conditions that younger barristers must face. Only seven years ago there were 1,000 barristers and now there are 2,000 barristers but still the Competition Authority sees fit to ignore these facts. I am reminded of Screaming <Col N="1684"/>Lord Sutch, the head of the Monster Raving Looney Party, who complained that there was only one Monopolies Commission. Perhaps there should be another Competition Authority, or at least one with a broader view of society. Deputy Higgins made the point that price is not the only issue, just as the economy is not the only issue.</P>
      <P>Many speakers have used the phrase &ldquo;social infrastructure&rdquo;, referring to better planning in dealing with these issues. Some people might laugh at my referring to Foxrock, because it is a place used to deride those with too much money, but I was invited to visit the post mistress there to talk about her concerns on the post office and its future in the community. It is the only financial outlet in the village of Foxrock. I stood for 20 minutes waiting for the queue to disappear. It was not a particular day when there were more collections than any other, but the queue took a long time to dissipate because the post mistress knew everyone coming into the shop. She could quiz them on siblings and sore knees, she knew where they had been on holiday and could ask about children who had been sick. This impressed me because it proved to me there was more to the assessment of An Post than pounds, shillings and pence or balance sheets in the black.</P>
      <P>That is not considered fully when the Government makes decisions. Equally, the Competition Authority is blind to these factors and the circumstances on the ground. It is our job to stand back from all vested interests, including the Competition Authority, which has a specific outlook, and to look at the bigger picture of the economy and society.</P>
      <P>This Bill has some weaknesses. While I support what the Minister is doing, there are questions to be asked about enforcement. A list of worthy exclusions is given in section 15(<i>b</i>), where restrictions on certain practices are allowed, but that does not answer the question of how these provisions will be enforced. There must be stronger enforcement by the Competition Authority. Only one criminal prosecution was taken by the authority in 2004.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I would also like the Minister to tell us how a supplier is supposed to make a complaint to the Competition Authority against a major customer without destroying his relationship with the retailer and, possibly, the entire business. The Bill envisages on the one hand the supplier or undertaking bringing a case before the Circuit Court or the High Court, or on the other hand, the Competition Authority doing so. The figures show the authority is not effectively policing unfair practice in the economy and it is very difficult for a supplier to bring a case against a company with which he has close relations.</P>
      <P>Trying to show a particular undertaking is abusing its dominant position is fraught with diffi<Col N="1685"/>culty. First, it must be proved it is in a dominant position.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies O&rsquo;Flynn, Cassidy, Moloney, Finneran and Sexton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan"><NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate is timely in so far as every Member of the House would support the allocation of more resources for the care of the elderly. It is important to acknowledge the additional &euro;110 million of revenue funding provided in the most recent budget. We must also note that people now live longer, obtain hospital treatment faster which ensures they have a better quality of life, see more specialists and work in healthier workplaces. In addition, people with disabilities are finally receiving priority and supports. For these reasons, the number of elderly people is greater than ever.</P>
      <P>It is Government policy to ensure older people can remain at home in dignity and independence if this is their wish, while providing high quality residential care for those who can no longer remain at home in dignity and independence. It should be the policy of every Government to ensure our senior citizens can remain in the environs to which they have become accustomed, which is what they seek.</P>
      <P>One of the down sides of a successful economy, in our case the Celtic tiger, is that with an increasing number of people in employment, families have less time to look after elderly parents or aunts and uncles. It disappoints me to receive telephone calls from members of families to tell me they are being put under pressure by Kilkenny General Hospital to take an elderly relative home on the basis that the hospital has done everything in its power for the person and <Col N="1687"/>there is no medical reason for him or her to continue to use a high support bed when more urgent cases are waiting to be admitted to the hospital. In such circumstances, family members will often argue that as both spouses work, they do not have the wherewithal to look after their elderly relative.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Government continues to make provision to support elderly people, including funding for the home help service which they need to continue to live at home. The home help service, the cornerstone of community based care for older people, is delivered as part of the community support service. The investment the Government makes in the service is money well spent. A cost benefit analysis would demonstrate that the service provides much greater value for money than the large investments required in our regional, general and local hospitals.</P>
      <P>It is also important to continue funding day care hospitals, which elderly people, including many who live alone in rural settings, avail of to meet other people in similar positions. Whether they visit such centres once or twice a week or on a daily basis, they enhance their quality of life and deserve support. I commend the Government&rsquo;s policy on the care of the elderly and wish more resources could be allocated to this sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Media reports in recent months have highlighted the dreadful conditions some older people are forced to endure. This shameful and disgraceful mistreatment of some of the most vulnerable people in society is appalling. It is incumbent on all of us in many capacities &mdash; as sons, daughters, relatives, neighbours and taxpayers &mdash; to value and care for older people. Nevertheless, the vast majority of care homes and carers are doing a remarkable job.</P>
      <P>A report produced and published this week by the National Economic and Social Forum confirmed what most of us already knew, namely, that older people want to continue to live in their homes and communities, rather than moving to nursing homes and hospitals. They want to live as independently as possible and it has been Government policy to support them in doing so since the publication of the document, The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly. Unfortunately, resources have not always been available to make this commitment a reality.</P>
      <P>The Government is all too aware that investment in services for older people has ground to make up. In recognition of this fact, I commend my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, for ensuring that &euro;150 million was allocated for new services for older people in this year&rsquo;s budget. This money will cover a wide range of services, including home care packages, support packages, home helps, meals on wheels, day and respite care, palliative care and sheltered housing.</P><Col N="1688"/>
      <P>The home help service is the cornerstone of community based care for older people. A sum of &euro;30 million has been allocated to home helps in 2006. This will provide for an additional 1.7 million home help hours. The home help service provides invaluable assistance to elderly people and a guarantee of independence and dignity. This is particularly important given the changing face of modern Ireland. We all lead busier lives, commuting long distances and often living far from where we grew up. Many older people in my constituency live alone and no longer have a relative or neighbour living nearby to look in and check how they are. A daily visit is a lifeline for such people and an invaluable means of ensuring that any signs of neglect or abuse are detected in the early stages.</P>
      <P>The NESF report found that low level supports, if provided at the right time, can have better outcomes for older people compared to services provided at times of crisis. Older people are not only vulnerable to abuse and neglect in their own homes. The Leas Cross case highlighted that while many great nursing homes across the country provide excellent services to older people and their families, others have no place in providing care for older people.</P>
      <P>At present random inspections of nursing homes are carried out by the Health Service Executive but the findings are not published. The practice of random inspections should be continued and improved. Abuse of the elderly can be difficult to detect, especially if the individuals in question are frail or suffering from dementia. Furthermore, vulnerable old people may be too scared and intimidated to speak out about substandard conditions. It is vital that inspectors speak to patients and their families to learn about any concerns they may have.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, some older people have no relatives or are left to their fate once they enter a nursing home. It is vital that this group has a voice. They should be assigned a representative who can act as their voice and make their concerns, fears and worries known to the relevant authorities. Patients must not only be interviewed but also medically examined to ensure they are being properly cared for. The Government must send out a loud and clear message that it will not tolerate substandard care of elderly people or stand back and allow abuse of the elderly to take place.</P>
      <P>Perhaps there is a case for establishing an older person&rsquo;s ombudsman, an idea I float tonight in the hope that the Minister will consider it. This body or individual would work in a similar way to the successful Ombudsman for Children. In effect, it would mean that older people would have an ambassador, that is, a person or office established to safeguard their rights. This independent body would have powers to investigate complaints by older people or their representatives against public bodies. I hope the Minister will consider my proposal.</P><Col N="1689"/>
      <P>I commend the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, for expediting the proposed legislation which is being drafted. It will be fine legislation which Members will have an opportunity to debate. While progress has been made in the care of the elderly in terms of funding home help services, increases in the old age pension and fuel allowances, we must also ensure that this vulnerable section of our population is cared for, valued and safe. Anyone who has been in hospital in the past year or two will understand the vulnerability one feels as a hospital patient and appreciate the amount of care and attention one receives from hospital and care staff. Having been a recipient of the care and attention of staff while in hospital last year, I commend all carers in the health service. It is only when one receives it that one realises the importance of the service they provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, on his role in the Department, particularly for the increased funding for the elderly. While this debate is not entirely focussed on funding, it is important to recognise the &euro;110 million extra for the elderly, and &euro;302 million in total between 1997 and 2005. An increase of this magnitude confirms the Government&rsquo;s approach to extra funding, which is in place, and we will reap the benefits. Given the increase in the elderly population it is right that the funding should increase. According to the 2002 census 11.3% of the population was over 65 years of age and the projected figure by 2031 is 21%. That must focus our attention on the need to provide adequate facilities and resources for the elderly.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the motion and recognise that we need supervision for our elderly, we must also provide services for the elderly. I welcome the increase in home help services and the home care package, which is specifically geared towards the needs of the elderly. I welcome the active day care centres where facilities are available for the elderly during the day as distinct from overnight facilities. I welcome that so many levels of activity are available, and the increase in respite.</P>
      <P>Far more can be done. It is not enough to demand more funding from the Department or that the Minister be more proactive in specific areas. Much can be done through community based initiatives. I commend to local authorities and local public representatives the securing of funding under the voluntary housing schemes for the elderly. If this was happening in every town and village we would not have such a high level of dependency on nursing homes or hospitals for the elderly. The levels of funding amaze me and I am pleased that in my home town, Mountmellick, such a scheme is available and will open next month. Between 95% and 98% of funding is available for such projects, and retired religious staff are often available to monitor the needs of <Col N="1690"/>the elderly. Rather than demand extra places in houses of care or hospitals we should be more proactive in the community and keep the elderly active, involved and engaged with the community. Funding available for centres within those housing compounds should target the needs of the elderly and keep them out of confinement for as long as possible. We should progress these matters and rely on the extra funding being made available by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Many of us had firsthand evidence of problems in nursing homes by way of inspection and in some cases homes have been closed. Stories of what led to such closures would make people concerned. We must press as fast as we can to ensure inspections occur on a regular basis and without forewarning. If we secure extra funding, make it available and prepare extra facilities it is equally important that we are constantly vigilant to ensure that while our elderly are in care they are being properly cared for. The only way we can do that is by surprise inspections and a code of practice for nursing homes.</P>
      <P>I recognise the Minister of State&rsquo;s involvement in the care of the elderly. I am glad there is a specific brief in that regard, and the test must be the recognition of extra funding for the elderly on a continuous basis.</P>

	<P>If the Deputy only had another minute he would be supporting us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, on the work he does with particular emphasis on providing support and help to the elderly. We must be conscious that age and an aging population will be a reality into the future. It is the case across Europe and will be on our doorsteps in the near future. We must make provision for that and deal with the current position. I, and many others, have been supportive and have spoken many times on the issue of people being cared for at home. Having worked in the health service for nearly 20 years I saw firsthand some of the unnecessary hospitalisation of people, sometimes for suspect reasons or because the nation or the Government had not thought out alternatives to institutional care for our elderly, whether in a long-stay hospital, nursing home or welfare home. While these provide excellent care in most cases it is not in keeping with the wishes of our elderly, which is to be cared for in their own homes.</P>
      <P>In past finance debates I have spoken about the opportunity in other countries for people to take out insurance cover during their working lives to provide a home help, care or nursing system in their twilight years. The insurance companies have not introduced such a scheme, although they are readily available in many countries such as the US, Australia and some European countries. This should be promoted and I call on the VHI, BUPA and others to examine this area. This would be similar to the home help <Col N="1691"/>system provided by the State but through an insurance policy.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Government in particular on the increased funds for the care of the elderly. A number of areas must be emphasised, which sometimes are cheap options which are overlooked. The opportunity of day care is not developed or encouraged to the level I would expect. In different counties people have come together, added a number of rooms to a health centre and bus in up to 100 people on a five-day week basis. Staff work through a social economy or F&Aacute;S system at little cost to the State. It gives people the opportunity to use the facilities, get meals and have social interaction, which is important.</P>
      <P>To be parochial, I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the need for investment in the major elderly hospital in County Roscommon, namely the Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon town. Some of the accommodation has been there since the time of the Famine. I would like to see an investment there. The Minister for Health and Children visited the hospital, but there is a need for a major investment in the Alzheimer&rsquo;s unit and the other three units.</P>
      <P>We should encourage communities to develop social housing in their areas. This is an ideal opportunity for people to congregate in a village setting in units where they have a communal facility. We do not have enough of those nationally, yet there is adequate money in the Department for them. This is not promoted enough in some communities. I compliment the Minister of State on the good work he is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaeSextonPD"><NameTxt>Ms Sexton</NameTxt>
	<P>I recognise that many pertinent points have been made so I will focus on just a few regarding the care of the elderly. However, I feel it would be remiss of me not to make reference to a contribution made here last night by a member of the Opposition, which I believe was an inappropriate and derogatory reference to the child care needs of our fellow European citizens, especially Latvians and Poles. That the remarks were made at all is reprehensible, but that they were uttered by a well educated member of the so-called caring profession makes it all the more disappointing and unacceptable. I urge that more considered and tempered language be used in the future. It is not necessary to denigrate one section of the community to make a point about another sector.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed to hear members of the Opposition state their full and certain belief that no changes were made regarding the issue of nursing home care. During a very successful conference called Aging Ireland &mdash; Shaping the Future, which was held by the Progressive Democrats in 2004, a consultation process was held where advice from independent contributors and key stakeholders representing the elderly were considered. The promoter of the seminar was <Col N="1692"/>none other than the T&aacute;naiste. To suggest that the Government, the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, or the Minister for Health and Children does not have a commitment to the elderly is absurd. No one individual or party has a monopoly on compassion.</P>
      <P>The charges levelled in the motion defy the facts, such as the &euro;110 million announced as additional funding in the budget for care of the elderly, which is the equivalent of &euro;150 million in a full year. Since 1997, additional spending in excess of &euro;300 million has been provided for health care services. This record investment will deliver home care support packages, home help, stay and respite centres, specialist palliative care, increased meals on wheels services and more sheltered housing. We know that we must put additional funding into these areas. This investment will also allow for many more excellent initiatives in primary and community care for the elderly, all of which illustrates the inaccuracy of the views expressed in the Private Members&rsquo; motion. The Government is committed to making meaningful progress in the care of the elderly and I wish that the motion was more proactive in its content, rather than critical.</P>
      <P>Investment is particularly evident with regard to the abuse of the elderly in care, which is an issue underlying the Opposition motion. A total of &euro;4.5 million has been provided and ring-fenced to implement the recommendations of the report entitled Protecting Our Future, which provides the definition of abuse of the elderly and gives the more vulnerable older person the confidence to report his or her concerns. The draft heads of the social services inspectorate legislation are at an advanced stage and are expected to be submitted to the Government, which will provide for an office of the chief inspector of social services and the welcome establishment of a registration system in respect of residential services for older people, children and people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The national nursing homes steering committee was established last July and was charged with standardising inspection documentation, making the inspection information as transparent as possible. All of us look forward to the day when all that information will be available on the Internet. The motion is misleading to pretend that the public cannot access information. The public can access information on request from both the HSE and nursing homes.</P>
      <P>Caring for the elderly in the home is the way forward and I am delighted at the significant levels of increased funding for the elderly, which will be targeted at insuring that older people in this country can access their needs in the most appropriate setting of their choice. I have every confidence that the Government will continue to ensure that the funding is directed to that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse everything that has been said by Deputy Sexton. I congratulate the Minister of State on the work he is doing. He is a great <Col N="1693"/>friend and colleague and his father before him gave great service to the State as a Member of this House for over 20 years.</P>
      <P>The care of the elderly is an area that must be supported by everyone, regardless of party affiliation. I was a member of the Midland Health Board from 1985 to 2002 and I am very aware of the hard work and the dedication of the staff in all our institutions which care for the elderly in Westmeath, Longford, Laois and Offaly. The care being given to our senior citizens in private nursing homes is also second to none. The nursing staff should get gold medals for their commitment and for what they are doing in the interest of our elderly senior citizens. I have great respect for the professionals from the health service who are Members of this House.</P>
      <P>I have respect for the Fine Gael Member who contributed to this debate last night. I listened very attentively to the Deputy&rsquo;s remarks and we cannot beat the professionals with the experience coming in here and assisting the Government. That is good oppositional politics. I agree with Deputy Sexton on some of the views made by the Deputy, but I would welcome in the House the expertise displayed in the committees, and the public will appreciate it far more.</P>
      <P>The allocation that has been made regarding the long-stay home subvention and additional long-stay bed capacity has to be welcomed. In particular, I welcome the threshold by which a person can now enter a nursing home. If the house is worth &euro;250,000, the person is now entitled to a subvention. There are many people whose parents are in nursing homes who are becoming the new poor in Ireland because their parents did not qualify for a subvention. Parents went into long-term care, hoping to come home as soon as possible, but were left in a situation where they had to sell the family home and spend all the money on care before a subvention was granted. The Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, as well as the Minister for Finance, are aware of the difficulties in our midland region and have the experience to bring this before the House. I welcome the fact that the threshold is now &euro;500,000 for Dublin and &euro;300,000 for the rest of the country. It has been an enormous assistance and it will leave many people in nursing homes and long-stay institutions with much peace and happiness.</P>
      <P>I welcome the efforts being made by the Government on long-stay care, as well as the strongly held views of the Opposition and the professional advice which Members can give the Government. We are all trying to achieve the same result at the end of the day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sharing time with Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Cowley, Finian McGrath, Healy, Connolly and James Breen.</P>
      <P>I thank the Fine Gael Party for bringing this motion before the House. Yesterday in the House we spoke about the new trend towards privatis<Col N="1694"/>ation in the health service. There is a section of the health service, however, which has been privatised for quite some time, namely, the nursing homes area. It is a lucrative business. It is a business and not a vocation for this new breed of entrepreneur which might as well be selling carpets or second-hand cars for all the sensitivity shown sometimes to the elderly and most vulnerable people in our community.</P>
      <P>That is shameful and clearly these people are being treated as a commodity. We are talking about the old, the infirm, the sick being treated as a commodity. The less regulation we have the more profit they can make. That is the bottom line. We could be cynical and say the Government is delaying while they make more money on the backs of these very vulnerable people. We are heading now towards the lowest common denominator. When I spoke in the House previously about this I gave examples of what was happening. I was told this by a nurse who had contacted me and these stories are really quite appalling. She spoke of a nursing home in Cabra where she works. Older people there would sometimes wet themselves at night. They were not properly dried and the uric acid would give rise to bed sores. Why did this happen? It was because the staff members were poorly paid and were not properly motivated. This is what is going on.</P>
      <P>To save money sometimes they would not get the extra glass of milk they asked for. If they were given bread, it was pre-buttered. Skimping on basic necessities, they were kept downstairs in the cellar very often. As she said, they were very often doped out of their minds with Valium so that they could go to bed earlier. This is what is going on and why we need inspections. I ask the Minister of State not to delay any further on this. It is going on wholesale because people want to make money. That is at the root of the problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State told me in the House on 21 June last that he would come back with information. At that stage I had said there were 33 nursing homes that had received adverse inspection reports. The Minister of State said that he would get back to me and that it was not a problem. He said: &ldquo;It is not our intention to defend nursing homes which do not provide an acceptable level of care, particularly where the Department has assisted people to move into long-term care.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister of State promised, on 21 June 2005, that he would get back with that information about the 33 nursing homes that had received adverse reports, and I am still waiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to delay matters, but I will speak to the Deputy about it later. I have followed through on the commitment I gave him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Minister of State to do so, and to put it on the record of the House. <Col N="1695"/>It is very important that we have openness and transparency and that we get to the truth. As this society becomes older &mdash; and this is happening throughout Europe &mdash; this will become probably the most important issue, along with pensions and care for the elderly. Our health services will cost more and more money because people are getting older and more people will have to go into nursing homes. I ask the Minister of State to move on this legislation as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion tabled by the Fine Gael Deputies and I commend their initiative. The Government&rsquo;s amendment, quite simply, is not adequate. It rows back on the commitment given by both the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste last year in the wake of the Leas Cross nursing home scandal. Both the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste clearly committed to an independent nursing homes inspectorate. There can be no question about that and people will recall one of the most revealing moments in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; documentary which exposed the disgraceful ill-treatment of elderly and vulnerable people in Leas Cross. One of the Leas Cross staff was secretly filmed after a visit to the home from the health board&rsquo;s inspector. She said: &ldquo;They were just concerned with the paperwork&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The health board and later, the Health Service Executive inspectors, failed to protect these elderly people and that is the bottom line. I have no doubt that some improvements have been made in the inspectorate regime for nursing homes, but why did these elderly people have to suffer, and why did we have to wait until it was exposed in the media before action was taken? It is estimated that at least &euro;500 million of public moneys has been ploughed into nursing homes since the tax reliefs were introduced in 1997. The owners of Leas Cross benefited from this tax break, but we have not been told by how much.</P>
      <P>Sinn F&eacute;in believes this money should be spent, not on subsidising private facilities, but on public health and social services including nursing homes for the elderly and greatly improved care and support for them in their homes and in other community settings. Today the D&aacute;il took the Report Stage of the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill. The National Economic and Social Forum comes into its remit and on Monday of this week it issued another very important report, which has not received the attention it deserves. I have no doubt the Minister of State has taken the time to consider it, but the report is entitled Care for Older People. Describing the barriers to the development of community services for the elderly, it refers to &ldquo;perverse investment incentives&rdquo;. The present official funding of services is not consistent with the policy objective of encouraging community based responses, says the report. Considerable resources are invested in nursing home care <Col N="1696"/>responses, some of which are unnecessary and inappropriate.</P>
      <P>This reinforces the point about the use of tax subsidies for private nursing homes. It is little wonder that the scandal of Leas Cross and other homes has occurred. The NESF report quotes from the report of the working party on services for the elderly, from 1988. That identified lack of co-ordination of services as a key concern. That lack of co-ordination, sadly, today remains largely as it was back in 1988.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment refers to the social services inspectorate and speaks of extending its remit and recommendations. If that is the case, then it should extend them in line with the recommendations in this area in the NESF report. The remit of the social services inspectorate, it says, should be extended on a statutory basis to include all care settings for older people &mdash; residential, community, home-based, private, State-owned or whatever, with the necessary trained staff and financial resources.</P>
      <P>It says inspection findings should be published, with sanctions for non-compliance with standards. The principles of autonomy and person-centredness should inform the development and implementation of standards. These should be clear, adequate and developed in consultation with users. Standards of care for older people and acute hospitals, says the NESF, should also be developed. It recommends the proactive development of higher standards to move care towards quality of life measures. It says standards need to be developed across all service levels, from front line service delivery, organisation of care, planning integration and strategic development.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State say whether the NESF report will be left to gather dust, just like its predecessors on equality in hospital care and on social housing? I appeal to the Minister of State that this must not be allowed to happen. Older citizens and those in need of care within nursing home provision all deserve better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is hard to say all one wishes to say in two minutes but I will try. People have referred to the fact that there are so many private nursing homes. Only 5% of the population end up in nursing homes but the difficulty is that there appears to be a rush on the part of the Government to allow people to make money out of older people. While there are very fine people doing that, unscrupulous people will cut corners and care standards will suffer.</P>
      <P>An independent inspection system is most important. It should be extended across the board. Why do exemptions exist? Currently, only institutions that are registered under the nursing homes Act will be visited. Why are there exemptions under this Act for institutions that have &ldquo;handicapped people&rdquo;? That should not be the case. How would the State institutions fare under the inspections that nursing homes get? I doubt that many of them would fare well given their <Col N="1697"/>decrepit and old, falling buildings. That must come, however, and the sooner the better. There should be no exceptions.</P>
      <P>Approximately 95% of people will remain at home and there must be support for them. I was disappointed that when I met the Minister of State with the Irish Council for Social Housing it was not possible to increase the funding, except marginally, for a defined revenue funding scheme to keep people in their communities. The Government pays lip service to that. I welcome the improvements in that regard, in the home subvention scheme and so forth, but a defined revenue funding scheme could have taken 20% of people out of the nursing home situation.</P>
      <P>Funding uncertainty for people in nursing homes should be rectified. Our spending on social protection for older people is just 60% of the EU average. We should spend more and it should be spent on keeping people in their homes and, when that is not possible, in sheltered housing. That should be supported by a defined revenue funding scheme. The scheme needs &euro;2 million, not &euro;500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this motion and on the urgent need for an independent inspection regime for all nursing homes. This is a key issue which is of major importance for our elderly. They deserve a quality service, respect for their dignity and an opportunity to live out their final years in comfort.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to thank and commend the many nursing homes in the State which carry out excellent but difficult work. I also commend the magnificent work of the staff. We have heard the bad stories but we must thank those who have given great care and have been examples of good practice. It is important to make that point when debating this issue. The vast majority of staff working in nursing homes are doing an excellent job.</P>
      <P>However, that does not mean there should be complacency about the rights of our elderly. It is time to end all the old guff about care for the elderly in their homes and communities. It is time for action and investment. There are thousands of elderly who are living alone, who are lonely and without back-up services.</P>
      <P>I must also raise the issue of the biggest robbery in three decades. The Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision to reject the Government&rsquo;s Health (Amendment) Bill confirmed the biggest theft of our time. I speak tonight on behalf of the elderly. A sum of &euro;3 billion was stolen from more than 300,000 older people over 30 years. The implications of the Travers report were devastating and clearly showed up the State-sanctioned elder abuse that went on for three decades. It also showed the complete lack of political leadership by successive Governments.</P>
      <P>This motion is about improving the care of the elderly in nursing homes. It is about keeping <Col N="1698"/>families informed and satisfied about the standards of care in nursing homes. I urge all Deputies to support this excellent motion on<?oasys _jy ?>caring for the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to make the point, in view of some of the contributions to this debate, that everybody across the political divide is anxious to see our elderly live out their lives at home in their communities and availing of day care centres and sheltered housing. It is only in a situation where they are no longer able to avail of those services that the nursing home option is considered. The vast majority of patients in public or private nursing homes are there as a last resort.</P>
      <P>An important point must be made about those patients and families who have, effectively, been forced into private nursing homes. These people are medical card holders who would otherwise qualify for public care. Their families are in severe financial difficulty as the subvention system is simply inadequate. It has not been upgraded since it was introduced almost ten years ago. A patient in a nursing home on an old age pension of &euro;180 per week and a maximum health board subvention of approximately &euro;240 per week must pay approximately &euro;150 per week. That is the situation for each family. It is unacceptable and it must be changed. Those patients are entitled to public care and that should be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>Elderly people in nursing homes are generally as vulnerable and utterly reliant on other people for their care as young babies who are totally dependent on their parents in their first months and years of life. These elderly residents of nursing homes have, by and large, contributed massively to society and warrant commensurate treatment.</P>
      <P>A general level of care is important but these people have a right to a dignified existence, with the right to intellectual stimulation and rights of association and participation with staff and other residents. It is important to check the length of time staff spend interacting verbally with patients. Patients should be kept abreast of current affairs and not out of sight.</P>
      <P>The remit or responsibility of a nursing home inspectorate should extend to Northern Ireland where our Health Service Executive subvents many nursing home residents. We should know how people are treated in nursing homes in Northern Ireland. Another issue is mealtimes and bedtimes, which should be subject to scrutiny by the inspector. Last meals, for example, are sometimes served at 4.30 p.m., with patients pushed off to bed afterwards. That is not sensible or right. These are quality of life issues which must be considered.</P>
      <P>A new practice is the grading of price structures in a nursing home. In other words, a patient might go into the home under package A which entitles them to a physiotherapist and, perhaps, a walk during the day or a different type of meal. <Col N="1699"/>That is a dangerous precedent and it should be nipped in the bud.</P>
      <P>In addition, the concept of unannounced visits should be an important part of the inspectorate&rsquo;s duties. We saw the farce that occurred in the psychiatric services where it was known when the inspectors would arrive and everybody naturally put their best foot forward. The visits should be unannounced. I support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is shameful that today, 1 February 2006, we are debating the lack of legislation to provide for an independent statutorily-based inspection regime for all nursing homes. In 2001, promises were made about the introduction of such legislation and it was only the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme broadcast in May 2005 which tweaked the conscience of the Government and brought about further debate.</P>
      <P>In June 2005, the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that legislation would be before the House in the autumn to improve inspection powers and increase the number of inspections of nursing homes. Since then how many extra inspection teams have been established? How many of the recommended two annual visits to each of the 479 nursing homes in the country have taken place? What standardisation of actual inspections has been effected to ensure all nursing homes meet suitably high criteria of care? I hope I can get answers today as it is impossible to get that information elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach told the House on 1 June 2005 that these changes were already being implemented under the new Health Service Executive and that new legislation would be before the D&aacute;il in the autumn. On 29 September 2005 all members of the Opposition urged that the legislation be introduced immediately. On that date the T&aacute;naiste was sent into the House, presumably so the Taoiseach could not be accused of telling half truths or lies. When pressed as to when we might see the proposed legislation the T&aacute;naiste hesitated, dithered, paused and fudged. Eventually she almost said yes, that it might come before us in the autumn.</P>
      <P>On that date the T&aacute;naiste told the House: &ldquo;A strong focus of Government actions this autumn will be on care of the elderly issues&rdquo;. For a subject that is such a priority for our Taoiseach and a burning issue for both the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, it beggars belief that the reason legislation was not even on the A list was because the Bill had not been cleared by Government.</P>
      <P>Who else must die before this Government acts? Is it not enough that the whole country witnessed the scandalous treatment and death of Peter McKenna and the scandals of Rostrevor House, Rathfarnham nursing home and Leas Cross? Shame and shame again on the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State. They are a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1700"/>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. I am pleased that the Minister with responsibility for the elderly is here. The State can be judged on how it deals with its most vulnerable people, our young people, those with disabilities and our elderly. In all these areas the Government has failed dismally to provide the quality of life our most vulnerable deserve.</P>
      <P>Our most vulnerable elderly, those in nursing homes and those incapable of independent living have been the most neglected. This is manifested in many ways, including the neglect of the home help service and the lack of step-down beds for those leaving hospitals. There is pressure on families to accept people from hospitals who are not physically ready to go back into their community.</P>
      <P>One of the worst areas of neglect is the control and inspection of nursing homes. The regulations on nursing homes were hailed as a panacea that would ensure the elderly in nursing homes would have a basic standard of service and quality of life. Without an independent statutory based inspection regime, these regulations are useless. They are not worthy of the paper on which they are written. It is obvious the current inspectors have failed to produce reports that are accessible and available to the public, the nursing home residents and their families, who on numerous occasions have spoken at Deputies&rsquo; clinics of their concerns about the treatment of our elderly in nursing homes. I am sure the Minister of State has experience of this, particularly on account of his responsibility in this area. He must agree there is serious concern in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Government has no commitment to care of the elderly in the community or in the residential sector. The Minister has dragged her heels on the issue. The proposals put forward by Deputy Twomey will protect the elderly in every area of society. The Government has made repeated promises in this regard. It has regularly stated that it recognised the problem and would deal with it. Legislation was promised before the end of 2005, but nothing happened. In April 2005, the T&aacute;naiste gave commitments in the health strategy Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System For You, as did her predecessor in the social partnership agreements of 2003 and 2004. In An Agreed Programme for Government of June 2002 another predecessor gave a similar commitment. On the establishment of the social service inspectorate on a statutory basis, we were promised an extension of this remit to other social services, including residential services for older people. However, nothing has been done.</P>
      <P>There is growing pressure on people with regard to the cost of nursing home facilities. Charges have increased dramatically in recent years, but no attempt has been made by Government to address this. The current subvention levels came into effect in 2001. Nursing home charges have increased substantially in the past five years, yet the subvention does not reflect the <Col N="1701"/>proportional support envisaged in 2001 for the cost of nursing home care. A formula was determined in 2001 that worked out the subvention in proportion to the costs at that time. This has not been updated. The Minister of State should immediately revise the three rates of subvention payable at the three levels of dependancy, medium, high and maximum.</P>
      <P>I was extremely disappointed that despite some indications this would be reviewed, the Minister of State informed me yesterday there are no plans to increase subvention rates at present. Will the Minister of State revisit this issue and respond to the pressures placed on nursing home residents and their families?</P>
      <P>As life expectancy grows, it is important to give particular consideration to the mental health needs of older people and to provide a comprehensive range of services appropriate to their needs. Unfortunately, our current psychiatric service for the elderly is totally inadequate. It is no response for our elderly with psychiatric and emotional difficulties. People of advanced years are faced with stresses and challenges resulting from the loss of people closely attached to them, changes in their vocational and social roles and the depletion of their general health and physical capacities.</P>
      <P>There are only 62 acute designated assessment and treatment beds for mental health services for older people. Some are in specially designed locations with acute general hospital units. Others are available from the mental health service for older people on request from the general psychiatric area rather than being specially designated for the elderly. There are just seven day hospitals providing a service for fewer than 100 places and only 469 continuing care beds. There are major gaps in current mental health services for older people. These include absence of mental health services for older people in many catchment areas, incomplete multidisciplinary representations in almost all existing mental health services for older people&rsquo;s teams and lack of specialised assessment and treatment in most acute admissions. There is inadequate accommodation in continuing care facilities under mental health legislation. I would comment further on this if I had the opportunity. There is a lack of dedicated day hospital facilities in almost all services and a lack of services on recovery and positive coping skills in existing service positions.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State must as a matter of urgency give priority to establishing comprehensive specialists for mental health services for older people where none currently exists. There is an urgent need for physical resources essential to service delivery. Acute beds and continuing care service headquarters and community based day facilities should be provided for the elderly with mental health difficulties. We need a full examination by the Minister of State on the needs of the elderly with psychiatric difficulties, much <Col N="1702"/>of which come with age, and of the difficulties experienced by people dealing with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>We must acknowledge that the majority of private nursing homes provide excellent care to their patients and that many families are grateful to be able to avail of the services of such homes for their relatives. However, this debate is very important. Its purpose is to ensure our elderly will be well cared for in our nursing homes. The &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme showed what happened in some nursing homes and demonstrated for us why the putting in place of the inspectorate is so important.</P>
      <P>Why are there such long waiting lists for our public nursing homes, for example, the long-stay care in Merlin Park Hospital in Galway which has a two or three-year waiting list? St. Brendan&rsquo;s nursing home in Loughrea also has a two or three-year waiting list. The State should be in a position to provide more public nursing homes. Many of our public nursing homes provide excellent care. I visited one in Clifden recently where the patients get top class care.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for an older person living alone to get a place or to afford private nursing home care. A person on an old age pension without relatives could not afford the &euro;500 or &euro;600 a week charged. Many of these people are denied subvention through an anomaly in the means test.</P>
      <P>In the budget the Minister for Finance used a sleight of hand when he pretended to raise the thresholds to &euro;500,000 for a house in Dublin and &euro;300,000 for a house in rural areas. However, he did not really raise them. If a house in a rural area is valued at over &euro;300,000, the owner does not qualify for the subvention. If, for example, one&rsquo;s house is worth &euro;250,000, 5% of the value of the house is assessed as income. This amounts to approximately &euro;12,500. The income limit to qualify for the full subvention is &euro;11,000 and therefore if one&rsquo;s house is valued at &euro;250,000, one does not qualify for the subvention.</P>
      <P>It is all very fine for the Health Service Executive or the Minister to ask why relatives do not sell the house and cater for the owner in a nursing home but many people in nursing homes really believe they will be returning to their houses the following summer. They believe they would be cutting all ties with their communities if they sold their houses. Selling one&rsquo;s house, therefore, is not a viable proposition. Irrespective of who remains in a house after the owner enters a nursing home, even if nobody remains in the house, 5% of the value of the house is regarded as income. This is codology in respect of people in rural areas who enter nursing homes.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment notes the Government is committed to introducing legislation which, <i>inter alia</i>, will establish the social services inspectorate function on a statutory basis. The Minister for Health and Children, the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Power, and the <Col N="1703"/>Taoiseach promised in the D&aacute;il that the legislation would be introduced last autumn, but we are still waiting. In the meantime, many people in nursing homes may be suffering from treatment similar to that exposed in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme.</P>
      <P>There were numerous promises in 2001 to introduce a nursing home inspection regime. The Government committed in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, Sustaining Progress, the social partnership agreement for 2003 to 2005 and An Agreed Programme for Government, dated June 2002, to the establishment of a social services inspectorate on a statutory basis and to the extension of its remit to other social services, including residential services for older people. This was stated by the T&aacute;naiste in the House on 4 April 2005.</P>
      <P>Research has shown that most people would prefer to live out their lives in their own homes and communities. However, nothing is geared to help this happen, particularly in rural areas. County councils and the Health Service Executive ran out of money last year. I could quote letters referring to there being no money for the essential repairs grant for the elderly. Sometimes people are forced into nursing homes as a result of their not being able to carry out such repairs. Letters refer to there being no money for the disabled person&rsquo;s grant. I knew of some people who applied for it but who passed away before it was sanctioned. They might have been looking for a downstairs bedroom or bathroom as a result of their being unable to go upstairs, but no money was made available for the necessary work.</P>
      <P>Home help hours have been cut back seriously. I recently dealt with the case of an 88-year-old woman in my area of Clonbur whose son was trying to keep her in the house for as long as possible. Up to last September, he was receiving eight hours of home help but the number of hours was then cut to four. He struggled as best he could and I have been struggling ever since to have the eight hours help restored. If I succeed, he will be able to keep his elderly mother, who suffers from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, in his own home.</P>
      <P>When I contact the Health Service Executive about this problem, officials tell me they cannot allow eight hours because of the embargo on recruitment. When I asked the Minister about this on 25 January, I was told the Department had not imposed an embargo on recruitment for home help services. She also stated &euro;30 million has been provided for the home help service in 2006, which will provide 1.6 million extra home help hours. When I contacted the Health Service Executive, the officials said they never heard of this. Will somebody please send the Minister&rsquo;s message to the executive, particularly in my area, and tell it there is no embargo on the recruitment of home help staff, who would enable people to <Col N="1704"/>stay in their own communities for as long as possible?</P>
      <P>This generation is losing out greatly and it will be regretted by our grandchildren and others that we are putting our elderly relatives in nursing homes and institutional care rather than keeping them at home. The value of elderly persons in the community and their experience of life cannot be measured, nor can the value to grandchildren of having an elderly person in the home or an adjacent home.</P>
      <P>If more resources were allocated for home help, the essential repairs grant for the elderly and the disabled person&rsquo;s grant, we would have a better community entirely. There is no point in stating fancy figures, such as the &euro;150 million allocated in the budget and the Social Welfare Bill for the care of the elderly, because the results are not seen on the ground. Is the money going into administration? Where is the &euro;30 million the T&aacute;naiste referred to in Question No. 352 of 25 January 2005? The Health Service Executive knows nothing about it when I ring it up. I have rung it on five or six occasions about the aforementioned case in the north Connemara area. This is only an example and one could multiply it by thousands to indicate the number of people being refused home help hours who are attempting to keep their parents or loved ones at home rather than in institutional care.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Department have a lot to answer for in terms of their neglect of the elderly. Maybe Ministers are so busy with their own lives and Departments that they do not realise the hardship being experienced. However, I am sure they, as Deputies, realise it because they must note the problems raised in their constituency offices, just as I and other Deputies encounter the real problems old people face in both urban and rural areas. It is the wish of most families to keep elderly people in their communities rather than put them in institutional care. They should be given the necessary State support rather than be forced to deal with the red tape of the Health Service Executive.</P>
      <P>In the case to which I referred, the Health Service Executive officials said they could identify a person willing to work evenings, thus supplying the necessary home help, but that there was an embargo on recruitment as the executive area had its full complement of whole-time staff. I was told this on 20 December, at which time it was stated circumstances may change in the new year. We are now a month into the new year but the position has not changed. Will the T&aacute;naiste get on to somebody in the executive, such as Mo Flynn, with whose office I dealt today, to inform officials in the various executive areas that the &euro;30 million is available and that there is no embargo on the appointment of the staff necessary to allow relatives keep their loved one&rsquo;s in their homes for as long as possible?</P>

	<P>The Government is firmly committed to developing and improving services for older people. In this year&rsquo;s budget alone we have made a step change in the level of new investment in services for older people, particularly to support services in the community.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>In the time available, I will address some points in the debate about our legislative programme. The legislation providing for the establishment of the social services inspectorate on a statutory basis is being incorporated into the Bill establishing the health information and quality authority, HIQA. The preparation of the heads of this Bill is at an advanced stage in my Department and I expect to be in a position to submit them to Government within the next month. I will then publish the heads to allow for a period of consultation on the proposals contained in the heads.</P>
      <P>My intention in publishing the heads for consultation is to ensure that all interested parties have an opportunity to make their views known on the policy proposals contained in the heads at an early stage before drafting of the Bill is finalised. We will draft the Bill, taking on board those views, with the intention of publishing it as early as possible this year.</P>
      <P>In the legislation, I envisage the social services inspectorate function would be carried out through a distinct office of the chief inspector of social services. The legislation will propose that HIQA will set the standards for health and personal social services. The office of the chief inspector will monitor residential services provided for older people with disabilities and children, provided in accordance with the Child Care Act 1991 and Part 2 of the Children Act 2001, against the standards set by HIQA.</P>
      <P>I propose that the legislation will provide for the establishment of a registration system to apply to residential services for children, older people and people with disabilities. In preparation, I have established a working group to develop standards for residential care. Membership is drawn from my Department, the HSE, the social services inspectorate and the Irish Health Service Accreditation Board. There will, of course, be consultation on the work of the group with relevant bodies.</P>
      <P>The legislation in regard to refunding long-stay charges was also raised. Draft heads of this Bill were approved by Government before Christmas. It is my intention to have the Bill published in the current parliamentary session. We can expect that repayments will commence shortly after the Bill is approved and signed into law. We are also working on important legislation on eligibility for health services in general.</P>
      <P>With regard to home care grants, I have been advised by the HSE that, with &euro;35 million new funding in 2006 in regard to home care packages and &euro;30 million extra for home help, the home care grant will be mainstreamed in the HSE <Col N="1706"/>southern area. People on the existing waiting list will be prioritised. The scheme in future will form a part of the national home care package initiative. In the context of the additional funding of &euro;20 million being made available nationally for nursing home subventions, the HSE southern area will in particular assist people who have applied for and been approved for enhanced subvention.</P>
      <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>Some Deputies referred to a difficulty in obtaining information from the HSE. I have been advised by the HSE that its parliamentary affairs division currently replies to approximately 70% of parliamentary question referrals within the HSE&rsquo;s target period of 20 working days. The HSE is committed to improving this performance. Currently, it is issuing interim replies where it is not possible to issue a final reply within 20 working days.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>The Government is working at every level to achieve substantial improvement in services and standards of care for older people. Over the past year, the Government has established an interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, to consider many of the issues that confront the elderly in our society, particularly in regard to continuing and ongoing care. That group has recently reported and the Government is currently deliberating on its recommendations. I hope that in the context of the upcoming negotiations on social partnership, long-term care will become a main feature of agreement between Government and the social partners.</P>
      <P>Our society must have clear priorities, in particular with regard to community and home-based supports. Evidence has shown that where families are given support, the level of care the family makes available increases rather than decreases. A recent study by Trinity College, Dublin of home care packages provided in the Dublin area suggested the average time given by the family increased to approximately 43 hours per week. This is the model the Government must support in providing new measures, initiatives and incentives for the elderly in our society to remain in their communities for as long as possible, which is their wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for bringing this important motion before the House. I acknowledge the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s point with regard to the payment of outstanding charges. It is good to know the legislation will be introduced this session because many people are anxious as part payment has not been made and they want to know the reason for the delay. Given that &euro;2,000 was offered by the Department to those listed on its register, it is unfortunate that some payments were not made in this regard.</P>
      <P>Many beds in Sligo are empty as a result of subvention. Apparently, while the cost of a bed might be &euro;800, some families in the west pay &euro;300 to &euro;400 in addition to the pension and subvention whereas a similar bed in Dublin would only cost <Col N="1707"/>&euro;200. There is no parity and the Minister might check this because the cost of running a nursing home is the same in the west as on the east coast. It is hard to explain the discrepancy.</P>
      <P>With regard to the MRSA bug, I am surprised that while the public health inspectorate is allowed into hospitals, it is not allowed into public wards or nursing homes to carry out unannounced checks. That may be dealt with by the new inspectorate but, in the short term, unannounced checks would be welcome.</P>
      <P>The Government has ignored the inspection regime for too long. Without the promised inspectorate, more horror stories about conditions in nursing homes are in store. We all remember how quickly the Government was able to introduce legislation to make legal the practice of charging elderly patients in nursing homes. This is in stark contrast to its failure, despite numerous promises, to bring forward legislation for a statutory, independent inspection regime for all nursing homes, be they public, private or community based.</P>
      <P>Given the level of inspection of supermarkets, hotels and every other public facility, such as schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>And farmyards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>The farming community has a high level of inspection but when it comes to the care of the aged, it seems extraordinarily difficult to develop an inspection regime that can carry out an unannounced hygiene audit.</P>
      <P>I have been involved with the Excellence Ireland Quality Association awards for many years. Its inspectors enter business operations and check everything, which should be the case in regard to nursing homes. There should be a standard of accreditation for nursing homes, such as a Q-mark, which would accredit that they have been subject to unannounced checks. There is no point telling those running a unit that it will be inspected next week &mdash; the inspection should be completely unannounced. I am astonished that standards have lagged with regard to the care of the aged. Inspections should have been in place years ago.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, all promised legislation. Of course, they were echoing a litany of unfulfilled commitments in a series of Government publications. While the issue of making refunds is complicated, it is extraordinary that the process has taken so long. Many people who were due payments have died in the past year and a half and the process has been marked by uncertainty for people who felt they were due payments, unclear legality in the collection of charges and the fact that next-of-kin will now benefit from the fund.</P>
      <P>Continuing to break Government promises is a direct contradiction of the recommendations of <Col N="1708"/>numerous reports on the elderly which the Government commissioned, including the most recent report of NESF. The absence of such a regime means the standards applying to nursing homes are unclear and, in particular following public concerns about conditions in some nursing homes, it is essential that this system is made absolutely transparent to reassure people in their latter years.</P>
      <P>The inspection regime is particularly vital because it should inform the HSE&rsquo;s decisions on the registration of nursing homes. It is wrong that a nursing home can open without the application of strict qualification criteria. If one opened a hotel, strict rules would apply before it was awarded two, three or four stars. Similar accreditation should apply to nursing homes. They should be star-rated according to different categories and facilities, and charges should relate to the star-rating of the facility. It is extremely worrying if, as one newspaper report reveals today, there are certain cases where this is not happening. How can we have faith in the organisation which is meant to ensure our elderly people are placed in appropriate care if, in some cases, it ignores the advice of inspectors?</P>
      <P>This is yet another reason for the inspection regime to be put on a statutory footing, to ensure the inspectorate is properly resourced and to make the inspectors&rsquo; reports fully available to the public. My fear is that, if the Government continues to drag its feet, we will hear many more of the nightmare stories about the treatment of elderly people in nursing homes. I accept there are some fine nursing homes but having an independent inspectorate which would award qualifications and accredit institutions is critically important. I am somewhat disappointed that, given the scandal relating to MRSA, public health officials who are highly qualified and capable of carrying out independent inspections of hygiene in hospitals do not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank everyone who contributed to this motion. The health strategy was always the basis for the Government&rsquo;s blueprint for the health services. If one reviews the strategy in respect of care of the elderly, it becomes clear the Government has failed miserably. There is no doubt about this.</P>
      <P>Earlier on, Deputy Sexton attempted to play the race card in a slightly more subtle fashion than the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan. All we stated last night was that, the &euro;1,000 to be spent on child care was expected to be spent in accordance with the budget. I was surprised that Deputy Sexton attempted to play this race card again when the mantra of her party, the Progressive Democrats, has always been transparency, accountability and value for money for the taxpayers&rsquo; money. At budget time, it was expected that this money would support child care. In stating this, we are not being racist. We are simply pointing out that <Col N="1709"/>if the budget states that taxpayers&rsquo; money will be spent for a particular purpose, the Government should spend the money for that purpose. The same principle applies to the &euro;56 million whose position in the accounts book the Government was unsure of last week and the &euro;156 million wasted on the PPARS system last year. This is why we raise these issues in the House.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the &euro;450 million we receive from the UK for our health services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>This money is spent on providing medical treatment for UK citizens living or visiting this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The money is also spent on Irish citizens who previously worked in the UK and have returned home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>They paid for this service while they were working in the UK. The situation is completely different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an EU-wide rule that by virtue of a person&rsquo;s work here, he or she is entitled to certain benefits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Twomey, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The two issues are completely different. The people in other jurisdictions who will be paid the &euro;1,000 promised by the Government have not worked here and do not live here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Their parents are working here, which is why they are entitled to the payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The contributions of other speakers have been quite informative. The chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, Deputy Moloney, stated that many nursing homes in his constituency left much to be desired. This is a very interesting point. It is extremely difficult to close down substandard nursing homes although one Deputy stated that some of these nursing homes have been closed down. Even though we criticise the lack of a legislatively based social services inspectorate for nursing homes, when these homes are inspected and problems are uncovered, it is extremely difficult to do anything about it. This has a knock-on effect on nursing homes which provide an excellent service and show genuine concern for their patients. If too many rogues are allowed to operate within this business and feel they can operate with impunity, it will affect people working in this sector who do their best for patients.</P>
      <P>A member of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service stated that people could take out private insurance to pay for their nursing home care in the future. This is surprising <Col N="1710"/>given that the Government failed to publish a policy on care of the elderly, a measure which was promised in 2001 but which we are now told is only at the level of a Cabinet working group. This type of slow progress does not do anyone justice, particularly those who expect this Government to make decisions on the matter. There are more than enough reports for the Government to read, some going back as far as 2003.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, Deputy Cassidy, spoke in a more measured fashion and had some words of praise for what members of the Opposition are attempting to do this evening. This praise was unexpected but we are grateful for it. Unfortunately, we have a very adversarial form of politics here. The consensus form of politics, where we could possibly work together, is not used. I mean no disrespect to the Government but our adversarial system leaves the Opposition with no alternative but to push the Government to do something for the people whom we represent. We cannot work together because there is no forum for us to do so. This is why we must constantly barrack the Government to do some work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, it does not work like that. If we were nice to the Government every day of the week, it would do nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Subventions are an extremely important issue. The eligibility criteria for a subvention was extended in the last budget but it is not the same thing as increasing the rates for subventions. We will continue to press this point until the rules are changed. Between &euro;130 and &euro;190 per week is the maximum subvention to which anyone is entitled. It is not possible to secure a nursing home place costing &euro;190 per week. The cheapest nursing homes probably cost approximately &euro;800 per week in rural areas and up to &euro;1,200 per week in urban areas. This con<Col N="1711"/>trasts dramatically with charges levied in 2000. The Minister must acknowledge this and increase the rates. She should stop dillydallying around the value of a house in Dublin or a rural area or stating that eligibility has been increased. She should simply increase these rates to a level that is acceptable for the people involved.</P>
      <P>In 2001, the then Minister for Health and Children, gave medical cards to everyone over 70. In 2006, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children announced that &euro;110 million would go towards care of the elderly. However, nothing has been accomplished in respect of care of the elderly between 2001 and 2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>They have received nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Comments were made earlier about the &euro;30 million that is supposed to go towards care of the elderly but there is probably &euro;30 million still lying in the bank for the doctor-only medical cards that were to have been issued and there is probably still &euro;30 million in the bank for the ten-point plan announced in the budget. It was promised this money would be spent on the health services but I do not believe it has been spent and believe it is still in the bank, lying next to the &euro;56 million which I hope the Government has found by now.</P><Col N="1712"/>
      <P>Going into the next election, the credibility of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, and that of the Government, will hinge on these issues and their commitment to looking after the elderly. This is why this legislation is so important. There is a raft of legislation lying around dealing with the health service, such as the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill 2002, a pharmacy Bill, a Bill relating to nurses and a Bill regarding the Health Information and Quality Authority. This legislation was promised as far back as 2001. Let us examine eligibility. A range of legislation regarding the rights of elderly people within our community has been lying around since 2001. It is time the Government stopped telling us that such legislation is on its way. These announcements are all we seem to hear from the Government. Even the announcement today by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children about the &euro;200 million for medical education was slightly disingenuous because only &euro;13 million will be spent in 2006. I do not know how she came up with a figure of &euro;200 million but this is a question for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We said the figure would be &euro;90 million.</P>

      <sTitle>Mental Health Services.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I intend to discuss the recommendations of the report of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision for Change. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to debate this important report and welcome the participation of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley.</P>
        <P>A comparison between these latest recommendations and the 1984 report on psychiatric services, Planning for the Future, reveals little progress and raises questions about our attitudes towards improving the treatment of mentally ill people. It is depressing that a report dating from more than 20 years ago contains so many of the recommendations made by the most recent expert group. While this does not undermine the validity of those recommendations, it reveals how little progress we have made in terms of the way we treat the mentally ill. All this time, we have been promising to care for this most vulnerable group in their communities but progress has been painfully slow. How many other sectors in these <Col N="1716"/>modern and fast-paced times measure milestones in decades rather than years?</P>
        <P>The Government proposes that its new plan will be effected incrementally over ten years, with funding from the sale of 15 mental hospitals to provide the necessary structures at community level. Why should the desperate need of the mental health sector depend on its ability to raise its own finances? Other areas of need are not treated in that way. By all means, let the Government raise money where possible from the sale of institutions but why should vital recommendations wait until this is complete before they are implemented when the money could be made available immediately?</P>
        <P>It is a poor reflection on our society that our economy is in rude health, yet we still fail to act on behalf of the mentally ill. The disappointing proposal to increase the percentage of the health spend for mental health services from 6.98% to 8.24%, which the Minister of State has endorsed, compares unfavourably with other countries. For example, the comparable spend in England is 12% and is 18% in Scotland. For that matter, the recommendation falls far short of Ireland&rsquo;s mental health spend in 1997, which was 11% of total health expenditure.</P>
        <P>There are inescapable doubts about the ability and commitment of the Government to deliver on the changes that the mental health sector so desperately needs. After knowing for 20 years the <Col N="1717"/>essential requirements of the mental health service, I have little confidence that the recommendations of this report will be implemented by this Government. I want to know how many sales have been completed since last March, when the Minister of State announced the sale of mental health service property to facilitate expenditure on psychiatric care.</P>
        <P>It is unacceptable that there is a serious dearth of suitable community-based facilities for the delivery of high quality care. This not only applies to community mental health centres but also to day and hospital accommodation and community residences. Specialised mental health services are lacking and the neglect of young and old people with difficulties and of those with intellectual disabilities reflects badly on the Government.</P>
        <P>Outpatient services for those suffering from mental or emotional illnesses are not being determined by need but by available resources. An integrated model of care should be introduced to address the broad needs of service users, including biological, psychological and social aspects of presenting disorders. Emotional aspects of mental disorder have been neglected, as has the disruption this can cause to sufferers&rsquo; social and occupational functions. We did not need this report to inform us that there is a major scarcity of psychological therapists dealing with mental illness and the re-establishment of healthy supportive relationships. Some 22 years after the publication of the report, Planning for the Future, there are serious shortcomings in existing services for people with severe and enduring mental illness. At present, there are only five specialist rehabilitation teams in the country, none of which has the full range and number of staff required. Only two rehabilitation community mental health therapy centres have sufficient staffing.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>For many years, I have witnessed the exclusion by the psychiatric service of families involved in the recovery and care for loved ones. The family of people with severe mental illnesses carry significant burdens of care but this goes unrecognised. There is a need to provide families and carers with support, information and, when needed, accessible help. The instant response by specialists to more than 90% of queries on the conditions of loved ones is that the matter is confidential and cannot be discussed with families. This contrasts with other areas, where the involvement of families and loved ones is welcomed by specialists.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter.</P>
        <P>I welcome the publication of A Vision for Change, which outlines an exciting vision of the future for mental health services and sets out a framework for action to achieve it over the next seven to ten years. The report has been accepted <Col N="1718"/>by Government as the basis for the future development of mental health policy.</P>
        <P>I established the expert group on mental health policy in August 2003 in recognition of the need to review long-standing policy in this area and to formulate a blueprint for a modern, comprehensive, world class service to meet the mental health challenges facing our society.</P>
        <P>The group&rsquo;s report is the first comprehensive review of mental health policy since Planning for the Future was published in 1984. The expert group was chaired by Professor Joyce O&rsquo;Connor, President of the National College of Ireland, and consisted of 18 widely experienced people drawn from a range of backgrounds within the mental health services.</P>
        <P>Wide-ranging consultation took place throughout the country in the development of this policy, drawing on the experience, perspectives and ideas of key stakeholders, interested agencies and concerned individuals. The findings from the consultation process provide a very clear indication of service users&rsquo; views on the current state of the mental health services and how they should be developed in the future.</P>
        <P>The report proposes a holistic view of mental illness and recommends an integrated multidisciplinary approach to addressing the biological, psychological and social factors that contribute to mental health problems. It proposes a person-centred treatment approach which addresses each of these elements through an integrated care plan, reflecting best practice, and agreed with service users and their carers. Special emphasis is given to the need to involve service users, their families and carers at every level of service provision. Interventions should be aimed at maximising recovery from mental illness and building on the resources of service users themselves and within their immediate social networks to allow them to achieve meaningful integration and participation in community life. A Vision for Change recommends that specialist expertise should be provided by community mental health teams &mdash; expanded multidisciplinary teams of clinicians who work together to serve the needs of service users across their lifespan. The community mental health teams should serve defined populations and age groups and operate from community-based mental health centres in specific sectors throughout reconfigured mental health catchments areas. These teams should assume responsibility for self-governance and be accountable to all their stakeholders, especially service users, their families and carers. Some of these community mental health teams should be established on a regional or national basis to address the complex mental health needs of specific categories of people who are few in number but who require particular expertise.</P>
        <P>A Vision for Change envisions an active, flexible and community-based mental health service where the need for hospital admission will be greatly reduced. This policy will require substan<Col N="1719"/>tial funding and it is recommended in the report that steps be taken to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals and to re-invest the resources released by these closures in the mental health service.</P>
        <P>The closure of large mental hospitals and the move to modern units attached to general hospitals, together with the expansion of community services, has been Government policy since the publication of Planning for the Future in 1984. A number of large psychiatric hospitals around the country have already been closed, including Our Lady&rsquo;s in Cork, St. Patrick&rsquo;s in Castlerea, St. Columba&rsquo;s in Sligo, St. Mary&rsquo;s in Castlebar and Our Lady&rsquo;s in Ennis. The re-organisation of services following these closures resulted in more community facilities, new acute psychiatric units in some cases and an overall improvement for service users, their families and carers. The remaining stand-alone psychiatric hospitals cater in the main for long-stay patients, many of whom are over 65 years of age.</P>
        <P>The report recommends that a programme of capital and non-capital investment in mental health services adjusted in line with inflation should be implemented in a phased way over the next seven to ten years, in parallel with the proposed reorganisation of mental health services. The proposed new workforce will comprise more than 11,000 staff throughout the service. Allowing for the assimilation of all existing posts, the expert group has estimated that a total of 1,803 new posts across the service, together with a total non-capital investment of &euro;151 million per annum in addition to existing funding are required.</P>
        <P>Due to the current non-availability of certain health professionals, investment will be required on an incremental basis, resulting in a proposed non-capital investment of an additional &euro;21.6 million each year for the next seven years. An additional &euro;25 million has been allocated to the HSE for mental health services in 2006 and it is hoped to continue this level of investment in the coming years.</P>
        <P>Significant capital investment is also required to provide and equip the proposed new mental health infrastructure. The report estimates that &euro;796 million will be required. There are, however, substantial capital assets in the existing psychiatric hospital buildings and lands which could be released to fund the capital investment required.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue.</P>
        <P>Violence against women is extensive, pervasive and ongoing. Frontline services including rape crisis centres, refuges and support services are operating at a funding level, capped since 2002, which can only be described as severely inad<Col N="1720"/>equate to meet current needs. Such services were operating on a resource deficit in 2003 and the subsequent cap in funding occurred alongside increased demands for service delivery and new research which highlighted populations of victims who are not seeking help from dedicated support agencies. Various NGOs have recommended that current investment on dedicated, frontline responses to violence against women be increased by &euro;7 million. This allocation should be ring-fenced for frontline service responses and their national bodies. Funding arrangements must also improve to alleviate the worst effects of the current inefficiencies.</P>
        <P>Currently there are 40 locally based responses to domestic violence and 16 rape crisis centres. In June 2004, members of national networks were surveyed on direct State funding in 2003 and a total of 51 frontline services responded. Three quarters of all frontline service providers indicated there was no change to the level of funding they received from statutory sources in 2003 compared with 2002 and there has been no increase since then. Service providers described their inability to meet existing demand and pointed out that being overstretched automatically prevented them developing their services, particularly with regard to inaccessibility for certain populations. Service providers have not been able to deal with staff pay increases, the absence of pension provision, training of new volunteers and even applications from prospective volunteers. Service providers described cutting back key service areas, such as help line cover, which automatically reduces the accessibility of the service for existing and new clients.</P>
        <P>Investment is urgently needed in this vital service. An article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> today states that more than 1,000 women reported rape by a partner in 2004, a figure which clearly indicates the urgency with which this issue must be dealt. At this point, I wish to compliment all those involved in frontline services in rape crisis centres and refuges. The job is difficult and such people are doing magnificent work with very limited resources.</P>
        <P>The failure of the Government to provide for a sexual assault treatment unit in Kerry is a very serious matter. Currently, there is only one such unit in the Munster area, in Cork. The need for a unit in Kerry was identified to ensure that victims of rape could be examined in Kerry General Hospital. A dedicated working group was set up, comprising medical staff, garda&iacute; and the staff of the Kerry Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre. A pilot scheme was undertaken in April 2002 and the service operated very successfully, despite having no resources allocated to it by the Government. A total of 60 clients were seen at the unit and supported. A decision was made in September 2004 to contact GPs in the Kerry region, with a view to having trained doctors on an on-call rota to undertake forensic medical examinations. Ten GPs expressed their interest in <Col N="1721"/>undertaking the training and being available. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform refunds the costs incurred in forensic examinations but, unfortunately, due to the lack of resources to fund a nursing post and on-call nurses, this initiative did not take place.</P>
        <P>The genesis of a service is available but it is functioning at a low level entirely as a result of the lack of funding. Even with the existence of a sexual assault treatment unit in County Kerry, victims in remote parts of the county will have to travel for at least an hour. Victims are now reporting that they may have to travel to Cork for the examination, a six hour round trip. This is an unacceptable burden on those people who have been subjected to the most traumatic experience of rape. They are also required, at their own expense, to return to Cork for any follow-up treatment, which may involve four visits.</P>
        <P>Funding was promised to the rape crisis centres but none has been made available for the sexual assault unit in Kerry. This is another broken promise from the Government and once again the most vulnerable are left to suffer.</P>

	<P>I will be taking the adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>
        <P>The national steering committee on violence against women was established following the report of the task force on violence against women in 1997. It is chaired by Deputy Fahey, Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Department of Health and Children is represented on the national steering committee, as is the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the national steering committee is to provide a multi-disciplinary, multi-agency and cohesive response to the problem of violence against women and in so doing to progress the recommendations of the task force. It is representative of a wide range of interests concerned with violence against women and has a number of objectives which include ensuring that regional and local structures are established, developing public awareness campaigns, co-ordinating and advising on the distribution of resources among the health regions and co-ordinating and advising on ongoing development of policies, including those concerning perpetrators, criminal justice intervention, services and supports.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to working with all interested parties, including service providers, and has undertaken a range of measures to reduce the incidence of domestic violence, to respond to the needs of victims and perpetrators and to raise awareness among the public about the dynamics of this crime. These measures can be seen across a wide range of Government policy and include legislative measures, Garda response, health services, national research and treatment programmes for perpetrators.</P><Col N="1722"/>
        <P>Funding for service provision is a key indicator of Government commitment to the issue. Funding for service provision for victims is channelled primarily through the Health Service Executive Vote. In addition, other Departments such as Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, Social and Family Affairs, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government contribute to responding to the issue.</P>
        <P>Funding in the health sector has risen from approximately &euro;3.8 million in 1997 to approximately &euro;12 million in 2005. This shows the commitment of Government and of the Department to addressing this important issue. The allocation of this funding, including to individual rape crisis centres, is now a matter for the Health Service Executive. The former health boards, now the HSE, worked closely for many years with a range of NGOs, including the rape crisis centres.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children will continue to monitor the level of investment in services for victims of sexual offences, including rape. The T&aacute;naiste has asked the Department, together with the Health Service Executive, to undertake an analysis of the current level of service provision in this area with a view to planning future service needs. The T&aacute;naiste has recently received this report and my Department will meet the HSE in this regard.</P>
        <P>Recently the T&aacute;naiste received a delegation of the relevant violence against women organisations operating dedicated frontline service responses to violence against women. The T&aacute;naiste is considering the report presented to her at that meeting.</P>
        <P>In keeping with the recommendations of the task force on violence against women, the HSE works through the regional planning committees to determine the needs of their localities and to co-ordinate statutory and voluntary approaches to these needs. The Health Service Executive is exploring the possibility of co-ordinating funding streams and the development of a more unified structure for violence against women services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Hoctor.</P>
        <P>Since 1997 there have been significant developments in the county hospital in Nenagh, including the appointment of a range of consultants, nursing and other staff, the refurbishment and extension of the hospital and the building of a one-stop shop to incorporate a range of administrative and other services.</P>
        <P>We are now on the cusp of a major extension that will include the accident and emergency department, laboratory and x-ray facilities. We are asking that the x-ray facility, housing the CT scanner so essential for the development of services in the hospital, be included in the overall contract. As the project was planned, the x-ray <Col N="1723"/>facility was an integral part of the facilities and we urge the Minister of State to respond in a positive way to the final stage of a significant development for the hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Ms Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse the comments of my colleague, Deputy Michael Smith. In September 2004, the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, approved &euro;2.2 million for the extension to the accident and emergency department, laboratory and radiology department at Nenagh hospital. This was to address the deficits and build on the strengths identified in the Hanly report for the future of the hospital, which was one of the pilot project hospitals in the report of the task force. Planning and tender were approved.</P>
        <P>For some reason, however, we have learned the development is to go ahead without the extension to the x-ray department. We are here this evening to make it known to the Minister and the Department that we will not accept this. The accident and emergency, pathology and radiology departments are interdependent. Radiology is in need of expansion, no more than the accident and emergency department and the laboratory.</P>
        <P>A CT scanner is also needed. The Minister of State knows of the logjam at the regional hospital in Limerick. If we secure a CT scanner as part of the radiology extension, we will be able to perform x-rays that would normally be sent to Limerick with accompanying medical and nursing staff. If our package goes ahead as originally approved by the Minister for Health and Children in 2004 we will be able to conduct those services under the one roof at Nenagh hospital.</P>
        <P>If radiology is discommoded, the extensions to the accident and emergency department and to the laboratory will be less productive. Savings in costs from not sending patients to Limerick will be to the financial benefit of the hospital and to those who avail of the services.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister to address the urgent need for the approval of all parts of the extension for Nenagh hospital. It is essential approval is granted when we consider the growing population of north Tipperary, with people from as far as Littleton, Upperchurch, Redwood and Lorrha availing of the services at the hospital.</P>
        <P>If we are to see reform in the health service, it is only right that Nenagh hospital should be a pilot project. Management had the courage to undertake the project following the Hanly report and should now get its just reward. We are not looking for anything extra, simply for what was agreed last year, the extensions to the accident and emergency department, the laboratory and radiology department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take this matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I thank Deputies Michael Smith and Hoctor for raising <Col N="1724"/>this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the continued development of services at Nenagh General Hospital and continued provision of high quality, safe acute hospital services to the people of north Tipperary.</P>
        <P>In recent years, funding of &euro;2 million has been provided to facilitate the extension of existing buildings and significant refurbishment of existing facilities. A sum of &euro;750,000 has been spent on the refurbishment and upgrading of mechanical and electrical services and additional ultrasound equipment has been purchased at a cost of &euro;200,000. In addition, space has been protected on the Nenagh campus for the proposed future provision of a geriatric assessment-rehabilitation unit and approval has been given to the development of a health centre-community care headquarters.</P>
        <P>The next capital development project at Nenagh hospital comprises an extension to the laboratory, radiology and accident and emergency departments and provision of a CT scanner. The estimated capital cost of this project is in excess of &euro;2 million and the project has been progressed through planning stages. I understand tenders for the work have been sought and I have been informed by the Health Service Executive that approval has been given to proceed with the extension to the accident and emergency department and laboratory. However, the extension of the radiology department and provision of CT scanning will require the provision of additional revenue funding and staffing. It will not be possible to proceed with this aspect of the project until the required additional revenue and staffing can be identified.</P>
        <P>In summary, the planning process has commenced for the further development of facilities at Nenagh General Hospital. The national hospitals office will continue to work with the HSE mid-western region to identify the revenue required for the radiology department and CT aspects of this project.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to the continued development of services at Nenagh General Hospital. We have provided for developments at the hospital in the past and are committed to continuing the investment in services at Nenagh. Nenagh General Hospital will continue to play its part in providing services for the people of north Tipperary.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, for coming before the House to listen to Deputy Healy, and I making a case for Carrick-on-Suir. As the Minister will be aware, it was announced today that 42 jobs will be lost in SRAM Ireland, which is located in the town, with a further 11 jobs set to be transferred elsewhere in the region. This is <Col N="1725"/>a major blow to the constituency of Tipperary South, specifically Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
        <P>In this time of unprecedented prosperity we expect to gain rather than lose jobs. I am concerned about the 42 people who will be left with no work, some of them in as soon as three months&rsquo; time. I am also disappointed that only 11 jobs will be transferred to SRAM Ireland&rsquo;s new facility in the south east. The company cited competition from the Far East as the reason for the job losses. The Government must step in to protect workers. Towns such as Carrick-on-Suir can be devastated by a closure of a factory, however small. The Government must take a proactive role in protecting jobs in factories when there is a danger of job losses occurring due to competition from countries with lower production costs. In these circumstances, it must actively source alternative employment for workers, particularly in heavily dependent towns such as Carrick-on-Suir. I urge the Minister to take serious measures on behalf of the people of the town and its surrounding areas which have received a devastating blow today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>Carrick-on-Suir has been felled by the news that 53 jobs will be lost to the town as a result of the closure of SRAM Ireland. This is a bad blow, particularly as the town already has an unemployment rate of more than 20%, with 890 people on the live register. Carrick-on-Suir is one of six blackspots in the south east identified by the South East Regional Authority. The town&rsquo;s circumstances have been brought to the attention of the Minister and his predecessors. Oireachtas Members and local elected members and officials met the Minister on 19 July last to discuss the issue and I raised the matter with him on 28 September 2005. In view of the job losses announced today, I repeat the request I made at the July meeting that job creation and investment be prioritised for Carrick-on-Suir and a dedicated task force established for the town.</P>
        <P>Last September, the Minister indicated that the Department would not fulfil this request and referred to similar circumstances prevailing in other towns. The situation in Carrick-on-Suir is extremely serious and not comparable to that of other towns. As a result of today&rsquo;s developments, the town will have an unemployment rate in excess of 25%, which is almost unique. Carrick-on-Suir must be prioritised for job creation and the only way to do so is to create a task force specifically for the purpose of targeting jobs for the town.</P>
        <P>In September 2005 the Minister stated: &ldquo;I am confident the policies and strategies pursued by the development agencies, together with the ongoing commitment and support from Government, will bear fruit in terms of sustainable additional investment for all the towns in south Tipperary.&rdquo; This has patently not been the case. We need specific strategies for Carrick-on-Suir. We cannot continue to allow more than 20% of <Col N="1726"/>the workforce of the town to remain on the live register. It is not good enough that unemployment rates in Carrick-on-Suir have not improved one iota since 1997. I urge the Minister to establish a task force for the town immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for raising these matters. As they noted, SRAM Corporation announced to its staff that it would cease operations in Carrick-on-Suir with the loss of 53 permanent and temporary jobs. Some 11 permanent staff will be retained in distribution support activities and finance. This is devastating news for the workers in question and their families and our thoughts are with them.</P>
        <P>The company attributed the redundancies to ongoing cost pressures and falling sales. It informed IDA Ireland of its decision earlier in the day. SRAM Corporation intends to end manufacturing production and distribution activities at the Carrick-on-Suir site and transfer the remaining employees, who are involved in support activities, to new offices in Waterford city.</P>
        <P>The role of F&Aacute;S, the State training agency, will be particularly important in assisting those who are to lose their jobs. The agency will, as a matter of urgency, make contact with the management and staff of the company to outline the support services F&Aacute;S can provide, particularly advice and training opportunities for the workforce. Finding alternative employment for the workers affected will be a priority for the State development agencies.</P>
        <P>I assure Deputies that IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and F&Aacute;S will play their part in developing a way forward. Deputy Healy is correct that there is little point setting up more groups and task forces when there is a uniform response across the country, and in areas where there is significant unemployment in given localities or where redundancies take place, the State agencies which are in place respond in a proactive manner to the issues.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The present IDA Ireland strategy for south Tipperary is to concentrate future economic development in Clonmel by developing the town as a first-class location for overseas investment. This strategy has been agreed with the South Tipperary County Development Board. At a meeting of Carrick-on-Suir Town Council last year the agency&rsquo;s plans for south Tipperary and Waterford city were outlined to the council and the need for Carrick-on-Suir to find a way to link into the economic growth centres of Clonmel and Waterford underlined. This is a key issue. I have stated across the country that people must view their position in a regional context to determine how they can maximise investment in the region.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to stress however, that Carrick-on-Suir is not being neglected. I met a delegation from the town council last year and then met with F&Aacute;S. The town council specifically brought the F&Aacute;S service to my attention and asked us to expand and improve it. Following a meeting with the council the agency agreed to increase its level of engagement with the long-term unemployed in the town. This process, which commenced last October, will continue throughout 2006. While the main focus from the IDA&rsquo;s perspective is on Waterford and Clonmel, there are knock-on benefits in sectors such as supply, distribution and transport thus creating further investment and employment opportunities for people in surrounding areas including Carrick-on-Suir. Carrick-on-Suir can benefit from its close proximity to both Waterford and Clonmel. The largest single IDA job creation project in 2004 was Guidant with a 1,000 job expansion project in Clonmel, which must have a ripple effect across the area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The company will seek to recruit approximately 200 staff per year, both graduates and non-graduates, for the next five years. The development of community based enterprise centres is a crucial part of the drive to create new regional enterprise. Enterprise Ireland provided support of &euro;54,852 in 1998 for the setting up of the enterprise centre in Carrick-on-Suir. This centre has been sold to a private developer and the proceeds of that sale have been invested in a new community resource centre for the town. The community enterprise centre is now incorporated into a state-of the-art resource centre. A high quality training facility is now at the heart of the community enterprise centre and should bring long-term benefits to the town. The unemployment rate for the south east, according to the latest quarterly national household survey, is 6.7%. The latest CSO live register analysis shows that those claiming unemployment benefit in south Tipperary fell to 3,238 in December 2005&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The focus of my Department and its agencies is firmly concentrated on managing this transition of our economy through the use of the best possible blend of policies to strengthen both national and firm-level competitiveness. An integral element of the Government&rsquo;s policies is to encourage enterprises to undertake increased levels of investment and research, to use more technology in product development and to encourage more innovation across all sectors of the economy. This will help firms produce improved value-added products and services. In the longer term this will provide longer lasting and higher quality jobs. I assure the Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 133 and 207 together.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated to this House previously, the delay in providing driving tests is a matter of regret to me. It not only represents a poor service to the public but it is also hampering the development of initiatives which I wish to pursue and which will contribute further to road safety. The driving test and those who deliver it are a key element in the road safety strategy.</P>
        <P>It is my objective to eliminate the backlog of driving tests by mid-2007 and my Department has developed a package of measures in consultation with staff interests to achieve this.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to acknowledge that a very high number of the existing driver testers have indicated that they will participate in a bonus scheme which will make a significant contribution to the reduction of the backlog over the coming 18 months. Furthermore, in a unique cross-departmental and cross-union agreement, a further eight civil servants from the Department of Agriculture and Food have successfully passed interviews and tests and will shortly be trained as driver testers and start working in April to reduce the backlog. Later in the year they will be augmented by another ten new recruits on two-year <Col N="1730"/>contracts. This increased volume of testing is putting administrative staff in Ballina under considerable pressure and I want to publicly recognise the contribution they are making to resolving a difficult situation. They are often the first point of contact between the public and the Department in difficult times and they have responded admirably.</P>
        <P>However, despite all these efforts I am convinced that more needs to be done in the short term and that the temporary use of outsourcing has to be an option to which I have recourse. Outsourcing not only provides access to additional staff resources but also to training options and infrastructure and facilities that are needed to overcome the problems we face in the coming months. I believe Sustaining Progress provides that option but there is union disagreement on this. I accept that this disagreement reflects a genuinely held difference of opinion on the meaning of clauses in Sustaining Progress. Departmental and union officials have worked hard together to reach solutions and although good progress has been made I do not think it is sufficient to overcome the overriding need to eliminate the backlog as quickly as possible and allow those same staff concentrate on developing and implementing a road safety regime and services which are part of this Government&rsquo;s programme. Therefore, I intend to progress the outsourcing option.</P>
        <P>I understand that this decision is likely to be tested under the arbitration provisions of Sustaining Progress. If so, that will give both sides a binding decision. Meanwhile, I have mandated my Department to progress outsourcing. I strongly believe that this is a prudent decision which it is necessary to take in the interests of road safety and to avoid any unnecessary subsequent delays in eliminating the backlog.</P>
        <P>I want to be unequivocally clear to the staff in the Department that I appreciate the level of service and commitment they have given and continue to give to the delivery of a driver testing service. They will continue to be the backbone of the service into the future. While I believe that outsourcing is needed now in exceptional circumstances to augment their work I can give them an assurance that it is a temporary measure and not intended to replace their work. I can also assure them that if outsourcing points to deficiencies in the infrastructure or systems which are available in the public service, I intend to continue to secure and provide the resources needed to improve the public service infrastructure. In tandem with eliminating the backlog I am determined to support a better public service delivery of the driving test to the benefit of both customers and staff. Along with eliminating the backlog I intend to deliver a service in which existing staff will be proud to work.</P>

	<P>My Department proposes to temporarily redeploy staff from the Department of Agriculture and Food who have been identified as being surplus to that Department&rsquo;s organisational requirements and who are based in various regional locations around the country. Following interviews and tests, eight successful candidates will now commence a six week training course late February and, subject to passing this course, it is envisaged that these staff will commence testing in April 2006.</P>
        <P>My Department also proposes to recruit ten driver testers through an open recruitment competition organised by the Public Appointments Service. This process began in December 2005 with a psychometric exam. Stage two of the competition, which is an assessment of driving competence, will take place next week. The third stage, an interview, will take place in March. Successful candidates will commence their six week training course in April and it is envisaged that they will commence testing in June 2006.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to give a definitive number on the number of tests that will be conducted during the year as there is a large number of variables involved such as the actual number of new testers who commence work and in particular the amount of training of the new recruits which must be done from within our own resources. The average number of tests conducted over the last five years was approximately 150,000 per annum.</P>
        <P>In light of the above, coupled with a bonus scheme which has been taken up by a high number of testers and the use of outsourcing, I would expect that this figure will be substantially exceeded in 2006.</P>

        <Quest>the interim measures he is taking to deal with traffic congestion in the greater Dublin area pending the full implementation of Transport 21; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Transport 21 makes provision for a major phased investment in public transport in the greater Dublin area, which will provide a real alternative to private car commuting. A significant expansion in rail capacity occurred in 2005 including the entry into service of eight car DART trains.</P>
        <P>As I have said previously, the bus will continue to play a crucial role in the capital&rsquo;s public transport system. It is not a question of bus or rail but of using both modes to complement each other effectively to maximise the passenger carrying <Col N="1732"/>capacity and availability of public transport. Buses, in particular, will be used to meet the immediate and short-term requirements for additional public transport in Dublin while other infrastructure is being put in place.</P>
        <P>Dublin Bus has already submitted an application to me for additional fleet requirements. I also expect to receive the company&rsquo;s report on its bus network review shortly. I will make a decision when my Department&rsquo;s assessment has been completed.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, planning and the statutory processes for the expansion of the Luas to Cherrywood and Docklands is under way. The business case has been approved for a 40% increase in capacity on the Tallaght Luas line and a railway order public inquiry has recently begun for the Kildare route project.</P>
        <P>The full Transport 21 programme will take ten years to deliver and this is reasonable given the extent of the infrastructure development involved. However, I would stress that elements of the programme will come on steam incrementally, including from this year, the first year of the programme. Each element of the programme will contribute to easing congestion in a particular part of the city.</P>
        <P>In addition, traffic management will continue to be an important part of the solution to congestion. Programmes such as the traffic management grants scheme administered by the Dublin Transportation Office will ensure continued and enhanced funding to local authorities for investment in traffic management schemes throughout the greater Dublin area. The main objective of this scheme is to improve operating conditions of buses in the greater Dublin area. Transport 21 provides for the doubling of the quality bus network to improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of the bus service.</P>

        <P>The advice referred to in the D&aacute;il reply from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources of 12 October 2005 was received from the Attorney General on 21 October 2005. In addition, further advice relevant to this matter was received from the Attorney General in January of this year.</P>
        <P>Following approval by the Government, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue, announced on 16 November 2005 that Spencer Dock International Conference Centre Consortium was being invited to become the provisional preferred tenderer for the provision of a national conference centre in Dublin. This decision was taken by the National Conference Centre Steering Group following a detailed assessment and evaluation of tenders received, against award criteria set out in the invitation to negotiate document.</P>
        <P>In relation to the company&rsquo;s letter of 18 May 2005 referred to by the Deputy, I am currently considering this matter in light of both the latest advice from the Attorney General of 6 January 2006 and the announcement by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>

	<P>With regard to the Irish ship register, the maritime safety directorate of my Department is at present reviewing Ireland&rsquo;s policy on the registration of vessels on the Irish flag.</P>
        <P>In September 2005, a consultation paper was published by the directorate, which outlined the current position in relation to ship registration in Ireland, and invited submissions from interested parties in relation to the issues raised in the paper. The consultation process ended on 16 December 2005, and work is now progressing on developing proposals for the modernisation of Irish ship registration legislation.</P>
        <P>Based on the information supplied to my Department by the registrars of ships at the 13 ports of registry around the coast, on 1 January 2005 there were 58 merchant ships on the register and on 31 December 2005 there were 52 merchant ships.</P>
        <P>The Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, is the development and promotional agency for the shipping and shipping services sector and is based in the Marine Institute. Late last year, the IMDO was asked to carry out a thorough evaluation of the results of existing strategies to promote the Irish maritime sector, including the successes achieved to date and the issues to be addressed going forward. Terms of reference are currently being formalised in consultation with my Department and the IMDO hopes to complete the requested evaluation later this year.</P>

        <P>In parallel with the opening to traffic of the Dublin Port tunnel, Dublin City Council will be introducing a heavy goods vehicle traffic management strategy to ensure that maximum traffic benefits are secured from the Dublin Port tunnel.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s formal role will be to put in place the necessary regulatory framework relating to traffic and parking management and road signage to support the strategy. In addition, my Department will continue to liaise with Dublin City Council as the strategy is finalised so that I may be assured that the primary objective of the Dublin Port tunnel &mdash; to provide a high quality access route to Dublin Port for heavy goods vehicles &mdash; is achieved in a manner which maximises the overall traffic benefit of the tunnel.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122, 151, 174, 183 and 264 together.</P>
        <P>At the launch of Transport 21 on 1 November, I said that I was convinced that we need a new approach to transport in the greater Dublin area, delivered through a single authority with the power to ensure joined-up thinking and delivery across all transport modes.</P><Col N="1737"/>
        <P>In pursuit of that objective, I appointed a team last November to finalise the remit, structures and human resource requirements of the proposed authority. The chairperson of the team is Professor Margaret O&rsquo;Mahony of Trinity College. The other members are John Lumsden and Pat Mangan, assistant secretaries at my Department, and Colin Hunt who is my special adviser.</P>
        <P>I asked the team, when considering the remit of the authority, to have regard to the importance of timely and effective implementation of the Transport 21 investment programme in the greater Dublin area, delivering an integrated transport system and of ensuring effective inter-agency co-operation and co-ordination. I also asked the team to make recommendations on interim arrangements to be put in place, pending enactment of legislation to establish the new authority.</P>
        <P>I expect to receive the team&rsquo;s report in the near future and I intend to bring proposals to the Government for decision as soon as I have had an opportunity to consider the report. The funding requirements and timetable for establishment of the proposed authority will be considered by the Government at that time. The Government will also consider the interim arrangements to be implemented at that stage with a view to maintaining momentum pending enactment of the necessary legislation. In the meantime I do not propose to pre-empt the outcome of the team&rsquo;s deliberations and any future Government decisions.</P>
        <P>It had been my intention that the proposed public transport commission would allocate Exchequer subvention through public service contracts for public transport bus and rail services, license commercial bus services and regulate fares on all bus and rail services, including Luas. Clearly, it is important that proposals for modernising the regulatory framework governing public transport should be coherent with the institutional arrangements for transport in the greater Dublin area. Accordingly, I have already indicated that I will review how best to proceed in respect of the public transport commission after Professor O&rsquo;Mahony&rsquo;s team has reported and the Government has made decisions on the proposed transport authority for the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>With regard to the delivery of Transport 21, I have already established a dedicated division in my Department to oversee the implementation of all aspects of Transport 21. In addition, I will shortly establish a high-level monitoring group to be chaired by my Department and comprising representatives of relevant Departments and the State agencies with responsibility for implementing the projects in Transport 21.</P>

	<P>The operation and licensing of wheelchair accessible taxis and their drivers is currently controlled through the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002. The Commission for Taxi Regulation is responsible for the development and maintenance of a new regulatory framework for the control and operation of small public service vehicles and their drivers.</P>
        <P>In 2005 the Commission initiated a national review to assess the extent and quality of services currently provided by small public service vehicles and subsequently published Roadmap &mdash; Towards a new national code of regulation for taxis, hackneys and limousines in Ireland, which set out the areas where change is required along with the commission&rsquo;s proposed solutions. Submissions were invited on the roadmap by 26 September 2005 following which the preparation of new regulations commenced.</P>
        <P>It is understood that the commission intends to improve accessibility through new regulations facilitating improved standards of vehicle accessibility and increased availability of accessible vehicles, as well as measures to improve driver awareness and training and improved information and infrastructure provision. The commission will shortly publish its action plan outlining changes that will be put in place from 2006 on a phased basis.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 150 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Dublin Airport Authority&rsquo;s, DAA, medium term plan for new infrastructural provision at Dublin Airport published last autumn, a new terminal and associated pier facilities, pier E, will be provided to the south of the existing terminal. These facilities are due to come on stream in 2009. The plan also provided for other capacity enhancements including the provision of temporary pier facilities in 2006 and a permanent new pier, pier D, to be in place by late 2007. These new pier facilities will deliver significant <Col N="1739"/>additional aircraft contact stands for fast turnaround operations.</P>
        <P>In relation to Terminal 2, I understand that the DAA has progressed with the procurement of the project management and design teams for the project and that the authority will shortly announce the outcome of the bidding process. Work will commence immediately on the planning application and in this regard, preliminary consultation with Fingal County Council has already taken place. The DAA is working to the Government decision to have the terminal operational by 2009.</P>
        <P>The specification and cost of Terminal 2 will be independently verified by experts on behalf of the Government. Also, at the appropriate time, an independent body will manage an open tender competition to select an operator for the new terminal. The cost of developing pier D at Dublin Airport is an operational matter for the DAA. The final tender costs will not be fully known until the authority is in a position to place the procurement contract. I understand that the authority is currently actively engaged in the procurement process for pier D and expect that the process will be completed and a contract awarded within a matter of weeks. It is the intention of the DAA, that the new facility will be operational by late 2007.</P>

	<P>The driving test in Ireland is designed in accordance with the requirements of the European directives on driving licences, which set out the skills that a driver must demonstrate during a driving test. As in other EU countries there is a variation in the pass rate among test centres.</P>
        <P>The pass rate may be influenced by a number of factors including the number of lessons taken by the candidate, the standard of instruction available and demographic factors. Our pass rate is consistent with the experience in other countries.</P>
        <P>In relation to consistency in the standard of the driving test, my Department undertook a comprehensive training programme for all driver testers in 2002 covering procedures for carrying out the test, guidelines to assess faults and training to enhance customer service in the delivery of the driving test. The work of all testers is monitored on an ongoing basis by supervisory driver testers to ensure that a uniform standard of test is maintained.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 170 together.</P>
        <P>The planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects, including the Dublin Port tunnel, is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, and the local authorities concerned.</P>
        <P>Good progress continues to be made on the construction of the tunnel. I am informed that the civil engineering work within the tunnels has now been largely completed and that the main focus of work has shifted to the installation of the mechanical and electrical systems which make up the safety and control features of the project. I understand from the NRA that the tunnel is expected to be open to traffic in summer 2006 following the testing and commissioning of the tunnels&rsquo; operational and safety features. I understand from the NRA that the estimated cost of the Dublin Port tunnel remains at &euro;751 million.</P>
        <P>The tunnel&rsquo;s construction work has been monitored in detail since the project commenced in 2001. Design and construction is monitored by construction supervisors appointed by Dublin City Council. When problems arise, as they inevitably do with projects of this size, Dublin City Council and their construction supervisors ensure that they are detected and rectified.</P>
        <P>I understand from Dublin City Council that recent leaks are part and parcel of the issues that arise on large engineering projects such as the tunnel. If remedial measures are called for at any stage the contractor is required to implement them at their own expense. I also understand that contrary to the impression that may have been created, the tunnels are safe and stable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The decentralisation of transport staff to Loughrea is among the priority moves in the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme. A total of 50 posts are due to transfer to Loughrea.</P>
        <P>A suitable site has been identified in Loughrea and the Office of Public Works is currently in discussion with the county council in relation to the preparation necessary for lodging an application to obtain planning permission for the site. We are working to ensure that the posts are transferred <Col N="1742"/>to Loughrea by 2007 as required. In view of the timescale involved the possibility of temporary accommodation in Loughrea has also been actively pursued in consultation with OPW and a possible site has now been identified.</P>
        <P>The overall numbers and location for decentralisation in the transport sector are outlined are in the following table. The decision to set up a road safety authority effectively means that the figures under the Department of Transport and the National Safety Council can be merged to provide for 50 transport posts in Loughrea. Many of the grades transferring to Loughrea are oversubscribed. Although there are risks associated with the establishment of the RSA, I remain confident of meeting the target of 50 transport posts in Loughrea by 2007.</P><Col N="1741"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129, 158, 172, 179, 190, 200 and 280 together.</P>
        <P>In summary, about 5% of the overall Luas track will require remedial work which will be <Col N="1743"/>carried out with minimal interference to the travelling public. There is currently no threat to passenger safety and the remedial work will be carried out at no expense to the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, or the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Approximately one third of the track on the Luas system uses &lsquo;Edilon Block&rsquo; rail supports. This represents 7.7 km of twin track on both Luas lines, out of a total track length of 24 km. The system comprises a concrete rail support block which is supported in a precast concrete tray by an &lsquo;Edilon&rsquo; polymer. The benefit of such a system is that it reduces noise and vibration generated by trams. I am informed that Edilon is a reputable manufacturer of various polymers for track systems, having supplied similar products to systems such as Madrid and Bilbao.</P>
        <P>In April 2004, prior to the start of Luas passenger services in June of that year, quality control procedures within the RPA revealed that the extent of bonding between the polymer material and adjoining concrete was not as per specification. This was notified by the RPA to the Luas Monitoring Committee, chaired by my Department, in May 2004. At that time, the extent of the problem had not been fully determined but the RPA assured the Department that a track monitoring process had been put in place. The monitoring committee&rsquo;s professional railway consultants, Parsons Brinckerhoff, drew no particular attention in their reports to this issue at that time. In addition, the then Interim Railway Safety Commission, which operated on a functionally independent basis pending its recent establishment on a statutory footing on 1 January 2006, was aware of the issue and it gave rise to no material safety concerns.</P>
        <P>There is currently no threat to passenger safety arising from the polymer bonding issue. The newly established, statutory, Railway Safety Commission has recently confirmed this. Two of the world&rsquo;s leading track experts reported on the issue to the RPA and to the main Luas contractor in autumn last year. Both carried out extensive on-site and laboratory tests and have confirmed that the system is safe. However, they do recommend ongoing monitoring of the situation and appropriate remedial works in due course.</P>
        <P>While the exact cause of the problem has not yet been established, this issue is a contractual matter between the RPA and the relevant contractor and my Department has no role in this matter. The necessary remedial works will fall to be dealt with by the contractor and will be carried out at no expense to RPA or the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>No more than about 5% of the overall Luas track will require modification to bring it up to full specification and I understand from the RPA that this work will begin around April-May of this year with minimal interference to the travelling public. The intention is to do most of the necessary work within maintenance engineering hours.</P><Col N="1744"/>
        <P>The media have also reported about other faults on the Luas network. These refer to the normal snag list to be rectified by the contractor. The RPA is satisfied that none of the items on the snag list have any negative impact on the safe and efficient operation of the Luas. These will also be rectified by the contractor at no cost to the RPA or to the taxpayer.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 277 together.</P>
        <P>Statistics relating to road accidents, based on information provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are published by the National Roads Authority, NRA, in its annual Road Accident Facts reports. The most recent report, now entitled Road Collision Facts, relates to 2004 and is available on the NRA website. Reports relating to previous years are available in the Oireachtas Library. The report refers in particular to the various contributory factors to collisions where such data is available.</P>
        <P>In that context the report in respect of 2004 notes that driver error accounted for 88% of all contributory factors in respect of all collisions where such were identified. Pedestrian error was the next most listed factor at 8%, with road factors accounting for 2% of all of those listed. The remaining factors listed related to vehicle and environmental factors.</P>
        <P>The report does not address a ranking order for contributory factors to collisions on a specific or general basis. However, the report notes that during the hours of the day most strongly associated with drinking and driving, some 26% of fatalities were recorded.</P>
        <P>The annual road collision reports provide a significant degree of knowledge that supports and informs the deployment of road safety measures, which are pursued within the planning framework of the multi-annual road safety strategies.</P>

	<P>Directive 2003/97 lays down new standards for the type approval of certain categories of vehicles, particularly lorries, in relation to the field of vision of drivers and requires that all new vehicles meet the new standards from 26 January 2007.</P>
        <P>In April 2005, the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, were requested to consider advising their members to retrofit vehicles with blind spot mirrors or indirect vision devices. SIMI was also asked that, in advance of the 26 January 2007 deadline for new vehicles, all new HGVs being put on the market meet the higher standards required by Directive 2003/97/EC.</P>
        <P>The IRHA responded positively indicating that for the past number of years it has actively encouraged its members to fit convex mirrors to their vehicles and to request these when acquiring new vehicles. SIMI has informed me that it has received a very positive response from vehicle distributors to the request for early implementation of Directive 2003/97/EC and it anticipates that by the end of March 2006 up to 80% of new vehicles of the relevant categories will meet the requirements of the directive. It is my intention to have the necessary directive transposed into law before the deadline of January 2007.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 204 together.</P>
        <P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, make toll bye-laws and enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the National Roads Authority, NRA, under Part V of the Roads Act 1993, as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>
        <P>I have given no directions to the NRA under section 41 of the Roads Act in relation to its <Col N="1746"/>negotiations with National Toll Roads, NTR, regarding the upgrade of that section of the M50 operated by NTR. The position in relation to the negotiations is that the NRA has decided with my agreement to terminate discussions with NTR relating to the upgrade of the West-Link toll facility and to commence a tender process for the design, building and operation of a barrier free toll regime on the M50. In this context, the NRA is undertaking a comprehensive traffic study as a basis for designing the new tolling arrangements for the M50. The detailed proposals emerging from this study will be submitted for the approval of the Government.</P>
        <P>I understand from the NRA that they expect to have free flow tolling in operation on the upgraded section of the M50 in summer 2008.</P>

	<P>A matter that is relevant to vehicle-based technologies is that the regulatory framework for vehicle standards is set at European level through a harmonised system of motor vehicle type-approval. Standards for new passenger cars in the EU are specified in a range of EU type-approval directives that are incorporated into a system known as EU whole vehicle type approval, WVTA. WVTA facilitates the achievement of a single market for cars through harmonised safety and environmental standards. New cars must have WVTA in order to be placed on the market in the EU. Once a car has WVTA, it must be given access to the EU market and it is not open to a member state to unilaterally require additional equipment to be fitted in a car.</P>
        <P>The inclusion in motor vehicles of technology of the type outlined by the Deputy is not required under the EU motor vehicle type-approval system. Accordingly, it would not be open to Ireland to require the installation of such equipment in motor vehicles.</P>

        <P>The Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006 contains a commitment that random preliminary roadside testing of drivers for the presence of alcohol would be introduced before the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>Against the background of that commitment I have pursued a very detailed examination of the possible approaches that could be adopted to allow for the introduction of a scheme of random breath testing.

        <P>The Attorney General has now provided advice that will allow for the development of a scheme for the operation of random breath testing in a targeted manner, as I indicated in response to today&rsquo;s priority question on this subject.</P>

A copy of the manual is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>Since late 2004 my Department has been engaged in a comprehensive review of the Traffic Signs Manual. This task is being undertaken in association with the National Roads Authority, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the consultants who have been engaged to prepare a new manual. It is intended that the use of the manual by road authorities will ensure a high quality of signposting in the State through uniformity of practice and the creation of a consistent approach to signing, including at road works.</P><Col N="1749"/>
        <P>A draft of a new chapter eight of the manual which relates to traffic signs at roadworks is currently the subject of a consultation process involving all road authorities and other interested parties. This chapter will be finalised following consideration of submissions received in response to that consultation process and it is proposed that it will be published by mid-year. Work on the remaining chapters is progressing and it is hoped that drafts will be made available for consultation with local authorities and other interested parties by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the provision, positioning, maintenance and monitoring of traffic signs on non-national roads is a matter for each individual road authority and in the case of national roads, the National Road Authority.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139, 152, 178 and 201 together.</P>
        <P>I have recently introduced regulations, SI 780 of 2005, the European Communities (Access to Railway Infrastructure) (Amendment) Regulations, 2005, transposing Directive 2004/51/EC on the development of the Community&rsquo;s railways. These regulations allow for the opening of the freight market to competition from 1 January 2006, in the case of international freight, and from 1 January 2007 for domestic freight operations.</P>
        <P>While no formal applications have yet been received for a railway undertaking licence or for track access, my Department has received a communication from an operator stating their intention to establish themselves as a freight operator. My Department has been in touch with the operator, but no formal application has been received to date.</P>
        <P>In relation to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s freight business, it is its goal to return this business to profitability. Significant progress has been made recently in this regard; in fact, the business is forecast to turn the freight operating deficit of &euro;10 million in 2003 into a break-even position by 2007. To help achieve this turnaround, the company withdrew from loss-making single container movements on common user liner trains between Dublin and the provincial railheads in Ballina, Cork and Limerick on 29 July last year. This business continued to lose substantial moneys despite significant rationalisation of the cost base. I understand Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is continuing to explore the expansion of its rail freight business where there are viable trainload business opportunities.</P>

	<P>The importance of providing emergency towing vessel facilities, ETV, to protect our coasts has been recognised, including the possibility of sharing such services with the UK in relation to the east coast. However, the very significant costs involved has meant that, in the context of other marine emergency response priorities, it has not been possible to date to put permanent ETV arrangements in place. I have therefore asked the Coast Guard to look again at this issue and advise me on suitable options having regard to associated costs and benefits.</P>

	<P>At the outset I wish to extend my sympathies to the families of those who tragically lost their lives as a result of the sinking of the <i>Rising Sun</i> fishing vessel.</P>
        <P>An investigator from the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB, commenced an investigation into the incident on Wednesday, 30 November 2005. To facilitate that inquiry and in view of health and safety concerns arising particularly as a result of oil pollution emanating from the sunken vessel, the Coast Guard informed all parties, including shipping, fishing and local diving clubs, not to visit the site. When the MCIB investigator indicated on 1 December 2005 that <Col N="1752"/>he did not require an exclusion zone to be maintained around the sunken vessel for the purposes of his investigation, the temporary exclusion direction was lifted. The pollution threat had also receded by that time.</P>
        <P>Local diving interests indicated to the Coast Guard that they wanted to dive on the site. However, although the exclusion direction was lifted, the Coast Guard, in consultation with the Navy, requested all divers in the area not to dive on the vessel in view of the dangerous site conditions, water depths, undercurrents and poor weather conditions.</P>
        <P>In responding to marine emergencies the Coast Guard generally welcomes the assistance of local people, particularly in search and recovery operations. However, in every situation the Coast Guard expects such volunteers to operate under its guidance and instructions, which are provided by the Coast Guard on-scene incident co-ordinator.</P>
        <P>The request not to dive was ignored and tragically a local diver died that day. The cause of his death is not yet known. When it became clear that the request would continue to be ignored, particularly over the weekend when sports divers from around the country announced that they planned to dive on the site, it was decided to issue a formal notice on Friday, 2 December re-establishing an exclusion zone.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145, 160, 205 and 209 together.</P>
        <P>The State Airports Act 2004 provides for the establishment of the three State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork as fully independent and autonomous authorities under State ownership. The Act provides a framework to allow for an orderly approach to the distribution of the assets of Shannon and Cork airports in conformity with the capital maintenance and other provisions of the Companies Act. New boards were appointed at all three airports in 2004.</P>
        <P>The boards of Cork and Shannon Airports are now charged with making preparations to assume responsibility for the ownership and development of the airports. They are also empowered to undertake certain management and operational functions, on an agreed basis with Dublin Airport Authority, during the interim period.</P>
        <P>Under the Act, before any assets can transfer to either the Shannon or Cork Airport Authorities, the Ministers for Transport and Finance will have to be satisfied as to the financial and operational readiness of the airport authorities. Accordingly, each airport authority is required to prepare a comprehensive business plan and obtain the Ministers&rsquo; approval for these plans before any assets can be transferred.</P>
        <P>The three State airport authorities are continuing to work on the preparation of their business plans with the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, co-ordinating the process. In this context there is a range of issues, including the unsustainable cost base at Shannon Airport, the recent airport charges determination for Dublin Airport by the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the optimum mechanisms for the financing of the new terminal in Cork, that need to be carefully considered. These are complex issues that the airport authorities must consider carefully and, as I have indicated previously, I have not imposed any artificial deadlines for the completion of the business planning process.</P>
        <P>As regards Cork Airport, a major new terminal development project is currently being completed. The new terminal will deliver an annual passenger capacity of three million people with the facility to expand to five million, when needed.</P>
        <P>There was an indication at an early stage in the airport restructuring process that the intention was that both the independent Cork and Shannon <Col N="1754"/>Airports would commence on a debt-free basis. However, this was always going to be subject to determining the optimum mechanisms for allocating airport assets among the three airports in compliance with the capital maintenance rules and other provisions of the Companies Acts.</P>
        <P>The position with regard to the transfer of assets to Cork Airport Authority was set out in the course of the passing of the State Airports Act 2005. Because of the tightness of DAA&rsquo;s distributable reserves a phased approach to restructuring was outlined at the time. The option was mentioned of the negotiation of a finance lease covering a portion of Cork Airport&rsquo;s assets to facilitate the earlier establishment of Cork as a fully independent airport. The Deputy can be assured that Cork&rsquo;s ability to operate on a completely commercial basis will be fully assessed as part of the business planning process and will be factored into the decisions made.</P>
        <P>The need to address the cost base of Shannon Airport is not related to the restructuring of the State airports as this has long been identified as a pre-existing challenge. It is expected that any necessary staff reductions that may arise will be achieved by voluntary early retirement or voluntary severance schemes to be negotiated with the trade unions.</P>
        <P>The Shannon Airport Authority is currently engaged with trade union representatives on its rationalisation proposals. The proposals are being discussed under the chairmanship of the Labour Relations Commission. I understand that in the last number of days the Shannon restructuring plan has been jointly referred to the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Great Southern Hotels Group, GSH, I understand that its parent company, the Dublin Airport Authority, is currently considering how to achieve the optimum outcome for the future of the hotels, having regard to their financial position. I understand that proposals on the future of GSH are to be submitted to my Department shortly, following consideration by the boards of GSH and the DAA.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Question No. 150 on 19 October 2005 and Question No. 160 on 24 November 2005.</P><Col N="1755"/>
        <P>The North-South work programme, which was agreed by the North-South Ministerial Council, included a commitment to examine the mutual recognition of penalty points between the Republic of Ireland and the North. However, in addition to the fact that separate penalty point systems operate in the two jurisdictions on this island, the system that operates in Northern Ireland differs from that applying in Great Britain. For that reason, it was agreed that it would be more appropriate to pursue the question of mutual recognition of penalty points on the basis of the operation of the three systems and that it would also be more appropriate that it would be dealt with under the auspices of the British-Irish Council. As Northern Ireland has the lead role for transport matters in the BIC, the authorities in that jurisdiction are taking the lead in considering this issue.</P>
        <P>The development of a system of mutual recognition of penalty points presents complex legal questions and will require the negotiation of a bilateral agreement between the two Governments and probably the passage of primary legislation to support such an agreement. For that reason, my Department has sought and obtained the advice of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in relation to this issue which will inform future consideration of the issue.</P>
        <P>Under the structures of the British-Irish Council, Northern Ireland is the lead administration for the organisation and co-ordination of all BIC transport sectoral issues. There has not been a BIC transport ministerial meeting since these road safety issues were adopted onto the BIC work programme in November 2004.</P>
        <P>Mutual recognition of driving disqualifications and driving offences will be discussed by Ministers at the forthcoming BIC Transport Ministerial meeting scheduled for 9 February 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 22 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 provides that where a person is convicted of a drink driving offence, the court shall, unless it is satisfied that there are special and substantial reasons for not so doing, order that person to pay a prescribed amount to the court as a contribution to the costs and expenses of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety. The prescribed amount, which was established in 1994 at &pound;75, is &euro;95.23.</P>
        <P>The Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006 provides for the implementation of a range of linked measures relating to drinking and driving including the adoption of a system of random roadside <Col N="1756"/>preliminary breath testing. These proposals include a specific measure for an increase in the charge imposed by the courts under section 22 of the Road Traffic Act 1994. The initiative will be pursued in association with the proposals for the development of a legislative basis for the adoption of a scheme for the operation of random breath testing in a targeted and sustainable manner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 173 together.</P>
        <P>The Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, is the statutory body responsible for the delivery of a multi-operator system of integrated public transport ticketing using smartcard technology. The proposed system is, in line with international experience, being introduced on a phased basis, initially in the Dublin area.</P>
        <P>As part of the phased introduction of smartcard-based integrated ticketing, in April 2004, Morton&rsquo;s Coaches, in conjunction with the RPA and as a &lsquo;proof of concept&rsquo;, successfully launched smartcards on its services. Last March, another step was taken with the launch of smartcards on Luas services. To date, approximately 11,000 smartcards have been purchased for use on Luas services. The Luas smartcard deployment is helping to obtain important feedback from passengers and provide operational experience for the next stage of integrated ticketing.</P>
        <P>Following an inconclusive procurement procedure in 2005, the RPA is finalising proposals for a revised implementation plan. The RPA is currently discussing these proposals with transport operators and the outcome will determine a revised target implementation process and timescale for the phased rollout of integrated ticket<Col N="1757"/>ing. I understand from the RPA that it is unlikely that the full integrated system will be in place by the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>I expect the ongoing discussions to conclude shortly, after which a revised implementation plan and timescale will be presented to my Department.</P>

	<P>On 6 December 2005, the European Parliament and the Council reached agreement, through the conciliation process, on a new EU regulation designed to improve driving times and rest periods for professional drivers. The new EU regulation includes a number of changes to the existing rules, designed specifically to minimise <Col N="1759"/>the risks of driver fatigue and ensure safety for drivers and other road users. This includes the removal of the existing provision that allows drivers of passenger vehicles involved in non-regular services to drive for up to 12 continuous days before taking a weekly rest period.</P>
        <P>As the provisions of the new regulation have already been agreed at EU level, there is no scope for making changes at this stage. These new rules will replace the existing drivers&rsquo; hours rules which have not been updated since 1985. It is expected that the legal text of the new regulation will be formally adopted shortly and will come into effect throughout the European Union as soon as it is published in the EU Official Journal. After that, member states will have 12 months to implement the new drivers&rsquo; hours rules.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 164 and 196 together.</P>
        <P>The McCann report recommended a phased approach to the construction of the western rail corridor. Following the launch of Transport 21, I asked Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to commence the design and planning stages of the western rail corridor from Ennis to Claremorris. The line between Ennis and Athenry will be the first section to be developed. The indicative timescale for development of the corridor is Ennis to Athenry to be completed in 2008, Athenry to Tuam in 2011 and Tuam to Claremorris in 2014. The necessary steps to preserve the section of line between Claremorris and Collooney will be taken this year. I await specific proposals from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in relation to the development of the first phase.</P>
        <P>This phased approach to reopening the western rail corridor, as well as being consistent with the McCann recommendations, also allows for the management of the construction programme in the context of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s overall resource requirements under Transport 21 and makes sense from the perspective of the effective management of the overall capital envelope.</P>
        <P>Following completion, in 2010, of the inter-urban motorways programme linking Dublin and the provincial cities, the roads element of Transport 21 will focus on the substantial upgrading of the remainder of the national primary road network. This includes the Atlantic corridor linking the gateways of Letterkenny, Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford, elements of which will be developed between now and 2010. The Atlantic corridor and the western rail corridor will be key projects in remedying the infrastructural deficit of the west.</P>

	<P>In January 2005, when responsibility for ports policy was in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Minister of State with responsibility for the marine launched the Government&rsquo;s ports policy statement. The policy statement aims to better equip the port sector and its stakeholders to meet national and regional capacity and service needs. One of the key challenges that lies ahead is the provision of adequate in-time port capacity, particularly for unitised trade. The policy statement sets out a framework to ensure that capacity needs are identified, planned and progressed in a coordinated manner.</P>
        <P>As an initial step in this process, the Department consulted with the commercial ports handling unitised trade, to determine their view of port capacity and how they intended to deal with the projected capacity requirement. Both Dublin Port Company and Drogheda Port Company responded in this regard with information on their project proposals.</P>
        <P>In addition, in September 2005, the Department appointed a firm of consultants expert in this field, Fisher Associates, to, <i>inter alia</i>, invite detailed project submissions from the commercial ports and evaluate those submissions with a view to the Department&rsquo;s recommendations to Government. As part of this process the Department expects submissions from both Dublin Port Company and Drogheda Port Company with regard to their capacity plans.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this process is to satisfy the Government that the anticipated capacity requirement to 2014 and beyond can be efficiently and adequately met through the successful advancement and implementation by the port sector of some combination of the key projects referred to above. The Government expects <Col N="1763"/>that market forces will decide which projects or combination of projects are completed.</P>
        <P>Drogheda Port Company has a well publicised proposal to develop a new port facility at Bremore in north County Dublin. Drogheda Port Company updated my officials on the progress of this project at meetings in December 2005 and January 2006.</P>
        <P>In addition, I am informed that, on Friday last, 27 January 2006, Drogheda Port Company published a notice in the national and international press seeking joint venture partners in the project. The company is aware that any such joint venture would require my consent, in line with the requirements of the Department of Finance code of practice for the governance of State bodies.</P>
        <P>On 15 December last, the Progressive Democrats launched a discussion document entitled, A New Heart for Dublin. According to the document it is intended to fuel debate and it invites submissions from interested parties.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The main purpose of the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Bill 2005 is to give effect to the international convention on co-operation for the safety of air navigation. The convention is the result of negotiations on a revision of the original convention signed in 1960 to take into account developments since then relating to the provision of air navigation services.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the concerns of some aircraft leasing companies about the provisions in the revised Eurocontrol convention concerning attaching debts to Eurocontrol as a lien on the aircraft and making the operator and owner jointly and severally liable for such debts. These provisions are not included in the published Bill.</P>
        <P>Under the convention, Ireland is under no compulsion to legislate for the creation of liens or joint and several liability. Rather, it is at the discretion of each contracting party to introduce domestic law to implement this element of the convention. I can therefore assure the Deputy that the passage of this Bill in its current form will not increase our current powers concerning the detention and sale of aircraft for unpaid <Col N="1765"/>charges. These provisions have been in place since 1988.</P>
        <P>The leasing companies have also voiced concerns about the powers contained in earlier Acts dating from 1988 and they have asked that they be modified in the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Bill 2005. As a result, I consulted with the Office of the Attorney General and other interested parties, namely, the Irish Aviation Authority, the Dublin Airport Authority and Eurocontrol. All argued against the removal or dilution of the existing powers of detention and sale.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of all the views expressed on both sides, I have decided not to make any changes to the existing powers at this point. The Bill will come before the House in the coming days and I will deal with these issues in more detail at that point.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The consensus of public authorities concerned with road safety has been that the wearing of reflective armbands is best promoted on a voluntary basis by way of educational and publicity campaigns such as those undertaken by the National Safety Council, rather than through legislation. The safety of all road users is generally a matter of personal responsibility. In that context, the Rules of the Road include a strong recommendation supporting the use at night by pedestrians of reflective armbands outside urban areas.</P>
        <P>However, I have asked my officials to consider, in consultation with the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Finance, the question of supplying all school children with reflective armbands, and to report to me on the matter.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s Road Safety Strategy 2004-06 sets a primary target of a 25% reduction in road collision fatalities by the end of 2006 over the average annual number of fatalities in the 1998-2003 period. Achievement of the target would result in no more than 300 deaths per annum by the end of the period of the strategy. This is an ambitious target and one which will require the continued commitment to a strategic, integrated approach by all of the road safety agencies.</P>
        <P>Progress depends in the first instance on a continued emphasis on the approach that underpins the strategy. A major independent review of the previous strategy confirms that basing the primary target on the achievement of progress in the areas of speeding, drink driving and use of seat belts remains the correct approach. These remain the key areas of the new strategy.</P>
        <P>The increase in road deaths recorded over the past number of months places the challenge of meeting the targets set out in the strategy in stark focus. I am satisfied that all of the agencies involved in the delivery of the strategy are fully committed to the achievement of the goals that underpin it, and that they have the resources available to them to support those commitments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Road Safety Strategy 2004-06 acknowledges that there are significant difficulties in establishing a benchmark from which to set a target for the achievement of a reduction in the number of serious injuries. For that reason, the central target established for the strategy was focused on the realisation of a reduction in the number of road deaths.</P>
        <P>The strategy included a commitment to the pursuit of a programme aimed at establishing a more robust basis for determining injury data based on the information flow from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the National Roads Authority, allied to information from hospital admission data and insurance claims.</P>
        <P>This exercise is still being pursued by a number of organisations that are represented on the road safety high level group under the general direction of the National Roads Authority, which is tasked with the publication of national road collision data.</P><Col N="1767"/>
        <P>As the planning horizon for the current strategy is completed at the end of this year, the establishment of a meaningful target for the achievement of reductions in injuries would be of limited value. The results of the examination of this issue will, however, inform decisions on the establishment of targets for the next road safety strategy.</P>

	<P>I am aware that consultants have carried out a study of the cost of congestion for Dublin Bus. The impact of congestion and other factors on the cost base of Dublin Bus are the subject of ongoing <Col N="1770"/>discussions between my Department and the company. In this context, I have recently granted Dublin Bus an average 4% increase in bus fares, together with an increase of 5% in Exchequer subvention for 2006. This is in addition to the significant Exchequer investment in bus priority measures in recent years and the planned further investment in such measures contained in Transport 21.</P>

Legislation to support the application of the convention is contained in the Road Traffic Act 2002. The convention relates to disqualifications arising from a range of specified traffic offences including drink-driving, speeding and dangerous driving. Arrangements for the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications are being considered in the context of the British-Irish Council and the matter is being progressed. It is anticipated that there will be progress at the forthcoming ministerial meeting of the British-Irish Council dealing with transport matters.</P>

	<P>Section 36 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, as amended by section 36 of the Road Traffic Act 2004, provides for a system of automatic disqualification from applying for or holding a small public service vehicle driver licence or vehicle licence in respect of persons who have been convicted of one of a range of very serious offences, including murder, manslaughter and various sexual, drug trafficking and other offences. A person who is affected by these provisions can request the courts to allow them to apply for a licence in certain restricted circumstances.</P>
        <P>The commencement of section 36 requires further consultation with licensing authorities, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Courts Service, among others, to ensure that the appropriate arrangements for implementation are in place. Specific legal advice on a number of issues surrounding the practical application of the section has been sought from the Office of the Attorney General. It will be necessary to give an appropriate period of advance notice of the proposed commencement of the section to allow persons who may be affected by the provisions, in particular existing licence holders, to clarify their position with the courts. Commencement of the section will be considered, in consultation with the Commission for Taxi Regulation, when the legal and administrative issues have been resolved.</P>

	<P>The Labour Relations Commission brokered the registered agreement that resolved the recent Irish Ferries dispute referred to by the Deputy. <Col N="1772"/>As responsibility for the commission rests with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, I do not consider it appropriate for me to report to the D&aacute;il on the resolution of an industrial dispute entered into under the auspices of the commission.</P>
        <P>There is no EU directive on the manning of regular passenger and ferry services operating in and between member states, in force or being considered at present by member states. If the commission were to initiate such a proposal, I would give it very careful consideration.</P>
        <P>At the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council, held in Brussels on 5 December 2005, the Minister of State with responsibility for the marine at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, raised the issue of the Irish Ferries dispute and requested the European Commission to consider revisiting its former proposal on the manning conditions on ferries operating between member states.</P>
        <P>The Commission responded by indicating that its priorities were to continue to encourage dialogue between the European social partners on the manning of ferries issue; to pursue the implementation of International Labour Organisation standards in Community law, and to study all possible solutions to safeguard employment in the maritime sector.</P>

        <P>Significant progress has been made to date. Applications for railway orders for the Luas extension to Cherrywood and Docklands have been made. I have approved funding for a 10 m extension of the trams used on the Tallaght line, increasing passenger capacity by 40%, and for the purchase of an additional 30 mainline railcars, bringing the total to 150. The NRA recently announced its 2006 investment programme which will see work start on 15 new projects and the completion of 13 projects, meaning that more than 400 km of national road will be started or completed this year.</P>
        <P>I have already established a dedicated division in my Department to oversee the implementation of all aspects of Transport 21. In addition, I will establish a high-level monitoring group shortly to be chaired by my Department and comprising representatives of relevant Departments and the State agencies with responsibility for implementing the projects in Transport 21. The main role of the group will be to monitor implementation of Transport 21, ensure adequate appraisal procedures are in place and review prioritisation of projects to ensure optimum effectiveness of the implementation programme.</P>
        <P>I am also on record as saying that we need a new approach to transport in the greater Dublin area, specifically for the delivery of Transport 21. I have proposed the establishment of a Dublin transport authority with the power to ensure joined-up thinking and delivery across all transport modes. I have appointed a team chaired by Professor Margaret O&rsquo;Mahony to finalise the remit, structures and human resource requirements of the proposed authority and I expect to receive the team&rsquo;s report in the near future. I intend to bring proposals to the Government for decision as soon as I have considered the report of the team.</P>

        <P>I am conscious that complementary therapy, including homoeopathy, is of increasing interest to the public and that more people are now attending complementary therapists. However, while the practice of conventional medicine and health care in this country is controlled and regulated, complementary health care, including the practice of homoeopathy, has not been subject to the same level of oversight. Standards of education, professional qualifications and experience required are not as well established and the level of qualification and length of training among complementary therapists can vary. Moreover, the practice of some complementary therapies has sometimes been carried out on an informal basis.</P>
        <P>A national working group on the regulation of complementary therapists was established by my predecessor in May 2003 to advise on future measures for strengthening the regulatory environment for complementary therapists.

	<P>An individual living in Ireland for at least one year is considered by the Health Service Executive, HSE, to be ordinarily resident and is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1, that is, medical card holders or limited eligibility, category 2, for health services. Dependants of an ordinarily resident person who have not been in Ireland for a period of one year themselves must declare themselves to be the dependants of that person to the HSE and seek to satisfy the HSE that they intend to remain in Ireland for a period of at least one year.</P>
        <P>Individuals who have not been resident in Ireland for at least one year must satisfy the HSE that it is their intention to remain for a minimum of one year to establish their entitlements to health services. Dependants of such individuals must also contact the HSE in that regard.</P>
        <P>Persons in category 1 are medical card holders, and they are entitled to a full range of services, including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultants&rsquo; services, all out-patient public hospital services, <Col N="1780"/>including consultants&rsquo; services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service. Determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical or surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. Persons over the age of 70 years are automatically entitled to a medical card.</P>
        <P>Persons not entitled to a medical card but with an income below a certain threshold, 25% above the medical card income guidelines, may be entitled to a GP visit card. A GP visit card entitles the holder to free GP services. For those who do not qualify for a medical card, a number of schemes exist which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the drug payment scheme, a person and his or her dependants need not pay more than &euro;85 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines or appliances.</P>
        <P>Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultant services, and out-patient public hospital services, including consultant services. The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;60 per night, up to a maximum of &euro;600 in any 12 consecutive months. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of &euro;60 where the patient does not have a referral note from his or her doctor. A maternity and infant care service is provided during pregnancy and up to six weeks after birth.</P>
        <P>Further information on eligibility for health services can be obtained from the HSE national information line on 1850 24 1850, which operates from Monday to Saturday between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>As a member state of the EU and a signatory to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, OSPAR, Ireland expects all operators and licensees to carry out activities in accordance with the directives, decisions and recommendations of both organisations as stipulated for offshore exploration operations and including management of their environmental impacts. Exploration drilling offshore from Ireland is governed by the rules and procedures for offshore petroleum exploration operations. This document sets out the detailed requirements for drilling, and other operations in the Irish offshore. It incorporates, <i>inter alia</i>, the relevant decisions and recommendations of OSPAR.</P>
        <P>OSPAR&rsquo;s decisions and recommendations deal with the following: a mandatory control system for the use and reduction of the discharge of offshore chemicals, OSPAR decision 2000/2; the use of organic-phase drilling fluids, OPF, and the discharge of OPF contaminated cuttings, OSPAR decision 2000/3; a harmonised pre-screening scheme for offshore chemicals, OSPAR recommendation 2000/4; and the harmonised offshore chemical notification format, OSPAR recommendation 2000/5, in addition to a permit scheme to use or discharge added chemicals. The rules and procedures also prescribe that drilling applications include an environmental area assessment. My Department is putting in place a process to ensure full compliance by companies with the environmental requirements of the rules and procedures for offshore petroleum exploration operations.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The ban on the use of deep water gill nets is set down in the 2006 total allowable catch and quota regulation. The regulation requires the removal of such nets from the areas covered by the ban by 1 February 2006. The Naval Service will be responsible for policing the ban within the Irish exclusive fisheries zone, EFZ, and will monitor fishing activity in this zone to ensure that the banned gear is not deployed. New EU rules came into force on 1 January 2006 which require that gill nets must be marked with the identification of the vessel to which they belong. These will facilitate the work of the Naval Service in this regard. In EU waters outside the Irish EFZ, it will be the responsibility of the control authorities of each member state to monitor waters within their own EFZ, which are covered by the ban and, in international waters, it will be a matter for the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission.</P>
        <P>While I understand that the current ban is regarded by the EU Commission as a short-term emergency measure and that the Commission will be bringing forward long-term measures during the course of 2006, I will be at the forefront in pushing for the continuation of the current ban unless strong and effective alternative measures are brought forward by the Commission.</P>
        <P>With regard to abandoned gear, work has already been carried out by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and UK Government agencies during 2005 to remove nets that have been discarded at sea. The results of this work underlined the scale of the problem. I will be pressing for an EU co-ordinated campaign to build upon this excellent work, as I believe it requires the co-operation of all member states to send out a strong message against what is a totally unacceptable practice.</P>

	<P>A US congressional delegation, led by Congressman James Walsh, chairman of the friends of Ireland group in Congress, visited Ireland last month. I was pleased to meet with the delegation, which included Congressmen Brian Higgins and Tim Murphy, in Carlingford on 17 January.</P>
        <P>Our discussions covered bilateral issues of mutual interest. I took the opportunity to thank the delegation for the continued bipartisan support of the United States for the peace process in Northern Ireland. I briefed the delegation on cur<Col N="1788"/>rent developments in Northern Ireland and on the Government&rsquo;s determination to ensure the earliest practicable restoration of the devolved institutions. I stressed that 2006 will be a decisive year and underlined the continued importance of close US engagement with the peace process.</P>
        <P>I also raised the issue of the undocumented Irish in the United States. As the Deputy is aware, various legislative proposals are under consideration in the US at present, of which the Bills sponsored, respectively, by Senators Kennedy and McCain and by Senators Kyl and Cornyn, remain the most comprehensive and politically significant. I briefed the Congressmen on the strong support by the Government and the Oireachtas, as expressed in last October&rsquo;s all-party motion, for the approach proposed by Senators Kennedy and McCain. This, if adopted, would offer the undocumented a path to permanent residency. However, it is clear that the legislative situation is fluid and that achieving the necessary compromise on this sensitive issue remains a formidable challenge.</P>

In exceptional cases, however, exigencies may arise, such as technical failure or medical emergency, which require an overnight stay.

        <P>Ireland also has a bilateral extradition treaty in force with the United States of America since 1983, which applies to all offences having a penalty of more than one year&rsquo;s imprisonment or where a sentence of four months or more remains to be served.</P>
        <P>In addition, Ireland, Italy, France, Germany, UK and US are all party to the following 12 multilateral terrorism conventions: the convention on the prevention and punishment of crimes against internationally protected persons, including diplomatic agents, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 14 December 1973; the international convention against the taking of hostages, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 17 December 1979; the international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 15 December 1997; the international convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 December 1999; the convention on offences and certain other acts committed on board aircraft, signed at Tokyo on 14 September 1963; the convention for the suppression of unlawful seizure of aircraft, signed at the Hague on 16 December 1970; the convention for the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of civil aviation, signed at Montreal on 23 September 1971; the convention on the physical protection of nuclear material, signed at Vienna on 3 March 1980; the protocol on the suppression of unlawful acts of violence at airports serving international civil aviation, supplementary to the convention for the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of civil aviation, signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988; the convention for the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of maritime navigation, agreed in Rome on 10 March 1988; the protocol for the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of fixed platforms located on the continental shelf, agreed in Rome on 10 March 1988; and the convention on the marking of plastic explosives for the purpose of detection, signed at Montreal on 1 March 1991.</P>
        <P>None of the above agreements or conventions provide for any of the state parties having bases <Col N="1791"/>on this State&rsquo;s territory or carrying out policing operations independently here.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 246 to 249, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Government, as I have assured the House on numerous occasions, is utterly opposed to the practice of so-called extraordinary rendition. Any suggestion that the Government would tolerate such a practice is completely without foundation.</P>
        <P>I am aware of media reports that a number of civil aircraft alleged to be operated on behalf of <Col N="1792"/>the CIA have transited through several European countries and in his reply of 13 December 2005, my colleague, the Minister for Transport, furnished details regarding the movements of certain such aircraft. However, none of these reports has included any concrete evidence or specific allegations that prisoners have been transported through Irish airports as part of a so-called extraordinary rendition operation. In addition, the Government has sought and received categoric assurances from the US authorities in this regard.</P>
        <P>Civil aircraft, including civil aircraft chartered by the CIA, are not required, in accordance with the 1944 Chicago convention on international civil aviation, to seek permission to land here unless they are engaged in commercial operations in this country.</P>
        <P>State aircraft, on the other hand, are required to apply for permission before landing in Ireland. In the event that the US authorities were to request such permission for a State aircraft operating for the CIA, the Department of Foreign Affairs would require, in keeping with standard practice, an undertaking from the US Embassy that the aircraft would be unarmed, would not be carrying arms, ammunition or explosives, would not be engaged in intelligence gathering and was not taking part in military exercises or operations. These conditions are not legal requirements but are policy stipulations which are applied at the direction of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Other data sought would include the type and registration number of the aircraft, its call sign, the purpose of the flight, the nature of any cargo, its destination and point of departure and the estimated times of arrival and departure.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Stem cell research is an area which holds considerable promise in the treatment of various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, and spinal cord injury. Research is under way in Ireland on therapies using stem cells derived from adult tissues.</P>
        <P>As regards ethical issues pertaining to stem cells derived from embryonic sources, the current sixth framework programme, FP6, explicitly forbids EU funding for research that involves human reproductive cloning, the creation of human embryos for research and research that would change the genetic heritage. FP6, 2002-06, does allow EU funding of projects involving the derivation and use of human embryonic stem cells derived from supernumerary embryos in countries where such research is permitted.</P>
        <P>Under FP6 the funding of ethically sensitive projects is dealt with through a process of ethical review. In summary, all such projects are submitted to a rigorous four-stage process before being funded: national ethical review, European scientific review, European ethical review and consideration by a committee of member states. EU research programmes never fund in a member state, under any circumstances, anything that is not legal or is deemed unethical in that particular member state.</P>
        <P>The seventh framework programme, FP7, is due to commence at the beginning of 2007 and is scheduled to run until 2013. In presenting its proposals for FP7, the Commission has stated that it has adopted a no change policy with regard to the respect of fundamental ethical principles in research activity. This explicitly respects the positions of those member states whose legal and ethical regimes forbid such research.</P>
        <P>The detailed technical examination of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals is under way and I am currently consulting with the Minister for Health and Children on the position to be adopted by Ireland on the ethical issues that arise in these proposals.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 252 and 253 together.</P>
        <P>The role of the Health and Safety Authority under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 relates to the protection of workers in all sectors. I am advised by the Health and Safety Authority that no report on the prevalence of MRSA in private nursing homes, geriatric institutions and public hospitals for older people has been produced or is contemplated. However, in line with its programme of work for 2006, the authority is continuing work relating to the potential exposure of workers in hospitals to biohazards that might adversely affect their safety, health or welfare.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the authority is focusing on the existence and implementation of comprehensive infection control policies as part of the overall safety management system of workplaces where there may be a risk of workers&rsquo; exposure to biological agents. Such infection control policies must take account of all biological agents that may be present and, in particular, focus on those organisms that are of primary concern, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, legionella, hepatitis B, HIV, mycobacterium tuberculosis, TB, and streptococcus pyrogenes.</P>
        <P>I am also advised by the Health and Safety Authority that, as part of this work, it recently requested the Health Service Executive to identify those hospitals, if any, under the control of the executive that are not in possession of a written site-specific risk assessment for exposure to biological agents at work and the associated safety management system, including prevention and control measures. Any hospitals that are so identified will be subject to inspection by the authority&rsquo;s inspectorate and, where necessary, consideration will be given to appropriate enforcement action. In hospitals that the Health Service Executive considers compliant, a sample will also be subject to inspection in line with the authority&rsquo;s policy of dealing with this prioritised area.</P><Col N="1795"/>
        <P>With regard to the question of complaints regarding the prevalence of MRSA in private nursing homes, geriatric hospitals or other institutions caring for the elderly, the Department has no record of such complaints. However, the Health and Safety Authority has received correspondence relating to hospital patients and MRSA but the matters raised do not fall within the role of the authority in relation to those who are not at work on the basis that there must be a clear, direct and explicit connection between a current work activity and its effect on persons other than workers before the authority gets involved.</P>

        <P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. The Forf&aacute;s annual employment survey records jobs gained and lost in companies supported by the industrial development agencies.

However, at the end of 2004 there were 13 IDA supported companies operating in County Donegal employing 2,206 people.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 and 258 together.</P>
        <P>To qualify for a social insurance payment a person must satisfy contribution conditions which <Col N="1797"/>vary from scheme to scheme. In the case of widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s entitlement to a contributory pension this may be based on the social insurance record of either the widowed person or the late spouse. As few as three years&rsquo; contributions may be required with an annual average of 39 weeks contributions paid or credited over the three or five tax years, whichever is more beneficial, before reaching pension age or before the spouse died, if earlier. This gives entitlement to a maximum rate pension.</P>
        <P>These contribution requirements are one of the least stringent applying to long-term pension schemes. In addition, recipients over 66 years of age receive the same payment as those qualifying for the old age contributory pension, while those under 66 years of age receive more than other welfare recipients. Payment is unaffected by earnings or other income.</P>
        <P>The adequacy of payments for widowed people and welfare recipients in general is kept under review and, where appropriate, increases are granted in annual budgets. In budget 2006 widowed people received increases of between &euro;14 and &euro;17 per week or between 9.5% and<?oasys _jy ?>11%. In certain circumstances, they also have access to a range of other schemes including household benefits. The household benefits package, which comprises the electricity-gas allowance, telephone allowance and television licence schemes, is generally available to people living permanently in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or satisfy a means test. People aged over 70 years of age can qualify regardless of their income or household composition. Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefits package retain that entitlement to ensure households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
        <P>Information relating to the secondary income of all widows and widowers is not available. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate the cost of the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal. A range of proposals have been made to extend the coverage of the household benefits package of free schemes. These proposals are kept under review in the context of the objectives of the scheme and budgetary resources.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004. The basis for the restriction contained in the new <Col N="1798"/>rules is the applicant&rsquo;s habitual residence. The restriction is not based on citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor. The question of what is a person&rsquo;s habitual residence is decided in accordance with the criteria set out in European Court of Justice case law. Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case.</P>
        <P>The person concerned made an application for one-parent family payment in November 2005. Her case was referred to the habitual residence unit of my Department for a determination on her habitual residence in the State. A deciding officer has determined that the person concerned did not satisfy the habitual residence condition as she had not resided in the State or common travel area continuously for the past two years or more, has had no stable pattern of employment in the State and does not intend to remain here long term. The person concerned was informed of her right to have her case reviewed by the deciding officer and of her right to appeal the decision within 21 days.</P>

        <Quest>the reason PRSI contributions from self-employed people are not considered when assessing eligibility with regard to the retirement pension; his views on whether this discriminates against self-employed people; if he has considered or will consider altering the eligibility criteria to include PRSI contributions from self-employed people; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The retirement pension was introduced in 1970 and was intended to provide income support for people who had to retire aged 65 years until they became eligible for the normal social welfare pension, which at the time was payable from 70 years of age. The qualifying age for old age pension was subsequently reduced over time to 66 years of age which means the require<Col N="1799"/>ment to retire before receiving a retirement pension now only has effect for one year. The self-employed are not subject to compulsory retirement in the same way as employees and it was therefore considered unnecessary to provide them with social insurance cover for that contingency when compulsory social insurance was introduced for them in 1988.</P>
        <P>The self-employed are covered for a range of social welfare benefits, including the old age contributory pension, which represents very good value for the level of contributions made. Any proposal to extend the benefits would necessarily involve an assessment of the additional costs that would arise and the level of social insurance contributions payable by the self-employed.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The processing of one-parent family claims has heretofore been carried out in the social welfare services office in Sligo. Following a review of the arrangements for administering the scheme, it was decided that services should in future be provided through my Department&rsquo;s local offices. The primary aim of providing services at local level is to improve customer service by reducing claim processing times through closer linkage with the local investigative officer network, and by providing more direct local contact for lone parents with the Department&rsquo;s employment support services.</P>
        <P>My Department currently processes new applications for one-parent family payment, OPFP, at 36 social welfare local offices. Plans are in place to move claims, already in payment, which are currently administered in Sligo, to social welfare local offices during 2006 and for this move to be finalised early in 2007.</P>
        <P>The time taken to process individual new claims varies significantly having regard to the necessity to establish the circumstances in each case. There is an onus on claimants to make a claim in the prescribed manner, furnish all necessary documentation, including birth and-or marriage certificates, details of earnings, etc. and co-operate with investigating officers during the processing of the claim.</P><Col N="1800"/>
        <P>Some 17,000 claims for one-parent family payment are received each year, equivalent to 330 per week on average. There are currently 3,608 one-parent family payment applications awaiting final decision. In addition to processing new claims, there is significant ongoing interaction with existing clients. Generally, recipients of one-parent family payment are in a relatively young age bracket and are likely to move in and out of employment, education or training on a regular basis or to have other changes in their family or household circumstances during the course of their entitlement to payment. Approximately 70,000 existing cases &mdash; an average of 1,300 per week &mdash; are reviewed for these reasons each year.</P>
        <P>Before my Department commenced the process of administering one-parent family payment applications at local level, the average processing time was 16 weeks. At present the average processing time for an application for the one-parent family payment is seven weeks. Every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible and minimise the time during which applicants have to rely on alternative forms of support. However, the time needed to decide on claims to one-parent family payment does not result in any loss of payment to the people concerned as entitlements are backdated to the date of initial claim receipt.</P>

	<P>The planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects, including the Dublin Port tunnel, is a matter for the National Roads Authority and the local authorities concerned. I understand from Dublin City Council that leaks are part and parcel of the issues that arise on large engineering projects such as the tunnel. If remedial measures are called for at any stage the contractor is required to implement them at its own expense. Contrary to the impression that may have been created, the tunnels are safe and stable. I have been informed by the NRA that the tunnel is expected to be open to traffic by summer 2006 following the testing and commissioning of the tunnel&rsquo;s operational and safety features.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The objective of aviation policy is to facilitate and encourage as wide a range as possible of reliable, regular and competitive commercial air services for Irish tourism, trade and industry. This Government has made a number of key strategic decisions on the future of aviation policy and a number of initiatives have been taken to achieve our principal policy objectives. Last May I brought a comprehensive package of measures before the Government with the aim of helping the State airports to realise their full potential in delivering international air access and positioning Aer Lingus for growth.</P>
        <P>The Government decision cleared the way for the planning and provision by the DAA of new terminal and pier capacity to cater for continued growth in passenger traffic at Dublin Airport. Subject to the safeguards of consultation, verifi<Col N="1804"/>cation and regulation, the DAA will provide a second passenger terminal in 2009 while a new pier for aircraft, Pier D, will be provided in 2007. An extension to the existing terminal building will also be completed in 2008. The restructuring of the State airports, as provided for under the State Airports Act 2004, will facilitate each of the three airports in maximising its own potential by bringing a fresh approach to addressing the challenges of meeting the changing needs of airlines in a growing but very competitive market. The role of the State airports is complemented by the six regional airports which contribute to balanced regional development.</P>
        <P>The Government also agreed that Aer Lingus had an immediate need for access to equity capital to enable it to compete effectively and to fund growth. It therefore agreed to the State disposing of a majority shareholding in Aer Lingus, while retaining a significant stake of at least 25% to protect key strategic interests, provided that myself and the Minister for Finance are satisfied that this level of disposal is warranted on foot of the analysis prepared by the Department&rsquo;s advisors for the investment transaction. The Government also authorised myself and the Minister for Finance to commence arrangements immediately to facilitate an investment transaction.</P>
        <P>The advisers appointed jointly by myself and the Minister for Finance have completed the first phase of their work, that is, recommending the most appropriate transaction mechanism and advising on the size and timing of a transaction. The Minister for Finance and myself are currently considering the report prepared by our advisers. Our Departments have also engaged with the company with a view to finalising the terms on which a transaction can be initiated as soon as possible. The Aer Lingus ESOT and trade unions will continue to be fully consulted on the proposed approach.</P>
        <P>A further significant development in 2005 was the negotiation of transitional arrangements for Shannon in the context of an EU-US open-skies agreement. The text of the EU-US agreement is finalised, and pending US clarification on new US rules on ownership and control issues, the agreement will come before the Transport Council in March or June 2006 for approval.</P>
        <P>The key features of the transitional arrangements for Shannon, reached after intensive negotiations with the US authorities, are as follows: there will be no change in the Shannon stop arrangements, that is, 1:1 ratio for Dublin and Shannon flights, for a further 12 months to November 2006; the transitional period commencing winter season 2006 and finishing beginning of the summer season in April 2008, which gives two and a half years of Shannon stop arrangements from now; during the transition period, the ratio of Dublin and Shannon flights will move from 1:1 to 3:1 so that for every one flight to and <Col N="1805"/>from Shannon, a carrier can provide three flights to and from Dublin. This ratio can be averaged out over the period of the transition; Irish airlines will have access to three additional destinations in the US from November 2006, over and above the four destinations currently being served; and there will be full open skies between Ireland and the US from April 2008 in the context of an EU-US agreement.</P>
        <P>When full open skies comes in after April 2008, Irish, EU and US airlines will have full unrestricted access from all airports in Ireland that can physically receive transatlantic flights to all points in the US. The aviation industry in Europe, particularly in Ireland, has benefited greatly from the liberalisation of the European aviation market in 1992 and it is expected that open skies will have a similar positive impact on Irish tourism and business. In consultation with the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Arts, Sport and Tourism, I am currently working on the development of a tourism and economic development plan for Shannon to ensure that the airport can maximise the benefits of open skies and sustain and grow transatlantic air services.</P>
        <P>A further development which will grow air traffic to and from Ireland is the negotiation of three new bilateral air transport agreements during 2005. My Department negotiated new agreements with Australia, Bahrain and Qatar in 2005, bringing to 23 the number of agreements which have been negotiated with non-EU-EEA states. This has already resulted in 2005 in a new service by Gulf Air between Dublin and Bahrain, and other services may follow. In addition, Aer Lingus plans to start a new service between Dublin and Dubai from the summer of 2006. Following my recent meetings with the Minister for Transport of Singapore and Thailand, the development of direct flights between Ireland and Singapore and Bangkok is being pursued by my Department and the Dublin Airport Authority.</P>

	<P>I am considering a departmental report on whether to reintroduce a statutory height restriction for vehicles. In the event that it is decided to reintroduce a statutory height restriction for vehicles it will be necessary to submit the draft regulations to the European Commission for consideration and for referral to other member states in accordance with the technical standards and regulations directive, Directive 98/34. The Dublin Port tunnel when completed will have an operational height of 4.65 metres. The issue of routing vehicles unable to use the tunnel through the city will be addressed in the context of the heavy goods vehicle management strategy currently being prepared by Dublin City Council.</P>

	<P>As I announced on 26 January, a major extension of the application of the penalty points system will be introduced in April. The extension will result in the system being applied in respect of 31 new offences, bringing the total to 36. The emphasis of this extension is on offences that relate to driver behaviour which is the greatest single contributory factor in road collisions. A list of the new offences and the level of penalty points to be applied either on conviction or an the payment of a fixed charge, where appropriate, is set out in the following table.</P><Col N="1805"/>

        <P>Irish Rail will shortly begin the construction of a new railway station in the Dublin docklands, which will facilitate a further increase in services on the Maynooth line. The company also proposes to expand its suburban rolling stock to meet the demands on all routes into Dublin. Transport 21 also provides for the electrification of the Maynooth line, which will result in the provision of DART-type services along the route.</P>

	<P>Transport 21 provides the funding for the implementation of the Kildare route project.

The project will allow separation of long distance and commuter services and improve speed and capacity for commuter, regional and intercity services.</P>
        <P>Having completed detailed planning and design, CIE applied for a railway order in October 2005 and I understand that the public inquiry commenced last week. Subject to the outcome of the railway order process, construction work on the project will begin towards the end of 2006 and is due for completion at the end of 2010.</P>

	<P>The conditions of eligibility, which need to be fulfilled in order to participate in the RSS are as follows: applicants must be in receipt of farm assist, or have been allocated a valid herd or flock number from the Department of Agriculture and Food, and be in receipt of one of the following allowances from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit if previously on CE or disability allowance; or applicants are self-employed fisherpersons on a fishing boat which has been entered in the register of fishing boats or have been issued with a fishing licence for fishing for salmon at sea, from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and are in receipt of one of the following allowances from the Department of Social and Family Affairs &mdash; unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit if previously on CE or disability allowance.</P>
        <P>The person in question, prior to commencement on this scheme, was signing for credited social insurance contributions, credits, with the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Credited contributions are notional social insurance contributions, which are awarded to an insured person without a PRSI payment being received from the insured person.</P>
        <P>My Department has established, following legal advice, that a person signing for credits has no underlying entitlement to participate on the scheme. The person concerned spent one year on the scheme but following the legal clarification was informed that he could not continue to participate for a further period on the basis of credited social insurance contributions. To be eligible for the future, a person must meet the criteria set out above.</P>

	<P>The first person named submitted an application under the single payment scheme on 12 May 2005 and also applied to have his entitlements consolidated under the scheme. The provisions governing the consolidation of entitlements provide that an applicant must declare a number of eligible hectares at least equalling 50% of the number of entitlements granted to him or her.</P>
        <P>The first person named declared a total forage area of 13.83 hectares on the 2005 single payment application. Included in the declared area was a parcel of land that was also claimed by another herd owner. Both applicants were contacted by my Department and as the first person named did not have entitlement to the parcel of land in question, a penalty was incurred. As a result of the application of this penalty, the 2005 single payment application was processed fully using the penalised forage area of 10.83 hectares.</P>
        <P>Having processed the application for consolidation of entitlements, the person first named was notified by my Department that his application was unsuccessful as the eligible hectares declared on his 2005 single payment application were less <Col N="1813"/>than 50% of his entitlements.

	<P>The Garda central vetting unit, GCVU, was established in 2002 and, in the education sector, currently processes vetting requests in respect of bus escorts, special needs assistants and staff for children in detention schools. In the time available, it has not been possible to compile information on the number of persons so vetted since 2002 in the education sector.</P>
        <P>Last year, an inter-agency working group on Garda vetting reported with a clear and focused strategy for enhancing national vetting arrangements from a child protection perspective. This strategy provides for an expansion of the GCVU&rsquo;s vetting service to all organisations which recruit persons having substantial, unsupervised access to children, including to the primary and post-primary education sectors.</P>
        <P>The implementation strategy is being overseen by an implementation group on Garda vetting comprising key stakeholders, including the Department of Education and Science. Preparations are at an advanced stage for the extension of vetting services and, to facilitate this, an additional 17 staff have been provided to the GCVU to more than double its numbers from 13 to 30.</P><Col N="1814"/>
        <P>The GCVU has recently been successfully decentralised to new, custom-designed office accommodation in Thurles, County Tipperary, from where it will soon commence expansion of its vetting service.</P>

        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the organisation responsible for providing policing and security services for the State. In this context, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established contacts, both multilateral and bilateral, with police and security services worldwide, touching on areas of mutual responsibility and interest. These contacts are in addition to any information exchanges which may be mandated by law, such as mutual assistance matters governed by the Criminal Justice Act 1994.</P>
        <P>I should also mention that section 28 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which will be brought into effect shortly, provides that, with the consent of the Government, the Garda Commissioner may, on behalf of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, enter into an agreement with a police service or other law enforcement agency outside the State covering the co-operation of the parties involved or the exchange of information or such other matters as the Garda Commissioner thinks fit. The Government is apprised of developments relating to the security of the State by the Garda Commissioner on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>I categorically reject any suggestion that the Government has or would turn a blind eye in any manner whatsoever to any alleged unlawful activity by any person or organisation.</P>

	<P>The murder of the person in question has been the subject of correspondence by and on behalf of the family of the deceased, to which I have given full consideration.</P>
        <P>In response to concerns expressed on the matter, the Garda Commissioner established a review team to conduct a thorough and concise investigation into all matters of concern, which involved the taking of more than 150 statements and the interview of more than 120 people.</P>
        <P>The Garda review was substantively completed in March 2005, at which time I received an interim report. Outstanding matters relate to a mutual assistance request and police-to-police inquiries made of the British and Northern Ireland authorities.</P>
        <P>Nothing has emerged in consequence of the Garda review which would justify the establishment of a public inquiry into the murder. However, I will continue to keep the matter under review in the context of the additional information being sought.</P>
        <P>I should add that the Garda investigation into the murder remains open, and I can assure the Deputy that any further lines of inquiry arising from new information from any quarter will be actively pursued by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

	<P>The person concerned, along with her child, arrived in the State on 7 September 2000 and applied for asylum. Her husband arrived in the State on 8 December 1999 and applied for asylum. Their application was refused following consideration of their case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The person referred to by the Deputy was informed by letter dated 19 February 2002, as was her husband, that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of them and afforded them three options under section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, namely, to make representations to the <Col N="1819"/>Minister setting out the reasons they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; to leave the State voluntarily; or to consent to the making of deportation orders.</P>
        <P>Their case was examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>, including consideration of representations for temporary leave to remain in the State lodged on her behalf by her legal representative. On 23 December 2002, deportation orders were signed in respect of the family. Notice of the deportation orders was served by registered post requiring the family to present itself to the Garda in Naas on Friday 31 January 2003 in order to make arrangements for their deportation from the State. The family presented as required and were given further presentation dates throughout 2003. On 11 February 2004, the family failed to present themselves as required and were classified as &ldquo;evaders.&rdquo; The father subsequently came to the notice of the Garda and was deported on 15 December 2004. He subsequently returned to the State on 16 July 2005 contrary to the provisions of his deportation order.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of late representations on behalf of the mother for revocation of the deportation order and for leave to remain in the State on medical grounds, the deportation orders were affirmed. The legal representative of the person concerned was notified of this by letter dated 27 April 2005.</P>
        <P>The mother gave birth to a child in the State on 3 February 2005. Thereafter she applied for leave to remain in the State under the provisions of the Irish-born child 2005 scheme. She was notified of the refusal of her application for residency in the State under the revised arrangements for the processing of such claims by letter dated 4 August 2005. Following consideration of yet further representations for temporary leave to remain in the State, the deportation orders were reaffirmed by me on 17 January 2006. This decision was made known to the legal representative by letter of the same date.</P>
        <P>In addition to the 11 factors contained in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, I must also have regard to section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>, before making a deportation order. The safety of returning a person, or <i>refoulement</i> as it is referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order. This means that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a state where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including UNHCR, in eval<Col N="1820"/>uating the safety of making returns to Moldova and other third countries.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that applications for asylum and leave to remain in the State of the family concerned, together with all <i>refoulement</i> issues, were comprehensively and fairly considered and, as such, their deportation should proceed. To this end, I urge the family concerned to come forward and present themselves to the GNIB as soon as possible. The enforcement of the deportation orders is now an operational matter for the GNIB.</P>

	<P>The Road Traffic Act 1961 defines a mechanically propelled vehicle as a vehicle intended or adapted for propulsion by mechanical means. Quadricycles and motorcycles, including micro-motorcycles, come within this definition.</P>
        <P>In order to use a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place, a range of requirements must be satisfied in relation to both the vehicle and the driver. Specifically, a mechanically propelled vehicle when in use in a public place must comply with the requirements of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002 and the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1996. The driver must also have third party insurance cover in accordance with section 56 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. In addition, a driving licence is required to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. The minimum age for holding a driving licence is 16 years for a moped and small motorcycle and 17 years for a quadricycle.</P>
        <P>The Road Traffic Act 1994, section 41, Regulations 1995 &mdash; SI 89 of 1995 &mdash; provides for the detention of vehicles by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for driving without a driving licence, insurance or motor tax.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have any legislative powers to retain a seized vehicle where the person concerned produces satisfactory evidence of ownership and has paid the charge concerned. All members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fully enforce the legislation regarding the seizure, storage cost, release and disposal of these vehicles when they are observed in use in a public place.</P>

	<P>The person to whom the Deputy is referring was sentenced to five years&rsquo; imprisonment, with the final year suspended, in the Dublin Circuit Court on 12 February 2004. The offence was possession of a controlled drug with a market value of &euro;13,000 or more, for the purpose of selling or otherwise unlawfully supplying it to another. The court also ordered that he gain credit for 114 days already served and his remission date was calculated as 20 October 2006.</P>
        <P>Following successful completion of the drug detoxification programme in Mountjoy Prison, this person was transferred to the training unit place of detention. In early January 2006, he was approved for an accompanied outing to visit his partner in hospital. This outing took place, without incident, on 7 January 2006. The prisoner was accompanied by one prison officer on this occasion. The prisoner subsequently made an application for compassionate temporary release on 11 January 2006 and the decision was made to grant him two separate short periods of day release for the same purpose. He was granted the first period of day release on 13 January 2006 and returned to custody as required. He was granted his second period of release on 20 January 2006 but he failed to return to custody at the appointed time and has been declared unlawfully at large. The Garda has been informed of his situation.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has not received a formal application for a transfer to this country in respect of this person from the United States authorities. An expression of interest for transfer to a prison in this country from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in my Department on 23 August 2004. In line with the convention, my Department wrote to the US Department of Justice on 24 August 2004 requesting that they commence processing this individual&rsquo;s application.</P>
        <P>The Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons requires extensive documentation to be <Col N="1822"/>exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered. A three-way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, that is, from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. In this regard, the US authorities informed my Department in May, 2005, that they were not inclined to act favourably on the transfer request at that time. As such, it was not possible for my Department to process this individual&rsquo;s application any further.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Since I commenced the publication of crime statistics on a quarterly basis at the beginning of 2003, I have consistently emphasised that care must be taken in interpreting the statistics, especially when considering short-term fluctuations and extrapolating trends over short periods. The level of headline crime in 2005 is lower than that for 2003 by 1.6% and is lower than that for 2002 by 4.4%. Furthermore in 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population, while in 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, while there have been significant reductions in 2005 in the incidence of manslaughter &mdash; down 50% &mdash; aggravated sexual assault &mdash; down 43% &mdash; robbery of cash and goods in transit &mdash; down 27% &mdash; robbery from the person &mdash; down 23% &mdash; and theft from the person &mdash; down 18% &mdash; the overall increase and the increases in particular categories are disappointing.</P>
        <P>I welcome the significant decrease of 27% in the number of incidents of robbery of cash and goods in transit &mdash; down from 62 in 2004 to 45 in 2005 &mdash; and that this trend improved in the fourth quarter with a decrease of 47%. Operation Delivery, an initiative undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to counteract the increase in cash in transit robberies which emerged in 2004, has contributed significantly to this welcome decrease. Furthermore, the new code of practice now being operated by the major institutions and companies involved in the cash in transit industry, which has raised the standards in operation and which I pushed for, has made a significant contribution to this decrease. These developments have been underpinned by the establishment of the Private Security Authority.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the increase in the number of detections for possession of drugs for sale or supply &mdash; up 20% &mdash; and possession of firearms &mdash; up 16% &mdash; which are offences which in the main become known as a result of police detection work. This trend continued in the fourth quarter and, in the case of possession of firearms, improved, with an increase of 24%.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil, which the Commissioner introduced last May and for which I obtained substantial additional resources made a significant contribution to this level of detection. Operation Anvil will continue as long as it is deemed necessary in operational and policing terms. At my <Col N="1824"/>request, the Commissioner has extended Operation Anvil to Garda divisions outside Dublin.</P>
        <P>Our legislative package for tackling crime especially serious and organised crime is already widely viewed as being one of the toughest in Europe. However, there are legislative proposals to enhance our legal framework in this area. The Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas, provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of garda&iacute; in the investigation and prosecution of offences. It contains an essential updating of our law to ensure that criminal offences can be investigated and prosecuted in a way which is efficient and fair and which meets the needs of modern society.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year has the highest level of resources in its history at &euro;1,290 million, which is an increase of &euro;146 million or 13% on 2005. The provision for Garda overtime in 2006 is &euro;83.5 million, an increase of &euro;23 million on the allocation for 2005. This increase will greatly assist the planned deployment of a visible policing service in a flexible, effective and targeted response to criminal activity and to crime prevention. The &euro;83.5 million in overtime will yield 2.725 million extra hours of policing by uniformed and by special units throughout the State.</P>
        <P>I take great satisfaction in the Government&rsquo;s decision of October 2004 to approve the recruitment of 2,000 additional garda&iacute; to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. As a result there will be a combined organisational strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training of 14,000 in 2006. One thing I have already promised is that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing plan for 2006, recently published by the Commissioner, includes a targeted reduction in the incidence of crime by 2% and an increase in detection rates by 2%. It also reflects the Government&rsquo;s priorities in the fight against crime and the actions which it wishes to be taken, for which significant additional resources have been provided.</P>
        <P>While it is the case that a number of the increases in headline crime statistics reflect increased enforcement activity on the part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the overall picture indicates that there is no room for complacency and validates the Government&rsquo;s decision to continue to devote unprecedented resources to the fight against crime. I can assure the Deputy that I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner in order to keep the measures and resources for tackling crime under continuing review.</P>

	<P>Section 23 of the Education Act 1998 clearly defines the role of the principal in providing guidance, direction and leadership to teachers. This requirement embraces the pedagogical and classroom management role of a teacher. Instructional leadership is a core responsibility of all principals and the Education Act also expects a principal to promote the professional development of his or her teachers.</P>
        <P>In circumstances where a parent has concerns about a teacher, the parent should raise the matter directly with the school authorities in the first instance. Currently, most schools use complaints procedures that have been arrived at through national agreements negotiated between management authorities and teacher unions. Under the CPSMA-INTO and the ASTI-JMB procedures that are in common usage in primary schools and voluntary secondary schools respec<Col N="1828"/>tively, the board of management may invite the complainant to address a meeting of the board. In general, similar procedures are followed by post-primary schools in the VEC and community and comprehensive sectors. If, following the completion of the complaints procedure and the issuing of a finding by the board of management of the school, the complainant remains dissatisfied, he or she may appeal the matter to my Department.</P>

	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P>Under section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, schools are required to have in place a code of behaviour detailing the circumstances under which the penalties of suspension and expulsion may be incurred. The Act requires that each board of management formulates a code of behaviour in consultation with teachers, parents and the NEWB.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s guidelines assist boards of management in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. They were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. Each board of management is responsible for formulating a fair and efficient code of behaviour while ensuring that the individuality of each child is accommodated and acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption-free environment. The code should also include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
        <P>In January 2005, the NEWB issued guidelines to the management authorities of all primary and post primary schools on reporting student absences and expulsions. These guidelines advise that the board of management must report its decision to expel a student to the NEWB. Under section 24(4) of the Act, the decision to expel a student cannot take effect until 20 school days have elapsed following the receipt of the notification by the educational welfare officer, thus fac<Col N="1829"/>ilitating an opportunity for appropriate intervention. However, this requirement is without prejudice to the right of the board of management of a school to take such other reasonable measures as it considers appropriate to ensure that good order and discipline are maintained in the school and that the safety of students is secured. The guidelines also outline the necessity to report where a student has been suspended for six days or more cumulatively.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal to the Secretary General of my Department where a board of management or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses to enrol a student, suspends a student for a cumulative total of more than 20 days in an academic year or expels a student from the school. Provision also exists under section 29 for the NEWB to make a submission at the hearing of an appeal brought by a parent or student against expulsion. The NEWB may, itself, take an appeal under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998. However, the NEWB does not exercise a decision-making function in respect of determining an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act 1998.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State&rsquo;s obligations as a member of the European Union. The service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer <Col N="1830"/>limits of the exclusive fishery limit, which covers 132,000 square miles.</P>
        <P>Where a fishing vessel is encountered which is suspected of being in contravention of fisheries regulations or legislation, particularly with regard to the fishing gear in use, then the master of such vessel is instructed to haul its gear for inspection prior to being escorted to the nearest convenient port by the inspecting naval vessel. In port, custody of the fishing vessel and its gear is handed over to the appropriate civil authorities for action.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communication, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in the first instance, to make provisions for the recovery of deep sea gill nets. He has informed me that the recovery of banned gill nets can be undertaken by hiring commercial boats, as was done by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Irish Sea Fisheries Board, and also by the UK authorities in 2005. Taking into account the heavy control and enforcement demands on the Naval Service to police Ireland&rsquo;s exclusive fishery limit, it would not the best use of Naval Service resources to undertake this work when it can be undertaken effectively by other means. In addition, it should be noted that Naval Service vessels are not equipped to carry out this task.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 322 and 327 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. My Department understands that the annual standing charge introduced by both Dungarvan Town Council and Waterford County Council of &euro;130 and &euro;150 per annum is seen as necessary to cover the fixed costs, for example, staff costs, truck, maintenance, insurance, transport to nearest landfill etc. associated with providing the collection service to each customer. These fixed costs of providing a regular household service are incurred by the collector whether or not a bin is presented for emptying. In order to assist lower income households, the councils have arranged for payment of the standing charge by way of instalments.</P>
        <P>My Department has been advised that the county council operates a comprehensive waiver scheme in respect of waste charges. Those eligible to apply for a waiver are old age pensioners and other social welfare recipients. A similar arrangement is operated by Dungarvan Town Council in respect of certain persons in receipt of old age pensions.</P>

My Department issued Circular PD 1/06 on 25 January 2006 reminding local authorities of their obligations under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 on the taking in charge of estates. Each local authority has been directed to establish a policy on the taking in charge of housing estates which will be agreed by the members of the authority, and reported on to those members on a regular basis and at least once annually. The circular directs that the local policy must include provision for when an estate is not completed within the appropriate period. In that case, enforcement action against the developer must be pursued vigorously and promptly to ensure that the developer completes the estate. All available legal remedies should be used to enable that to be done, including, where appropriate, the application of the security bond.</P>
