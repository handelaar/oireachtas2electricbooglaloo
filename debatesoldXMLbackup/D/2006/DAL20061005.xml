      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent, public and national concern, namely, the proposed redundancies at Lakeland Dairies at the end of this year as part of a restructuring plan which will impact most severely on County Monaghan and, particularly, on the small community of Lough Egish, County Monaghan, where all 60 jobs in the agri-stores and milk drying operations are to go; the devastating effect this body blow will have on the local economy; the additional four jobs in Carrickmacross that are also affected by the Lakelands layoff; and I call on the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, together with Enterprise Ireland to liaise with staff representatives to salvage the maximum number of these jobs for the Lough Egish and Carrickmacross communities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of national importance and concern, namely, the proposed 34% increase in gas prices as world oil prices are falling rapidly; and the need for the energy regulator to review his decision to allow these indefensible increases and to support householders, working people, the elderly and disabled on this important matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a specific matter requiring urgent attention, namely, the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to reverse his instructions to local authorities, regarding the review and the compilation of the register of electors, which are a threat to democracy and will wrongly delete thousands of electors from the <Col N="1946"/>register of electors; and I ask the Minister to fulfil his promise to launch a high profile national and local campaign to highlight the review of the register and make a statement on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise the following matter of urgent, national and local importance, namely, the need, without delay, to implement the recommendations contained in the report published yesterday by the National Consumer Agency on the issue of management companies, some of which will require new legislation.  Many of the recommendations were arrived at following the examination of the lack of consumer protection.  The report describes the system as legislatively passive.  The solutions, many of which are highlighted in the report, must be heeded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the announcement this morning that Ryanair has purchased 16% of Aer Lingus and intends to try to buy a majority of the airline; the implications for workers&rsquo; wages and conditions, passenger welfare, trade union rights and the environment; and the need for the Minister for Transport to make a statement and take questions in the D&aacute;il  today on this shocking effect of privatisation of the national airline.</P>

	<P>Competition how are you.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Really shameful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention today, namely, the serious consequences for the travelling public of the announcement by Ryanair that it has acquired a 16% shareholding in Aer Lingus and that it intends to seek a majority shareholding; and the need for the Government to outline the steps it plans to take to protect Aer Lingus from this predatory takeover.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise an issue of urgent public importance, namely, to allow time for the Taoiseach to clarify if the person from whom he bought his residential home was at the dinner in Manchester where he received a gift of Stg&pound;8,000 and, if so, to explain why he has not named that person as having been present at the dinner; and to state if the house was bought at market value and if all relevant taxes were paid.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1947"/>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise an issue of urgent national importance, namely, the impact of today&rsquo;s European Central Bank interest rate decision and its possible effect on the Irish economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise an issue of urgent public importance, namely, the proposed takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair and the implications of such a move for competition in the Irish airline industry; and the strategic implications of the possible loss of a major air carrier into Ireland for the Irish economy and society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 31.  I call the Taoiseach to take the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I think the Ceann Comhairle should rephrase the statement &ldquo;they are not in order&rdquo;.  The matters particularly on the crisis&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy has a problem, he may wish to contact the office of the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has just decided he will not allow the matter to be debated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy, it is not appropriate to raise it in this way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but if the D&aacute;il had any relevance we would debate in an emergency fashion the hijacking of the national airline by O&rsquo;Leary and Co. and Ryanair. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has been called.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 2, Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 &mdash; Second Stage, resumed; and No. 3, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2006 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I was just looking at the Standing Orders of the House which state that on Thursdays somebody else will be substituted to perform the Taoiseach&rsquo;s duties.  I am glad the Taoiseach is present and, obviously, it is for a <Col N="1948"/>reason.  I do not know where the junior partner has gone.  I suppose he is upstairs getting ready.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is the Deputy&rsquo;s colleague?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know the details of what is going on.  I know the Taoiseach is present to answer a question on a matter which he may clear up for everybody.  Obviously he mentioned names of persons who were present at a function in Manchester.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Just before Deputy Kenny proceeds, as he referred to Standing Orders, the Chair will allow a brief comment from him, Deputy McManus, Deputy Sargent, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Deputy Joe Higgins and a response from the Taoiseach.  We will then resume business under Standing Orders.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise two other issues on the Order of Business afterwards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I can only deal with this issue now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach indicate whether there is a connection between the Mr. Wall mentioned and the purchase of a house?  Was there a specific reason the Taoiseach did not put this name in the public domain when he replied to questions earlier this week?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy McManus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important for the Taoiseach to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Sargent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not satisfactory&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has ruled in accordance with precedent in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no difficulty in allowing the Taoiseach to answer ten questions and then allowing others to proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has made it quite clear how he intends to proceed in accordance with precedent.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair knows that is not satisfactory.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>My predecessors have proceeded in the same way when they deviate from Standing Orders.  If the Deputy wishes to ask a question or make a statement, that is fine.  If not, I will move on to Deputy Sargent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>What this Deputy wishes for, on behalf of the Labour Party, is full accountability.  We were promised full accountability by the <Col N="1949"/>Taoiseach and were promised final accountability by the Progressive Democrats.  We have received neither.  Instead, we have the truth dripping day by day because the media is giving it to us.  That is what is happening.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach had plenty of time to tell us who the people were who attended the dinner in Manchester and gave him thousands of pounds.  If his memory was faulty in a particular case, he had plenty of time to check out the details, but all he could do was come up with two names out of 25.  It is beyond belief that he was incapable of remembering the name of Miche&aacute;l Wall.  Why did he not give this House the name of Miche&aacute;l Wall, who is presumably the person who sold the Taoiseach his home?  Any member of the public can remember who sold him or her his or her home.  However, we somehow have an individual here who does not have that capacity of memory.  That does not stack up.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach must tell us now who was at that dinner and whether he has any record of any other business transactions with any of those individuals.  That is what full accountability requires.  Why is it the Taoiseach continues to humiliate the T&aacute;naiste and make a ship of fools of his junior Government partners in the Progressive Democrats Party?  What is the purpose behind his failure to come in here and give a full account of himself in the public interest?  When did the Progressive Democrats know about this latest revelation?</P>
        <P>We have sat here and asked questions, but have not received the answers the public requires of the Taoiseach.  It is important that the truth will out in this arena, otherwise questions will continue to be raised.  We are the last people who want to keep raising them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The media are doing a better job of it, that is the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>We want to talk about the health service and crime levels, but until the Taoiseach comes out in a forthright manner and is honest and complete in his answers, these issues will continue to arise.  Truth will win out in the end, no matter how long it takes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked questions under Standing Order 31 and I hope the Taoiseach will avail of the opportunity now to clear up the issues I raised.  We have tribunals, but it is important to remember they had to be set up in many cases because questions were not answered in the D&aacute;il.  Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past.</P>
        <P>There has been a holding back of information on matters dating back as far as 1999 when I asked the Taoiseach if such payments and transactions were unorthodox, unusual or irregular.  The fact he does not think they are raises the image of a GUBU situation, something we have come across before.  We need to move beyond that and begin to see life as clearly as it should <Col N="1950"/>be seen, especially for a Taoiseach and somebody in high office.</P>
        <P>The questions asked on Tuesday and Wednesday have not been fully answered.  Will the Taoiseach tell us, as I asked under Standing Order 31, whether the house was bought at market value and all taxes due paid?  If it was bought at anything less than market value, that would be tantamount to a donation.  Can we have clarity on that issue?</P>
        <P>Is there anything else the Taoiseach thinks we should know or anything else he wants to put into the public domain?  The situation is becoming tiresome.  We need to deal with other issues such as housing, health, education, child care and energy etc. and the sooner we can get back to dealing with the business we were elected to do, the better.  However, we need first to have standards in Government over which we can all stand and of which we can be proud.  That is not the case as we speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McManus asked when the Progressive Democrats learned of the latest revelation.  I would like to return to a question I posed on Wednesday as to when the Progressive Democrats learned of all that has been coming down the track with regard to what the Taoiseach has had to face over the past couple of weeks.  The Taoiseach responded almost with incredulity.</P>
        <P>I put that question to the Taoiseach again; is he any wiser today than he was 48 hours ago?  When did the former T&aacute;naiste learn of all the revelations that have come before public scrutiny in recent weeks with regard to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s affairs a number of years ago?  Is the Taoiseach any more informed as to when that occurred?  I believe, as many others do who have commented to me on it, that when the former T&aacute;naiste sat with the Taoiseach she was aware of all of this and that was the genesis of her decision to vacate office when she did &mdash; a very unexplained decision.</P>
        <P>I believe Geraldine Kennedy, the former Progressive Democrats Deputy and editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>, advised the former T&aacute;naiste of what was coming down the tracks in this regard and that was what influenced her decision.  Did the former T&aacute;naiste inform or alert the Taoiseach to the information that had been brought to her attention?  Can the Taoiseach throw any light on that relationship?  If he knows anything at all, surely this is the place where the information should be brought to public light.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These are serious matters.  When did the former T&aacute;naiste and current Minister for Health and Children, who was the sole member of Cabinet who did not respond enthusiastically to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement a few days ago, know of all of this?  Did she bring it to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attention?  If not, what is his reaction to the fact that a trusted member of his Cabinet, his then deputy and T&aacute;naiste, had information of this nat<Col N="1951"/>ure and did not bring it to his attention?  While everyone else is focusing on other details, these are matters we must consider.  It is important we get to the genesis of this situation, irrespective of the decision of Geraldine Kennedy to destroy whatever information source she had and remove it from public scrutiny.  The House should endeavour to learn and establish the full facts as to how all of this has come before the public gaze and why we are now spending day after day looking back on issues relating to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s previous conduct, by and large avoiding all the real and substantive issues why the Taoiseach and his colleagues in Government should now fold and go to the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Independent Deputies beside me have made the point that they would much prefer this time to be given over to the Taoiseach explaining the attempted hijacking of Aer Lingus by Ryanair, the increases in gas and ESB prices and other crucial issues affecting working class people and working people in general as a result of the policies of his Government.  It is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s fault that we must demand these explanations and accountability because of his failure to be frank with the D&aacute;il and the people when he made his statement here on Tuesday.</P>
        <P>Did the Taoiseach purchase a home from a person who attended one or some of the functions at which he spoke in Manchester?  Did this person contribute to the personal donation of about &pound;8,000 sterling which the Taoiseach received in Manchester?  Why did the Taoiseach not name that person and identify this particular relationship when he spoke to the D&aacute;il on Tuesday?  It is clear that if he was attempting to be candid, he would have named that person and referred to that episode if it happened.  Can the Taoiseach tell the people that he purchased this home at its full market value, that no reduction was made in the price to benefit him and that it was purchased by a bank loan?  Was there a substantial deposit in the form of a lump sum paid as well and how was that done?  Will the Taoiseach detail the amounts and the circumstances?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I offer my apologies to the House that I am back for the fourth day out of five to answer these issues.  I can only answer them to the best of my ability.</P>
        <P>I will answer all the questions without taking too long.  I believe I have answered every question I have been asked in a full and frank manner over the past number of days.  I believe I have answered them in a very complete way but I will do so again.</P>
        <P>I did not introduce any issues relevant to my house into any of the debates or into the interviews I did last week or into the debate in the House because I did not believe I was under any investigation regarding my house.  The Mahon tri<Col N="1952"/>bunal asked me for details about my house because, when I provided disclosure of all the information, the details about my house would have been clear.  I gave all that information to the Mahon tribunal.</P>
        <P>The tribunal has all the details of my house file and the file of the person who sold me the house.  The person from whom I initially rented the house, 44 Beresford Avenue off Griffith Avenue in Drumcondra, was Michael Wall of Cong and Manchester.  I paid full market rent.  I rented the house for about two years.  The rent was reviewed on a second lease and it went up.  It was a very good market rent.  I subsequently bought the house in the autumn of 1997, after I became Taoiseach.  Mr. Wall would have had a gain of about 30% in the two and a half years.  I paid the full market value for the house and I funded it by means of an Irish Permanent Building Society loan.  I paid the stamp duty and all the relevant taxes from my current account.  In answer to Deputy Higgins, the deposit was not a large sum and I paid it from my building society deposit book.  I have given all these details to the tribunal.  Michael Wall also has given all the details he was asked to provide to the tribunal.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Manchester event, I tried last week to locate the people in Manchester who attended that function.  However, I was at several functions.  As I stated the other day, many people have told me they were probably at that function but I was not able to pin down exactly who was there.  As I stated to the House, I probably know all the people who attended that function in Manchester but without talking to all of them, I cannot pin down exactly who attended it.  As I attended various functions in Manchester over the years, I cannot state with certainty who were the other persons in attendance.  I do not wish to mistakenly name someone and then be accused of misleading the House.</P>
        <P>I know Michael Wall well and of course I remember from whom I bought my house.  I spoke to him three times last weekend, twice on Saturday and once on Sunday.  I asked him whether he could help me by stating whether he had attended the function and whether he could help me identify any of the others because I wanted to give as many names as possible to the House.  He told me that he was not one of the 25.  He did not attend the dinner that day but he was in the hotel in a working capacity, using his coach minibus.  He confirmed he met me in the bar and that he spoke to people in the bar afterwards.</P>
        <P>Subsequently while travelling, he received a call from somebody from Clonbur whom he knew and who is a journalist with Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.  He did not give an interview to somebody in Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.  He was on his way to the UK when he was asked and he gave that short interview.</P>
        <P>To ensure completeness for the House, I spoke to the T&aacute;naiste on Tuesday morning and this was prior to R&oacute;n&aacute;n giving the interview to Pat Kenny. <Col N="1953"/> Therefore, it is obvious I did not know anything about that interview at the time so I did not raise that issue with the T&aacute;naiste either then or subsequently.  The T&aacute;naiste had no knowledge of this.  I did not put Mr. Wall&rsquo;s name into the public domain because he told me he was not one of the 25 people, that he did not contribute and that he did not attend the meal, but he confirmed that he was in the hotel in a working capacity.  He gave this information on the programme.</P>
        <P>However, he also stated on the radio that he was aware that I had received money because he was there and he was well acquainted with the people who were there.  He gave me some other names of people whom I tried to contact but, at this remove, it is impossible to pin down who attended the function and I am unable to do it.  I did not mention his name because he and others had told me he was not one of the 25 people.</P>
        <P>On the question of what the Progressive Democrats did or did not know, I have stated that they did not know about Michael Wall because I never told them the name of the person from whom I bought my house.  However, I told the tribunal and I made a full disclosure to it.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked whether I was dealing with the tribunal on these issues and the answer is that I was.  He asked whether I informed the Progressive Democrats I had received loans from friends and the answer is &ldquo;yes, I did&rdquo;.  He asked whether I informed them about Michael Wall and the answer is &ldquo;no, I did not&rdquo;.  This is the truthful position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Taoiseach ask the former T&aacute;naiste what she knew?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Taoiseach to speak without interruption.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope this answers the questions.  </P>
        <P>Yesterday, I was informed that I had referred to a dormant account.  I was trying to be complete in the information and a journalist who was doing his job for Independent Newspapers said they had information that the dormant account contained &euro;30,000.  I will explain to the House for completeness.  In the 1970s, I wanted to cash a cheque but the Bank of Ireland in Clonliffe Road would not cash it as I did not have an account.  I therefore opened an account which I never closed and I believe it contains &euro;20 or &pound;20.  This is the dormant account.</P>
        <P>I received a call yesterday evening from another journalist to say that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party sold a house in Amiens Street in the 1980s.  He asked me whether I had the money from the sale of that house in my dormant account.  The house was sold by the trustees and officers of the party and I probably was a trustee.  The money is in the accounts.  I have been asked a series of other questions and all I can do is answer them.  I am not accusing the Opposition in that regard.</P><Col N="1954"/>
        <P>It is clear that the file and all the information I gave to the tribunal is in the hands of at least one newspaper.  They obtained all the information.  They would have been aware of the issue about the house.  As late as yesterday, a person who was a witness on one of the forms used by Michael Wall to do with the purchase of the house was contacted.  The only place that would have appeared was on the disclosure that Michael Wall would have given.</P>

        <P>What I am up against is that on the one side I am told not to give all the information that I dealt with in the tribunal and on the other side all the information I gave to the tribunal is in the public domain in the hands of some people.  That is the difficulty and it is a dilemma.  I can only answer the questions.  If I came in here last week raising the issue about how I got my house, every bit of paper might have been sought.  If the Committee of Public Accounts or the Comptroller and Auditor General wanted to examine my house, to be frank, I would be far happier if that was where it was being examined than where it is being examined, but that is another day&rsquo;s work.</P>
        <P>I have no problem showing my file on the house to Deputy Kenny or anybody else if he wants to see it.  I know he is only asking his questions, but that is the problem for me.  I cannot close this down because people will continue to ask the next question.  People will continue to put pressure on my colleagues in government, the Progressive Democrats, totally unfairly.  I rented the house.  I subsequently bought the house.  I paid full rent on it.  I have given to the tribunal the procedures that I followed in the work that was done on the house, the invoices to do with the house.  I will wake up one of these mornings to see them in the newspapers too, I have no doubt, because it seems as if everything I gave in is out.  That is how I feel about it.  I can do nothing about it and I can do nothing about the other issues.</P>
        <P>The only question I cannot answer to the House is that I cannot name the 25 people.  I just cannot do that.  I do not know precisely who they are and I cannot put them forward.  All I can&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I have answered the question about the position regarding the former T&aacute;naiste.  The former T&aacute;naiste knew that I was answering letters from the tribunal.  She would not have seen those letters.  She would only have been aware of broad facts about them.  I believe she was aware that I got loans from friends.  She was not aware of where I bought my house from.  She was not aware of other issues, so there is no fault on the <Col N="1955"/>former T&aacute;naiste or the present T&aacute;naiste.  I did not tell the present T&aacute;naiste about Michael Wall &mdash; he did not want to know that either &mdash; from whom I bought my house.</P>

	<P>Yes, but he was not a donor.  He was not a contributor.  That is the fact.  Deputy Joe Higgins asked me another fair question, whether there was anybody at that function whom I might have done a business deal with or whom I got money from in another way.  The answer is no, and the reason I know that is there was nobody else whom I got money from.  It is not a question of not being able to identify: there was nobody else.  That is the information.  If the House wanted to see my files or files I have given to the tribunal, I would be as happy giving them to the House as anywhere else.  I hope that answers the questions.  It will not stop issues being raised.  I have no doubt this evening other people will feed a few more things out.  That is the problem and I do not have a resolution for it.</P>

	<P>Let the man answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  I have tried through several phone calls &mdash; not a few phone calls &mdash; to people I know in Manchester over the past week to ask whether they were definitely at the function.  People told me they were at this function, that function and the other function.  People told me: &ldquo;I remember a function where we raised a lot of money.&rdquo;  I asked what function that was and was told it was a charity function.  People just cannot pin themselves down as to whether they were there that night.  I would have met that group of people, probably, on 15 or 20 occasions that I can recall so I just cannot pin down exactly who was there.  When John Kennedy came forward last week, I did not remember that John Kennedy was at that function a long time back.  At one stage when I looked for names for the tribunal, John Kennedy came forward and gave a letter to the tribunal.  I would not have been able to pin down those names.  I think I have a good idea of another seven or eight, but I would need to try to find them individually.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what we are asking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I said in the House the other day that when I can get these names, I will gladly give the names to the tribunal.  I said I will give all the names to the tribunal if I can get the names, but I cannot piece it together.  I can piece together individuals in Manchester whom I met at various times, but as to who was at one function as opposed to another, I just cannot do that.  That is the answer.  It is not so easy.</P>

        <P>I ask the Taoiseach about his responsibility regarding the Moriarty tribunal.  I will not go into detail on it now, but the Taoiseach has answered questions from me on this matter in the House on a number of occasions, and he has answered them as fairly as he can.  Obviously that tribunal has not yet issued a report as confirmed by the Taoiseach in his answers here.  Perhaps he will speak to the T&aacute;naiste, who now appears to have acquired the gift of prophecy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will say a few words about the Aer Lingus IPO and the Ryanair bid.  The Aer Lingus IPO was priced at &euro;2.20 per share and conditional dealings commenced on 27 September.  Admission to the stock exchange and unconditional dealing commenced on 2 October and without any notice other than some phone calls this morning, Ryanair announced a take-over bid.  The bid price is &euro;2.80 per share.  The offer by Ryanair was announced a couple of hours ago and we were only informed at that time.  It clearly raises fundamental questions with regard to aviation policy and regulation issues, as Deputy Kenny noted, and these questions will have to be carefully examined.  The Government remains fully committed to competition in aviation markets and will not be selling its shares in Aer Lingus.</P>

	<P>Allow the Taoiseach to continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s strategic interest in aviation is best served by the maximum number of regular, safe and cost effective air services link<Col N="1959"/>ing the country to key business and tourism markets, and that remains the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>From the outset of the Aer Lingus IPO, the Government has been committed to ensuring that our strategic interests are protected.  It was always the intention to retain a significant minority shareholding for this purpose and the State&rsquo;s shareholding is 28.3% of the company.  As a result of the IPO, Aer Lingus has the means at its disposal to fulfil its potential and to contribute positively to the country&rsquo;s economic development.</P>
        <P>The approach from Ryanair was unexpected.  It is, in the first instance, a matter for the board of directors of the company to evaluate the Ryanair offer and to express an opinion to shareholders.  It is also the case that any proposal of this kind would require regulatory clearance and it remains to be clarified whether this is a matter for the Irish regulatory authorities or the European Commission.  That matter is being closely examined today.  The Minister for Transport is consulting his advisers.  He will evaluate all the strategic and policy issues arising and will set out the position more fully at an appropriate time.</P>

It will be difficult for the public to believe that this Bill, one of whose provisions gives the Government the power to shut down tribunals, should be fast-tracked from obscurity to become the priority Bill for next week.  Will it not be seen as an attempt to intimidate the tribunals?  Would it not be sensible for the orderly and proper business of the House to put it back so it would not be dealt with in an atmosphere where a succession of Ministers have been upset with tribunals?</P>

        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation is welcome and it regulates the operation of the legal profession in terms of the application of charges and the handling of complaints.  It is a departure from the existing self-regulation which is good.  The establishment of a legal services ombudsman is a positive development and it could be seen as a useful precedent in regard to other areas of dispute.</P>
        <P>I refer to legal aid which was originally provided on a voluntary basis but developed from there.  It is now a much sought after service.  Free legal aid does not apply to any great extent anymore.  As my learned colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, knows, only the hardened criminals can be absolutely guaranteed to get free legal aid.  I have raised this issue in parliamentary questions and I know there are compelling reasons that is the case.  Under the law <Col N="1968"/>a person accused of a serious crime is entitled to representation, with which I have no difficulty.</P>
        <P>However, what I find difficult to deal with is that there are countless instances where people may not be able to afford to take a legitimate legal case which has good grounds.  It would appear their constitutional rights are not being fully observed in the absence of their ability to take such a case.  Since they are not criminals, they do not get that automatic access to free legal aid.</P>
        <P>From time to time, I have tabled parliamentary questions to try to determine the full extent of the cost of free legal aid for the real criminals about whom we all know.  It would be beneficial to legislators to measure the extent to which costs are escalating in that area, particularly in view of the fact many of these well organised, hardened, committed and professional criminals have such ready access to the system at which they seem to laugh and scoff.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with civil legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know.  I am crossing over the boundaries and I am measuring civil legislation against criminal legislation.  In view of the fact a learned member of the legal profession is sitting opposite, namely, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, I could not but avail of the opportunity to bring it to his attention.  I am sure he does not know about these matters but I thought I would remind him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am well aware of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The time has come when we should look at system where civil litigants have at least as good access to legal aid as criminals.  It is a poor reflection on our society that we seem to believe it is imperative to give absolute protection to those who readily admit to being professional, outgoing criminals.  The reason I say that is that if a citizen can prove the bones of a case exists, they should have as much right to free legal aid as those in the criminal law courts.  Otherwise, it appears that we have two laws or standards, one that applies to protect criminals and the other that is slightly above and beyond the reach of the ordinary citizen.  I hope the Minister, if not immediately then sometime in the course of examining what needs to be done, will examine this.  It is something ordinary citizens talk to me about.  They ask why they are not entitled to free legal aid while criminals are.</P>
        <P>I raise this issue because what I refer to as ordinary, professional criminals nowadays are a fairly hardened, scary bunch.  They intimidate, terrorise, offer protection and do all the nasty things we abhor.  If the system is good enough to give them the kind of support to which they feel they are entitled then ordinary litigants in the civil area should have at least some similar recourse.  The <Col N="1969"/>Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, may reply and tell me I am wrong but I merely relate to him what I have found through dealing with people who come to my clinics at weekends.</P>
        <P>The other matter to which I wish to refer is legal separation, family law and the courts.  We were all in this House when the various items of legislation were passed.  I will always remember listening to how it was intended to simplify these matters.  Relationships do break down and legal separations do take place.  That cannot be changed.  However, we can simplify or at least reduce as much as possible the procedures under the law to which people must resort.  From what I see, legal separation has become very expensive.  This issue may fall to be dealt with in the course of the legislation because the ombudsman may deal with it.</P>
        <P>Some of the legal costs I have seen are frightening.  In addition to the problem of legal costs, we must also examine the causes of the significant delays that are commonplace in such circumstances that affect whatever plans the parties have to achieve a new life.  The current system is not living up to expectations and is incredibly expensive.  It is almost unworkable, to the extent that if each side digs in, in respect of fighting down to the last line, it gets very difficult.  This makes a sad situation worse.  I am sure the Minister of State has had similar experiences.</P>
        <P>I advise ordinary working people who do not have access to major resources to come to some agreement, go to court and have it notarised and walk away.  If it drags along and polarisation and entrenchment set in, everything goes by the wayside and the situation becomes very difficult.  I hope the Minister of State will make some reference to that in his reply, and that perhaps in the context of the legislation it might be possible to streamline matters in this regard.</P>
        <P>Occasionally constituents ask me to go to court to see how they are being treated.  I do not think the legal profession likes that.  One would be amazed at how the system operates in terms of the frequency of adjournments, the nature of offences and the total costs to the Exchequer of processing what in many cases are minor offences involving all the paraphernalia of legal representation for both sides.  In the UK there is a system of magistrates dealing with minor offences.  I know the legal profession is not too keen on this either.  I believe similar systems obtain in France and other countries where a senior member of the legal profession operates in a magistrate&rsquo;s court or similar and the costs are considerably reduced as it does not involve all the paraphernalia of the system trailing after it with all the entailing expenses.  I wonder if the time has come to look at changing that aspect of the legal process to accommodate minor offences.</P>
        <P>For instance, if somebody has not paid his or her television licence he or she is brought before the court.  I have no difficulty in accepting there must be a penalty for it but I wonder if it is really <Col N="1970"/>necessary for such cases to go before the court.  Is there not a lesser forum than the District Court where the matter can be resolved?  This would make matters far less expensive.  This area requires some consideration with a view to freeing up the system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have tabled a number of questions in recent times on the number of cases going through the courts, the speed with which they are processed and the reasons for delays.  I do not always get replies because very often Ministers, even T&aacute;naist&iacute;, get sensitive about questions of that nature.  There is nothing personal involved.  It is just a matter of getting the information and trying to identify where the snarl-ups arise.  With the best of efforts such as an increase in the number of judges and so on, currently the process still operates very slowly and courts are full.  We get complaints from time to time regarding the sitting times in various courts etc.  It should be possible to identify the most common causes of the delays.  In the area of criminal law, in many instances books of evidence have not been prepared and when cases come before the court they have to be postponed.  Delays involve expenses.  The more often one goes back to court, for whatever reason, the more expense is involved.  All the trappings of administration have to go along with it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we look at the success of the ombudsman system in other jurisdictions it is obvious it has much to offer.  The creation of a legal services ombudsman here will also prove of use.  It is a forum where both sides can look forward to fair play &mdash; the defendant as well as the complainant.  We all hear horrendous stories about what has happened to constituents and resorting to the existing bodies does not always bring about the resolution people would like.  The ombudsman might not do that either but at least the system will hopefully be impartial, fair and will have the ability to deal effectively with complaints, whatever their nature.  If not, at least it will be able to put in place some kind of recommendations or procedures whereby the same thing does not recur.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and am pleased to have had an opportunity to speak on it.  I hope some of the things about which I have moaned will become the subject of some amending legislation, if not in this Bill, in the not too distant future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this Bill and the ombudsman in particular.  There is no point in having jobs for the boys and the girls in the form of the ombudsman if the position does not have authority or the necessary powers.  We have many of those jobs.</P>
        <P>Recently, I wrote to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, regarding a case and the Ombudsman for Children, who stated the case was not under her remit.  If an ombudsman is to be established, he or she must be given the power to enter solicitors&rsquo; offices and do what must be <Col N="1971"/>done.  The 50-year fiasco that is the Law Society of Ireland investigating solicitors is the greatest joke.  Its people who appear on its behalf on radio are well spoken, but they do not deal with the complaints that have been made over the years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the ombudsman will not be a joke and will have real powers.  Many a person has not got justice from the State because he or she did not have the money or resources to bring a case to court.  Some such persons are dead now.  If a murderer, rapist or robber&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;goes to court, the victim gets nothing whereas the murderer or rapist gets everything, including free legal aid and the country&rsquo;s top barristers paid the top prices by the State.  The ordinary citizen who does not have enough resources but who needs justice, law and support cannot go to court because he or she cannot afford it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The citizen will go to a solicitor who will say that he or she wants &euro;5,000 up front for taking the case.  The citizens in question do not have that type of money.  If they had, they would not go to such a solicitor.  They would go directly to the top in Dublin.</P>
        <P>I hope we will have a system with some fairness because this country has become unfair.  I love putting on the record that the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer and the middle class is getting squeezed.  In recent years, the Government has looked after the rich.  The legal profession has been looked after by the Government and, in particular, the system.  We have seen many tribunals and the amount of money spent on law and order, but we are not getting any value.  The tribunals are going on and on and are making many people in the Law Society of Ireland richer.</P>
        <P>I want to see something happen.  A few months ago, hundreds of people attended a meeting to create an organisation to take on the legal profession.  I hope that the ombudsman will be given the power to investigate complaints.  That we will get a few cranks making complaints is fine, but we must deal with genuine complaints and the people who have been aggrieved and let down by the system, solicitors, the Law Society of Ireland and the State, which gave them no protection.  I hope the provision of an ombudsman will be the answer to people&rsquo;s problems, but the potential appointee should not take the job if he or she believes there is no power.</P>
        <P>The Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland has the power to investigate and do her job.  We want the same in respect of the proposed legal services ombudsman.  There is no point in the Oireachtas introducing wishy washy legislation if <Col N="1972"/>the ombudsman is not given the power or is unsure as to whether he or she has the necessary power.  Power must be given to the ombudsman to deal with problems.  The Law Society of Ireland was given an opportunity.  No organisation, be it the Garda, solicitors, politicians or others, should investigate itself.  There should always be an independent person to do so.</P>
        <P>Another matter upsets me.  Previously, I raised the matter of a serious assault case in my constituency in which the Garda recommended prosecution but the victim&rsquo;s family received a letter from the Director of Public Prosecutions stating he would not prosecute.  I examined the DPP&rsquo;s report in which he stated he is not required to be answerable to anyone.  That is not right, as the DPP should explain himself to the proposed ombudsman.  Perhaps we could include such a provision in the Bill.  My constituents&rsquo; daughter was hit on the head by a wheel brace, but the State did not see fit to prosecute despite the Garda&rsquo;s recommendation.  The family wrote to the DPP but has not received a reply.  If a person or family was in a similar situation, he, she or they should be able to write to the ombudsman and ask him or her to intervene by inquiring of the DPP why a daughter was in hospital for a number of weeks after an assault or why the State did not see fit to prosecute.  These are reasonable questions.</P>
        <P>If the public is dissatisfied with the DPP&rsquo;s decision not to prosecute a case, someone should be answerable.  People in every part of the country should be answerable to someone.  We all make mistakes.  There should be an appeal mechanism and the ombudsman should be used in this respect.  If people make complaints about the DPP, they should be able to write to the ombudsman to investigate the matter.  I would like to see this reasonable request included in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Is the Government serious about giving people justice and tackling the problem of legal costs?  Will the rich have justice while the poor has none?  People referred to the free Legal Aid Board, which has a good set-up.  However, it does not have enough funds or staff to deal with poor people&rsquo;s complaints.  The only people who get free legal aid are murderers and rapists.  They will be looked after while there are not enough resources, staff or money to take care of the people who really need protection, law and legal aid.  This should be corrected immediately.</P>
        <P>I hope the Government will take on the legal profession in respect of fees.  It is unrealistic and wrong to deprive people of justice because they do not have sufficient resources or money.  The time has come for this matter to be tackled.  As a society, we must give people justice.  If they want it, a lack of money should not prevent them from going to the Four Courts or taking a case.</P>
        <P>During the years, people have complained to me about wills and being unable to get information from solicitors, who have been protected by the House and legislation.  I welcome this legis<Col N="1973"/>lation and hope that powers will be given to the ombudsman to ensure genuine complaints can be quickly dealt with, the relevant solicitors can be brought in and their offices can be entered so that answers will be given to the ombudsman&rsquo;s questions.</P>
        <P>What has been happening has been wrong.  The largest farce of all is the Law Society of Ireland.  As we recently saw in respect of the redress board, the State paid solicitors who were also charging people.  This was double charging.  It took the Law Society of Ireland a long time to deal with the matter.  I listened to its president on the radio, but he did not do himself or the legal profession justice.  Wrong is wrong and one should not be paid twice for doing one&rsquo;s job.  I hope the ombudsman will take this matter on.</P>
        <P>I hope people will be able to approach the ombudsman directly rather than through the Law Society of Ireland.  The latter case should not be allowed.  There is no point in a case being before the Law Society of Ireland for 12 months and hoping that it will go away.  Previously, justice has not been done.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Bill.  I cannot state strongly enough that there is no point in an ombudsman if he or she does not have the power to deal with the complaints received.  First, the ombudsman must be given the powers, second, he or she must be given the staff and, third, there must be a timeframe in which to deal with queries.  There are many people out there who are dissatisfied with the legal profession and feel there is no place to go.  This, they hope, will be their saviour in the sense that at least there will be somewhere to go to make a complaint, that the complaint will be dealt with, they will not need to wait for years, they will not have solicitors investigating solicitors, the ombudsman will be able to adjudicate on their case and such adjudication will be legally binding on the solicitors.  I hope that will happen soon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Bill.  I hope that in the future the Minister will give the Legal Aid Board the resources and staff to give the poor of this country access to free legal aid to get the justice to which they are entitled.  Just because such people do not have sufficient money to do so does not mean they should not have access to the law.  They are as entitled to it as anybody else.  The Legal Aid Board does a good job but is under much pressure.  It does not have sufficient staff and resources, and it is not right that these resources are not provided.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the introduction of the legal services ombudsman.  I hope that I will not need to return in 18 months&rsquo; time to tell the House that we set up the ombudsman and it is not working because he or she does not possess the necessary powers or resources.  I hope that I am wrong and that this will be the first time people will feel that there is somebody, between the legal profession and <Col N="1974"/>themselves, to protect them and adjudicate on their cases.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Ring for his contribution.  I can assure him that, under section 25, the legal services ombudsman will have strong powers to require the provision of information.  He or she can require to see the files and deal with them, which is a concern Deputy Ring expressed understandably in the course of his contribution.  Deputy Ring might not be so pleased to learn that the scheme envisaged by the Bill is that the complaint will go in the first instance through the Law Society or the Bar Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>That is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That issue can be examined on Committee Stage.  There is a specific provision in the legislation which deals with the question of whether there has been unreasonable delay in either the Bar Council or the Law Society in the investigation of a complaint, and I understand that under the legislation the ombudsman can intervene in those circumstances.  The ombudsman also has full power to review the investigation that has already been done by the Law Society.  The ombudsman is being put in a strong position.  I agree with Deputy Ring.  A facility long needed in complaints against the profession is that there be an independent transparent mechanism for investigating solicitors or, indeed, members of the Bar who do not perform their duties in a professional manner, whether in the conduct of their practice, the dispatch of business or the handling, in the case of a solicitor, of clients&rsquo; funds.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputies for their wide-ranging contributions on what is a wide-ranging Bill.  Some of the contributions were at a detailed level and those issues can be dealt with on Committee Stage, but I want to address some of the more important points made in the course of the debate.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy McDowell, wants to record his appreciation for the general welcome given to the content of the Bill on all sides of the House.  I agree with Deputies that the provisions in the Bill are generally necessary and welcome.  Where differences of view have been expressed on some of the details, they can be explored further on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Deputies gave a general welcome for the establishment of the office of the legal services ombudsman.  I noted that most Deputies are supportive of the proposals of the Minister and I now want to address some of the more general points raised in connection with the ombudsman.</P>
        <P>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe and Deputy Howlin drew attention to the rising numbers entering the legal profession.  Currently, there are over 7,300 practising solicitors and over 1,900 members of <Col N="1975"/>the Bar in the State.  This rise in numbers is a reflection of the ongoing efforts of both branches of the profession towards reform and openness in their admissions policies.  Given that the administration of justice and the administration of the law is so closely bound up with the public administration of the State, it is important that persons should have reasonable access to legal qualification.  It is not simply a matter of providing a service for the public in a particular marketplace.  It is a branch, and profession, of business which is so closely tied up with the administration of the State that citizens should be entitled to aspire to membership of the profession if they so wish.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 1,100 complaints per annum against solicitors and approximately 25 per annum against members of the Bar.  I share the concern of many Deputies on such levels of complaints, especially against solicitors.  Given that there are over 9,000 practising solicitors and barristers many of whom would have large numbers of claims, it is not surprising this number of complaints arise but I am confident that the establishment of the legal services ombudsman will assist in rectifying problems which may arise in the investigation of complaints by the relevant professional bodies, both as regards the speed, thoroughness and outcome.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh queried section 11(2) and the arrangements on the appointment of staff to the office of the legal services ombudsman.  It is a standard practice to obtain the consent of the Minister for Finance where staff are being appointed.  Consultation with the Bar Council and the Law Society is considered necessary, given that they will both be funding the office of the legal services ombudsman.  Section 18(5) provides that the Minister may recover from the Bar Council or the Law Society, as a simple contract debt, any amount due in respect of the levy.  I have in the past expressed my appreciation of the willingness of the legal profession to embrace change and reform.  I look forward to the valued contributions of Deputies on the establishment of the office on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>On the gaming and lotteries legislation, the Minister has in the past expressed concerns at the growth of unregulated casino-type operations in this country operating ostensibly as private members&rsquo; clubs.  These expressions of concern are not just the Minister&rsquo;s own views.  His statements reflect the real worries expressed by the leading international anti-money laundering body, the Financial Action Task Force, that operations of this kind are vulnerable to abuse by laundering ill-gotten moneys.  With that in mind, the Minister has established an interdepartmental committee, chaired by a barrister, to examine what approaches can be taken to regulate casino style operations.  The deliberations of the committee will no doubt take account of broader gaming issues within the State.  Among these issues will <Col N="1976"/>be the question of on-line gaming raised by a number of Deputies during the debate.</P>
        <P>Deputy Howlin described as modest the proposals in the Bill to amend the gaming and lotteries legislation.  He is correct.  The limits being amended are hopelessly outdated and the Bill seeks no more than to remedy that aspect of the 1956 Act.</P>
        <P>Deputy Cuffe adverted to the mathematics of the proposed increase in stake and price limits and expressed concern as to the vulnerability of children to exposure to gaming.  The 1956 Act specifically outlaws gaming by those under the age of 16 and there are no proposals to lower that age limit.  I might add that gaming is unlawful unless the local authority has passed the appropriate resolution permitting the operation of slot machines within its functional area.  There are further steps that any intending operators must also take.  They must obtain a certificate from the local District Court and then apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a licence, which may be granted subject to conditions.</P>
        <P>Fifty years ago the maximum stake of sixpence would have bought, for instance, an eight-square bar of milk chocolate.  The maximum stake of that level is clearly now unrealistically low, as is the maximum price limit of ten shillings.  These need to be increased to realistic levels and that is all that this Bill does.</P>
        <P>On statutory law restatement, Deputy Howlin, while welcoming the Bill, was worried that the approach taken would tend towards a lack of clarity as to what the state of the present law will be.  I support his concern that statutes should be accessible, not just to the legal profession but to any person who wants to find out the current legal position.  The Statute Law (Restatement) Act 2002, to which Deputy Howlin referred, provides a means whereby blocks of law on a particular matter can be drawn together and presented in a comprehensive and coherent way.  Where possible, the provisions of this Bill have been drafted as amendments to existing legislation.  This approach is ideal for the preparation of restatements, once this Bill has been enacted, of the various other elements of the Statute Book that it amends.  It will be possible to update in a restatement form already available of the Succession Act.  Other areas such as the gaming and lotteries legislation can also be restated after the Bill is passed.</P>
        <P>In the matter of the court and court officers legislation there are difficulties.  There is a mass of statute law, going back to the foundation of the State and before, that can often be a minefield for the inexperienced, and indeed the experienced, reader.  I am glad to inform the House that there is a project under way under the aegis of the Law Reform Commission to address this major task.</P>
        <P>Deputies Howlin and Catherine Murphy expressed concern about the limit of &euro;3,000 in the Bill that the Law Society can award to a client against a solicitor who has provided a poor <Col N="1977"/>service.  This is an innovation.  The Law Society does not have this power at all at present.  The maximum set in the Bill can be compared, for instance, with the maximum fine that at present can be imposed by the District Court in criminal matters.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Howlin noted, the making of an award is not intended to limit in any way the right of an aggrieved client to pursue a full claim for compensation through the courts.  The disciplinary committee of the Law Society is not a court of law and it is appropriate that its power to award compensation should be limited to a modest level.  However, this issue can be re-examined on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe identified the thinking behind the requirement in the legislation that the Law Society disciplinary committee and its sub-committees should be chaired by solicitors.  He shares the concern that the chair of such committees should be up to the task of handling difficult points of law and procedure that are likely to be raised in the normal course of its business.  The skills and experience to deal properly with these challenges are likely to be found in lawyers.  Whether the chair should be confined to solicitors alone, even if, in this context, they can be expected to be in ready supply, is a matter that can be revisited.</P>
        <P>In his opening contribution, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, referred to further matters that are likely to be included in the legislation by way of Government amendments to be tabled on Committee Stage.  The amendments under development cover a number of areas, including anonymity for certain participants in civil proceedings in special circumstances; the wards of court legislation and, in particular, the provisions requiring that wards receive regular visitations by court appointed visitors; the banking arrangements for the collection of fines; the conferring of functions on county registrars by way of regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972; the adjustments to the levels of maximum stake and prize in slot machines under the gaming and lotteries legislation; technical adjustments to material relating to the legal services ombudsman; and technical adjustments to the legislation on the classification of films and videos.  Other matters may arise in the development of these amendments.</P>
        <P>In any event, the Minister looks forward to a rewarding debate on the details of the Bill on Committee Stage and any additional proposals brought forward by himself or other Members.  I thank Members for their contributions and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide specific arrangements for voting by prisoners.  In Ireland, there is no legal prohibition on voting by prisoners, once they meet the standard qualifying criteria under electoral law which apply on a general basis.  While a person in legal custody may be registered as an elector under section 11(5) of the Electoral Act 1992, he or she is deemed to be ordinarily resident in the place where he or she would have been residing but for his or her detention.  The law provides no specific mechanism for prisoners who are on the electoral register at such places to exercise their franchise.  In other words, they cannot get out for the day to go home to cast their votes.</P>
        <P>The Bill will modernise existing electoral law in this area and provide a practical framework for prisoners to vote in future elections and referenda.  It will bring certainty to Ireland&rsquo;s position in meeting fully our obligations under the relevant provisions of the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  This follows a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights last year in a case taken by a UK prisoner who challenged successfully a prohibition on voting.  While the legal position in the UK differs significantly from that in this country, in light of the judgment it is appropriate, timely and prudent to implement new arrangements to give practical effect to prisoner voting in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Postal voting in Ireland is provided in respect of a number of specific categories: persons living <Col N="1979"/>at home who are unable to go to a polling station to vote because of a physical illness or physical disability; persons whose occupation is likely to prevent them from voting at their local polling station and full-time students registered at home who are living elsewhere while attending a college in the State; whole-time members of the Defence Forces; Irish diplomats and their spouses; and members of the Garda.  Extension of postal voting arrangements to prisoners is the most appropriate way to proceed and the Bill provides accordingly.  Postal voting procedures are well established.  They are simple, flexible and inexpensive and registration authorities and returning officers are familiar with them.</P>
        <P>In broad terms, the legislation provides for applications by prisoners for entry in the postal voters list and, if necessary, in the supplement to the postal voters list and in the supplement to the register itself.  It also sets out the detailed procedures for prisoner voting.  Under the Bill, prisoners will continue to be registered at their home address and, for voting purposes, will be deemed to be ordinarily resident in their home constituency.  This will allow prisoners to vote for candidates in their own locality.  It is not intended that a prison location will be used for constituency purposes.  The new arrangements will apply to prisoners who can establish that they were ordinarily resident in the State prior to being imprisoned.  Under electoral law, citizenship determines the type of elections at which people can vote and this will apply in the same way to people who are in prison.  The scheme of postal voting contained in the Bill is modelled largely on existing postal voting procedures and mirrors most closely those used for the occupation and student category of postal voter.  The procedures have been modified, where necessary, to take account of prisoner circumstances, for example, in the witnessing of signatures.  A limited number of provisions contain miscellaneous amendments to electoral law.</P>
        <P>I turn now to the detail of the Bill.  The first substantive provision is section 2, which requires the local registration authority to enter in the postal voters list the name of an elector who applies for entry and who satisfies the authority that his or her detention is such that he or she would be unlikely to be able to vote in person on polling day.  Applications must be made not later than the last date for making claims for correction in the draft register &mdash; 25 November.  This is the same cut-off point for all applicants wishing to register.  The section provides that a person seeking registration under the terms of the Bill will be registered at the address where he or she would be ordinarily resident were it not for his or her detention.  It is not proposed that a prison location would be used for constituency purposes.  There will be no question, therefore, of an election in a particular constituency being disproportionately influenced simply by the location of <Col N="1980"/>a prison within its boundaries.  As with all electoral codes, determination of ordinary residence will be a matter for the registration authorities.</P>
        <P>Section 3 sets out a procedure for applying for entry on the postal voters list.  It is based on the existing application provisions for the occupation and student categories of postal voter.  The application must be in a form directed by the Minister and must be accompanied by a certificate from the relevant prison official.  The certificate must be signed by the official to verify that the applicant is a prisoner for the purposes of inclusion in the postal voters list.  The relevant official must arrange for the documents to be sent to the registration authority via the normal prison postal system.</P>
        <P>Section 4 requires the applicant to provide the registration authority with whatever documentation or information they may request to enable the authority to determine their eligibility.  Under this provision, the applicant has at least seven days in which to submit the necessary information before the application is deemed to be withdrawn.  The intent of this section is that the registration authority is satisfied that the circumstances of the applicant&rsquo;s detention are in accordance with the qualification criteria set out in the legislation and it will be a matter for them to take steps that may be necessary to come to a decision on the matter.  This is similar to existing provisions in electoral law.</P>
        <P>Section 5 requires a registration authority to give public notice each year within 14 days before the qualifying date for registration purposes &mdash; 1 September &mdash; of the category of electors eligible for inclusion on the postal voters list, the manner in which and the time before which they can apply, and the time and place at which application forms may be obtained.  This must include every prison located in the authority&rsquo;s area and forms must be supplied free of charge.</P>
        <P>Section 6 sets out the procedures to be followed by the registration authority following examination of the application, including the granting or refusal of an application and notification of the decision.  Applications cannot be accepted by a registration authority after 25 November.  There is, however, scope to vary this deadline by way of ministerial order for the first year in which the new arrangements for prisoners come into operation.  This flexibility in the transitional period will facilitate prisoners who wish to vote at any election or referendum which may be held in the period immediately following enactment.  There is also provision for an appeal to the county registrar in the event of an application for entry in the postal voters list being refused by a registration authority.  This is based on similar provisions for other categories of postal voters.</P>
        <P>Section 7 sets out the procedures for voting by prisoners entered in the postal voters list.  It applies to prisoners the existing procedures which operate for other categories of postal voters, with appropriate modifications.  Generally, the pro<Col N="1981"/>cedures include matters such as the issuing of ballot papers and other appropriate documentation to prisoners by post, completion of the declaration of identity and of ballot papers in secret, and instructions and envelopes for the proper return of ballot papers and supporting documentation to the returning officer.  In this regard, the relevant official must arrange for the documents to be sent to the returning officer via the normal prison postal system.  Section 7(2) ensures that these modifications in regard to postal voting in D&aacute;il elections will also apply to presidential elections and referenda.</P>
        <P>Separate rules in European Parliament and local elections law govern postal voting, although they are virtually identical to the D&aacute;il electoral law.  Sections 8 and 9 amend these codes by inserting provisions corresponding to those in section 7, thereby ensuring consistency across the electoral codes in the new arrangements.</P>
        <P>Section 10 amends section 15A of the Electoral Act 1992 and inserts a new provision to allow a prisoner who is not on the current postal voters list to make application for inclusion on the supplement to the list.  This amendment will allow the same procedures to be used by prisoners when applying for entry in the supplement to the postal voters list as apply to applications for entry in the postal voters list itself, but with appropriate modifications.  It will assist an elector who may not have been registered, nor even in custody, and therefore not eligible for inclusion on the postal voters list, by the specified date of 25 November &mdash; in other words, if he or she was incarcerated after that date.</P>
        <P>Section 11 amends Rule 14A of the Second Schedule to the Electoral Act 1992.  Any person who wishes to be included on a postal voters list must already be on the register of electors.  This provision establishes specific procedures for a prisoner who is not already on the register of electors to apply for inclusion in the supplement to the register and therefore qualify for inclusion on the postal voters list.</P>
        <P>Sections 12 and 13 amend the principal legislation relating to Seanad elections and are similar in content.  They implement minor procedural adjustments to take account of standard prison postal arrangements.  In this regard, the onus is placed on the relevant officer of the prison, rather than the prisoner, to arrange for the voting documentation to be sent to the returning officer through the normal prison postal system.  The provisions are necessary to facilitate voting by prisoners who may be eligible to vote in Seanad elections, whether for university or panel members.</P>
        <P>Section 14 takes account of the particular circumstances that a prisoner, or former prisoner, may be in when an election is called.  It enables a prisoner to have his or her name deleted from the postal voters list; for example, this would apply if he or she was released from prison.  Once the registration authority is notified in writing of this <Col N="1982"/>on or before the second day after the dissolution of the D&aacute;il at a general election, or on or before the second day after a polling day order is made at all other elections or referenda, the name may be deleted from the postal voters list allowing the elector to vote in person at a polling station in the normal way.</P>
        <P>Where a prisoner is released but is still on the postal voters list coming up to an election, and the relevant prison official of the prison returns the ballot paper documents to the returning officer before polling day, the returning officer can re-address the documentation to the elector&rsquo;s home address.  The elector can then vote at a Garda station in the same way as an occupation or student postal voter.  There is also provision for the ballot paper documentation to be re-addressed to a prisoner who has been moved to another prison in the State.  These are practical and relatively minor adjustments.</P>
        <P>Sections 15 to 17 are miscellaneous amendments to electoral law which we are taking the opportunity to bring forward in this Bill.  Section 15 amends section 6 of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 by the insertion of a new provision which authorises a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or an official of a registration authority to witness the statutory declaration which EU voters are required to submit when registering for the first time in this country to vote in European Parliament elections.  The services of the two new categories of authorised witnesses are free and readily accessible.  Of course, the declaration can continue to be signed by a notary public, a commissioner for oaths or a peace commissioner, as at present.  It is a matter for individuals to choose from the range of authorised people.</P>
        <P>Section 16 makes technical amendments to the Local Elections Regulations 1995, mainly relating to the local election count rules.  It deletes qualifications regarding surpluses and exclusions that are no longer relevant.  The purpose of the original provisions, now being deleted by paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), was to ensure that individual candidates were given every opportunity to save their deposits by being credited with a number of votes in excess of one quarter of the quota.  As the deposit system was found to be unconstitutional, these qualifications are no longer required.</P>
        <P>The term &ldquo;alderman&rdquo; was abolished under the Local Government Act 2001 and there is now no statutory order of election at local elections.  The amendments at paragraphs (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) reflect this position, repealing remaining provision in the local elections regulations relating to order of election.</P>
        <P>Section 17 amends the Presidential Elections Act 1993.  It makes technical amendments to the presidential count rules to ensure that candidates are given a full opportunity to qualify for recoupment of election expenses.  This amendment has its genesis in Article 3 of the Presidential Election (Reimbursement of Expenses) Regulations 2004, which made provision for recoupment of some <Col N="1983"/>election expenses by presidential candidates if they are credited with more than one quarter of the quota at any stage of the count.  Section 51 of the Presidential Elections Act 1993 is being amended to ensure that candidates are excluded separately in cases where this could give them the opportunity of qualifying for recoupment of election expenses.  The amendment will bring the presidential count rules into line with the D&aacute;il and European codes.</P>
        <P>In addition, a procedural amendment is also being made which reschedules, from 12 noon to 3 p.m. on the last day for receiving nominations, the time for the start of the formal ruling on nominations at a presidential election.  As the law currently stands, both the deadline for receipt of nominations and the start of the process of ruling on them is set at 12 noon, which may not allow sufficient time for consideration of nomination papers.</P>
        <P>Section 18 is a standard provision dealing with the Short Title, collective citation and construction of the Bill.</P>
        <P>This is a short Bill but a significant one.  It modernises existing electoral law in an important area and provides a practical framework for prisoners to vote in future elections and referenda.  It will also bring certainty to Ireland&rsquo;s position in meeting fully our obligations under the relevant provisions of the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell MEP, has done much work in this area.  In fact, he published the Electoral (Amendment) (Prisoners&rsquo; Franchise) Bill 2005, which was the precursor to this Bill.  We on this side of the House are very pleased that the Minister and the Department have taken on board the views expressed by Deputy Mitchell, as well as other views.  Therefore, Fine Gael will support the Bill on all Stages.</P>
        <P>As the Minister explained, the background to the Bill is that prisoners in Ireland have the right to vote but there is no mechanism by which they can vote.  The Bill is in response to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in October 2005 that the United Kingdom laws preventing prisoners from voting contravened the fundamental human rights of prisoners.</P>
        <P>Prisoners currently have the right to vote in Ireland but, as they are registered to vote in their constituency of residence prior to conviction, they are physically unable to do so.  The Bill proposes to introduce a mechanism through which prisoners can use a postal vote.</P>
        <P>What we are basically doing is encompassing the decision of the European Court of Human Rights and building on the issue.  There are clearly many issues that come to people&rsquo;s minds with regard to prisons.  I accept this is not a justice debate and we are not discussing those issues <Col N="1984"/>today.  Nevertheless, they should be addressed.  The issues include Mr. Justice Kinlen&rsquo;s report into prisons, an independent inspectorate and the important matter of what is happening in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, particularly rehabilitating and working with young first-time prisoners who have been convicted and incarcerated.  I hope the Government will bring forward other legislation dealing with these matters.</P>
        <P>It is important our prison system forms part of our reform agenda.  It is also important that our criminal justice system is framed with the hope that this measure will in some small part go towards the rehabilitation of prisoners.  It is an important social step and democratic reform which will, my party believes, strengthen our electoral process.</P>
        <P>The question internationally is very interesting.  We have done some research on it with the help of the Oireachtas Library.  That work will match the Minister&rsquo;s word for word and argument for argument.  I acknowledge as an important step the extension of staff in the Oireachtas Library to approximately 40 researchers, as it helps all of us on this side of the House who do not have the ranks of excellent civil servants.  It will add to debate and it is a very constructive move.  The Minister will know how good the researchers are from my comments today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is always well informed, focused and to the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy still does not deserve to be over here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>We will decide that one.</P>
        <P>Internationally, there is a wide spectrum of approaches in different countries.  Canada, the Ukraine, Iran &mdash; believe it or not &mdash; and South Africa allow prisoners to vote but bar some categories of prisoners.  For example, in Australia, prisoners with a sentence of over five years cannot vote.  In China, prisoners on death row cannot vote.</P>
        <P>It extends to a blanket ban in some countries, such as Russia, and countries which restrict even ex-prisoners from voting, such as the United States.  Added to this are prisoners in many countries such as Ireland who can legally vote, but there is no practical organisation or process for them to do so.</P>
        <P>The main arguments for giving prisoners the right to vote include the fact that prisoners usually overwhelmingly come from disadvantaged backgrounds and different racial or ethnic groups.  Therefore, the exclusion of prisoners&rsquo; votes discriminates against one ethnic racial class or group.  Exclusion from voting may contradict Irish laws against discrimination and possibly the International Convention on the Elimination of <Col N="1985"/>All Forms of Racial Discrimination, of which Ireland is a signatory.</P>
        <P>We know of no research that finds racial groups to be disproportionately represented in Irish prisons.  However, there has been a change and there is a significant increase in the number of non-nationals in Irish prisons.  There is some evidence to suggest that increases in racism are linked to increased disenfranchisement policies.</P>
        <P>The aim of modern criminal law is to rehabilitate offenders and orientate them positively towards a society when they are released.  That is the kernel of what we are trying to do here.  Our legal system deals with the prisoner&rsquo;s body, but we do not deal with the mind.  Having properly served due process and due time, we try, if possible, to help prisoners get back into society when they have fully discharged their duty to it.</P>
        <P>It is argued that the process is assisted by a policy of encouraging offenders to observe their civil and political obligations.  This is the prisoner&rsquo;s identification with, rather than alienation from, society.  That should be the guiding principle.  To deny prisoners a right to vote is to lose an important means of teaching them democratic values and social responsibility.  Elections are examples of communities working together for the common good.  If some members of the community are prohibited from engaging in elections, the communitarian ideal is undermined.</P>
        <P>A citizen&rsquo;s right to vote should depend only on the ability to make a rational choice.  The suggestion that prisoners lose the right to vote because they have violated a social contract implies they have a certain type of rationality, and that they have deliberately chosen criminal activity with the knowledge they would lose their voting rights.  Without this foreknowledge and rationality &mdash; both are highly questionable &mdash; this logic fails.</P>
        <P>There is no evidence that disenfranchisement deters crime.  It may actually foster further criminal behaviour.  It can stigmatise citizens.  A small portion of research indicates that prisoners feel stigmatised because of a lack of a right to vote, even if these prisoners did not vote in the past.  It can become a political football, as it has done in the United States, for example.</P>
        <P>The basic principles of electoral democracy are laid down in international law.  Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights declares:</P>
        <P LI="1">Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions: [...]</P>
        <P LI="2">(b) To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors;</P>
        <P FLI="0">Article 2 states that this applies to &ldquo;all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction <Col N="1986"/>the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status&rdquo;.  The European Court of Human Rights has upheld that a blanket ban violates the European Convention on Human Rights.  There is no obvious logical link between losing one&rsquo;s liberty and losing one&rsquo;s right to vote.</P>
        <P>The arguments that have been used against prisoners voting would include that of equal importance to the concept of rehabilitation is the concept of deterrence.  This seeks, by the denial of a range of freedoms, to provide a disincentive to crime.  Prisoners have violated a social contract and therefore forfeit the right to participate in the civil process for the duration of their sentence.</P>
        <P>This argument is usually not popular.  In the United States, a Supreme Court is quoted in upholding the prohibition against prisoners and ex-prisoners.  In the United States, 2% of the population is currently disenfranchised.  Research indicates that approximately 13% of African-Americans, or 1.4 million people, are disenfranchised.  It is a high number.  These disenfranchised people represent just over a third, some 36%, of the total disenfranchised population.</P>
        <P>In two states in America, research has shown that almost one in every three black people is disenfranchised.  In eight states, the number is one in four.  If current trends continue, it is projected that the rate of disenfranchisement for black people could reach 40% in the states that disenfranchise ex-offenders.</P>
        <P>This relates to the medieval concept of civil death.  If a prisoner is not executed by the state, by imposing a civil death the prisoner will suffer as if they were physically dead in that he or she would have no rights of succession or to vote.  The concept has a medieval origin, but in modern times it was brought from Europe to the colonies, where many people fully supported it in the 19th century.</P>
        <P>Deprivation of the right to vote is not an inherent or necessary aspect of criminal punishment.  Neither does it promote the reintegration of offenders into lawful society.  Defenders of these laws have been hard pressed to justify them.  In a modern democracy like Ireland, there is no place or case for these arguments.</P>
        <P>I have spoken about America and the European states.  Five other countries in Europe have no provision to allow prisoners to vote.  However, these countries are not in the majority.  Some 18 states place no voting restrictions on prisoners, and it should be pointed out that Ireland is among them.  Although there is no particular ban on prisoners voting in this country, as established by a court case in the past decade, prisoners are currently unable to exercise the right.  In France and Germany, courts have the power to impose a loss of voting rights as an additional punishment.</P><Col N="1987"/>
        <P>With regard to the United States, everybody will remember the 2000 presidential election and the actions of George Bush&rsquo;s brother in Florida.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>There were hanging chads.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>He had many people working for him disenfranchise all the people who had a previous conviction.  It gave a terrible picture of a democracy for people who were no longer in prison and had discharged their obligation.  They were pursued to get them off the electoral register because of their race and political situation.  That was terrible.  In Florida, it is estimated that one in three of all black people are denied the right to vote.</P>
        <P>It is worth making the point that although our country is only recently getting used to multiculturalism and we do not have a particularly high number of ethnic minorities in prison, there is a certainly a class issue with regard to the prison population and the denial of prisoner voting rights.  It impinges much more dramatically on the votes of working class members of the electorate.</P>
        <P>In the transnational context, the European Convention on Human Rights protects the right of everyone to vote.  We are not legislating in isolation, nor is this just some altruistic measure by the Government or the Oireachtas.  We have been remiss in not doing this earlier and it is good that we are finally acting in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is entirely right that the Bill seeks to extend the postal vote to prisoners.  When this issue was first mooted, there was some alarm that voting booths would be set up in prisons with all the accompanying costs to the State.  As an aside, I note what has happened to those wonderful counting machines which the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, ordered and the Minister, Deputy Cullen, delivered.  We have now learned that one can play video games on them, as well as corrupting the entire voting process by means of a simple key.  It shows just how unrealistic the whole process was.  It is unacceptable that it can be interfered with so easily, quickly and effectively.  While one may have been voting on such machines in Wicklow. Louth or elsewhere, the reality is that the process is now in serious doubt.  Much money has been spent on it but the Minister of the day should have listened to the views of the Opposition, particularly those of my colleague, Deputy Allen, who strongly argued that the Minister should have sought alternative opinions.</P>
        <P>The voting system is a matter for all of us.  It is not the Government&rsquo;s voting system, even though Ministers have made it their system; it should be a collective system.  Unless our work on issues such as the franchise and how we change the voting system is done with everyone&rsquo;s consent and agreement we will continue to have a debacle such as the current one.  It is politically unacceptable that on these important matters the <Col N="1988"/>Government did not listen and is still not heeding the voice of the Opposition.  We now have hundreds of electronic voting machines which are costing a fortune to store in air-conditioned offices.  Perhaps they should be preserved as a work of art dedicated to the memory of this Government when the time comes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Or recycled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s view on that.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise the issue of voter education.  It is difficult enough to get the general population to vote.  Typically, almost four out of ten voters do not vote.  I know we are trying to improve the electoral register so we will have to re-examine that voter turn-out figure again after the next election.  Prisoners, in particular, come from disadvantaged backgrounds and a large number of them cannot read or write.  They may also have medical and other problems.  We need to educate more people across the board to vote in this regard.  If we spent half or a quarter of the &euro;50 million that was wasted on electronic voting machines in getting people out to vote, and in educating them in the process, we would get a far more effective return for our money.</P>
        <P>The Bill also states that prisoners who are registering to vote need to establish that they were ordinarily resident in the State prior to their imprisonment to avail of the postal voting arrangements.  Where does this leave EU nationals who have the right to vote in local and European elections, and non-EU nationals who have the right to vote in local elections?  Are these groups to be included in the extension of voting rights?  If not, we should discuss this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>On a practical level, what arrangements does the Minister envisage around election time?  Will there be an opportunity to canvass?  Will there be public meetings in prisons?  I can imagine how lively they would be.  What access will prisoners have to the media or the arrangements currently in place?  I pose these questions because if we are going to extend voting rights we should ensure that people will have the opportunity to avail of them.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, has been a strong voice on the need for prison reform.  In 2003, he observed that the response to criminal activity has been to promise more laws.  He went on to say that we have passed 40 Criminal Justice Acts since 1973.  If all this law was put before the D&aacute;il in one Act or in four or five Acts, alarm bells would have rung and we would have questioned whether all this legislation was needed.</P>
        <P>Prison reform is a difficult area and, as Deputy Gay Mitchell has pointed out, politicians are fearful of raising the issue lest they come across as being unsympathetic towards victims or soft on crime.  Recidivism is high, however, and many of those who go to prison have few skills, while a <Col N="1989"/>significant number have mental and other illnesses.</P>
        <P>Prisoners are, by definition, deprived of their liberty but to deprive them of the right to vote as well is to dehumanise them.  Fine Gael believes in rights and responsibilities and to deny prisoners votes releases them of responsibility.  If prisoners are to take responsibility for their actions they should be encouraged to feel that they are still part of society and can be rehabilitated.  To punish an individual for a criminal offence should not mean that person is also automatically deprived of other rights.</P>
        <P>It is the view of my party that giving votes to prisoners would not only acknowledge their rights but would also underline their responsibility for themselves and to society.  Furthermore, it might encourage politicians to take a greater interest in penal reform and to invest greater effort in considering why 75% of Dublin&rsquo;s criminals come from five identifiable areas.</P>
        <P>If we give people an opportunity to be rehabilitated while in prison, if we require prisoners to confront their own role in society and make a contribution by way of fulfilling a civic duty &mdash; that is, the duty to vote &mdash; we will have a better chance of changing prisoners&rsquo; views of themselves and their role in society.</P>
        <P>There are without doubt victims of crime who will be offended by this Bill.  However, the objective is not to be soft on crime or the criminal but to examine how best we can change their behaviour once they have served their time.  If we can head off the causes of crime, we will be better able to rehabilitate and reintegrate prisoners into society.  This in turn should reduce crime.  Locking prisoners away in poorly-equipped prisons &mdash; social dustbins as it were &mdash; is not a contribution to solving crime.  As Deputy Gay Mitchell has said, it is little more than a way of recycling prisoners in a subculture which is excluded from the mainstream of society.</P>
        <P>This Bill has important implications for our electoral system and I would like to put on the record that Fine Gael has further proposals in this area.  One such proposal is to allow for automatic voter registration upon reaching one&rsquo;s 18th birthday.  The simple solution to the difficulties we are currently having with regard to the electoral register is to place people automatically on the register when they reach the age of 18 years.  This could be done quite simply by employing the PPS number currently used by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Every person already has a PPS number, so when someone reaches the voting age, the Department of Social and Family Affairs could automatically inform the relevant local authority.  Such a system would efficiently eliminate much of the confusion that currently reigns.  In addition, the exclusion of 18 to 21 year olds from standing for election to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann makes no sense.  In time this matter will have to be sorted out.</P><Col N="1990"/>
        <P>I have already referred to the debacle of electronic voting, an episode which has cast the entire political and electoral process in a bad light.  Taxpayers are paying exorbitant rates for the storage of unused electronic voting machines thanks to a complete lack of direction from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and its Ministers.  On foot of a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Paul McGrath, it was revealed that the State is paying widely different annual rates for storing these machines.  The costs range from nothing in Sligo to &euro;1.62 per machine in Louth, which I think is very good, and an incredible &euro;271 per machine in Waterford.  That shows just how out of control the situation has become.</P>
        <P>The Bill is progressive and timely.  It has been based on a decision of the European Court and will make a real difference to the campaign for prison reform.  I wish it a speedy passage through the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill, which the Labour Party will be supporting.  It arises from the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Hirst <i>v</i>. the United Kingdom, which established the right of prisoners to vote.  The Labour Party supports that right.</P>
        <P>There are a number of issues I wish to raise at this stage and, perhaps, pursue further on Committee Stage.  I have received a commentary on the Bill from the Irish Penal Reform Trust which has identified three areas where it considers the Bill needs to be amended.  The first issue is the requirement in section 2 that proof of residency in a particular constituency be shown by the prisoner concerned.  It points out that many prisoners are homeless or have no fixed abode at the point where they are committed to prison and, therefore, may not be in a position to prove they have residence in a particular constituency, and if they cannot prove they are resident in a particular constituency presumably they cannot be registered to vote.  That is an issue that needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>The second issue is the requirement in section 4 that a prisoner applying to register as a voter may have to provide additional information or documents to satisfy the registration authorities that he or she is entitled to be registered to vote.  Again the Irish Penal Reform Trust points out that prisoners may not have access to those documents while in prison and that they could be disenfranchised if they cannot produce the documentation.  It raises the question whether it is necessary for such documentation to be presented since, clearly, the State already knows the identity and has satisfied itself of the identity of the prisoner, as have the courts, and that there should be another way of dealing with that issue.</P>
        <P>The third issue raised by the Irish Penal Reform Trust is that if the legislation is to be effective it will require accompanying complementary prison policy governing access to registration and to ballots.  It is one thing for prisoners <Col N="1991"/>to have a right enshrined in legislation but it is another matter when it comes to be operated in the prison.  The whole issue of the way this will work in practice needs to be teased out somewhat further on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>There is a further issue which is not concerned with registration of the prisoner as a voter but with the prisoner&rsquo;s exercise of his or her right as a voter, the actual casting of the vote.  As I understand it, the procedure being provided for is a postal voting procedure.  A process is set down whereby that is to be witnessed.  There are obligations on prison officers and so on to ensure the vote is returned.  The difficulty that arises, one that will have to be addressed, is how the privacy of the prisoner&rsquo;s vote is protected and how the integrity of the prisoner&rsquo;s voting intention is protected.</P>
        <P>People who are in prison are not free.  We have become aware, as recently as this summer, of the degree to which the State is failing in its duty to protect those committed to prison, of the stories about the way in which prisoners are brutalised and the way in which a prisoner was killed during the summer.  We have had the report of the visiting committees and the criticisms that Mr. Justice Kinlen made of the way in which the prisons are run and the way in which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is supervising the running of prisons.  To be blunt, if the State cannot protect the lives of prisoners, their physical safety and bodily integrity, while in prison, I do not have a great deal of confidence that the administration of our prisons would be able to protect the secrecy and the integrity of a prisoner&rsquo;s vote.</P>
        <P>I will need to hear more, when this issue is debated on Committee Stage, about how steps are taken to ensure that prisoners are not subjected to undue pressures, either from fellow prisoners or, possibly &mdash; I am not casting reflection on prison staff &mdash; from prison staff or individual members of prison staff when they come to exercise their voting intention.  They are not free in the same way as every other voter.  That is an area that will have to be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The Bill is essentially about the registration of voters, in this case the registration of prisoners as voters, but there is a wider issue relating to the registration of voters which has been the subject of discussion in the House which I and other colleagues have raised here on a number of occasions, that is, the state of the current electoral register.  In response to raising the matter with the Minister, to be fair to him, he has engaged in a new voter registration process and has provided some additional resources to local authorities for same.  As we speak, the staff who have been engaged by local authorities are out there trying to improve the electoral register.</P>
        <P>I have a concern about the way in which that is being done and I wish to put it to the Minister.  We raised concerns about the electoral register, <Col N="1992"/>the multiple entries of people on the register and the fact that the register was out of date in many places.  Clearly, many were on the register who were no longer living at the addresses at which they were registered.  In putting it right, there is a grave danger that another very serious wrong will be done to many people, that is, that people will be removed from the register.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>People who have been on an electoral register for many years do not give it a second thought.  It is not something that occupies their minds.  They have always turned up to vote and they will now be removed from the register because the method that is being used to correct the electoral register involves the sending out of letters to people and calling to people&rsquo;s houses and if they do not respond to those approaches from local authority officials they will be removed from the register.  A paragraph from a report on this matter which was produced recently by South Dublin County Council reads: &ldquo;Based on recent indicators projected from the work undertaken so far by the council, thousands of South Dublin residents who would otherwise be eligible to vote will not be placed on the register of electors for 2007-2008 because they have not furnished up-to-date information regarding persons eligible to vote to South Dublin County Council.&rdquo;  I believe that is repeated elsewhere throughout the country.  When the new electoral register is produced and people who have always voted turn up to vote at the next general election, they will find they are not on the register.  When they ask why they are not on the register they will be told they are not on the register because they did not return the form to the county council.  </P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister needs to act to ensure people who have every entitlement to vote are not removed from the register.  The business of saying that officials called to the door and nobody was in, that two letters were sent to which there was no reply, following which the person was taken off the register, needs to be stopped.  That is not the way to correct the electoral register.  During the course of the past year we proposed many ways in which the electoral register could be amended and brought up to date, but the Government chose not to take up any of those suggestions.  The method now being used will deprive citizens who have always participated in the electoral process of the right to vote.  If local authorities do that, they will be in breach of their duties because it is the duty of the registration authorities to ensure the electoral register is accurate.  The issue must be addressed urgently.</P>
      
        <P>Another issue which arose during the course of the summer is the result of the preliminary census.  The preliminary census figures published show that some constituencies are out of line with the limits set down in the Constitution.  The con<Col N="1993"/>stituency of Dublin-West, for example, will have a ratio of TD per population which exceeds the upper limit of 1:30,000 provided for and quite explicit in the Constitution.  Also, a number of constituencies will vary from the norm in terms of the ratio of TD to population, in some cases by up to 10% or 12%.  We will have a situation where a constituency with roughly the same population as an adjoining constituency will have three seats while the adjoining constituency has four seats.</P>
        <P>The courts have previously insisted there must be equality of representation and that the principle of equality must be protected.  Based on the preliminary census figure, the existing constituency boundaries, which were based on the previous census, are vulnerable to legal challenge.  The Minister has stated publicly that the Government has decided not to do anything about this and that it will not do a new revision of the constituencies nor bring a new constituency boundary Bill before the House.  He has said this conclusion is based on the advice he has got from the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Minister publicly, and asked in the House yesterday through the Taoiseach, for the advice from the Attorney General to be published.  To date, the Minister&rsquo;s response has been that the Government does not normally publish advice it receives from the Attorney General.  I accept that is the case when dealing with routine Government business, but this is an area which is not about routine business.  It is about the electoral process and whether the general election we will have in the next six months or so will be vulnerable to legal challenge.</P>
        <P>The issue is urgent.  If the issue is allowed to drift and the Minister hides behind the advice of the Attorney General, which nobody else has seen, we are in danger of a challenge being taken.  We do not know what the courts will do in that situation or what they will decide.  I remind the House that on the last occasion a challenge was taken to our electoral Acts &mdash; the Kelly case taken at the time of the 2002 general election &mdash; the judgment was handed down the day before polling day.  Imagine the mess we will be in if the courts hand down a judgment stating the formation of constituencies on which the general election is based is unconstitutional.  The issue needs to be addressed.  The minimum I ask the Minister is to publish the advice he has received from the Attorney General.  This is an issue in which we all have an interest and the advice should be available to the House.</P>
        <P>The other development which occurred with regard to electoral matters during the summer was the publication of the second report of the Commission on Electronic Voting on the secrecy, accuracy and testing of the chosen electronic voting system.  It was published on 4 July, just as the House was going into recess for the summer.  I raised this matter this morning with the Minister for Finance who was taking the second phase of <Col N="1994"/>the Order of Business and asked him to make time available for a debate in the House on the report.  The report of the Commission on Electronic Voting was made to the House, not to Government.  Therefore it should be debated and discussed in the House.  I repeat my call for it to be debated here.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that we are having today&rsquo;s debate on the very day a report is being published in the Netherlands by a group of citizens with concerns about the electronic voting system in use there, essentially the same system and hardware and provided by the same company as that advocated for this country.  The Dutch have found it is possible to hack into the voting machines and demonstrated that it was possible to play a game of chess on them.  We were told repeatedly by the former Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputies Cullen and Noel Dempsey, and by the Taoiseach that the machines were secure and safe.</P>
        <P>I have been going back over the history of the electronic voting debacle.  The Government spent over &euro;50 million purchasing an electronic voting system which will not now be used and we spend &euro;750,000 per year to keep the machines in storage.  It is clear the equipment will never be used in an Irish election, not least because the public has no confidence in it and the commission, which was established by the House, has roundly and conclusively condemned it to the dustbin.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party raised concerns about electronic voting in 2003 and in November 2003 we published a document entitled Electronic Voting in Ireland &mdash; a Threat to Democracy?  In that document we set out a number of concerns about the electronic voting system the Government intended to use.  We pointed out there were problems relating to the physical and operational security of the system and that has been confirmed by the report of the Commission on Electronic Voting.  We pointed out that no end-to-end testing had been carried out on the system and the same conclusion is made in the commission report.  We pointed out that the quality of the software being used was inadequate and this too has been confirmed in the report.  We pointed out the source code had not been made available and the commission has drawn attention to this also.  We drew attention to the lack of independent verification of the system being proposed and this has been confirmed by the report.  We pointed out the dangers of using CDs and floppy disks to transfer data from the voting machines to the counting system and this too has been criticised by the Commission on Electronic Voting.  We also drew attention to the issue of voter confidence, which has been commented on by the Commission on Electronic Voting.</P>
        <P>I ask the House to bear in mind that this report was published by the Labour Party in November 2003, following which the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government examined the electronic voting system and had expert wit<Col N="1995"/>nesses appear before it as well as representatives of the Department and of the companies supplying both the hardware and the software.  Notwithstanding all the criticisms which were made of this system, the Government and the then Minister, Deputy Cullen, proceeded to buy it anyway.  When the Labour Party published its report and when the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government examined the electronic voting system, the contracts had not been signed and the payments had not been made.  It was after the problem had been flagged and after it was known that the Opposition was unhappy with the electronic voting system, after the expert opinion had been given and communicated, that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, went ahead with it anyway.</P>
        <P>In the past week, this House has heard much about the issue of accountability and it is not yet finished with accountability for the waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money on a system that will not be used in circumstances where the Minister concerned was repeatedly told that this was a mistake and where the flaws in the system which have now been confirmed by the Commission on Electronic Voting were already pointed out to him.</P>
        <P>The commission has done an excellent job and has produced two reports.  The second report, which is its major opus, has now been presented and is before the House.. The House will need to discuss what is to be done arising from that report.  It must discuss what is to be done with the voting machines.  It must discuss what is the future of electronic voting, if any, in this State.  It must discuss the question of holding to account those Ministers who wasted such a huge amount of Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money.  When will the Government provide time for such a discussion?</P>
        <P>We are approaching a general election.  On other occasions in advance of general and local elections the Government has suddenly pulled electoral legislation from the bottom drawer to be presented and rushed through the House.  I recall legislation being brought forward in the run-in to the 2002 general election which increased quite significantly the spending limits to be allowed in the course of that election.  I want a clear statement from the Minister.  Is any further electoral legislation contemplated by the Government between now and the general election?  If it is contemplated, I want to be told about it now, not when it is being published and presented in an attempt to rush it through the House.</P>
        <P>I have raised the following issue with the Minister by way of a parliamentary question.  What action does the Minister propose to take about the spending limits?  Is it intended to increase the spending limits for the forthcoming general election?  It is in the interests of the entire political system that this information be known.  It is unacceptable that the existing Government would have a game plan with regard to spending on the general election which is not available to other <Col N="1996"/>political parties and to the general public.  I await a clear statement from the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Morgan and Cuffe.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2006 and its proposals for dealing with the right of prisoners to vote and the provision for postal voting to allow for that.  This provision arises from a decision from the European Court of Human Rights in October 2005, whereby a prisoner in the United Kingdom took a case and the court found in his favour.  This legislation is being introduced on foot of that decision.  I welcome the decision and the right to vote which it gives.  I welcome the provision that this voting be allowed by means of postal voting.  Details on the implementation of the voting and aspects of security will need to be discussed and teased out on Committee Stage but I support this aspect of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Bill deals with a number of other matters of electoral law.  I have drawn the attention of the House to the question of the review of the electoral register.  I have discussed it with local authority officials and with the Minister&rsquo;s officials.  I refer to the current status of the register, the method of that review and what will be the result of the review.  There is a significant difficulty with the current register in the bigger cities but this is not the case in the majority of provincial areas.  In my view, the Minister&rsquo;s actions are a threat to democracy.  The method being used on the instructions of the Minister will ensure that thousands of voters will be wrongly deleted from the electoral register as a result of those instructions.  Local authority officials are concerned and county managers have raised these concerns with the Department and at meetings of the County Managers Association.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister to review his instructions as he is using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.  He has turned the review of the register on its head.  I was a local authority official.  I am aware that until now, the key element in the methods of reviewing the electoral register was that no person was removed from the register unless he or she had died, unless a duplication was clear to the local authority or it was clear to the local authority that the person had moved.  The Minister has turned the situation on its head.  One must either meet a field officer or send in an application in order to be put on the new register.  While I had not heard of the report from South Dublin County Council, referred to by Deputy Gilmore, it is consistent with everything I know and have heard from local authority officials throughout the country in this regard.  The instruction sent by the Minister would prevent local authorities from using their own records in putting people on the register of electors.  For instance, it would prevent local authorities from using their housing rental records to put people on the register of electors, which is insane.</P>

	<P>It is true and if it is not true, the Minister should advise local authorities that they may use their current records regarding rent, service charges etc. to put people on the register of electors because they do not believe they can do so under the instructions issued by the Minister.

	<P>It is not very good to return to it here.  The officials involved need to know what they are entitled to do.  As of now they believe they cannot use those records to put people on the register.  I ask the Minister to extend the time period for the review of the register.  Under the present timescale it is not possible to review the register in the manner the Minister wants and that we all want.  When this matter was raised in the House, the Minister promised that there would be a significant high profile publicity campaign on the review of the register of electors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a campaign.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am serious.  Local authority officials are concerned that the campaign is lacklustre, that there is insufficient focus on the campaign and that the vast majority of the public do not even know the review is taking place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>Unless the instructions the Minister issued are changed, unless he extends the timeframe for the review and unless he puts in a proper campaign, we will end up with a register, which is ten times worse than what we have at the moment.  I plead with the Minister to put the resources into the campaign, to make the changes I have outlined and to ensure we end up with a proper register.  I am not alone in believing that there will be thousands of electors wrongly deleted from the register as a result of this exercise.</P>
        <P>I turn to the preliminary figures of the 2006 census.  The constituencies must be redrawn on the basis of the preliminary census figures, which <Col N="1998"/>will be final figures by next February, well before the general election.  With a number of my Independent colleagues, I will be pursuing the matter to its conclusion, legally if necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party welcomes the Bill.  It is vital that the prison population is facilitated in exercising their most fundamental democratic entitlement.  However, this is just one of the many steps needed to bring Ireland in line with the accepted European human rights norms regarding prisons, prisoners and places of detention.  There is a slight irony that we are simply following the legal precedent established in the UK rather than leading on the issue.  The issue has been festering for many years and repeatedly we have asked the Minister to move forward on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The UK has not acted yet.  It is consulting; we are acting.  It is one of the occasions when we are to the fore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.  However, it took the UK case to move the issue forward here, where the issue was already live and many bodies had been seeking this change for some time.  I compliment the Irish Penal Reform Trust on its initiative in lobbying and pushing the issue forward.  Without its good work our views of the need to reform the Irish penal system would not be so well advanced.</P>
        <P>I worry about the detail of how the franchise will be exercised.  I repeat many of the concerns raised by Deputy Gilmore which have been communicated to us by Rick Lyons of the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  Mr. Lyons clearly states that in its current form the Bill would not have the desired effect of enfranchising the greatest number of Irish citizens in upcoming elections and does not take into account the specific institutional obstacles faced by prisoners.  On Committee Stage the Minister can address the issues concerning place of residence, the documentation necessary to be included on the list and the other details that will ensure that an adequate number of prisoners exercise their democratic right to vote.</P>
        <P>On the mechanics of the process, I worry about the confined system of prisons.  Given the extent of video surveillance in prisons, it is important that prisoners feel they are exercising their franchise in complete secrecy.  Some memorandum should be extended to the Irish Prison Service to ensure that this is the case.  We need ongoing monitoring of how exercising the franchise works out in practice.  For instance can we ensure that prisoners incarcerated in one prison will receive election literature from the candidates running in the D&aacute;il constituency in which they are registered?  In some areas where people have voted at a remove from their local polling station they find that while literature is available it is in a heap on the floor and the onus is on them to sort out what election literature is relevant to them.  That <Col N="1999"/>matter needs to be resolved in the detail of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Allowing the franchise to be exercised is just one small step in facing up to the appalling vista of staff shortages, cutbacks and deplorable conditions in our prisons.  I hope that in addressing this issue, which comes under the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, attention will be drawn to the problems of recidivism, overcrowding, lack of education and training programmes, and lack of psychiatric facilities in the Irish Prison Service.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has used the prison population as the fall guy in an ideological battle between him and the prison officers on overtime reduction.  However, the most vulnerable should not suffer from that ideological debate.</P>
        <P>It is important to safeguard the rights of the most wretched in our society.  The Government should reinstate programmes, such as CONNECT, which have never been afforded the opportunity to make an impact on the lives of prisoners.  The Government must also invest in training and education programmes for prisoners, particularly for young offenders, who deserve the opportunity to equip themselves for life outside prison.</P>
        <P>I note in passing my concern about the closure of Shanganagh Prison, which provided decent facilities for juvenile offenders.  As well as having purpose built extensions and an attached farm, the prison was located close to public transport routes.  What better place to provide decent programmes for young offenders?  Unfortunately, the facility was lost in the rush by Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to build a super-prison in north County Dublin.</P>
        <P>I cannot allow this debate to pass without commenting on the events which transpired this morning in the Netherlands.  I have not yet had the opportunity to find out what was revealed in the press conference at which the deficiencies in that country&rsquo;s electronic voting system were demonstrated.  I am concerned that a single master key could be used to open every electronic voting machine in the country and that the technical information relied upon by the Dutch hackers came from an Irish report on electronic voting.  While I would not describe myself as a Luddite and I believe in using electronic tools where they are the most efficient option, electronic voting should not be pursued unless a verifiable voter audit trail can be produced.  There is little sign of such a trail at present.  The best advice I can give the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is that he should take advantage of the recent reduction in waste electrical and electronic equipment charges to recycle the electronic voting machines.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be a business to business arrangement.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="2000"/>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>He could lead by example and demonstrate that recycling is a good way to deal with electronic equipment which has passed its &ldquo;best by&rdquo; date.  This morning&rsquo;s events in mainland Europe indicate that the time has expired for a system which cost tens of millions of euro.  The Minister should take action on the issue to save on storage costs and he should think in a more considered way about e-voting rather than follow the line taken by his predecessor in terms of rushing to buy the wrong equipment.</P>
        <P>I welcome this Bill and my party will support it.  However, substantial commitments will be required on Committee Stage if the fundamental rights of prisoners are to be honoured in law and in the forthcoming election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin where my colleague, Deputy Cuffe, finished, by welcoming this Bill.  However, it is a shame that a judgment was required against Britain in the European Court of Human Rights before the Government brought the law into line with best international civil rights practice.  It is time the practice of denying prisoners their democratic right to vote in elections was ended and this Bill will attempt to ensure that is done.  However, my party has a number of concerns regarding the implementation of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.</P>
        <P>The right to vote is one of the most fundamental tenets of democracy, yet this Bill as it currently stands will not make it easy for prisoners to exercise that right.  Section 2(1)(<i>c</i>) states that, before a prisoner can be eligible to vote, he or she must provide proof of the ordinary address at which he or she resided before entering prison.  Given that a considerable number of people who have no fixed abode or are homeless in every sense of the word are incarcerated in this State, is it necessary to demand proof of address before allowing them to exercise the right to vote?  People can become homeless for numerous reasons, such as poverty, drug and alcohol misuse or a history of residential care.  It is no coincidence that these are some of the factors which explain why somebody is put in jail because they are a direct result of the consistent failure of Government policies to support these sections of society.</P>
        <P>Have the people in our prisons not been penalised enough by their incarceration?  One is sent to prison as, not for, punishment.  The proposals in this Bill could have the effect of making it more difficult for people to exercise their right to vote.  The fact that a person may not have been in permanent accommodation should not be a deciding factor in allowing them to vote in prison and an experience of homelessness should not be a reason to deprive a prisoner of one of the most basic of civil rights.</P>
        <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides that a prisoner who wishes to be included on the postal voters list must provide documentary evidence of eligibility to the registration authority within a period <Col N="2001"/>of not less than seven days.  That period should be extended to at least 28 days because how can someone who is locked within prison walls for 24 hours per day submit the appropriate documents on time?  Not only is the seven day timeframe wholly unreasonable, it is a ridiculous stipulation to impose on a prisoner.  If this section is intended to verify the identity of a prisoner for the purpose of voting, are we then to presume that the State, which has incarcerated the prisoner in the first place, has doubts as to his or her identity?  The criteria proposed in this section borders on the bizarre.</P>
        <P>Given that the Bill proposes to provide a prisoner with the right to vote, it is reasonable to ask that he or she is facilitated in doing so.  The Bill makes no provision for prisoners to be informed of their right to vote, to get advice on the procedure for registration on the postal voters list or for somebody to assist them in completing registration forms.  That is an oversight, given the poor literacy levels among our prison population.</P>
        <P>In 2005, 85% of committals were for non-violent offences and 39%, or 55% in the case of women, were for three months or less.  Why should they be deprived of their right to vote?  Is the denial of the right to vote to non-violent or petty offenders really proportionate?</P>
        <P>This legislation was not introduced because the State suddenly decided to allow prisoners their rights but because the Government had to act.  This is a civil rights issue and the Government has to acknowledge that the people who occupy our prisons are not lesser beings and that their opinions and right to be represented in this House are just as important as those of anybody else.</P>
        <P>An issue has been brought to my attention by people in many parts of the State with regard to the register of electors.  One instance concerns a person who ordinarily resides and is registered to vote in Milford, County Donegal, and works in Dublin, but is being refused registration by the local authority.  I ask the Minister to investigate this issue because similar cases have arisen elsewhere.</P>
        <P>People have told me that a significant number of local authority representatives have been calling to homes to ensure people are registered.  That has made me a little more positive about the campaign, at least in my constituency.  However, there are still unusual circumstances in some local authorities or a lack of clarity in some cases.  Clarity must be brought to bear as quickly as possible to ensure that all people who are entitled to be included on the register of electors are included.  We have a hard enough job getting people to vote as only approximately 50% do so.  We must ensure that as many as possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I cannot conclude my contribution without referring to electronic voting.  Does the Minister propose to provide electronic voting in prisons?  Has he finally concluded that he will recycle the useless machines purchased by his predecessor?  In future proposals, as well as giving fair play to prisoners, could we also give fair play to taxpayers?  Spending &euro;52 million on these useless machines is extremely unfair to the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>I hope we can get clarity on some of the issues I have raised and I look forward to tabling amendments in respect of the various technical flaws in the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill.  I listened with interest to Deputy Morgan&rsquo;s contribution.  Ireland never prohibited the right of prisoners to vote.  The purpose of the Bill is misunderstood.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not facilitate it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not prohibit it and that is important.  The Deputy is misrepresenting the rights people have enjoyed in this country.  It was ironic and showed the danger the country might be subjected to should Sinn F&eacute;in get into Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;when Deputy Morgan questioned whether proof of address should be required for inclusion on the register of electors.  This should be a basic requirement.  Many people have worried about the state of the electoral register, and did so with good reason.  They have seen people arrive in busloads&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>They were prisoners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and fill single occupancy houses so they can vote for an individual.  Proof of address is a basic minimum requirement for the important duty and responsibility of voting, which should be treated with the dignity it deserves.  I am surprised that Deputy Morgan suggests otherwise.</P>
        <P>The Bill only refers to persons imprisoned in the State.  This imposes a responsibility on us to get people registered.  However, what about Irish citizens held in prisons overseas?  Does the Bill put an obligation on the State to ensure that those people are registered?  Take, for example, a person who goes on holiday to Thailand and finds himself or herself in prison there.  The per<Col N="2003"/>son is ordinarily resident at his or her address here and would presumably be entitled to vote.  However, if the person is incarcerated abroad, is he or she entitled to vote and does this put an onus on the State to ensure the person receives a polling card?  How can this be managed?</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s contribution.  He was worried about undue influence being imposed on prisoners.  It could be said that Members who are keen canvassers bring undue influence to bear on people because we are trying to persuade them to support us.  If people were to canvas in a prison, why should they be different and why should it be assumed that they are trying to bring undue influence to bear?  That raises the issue of access for canvassing in prisons.  Will this be provided?  How will it be done?  Will it be left to individual candidates to decide what they want to do?</P>
        <P>Sections 12 and 13 are somewhat ironic given the political climate over the past two weeks.  These sections relate to the electorate for the Seanad.  With the exception of the university panel, the Seanad electorate comprises, by and large, public representatives who would like to think of themselves as honourable, upstanding people.  This caused me to wonder, given the cloud that has been hanging over the political establishment and political profession over the past two weeks, how to provide for members of the political profession who find themselves incarcerated.  Are we getting to a stage where it is far more likely that we will find people from our political class being incarcerated, with access having to be provided for people who are on the electoral register for the Seanad?  This is significant.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfortunate that it must be considered but that might be a reflection of where politics stands at present.</P>
        <P>Like previous speakers and in view of the report about the electronic voting machines, I will take this opportunity to discuss the machines and what we will do with them.  There will be an election, although we do not know whether it will be sooner or later.  We need to prepare for that election.  We need to make the brave decision, once and for all, that the electronic voting machines will never be used and that we must stop wasting public money on them at the current rate.  It is outrageous.  We need a clear, firm decision from the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>If there were no other reason, it would end the storage costs.  The Government needs to grasp this issue quickly.  Faith in the electronic voting system has fallen apart.  Unquestionably, we will have to continue with the tried and true system.  I find nothing wrong with it.  I have observed and contributed to political life for many years, both as a candidate and as that valued commodity, an election worker.  The drama surrounding the count and voting system and how people finally get elected adds to the interest in politics.  It can be described as a bloodsport but it is a bloodsport we in the profession enjoy, whether one is the victim or just on the sidelines.  It shows how interested Irish people can get in elections.  An instant result with the press of a button would make elections dull.</P>
        <P>However, the purpose of an election is not to add to the excitement of life but to select a government, and to do so accurately.  That is an advantage the electronic system had over our traditional system.  It had the capacity to be 100% accurate in allocating voting transfer preferences.  However, the system we had selected did not allow for this but provided a random selection in the last element.  This was most unfortunate because the best reason for using electronic voting machines was ignored.  We will have to look at this again.  The sooner the Minister makes the decision on the electronic voting system, the better, given what we heard this morning about hackers and electronic voting machines in Holland.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and the fact the Minister has moved quickly to facilitate the voting rights of prisoners in the next election.  My query relates to prisoners imprisoned overseas and the responsibility of the State to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GayMitchell"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I thank my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, who mentioned some of the points I made when I published my Private Members&rsquo; Bill last November.  Following a European Court of Justice ruling, I published a Private Members&rsquo; Bill to give votes to prisoners which was entitled the Electoral (Amendment) (Prisoners&rsquo; Franchise) Bill 2005.  I, therefore, welcome moves by the Government to take on board aspects of my Bill.</P>
        <P>This part of the Bill and my Private Members&rsquo; Bill are not about being soft on criminals.  Fine Gael strongly believes that people have rights and responsibilities.  That is one of the cornerstones of the Christian Democrat Movement in Europe.  People not only have rights but they also have responsibilities.  It is time to stop recycling prisoners as if they were some sort of commodity and creating an environment in which prisoners have rights but no responsibilities, which takes from their dignity.  That was the essential point I wished to make when I published my Bill.</P><Col N="2005"/>
        <P>For the rest of us, one of our public duties is to vote, so we should start the process of prison reform by requiring prisoners to start the process of reintegration into a free society from day one by taking their share of public responsibility and duty.  Including them on the register of electors would allow them to do that.</P>
        <P>I found it extraordinary, when I tabled a parliamentary question earlier this year asking the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the rate of recidivism among prisoners, that the reply I received was that the Department did not know but it had set up a study presumably as a result of my question.  If we do not know the rate of recidivism, how can we take seriously any talk of prisoner reform?  How can we measure the success or failure of reform if we do not have such a basic statistic?</P>
        <P>Some 75% of prisoners in Mountjoy Prison come from five identifiable areas of Dublin.  The House will know that more wealthy suburbs do not appear on this list.  Mr. Justice Kinlen, the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, has repeatedly reported on the dreadful standards in our prisons.  The ministerial task force on drugs, of which I was a member, recommended on my proposal that Mountjoy Prison be closed.  I remember it was greeted with a certain amount of disbelief and derision at the time but it was the ministerial recommendation.  I encountered resistance to that proposal but I am glad that ten years later, it is now a real prospect.</P>
        <P>I wish to make one other comment on prisons.  Do we ever wonder why we now have such a high rate of suicide?  I consider that, in part, it is because of the absence of mercy in society.  That is a contributing factor.  We are all into condemnation and are always condemning others, whether by way of radio programmes, tribunals, courts or parliament.  Condemnation has become the norm and very often that norm is not tempered by mercy.  This is causing a certain hopelessness in society.  We all have our shortcomings; none of us is a saint.  Every one of us depends, to some extent, on people pardoning our shortcomings.  We need to inform ourselves of that in the way we treat prisoners.</P>
        <P>I am not a bleeding heart.  I have no time for criminal activity or bullying which is often what criminal activity amounts to.  However, where a person makes a real effort to reform, we should meet him or her half way and be informed in our approach by the quality of mercy.  We are not here as economists but as politicians.  Many will ask where in the world prisoner reform works.  Almost hopelessly, that question will be thrown out.  We are not elected and paid to merely ask questions.  We are elected and paid to find solutions.  In an Ireland with unprecedented wealth, we should strive to make the Irish prison system an international model for others to follow.  In that regard, extending the right to vote to prisoners is the right thing to do.</P><Col N="2006"/>
        <P>When I published my Bill 11 months ago, some people probably thought I was a little crazy.  I do not believe I will win much support among the electorate for publishing such a Bill.  I certainly do not believe the prison population will queue up to vote for Fine Gael for publishing such a Bill.  Members of this House must not always publish legislation or give the impression that we only take action if there is something in it for us.  That is why I welcome this section of the Bill.  I would have welcomed acceptance of my Private Members&rsquo; Bill but, nonetheless, I welcome this in principle.</P>
        <P>We are not just in the business of doing what is cute or smart.  Our job is to do what is right.  Sometimes we need to cut through the politically correct and the anticipated smart move and simply do what is right.  There is a tendency for people in Irish society to say &ldquo;Sure doesn&rsquo;t everybody know that will not work&rdquo;.  This House should be about debating and critically examining ideas and about leadership.  We should not be fearful of putting forward ideas because somebody in the media is stuck for a story on a slow day and will lash us for it.  So what if he or she does so?  The idea of doing what is right should be to the forefront of our minds.</P>
        <P>As a former councillor and former Lord Mayor of Dublin for a protracted period, I find it extraordinary that the register of electors, primary responsibility for which rested with local authorities, is constantly an issue among public representatives, in particular.  We have all had the experience in the past of standing outside a polling station &mdash; although we cannot do that anymore &mdash; when somebody came up to one and said he or she had voted for the past 20 years but was not on the register of electors.  That has happened left, right and centre.  The improvements made in recent years are welcome in that people can go on the register much later.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>When canvassing in my constituency I came across a house in Walkinstown which had a &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo; sign outside it.  I knocked on the door and the couple inside were from New Zealand and had lived here for a number of years.  Their contracts had expired and they were returning to New Zealand.  They had just voted in a New Zealand general election.  A country on the other side of the world with roughly the same population as ours is able to operate a register of electors to include its own diaspora yet we cannot even properly operate a register of electors which includes people living here.  That is not a criticism directed at the Minister or at anybody in particular.  It is an issue we have raised for years yet we cannot seem to get it right.  This is such an important issue that we should make special efforts to get it right.  It is important that we are as inclusive as possible while ensuring that the tradition of voting early and often is not accommodated by any of the provisions in place.</P><Col N="2007"/>
      
        <P>I broadly welcome the contents of the Bill.  The provisions for people to vote in prisons should be followed up with a study of what we can do to start a process of prison reform so that we can begin to try to reintegrate prisoners into society.  Even if we do not get it right, the fact that we are trying to get it right will speak volumes for us as a decent society.  So what if the begrudgers do not like it?</P>
        <P>The system we have at present of recycling prisoners does nothing for victims, it only creates more victims.  If we want to reduce the number of victims then we must try to reduce the number of people going into prison and coming out to re-offend.  That is one contribution we could make to reducing the number of victims.  I accept that victims do not want to hear that.  There are times when we are all victims and we all know what we would like to do when we come out in the morning and the mirror has been broken off the car yet again.</P>
        <P>In all of our policies the quality of mercy should inform us.  It is time we returned to some of this thinking because the middle ground is becoming very crowded with everyone trying to compete for very small margins.  Some of us are telling a good number of people what they want to hear instead of coming up with new ideas and showing leadership.  That is something about which we should be more concerned as we address these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Deputies who made contributions which were wide-ranging and interesting.  I single out for particular thanks Deputies O&rsquo;Dowd and Gay Mitchell.  I wish to take up the last point made by Deputy Mitchell which was a very good one.  It does appear to me that there is a degree of savagery in the way we do public business and this does us very little credit.  The point he made about mercy and occasionally standing back from cases and saying, there but for the grace of God go I, might have a wider application than just the issue of the Bill itself.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputies O&rsquo;Dowd and Gay Mitchell spoke about the disadvantages of marginalised groups and their participation in normal, civic activities.  I accept this as a principle to which I sign up personally.  The Bill is a modest but worthwhile step in this regard.  I acknowledge that Deputy Gay Mitchell has campaigned in this regard.  I also share both of these Deputies&rsquo; views that it is important to take forward electoral reform on a cross-party, consensual basis.  I wonder therefore at some of the other contributions that were made in the House today but I will not be contentious in that regard.</P>
        <P>The question was specifically raised by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd and a somewhat tangential but not unrelated question was raised by Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s question related to <Col N="2008"/>non-nationals.  The point is that everybody has to be on the register of electors before they can vote.  This applies to non-nationals in exactly the same way as it applies to nationals, EU voters, UK citizens and everybody else in the country.  There is no differentiation here.  It is a prerequisite that a person be ordinarily resident in the State in order to be included in the voting register.  Therefore, any non-national who can establish that he or she is ordinarily resident in the State immediately prior to his or her detention &mdash; in the case of non-nationals who are in detention &mdash; can of course vote in local elections.   I wish to reassure Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd that no change is proposed in that regard.</P>
        <P>Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley queried whether Irish citizens in prisons abroad are entitled to vote.  It is a somewhat surprising question because I would have thought, particularly by reference to the closing comments of Deputy Gay Mitchell, that the definition of prison in section 1 of the Bill is confined to prisoners in the State.  The rest of the Bill adheres to this definition.  Postal voting has been provided for prisoners in this country only.  It is not a global extension.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd referred to canvassing in prisons.  It is a colourful thought to which I have not given much personal consideration.  I think he would acknowledge that it would not be appropriate to make a provision in the Bill for the issue of canvassing in prison, although we will give some thought to the issue of how information gets through to prisoners.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore asked a most serious question as to whether the Prison Service could protect the integrity and the secrecy of prisoners&rsquo; votes.  I would hope the answer to that question would be &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  He also asked if a prisoner could be subject to improper pressure to vote in a specific way.  It would be the responsibility of the Prison Service to ensure that no improper pressure is brought to bear on a prisoner who is exercising his or her right to franchise.  Certainly, that is the case in all other institutions in which people may find themselves resident.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore also raised a number of technical but important issues.  He specifically related this to the work of the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  I will reflect on the issues he raised and I look forward to the necessary detailed discussion on Committee Stage.  A couple of points he made are certainly ones which require further consideration.  I may make arrangements for my staff to contact the trust on the issue.</P>
        <P>A number of Deputies made specific points on the electoral register.  It is a bit choice at this stage for Deputies to try to have it both ways.  Earlier this year there was something approaching hysteria on the matter of the electoral register and Deputies and the media pointed out &mdash; correctly in my view &mdash; that the register was in a mess.  Deputy Gay Mitchell asked why it is in such a mess.  It is a good question because local authorities have a statutory responsibility to keep the <Col N="2009"/>register up to date.  I believe the criticism which was made about the register earlier this year is correct.  There is of the order of 300,000 people&rsquo;s names on the register which should not be on it and there are many hundreds of thousands of people who should be on the register who are not on it.  In this day and age, this is not appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GayMitchell"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It also affects the perception of the turnout.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  I agree with the Deputy.  We have this nonsensical figure.  It is the case that if 100,000 people are on the register and 50,000 people vote, <i>ipso facto</i>, the turnout is only 50%.  If the register is only 80% correct, it is five eighths of people who voted so the calculation of the turnout would be rather different.</P>
        <P>The more important point is the efficacy of the register and whether it provides a basis for a proper, democratic election or, as Deputy Gay Mitchell asked at the end of his contribution, if it provides the wherewithal that people can fraudulently present themselves to vote.  That is a big concern which we should all share.  It does not matter on which side of the House we are, we should all be very concerned about that.</P>
        <P>I put an unprecedented amount of money into the upgrading of the voting register this year.  The only appropriate way to compile the voting register is to do it in the same way as the census is done &mdash; to make sure that every household is visited.  I was amazed, therefore, at the contribution of Deputy Hayes, who suggested that somehow or other we should pedal back on this process.  The criticism which was rightly made earlier this year was that sufficient resources had not been put into the register.  The specific criticism that was made, which was a valid one for which we all have to accept some responsibility, was that no effort had been made to edit the register &mdash; in other words, people appeared on three or four different registers and no effort was made to take them off.  Likewise, no effort was made to take off people who had died.</P>
        <P>What is under way at the moment is, effectively, a door to door call on every household in the State, not once, not twice but three times.  Deputy Hayes asked why we do not have a media campaign under way.  He clearly leads a very sheltered life.  I have seen the advertisements on television.  They have been focused in particular at the youth end of the spectrum.  The advertisements are also being run in the print media.  I think they are very effective.  If the Deputy does not watch television or read newspapers there is very little more I can do about that but the point is that a genuine effort has been made.</P>
        <P>More than twice the resources have been put into this area this year as compared to other years.  That is why I have provided a fund of up to &euro;6 million to assist local authorities in this regard.  All councils have been given the right to engage additional staff, including additional back<Col N="2010"/>room staff, for the process.  Deputy Hayes also made an interesting point in regard to his local authority area.  He stated that staff were prohibited from using common sense or information in the council&rsquo;s possession.  I hope people would use common sense.  If the council knows a house is occupied, I expect it to pay the house the requisite number of visits, put the notices in and ensure the people living there know what is happening.</P>
        <P>Deputies Fiona O&rsquo;Malley, Gay Mitchell and Gilmore made the point that local authorities have a legal responsibility to ensure that the voting register is compiled.  I am giving them more resources, which I expect to be used prudently.  It was suggested that we extend the deadline for voter registration, but I am unsure as to whether that would be a wise move.  The deadline is set and we should stick to it.  I do not see the point in its extension.  If local authorities have not done their jobs, I want to know why.  They have had adequate notice, circulars and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister found it difficult to get people to do what he wanted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what they tell me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That comment is interesting and I take it that the Deputy is correct, but I notified every county manager and county registrar early this year that they should and could recruit the census staff for this purpose.  The manager and registrar were not confined to those staff if they were unavailable.  I will not accept any local authority arguing conveniently that it did not have enough resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>The project is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is right.  We have a responsibility and it is not a politically contentious issue.  The political classes will have a right and responsibility to check the register when it is published because there will be deletions.  The register is awash with inaccurate information and must be corrected.  Both of the Deputies present have been positive and constructive, but it is not right for one or two Deputies to suggest that this is a bad or anti-democratic exercise.  It is an untrue claim and will be dealt with on the day.</P>
        <P>If any Deputy feels that there are inadequate resources in his or her area, I would welcome being told so that I can contact the electoral authorities.  I have done so in a number of cases.  I travelled around the country and told county managers in particular that I wanted this job done.  I do not want any Deputy to tell me in November that a big chunk of this or that constituency has not been done.  I will not take an excuse for not doing the job.  I have provided resources, the campaign is under way and local authorities have long since been notified.  We all <Col N="2011"/>know what must be done and I expect a modicum of common sense.</P>
        <P>A Deputy on the opposite side raised the issue of students.  The traditional arrangements for denominating where students are registered will continue to apply and no one should feel forced to register somewhere.  Like all Deputies, I want to ensure that no one is registered two, three or four times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fair comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In an interesting contribution, Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley made the point that the purpose of elections is to elect, not amuse, but she undermined her contribution by suggesting that we should look for a dramatic electoral system.  I like high opera, but the purpose of elections is to elect, not amuse.  This relates to the matter of electronic voting, which was raised by a number of Deputies as a fair point.  I was asked to clarify whether I intend to use the machines in 2007.  I have said several times and will do so again that it is not my purpose to use the machines.  There is nobody so deaf as those who are not here.  We all know that the machines can be interfered with by dismantling their backs.  Notwithstanding the press conference in the Netherlands, this is not news.  Security is clearly an issue and was mentioned in the second report of the commission.  It must be taken into account.</P>
        <P>As I said previously, I have issued instructions for the voting machines to be taken to a central location and do not intend to use them in the 2007 election.  We have established a commission that has made specific findings, the applicability of which we should examine.  While Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd has read the second report, it is not bedtime reading, but anyone who reads it will see that the machines can be modified with relatively small and low cost adjustments.  Given the report and what has been spent, a decision to recycle the machines would be an act of political irresponsibility and taxpayers would rightly ask why we behaved in that way.</P>
        <P>Two Deputies referred to the current electoral registration process.  If a house is visited three times and two notices are put through the door &mdash; I have seen staff delivering voter registration forms in a number of constituencies &mdash; voters have some responsibility to register.</P>

	<P>In the past week or two, documentation handed to a tribunal by the Taoiseach has apparently gone.  We do not know the leak&rsquo;s source, but neither the Government nor anyone here blames the tribunal.  However, the documentation left the source in which it was deposited and appeared in a newspaper office.  This is a serious matter.</P>

	<P>A box can be ticked to prevent that happening.  Specific guidance has gone out.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore and another speaker touched on the issue of the constituency revision.  Any party that has been in government in the past 20 years knows the position.  The Attorney General advised the Government that constituencies can only be revised on the basis of final census figures.  This is not new advice as it is in accordance with the advice of previous Attorneys General.  Constitutionally, the preliminary figures cannot be used to revise the constituencies.  We have not only advice in this respect, there is also case law.</P>
        <P>The Electoral Act 1997 provides that a constituency commission should be established upon the publication of the census report, which is the final report on the census.  As Minister, I do not have the right to put to one side the constitutional reality I face.  I intend to establish the commission when the census report containing the final figures is published.  There will be no delay in appointing the commission.  The good electoral legislation on which this reality is based was introduced by Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s party colleague.  He knows from the advice given to his colleague that the suggestion that I could do something unconstitutional is mendacious and disingenuous.  The advice given to me is not different from previous legal advice and it is not possible to do as Deputy Gilmore has suggested.</P>
        <P>My ministerial function in the context of these procedures is to establish a constituency commission to review and report on the D&aacute;il election in accordance with the relevant constitutional and statutory requirements.  I will discharge that statutory duty to the letter and spirit.  As soon as the relevant CSO census report is published, I will establish the constituency commission as the <Col N="2013"/>legislation provides.  Under the Electoral Act 1997, the commission will be required to report to the Ceann Comhairle, not to the Minister, within a period of six months of its establishment.  The report shall then be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and any necessary changes made.  That is a process of which everybody in this House is aware and which is established in statute.  The previous process and any ambiguities in it were dealt with in the Electoral Act 1997.  There has been much deliberate muddying of the water about this issue.  The reality is that it does not matter who stands here as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  We cannot decide to take a pick and mix attitude towards the Constitution.</P>
        <P>This has been a positive debate.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, who was outside the Chamber momentarily, made a good point to which I want to refer while he is here.  I believe that cross-party consensus is necessary for electoral change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It is essential.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd in that regard.  I have said that several times and I want to say it here in his presence.  I am grateful that it has always been the approach he has adopted in this area.  I have also acknowledged Deputy Gay Mitchell&rsquo;s previous interest in this and the fact that we are making a modest, but welcome, change and we are doing so with consensus.</P>
        <P>In the longer term, we must evolve a better way of doing things.  I have already indicated my personal views on issues like, for example, an electoral commission.  With regard to all of that, my responsibility at present on the voting register is to get it right and I have issued the necessary resources and instructions.  If any Member of the House feels that the work is not being done, I would greatly appreciate hearing from him or her.  I will deal with it in confidence or if the Deputy wants to be acknowledged, I will deal with it in that way.  It is important that we do that work.</P>
        <P>I am grateful for the debate.  I will listen, in particular, to the points made about rights of prisoners.  I will suggest to my staff that we make contact with the relevant NGO to see what, if any, improvements can be made because this is a consensus issue on which we can move forward.  I am grateful for the contributions in the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to inform the House that Comhairle na Tuaithe has completed its work on the development of a national countryside recreation strategy.  Its report was presented to me in September.</P>
        <P>Comhairle na Tuaithe comprises representatives of State bodies with an interest in the countryside, the farming organisations and recreational users of the countryside and is chaired by my Department.  Comhairle na Tuaithe&rsquo;s strategy defines the scope and vision for countryside recreation and it sets out the broad principles under which it recommends that sustainable countryside recreation can be managed into the future.  The members of Comhairle na Tuaithe, with the exception of the Irish Farmers Association, have endorsed the report.</P>
        <P>Comhairle na Tuaithe&rsquo;s vision encompasses a countryside which welcomes all visitors who practise responsible use of the resource and where the rights and responsibilities of both landowners and recreational users are respected.  The report sets out the broad principles under which it recommends that sustainable countryside recreation can be managed into the future.  It also sets out the tasks which Comhairle na Tuaithe recommends should be undertaken to achieve this vision and recommends the actions needed to be taken and by which bodies.</P>
        <P>I welcome the report and wish to put on record my thanks to the members of Comhairle na Tuaithe for all their hard work and dedication in coming to this agreement.  I will study the recommended strategy and will consult as appropriate with other Departments and public bodies on the wider recommendations in the report.</P>
        <P>Comhairle na Tuaithe has raised a number of legal issues to be addressed and I am concerned <Col N="2015"/>to ensure that these matters are addressed as a matter of priority.  To expedite matters, I intend to establish an expert group, comprising a senior counsel and officials from the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and from my Department, to urgently advise on tackling each of the legal issues raised.</P>
        <P>I also intend taking a number of immediate actions arising from my initial consideration of the report.  I will make &euro;1.5 million funding available for capital work under the rural social scheme and I will ask implementing bodies, which are in most cases Leader companies, to give particular priority to walkways and ancillary services.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland has already identified a selection of looped walks which it has publicised in its brochure, Walking Ireland, and on its website.  My Department, in consultation with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Comhar Leader na  h&Eacute;ireann and the national waymarked ways advisory committee, is identifying further looped walks and waymarked ways for development.  Details will be made available over the coming weeks and months of the work required to bring these up to the best international standards.  It is my intention to set aside a further  &euro;1.5 million for this purpose.</P>
    
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>The rural development package 2007-2013 means a trebling of EU and national funding for rural development under a Leader-type programme.  Three of my priorities under this programme will be the development of recreational tourism, including the development of facilities for walking, cycling, angling, pony trekking, bird watching etc, and ancillary facilities, such as car parking and other services such as signage, village renewal etc; the complementary development of the broader rural tourism package, such as upgraded accommodation, food tourism and other services; and the development of small or regional food sectors to add significantly to the unique experience for our visitors.</P>
        <P>I have reached agreement with F&aacute;ilte Ireland for the employment of up to ten walk managers under the community services programme to promote walking tourism in areas where there are clusters of suitable and accessible walks.</P>
        <P>I consider a localised community-based approach is the way forward where countryside recreation and issues relating to access to the countryside for this purposes arise.  I believe that the majority of people in rural areas see the benefit of these local solutions brought about by working in partnership together.  Where it is not possible to reach agreement in a particular area, alternative routes should be explored and developed.</P>
  </Speaker><Col N="2016"/>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I welcome the funding that has been allocated and I acknowledge his commitment to finding a solution to this issue.  I believe he genuinely wants to solve this problem.</P>
        <P>Comhairle na Tuaithe is to be commended for its report.  However, another group has been set up and I question whether we are back to square one and still stuck on the main issue.  How long will it take to solve that problem?  When does the Minister expect the expert group to report?  Has he set a timeframe?</P>
        <P>I acknowledge much work has been done and new walkways have been opened up, which are working well in some places.  The Oldcastle development committee has developed some nice walks and many other groups are also doing so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, a fundamental problem exists.  The Minister stated he does not agree with compensating farmers and I understand his view.  Other organisations, such as the Irish Farmers Association, do not represent everybody but they are digging in their heels and saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to access to land.  There is still a principal problem, regardless of all the improvements and other bits and pieces which are going well and being sorted out.  What are the Minister&rsquo;s views on a solution to provide some form of compensation or way of easing the pain and burden on landowners or farmers?</P>
        <P>I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s view of a scheme which is used in foreign countries, a ski pass for those skiing in an area for a week or two.  The pass is paid for by the skiers and allows them access to all the ski routes for that week.  The revenue collected is used to administer the scheme and to pay compensation to landowners.  A walker or tourist could be given a pass for a set period of time in a specified area.  The money collected would provide a fund to develop the walks, cover insurance costs and to compensate farmers.  This would provide an incentive to the community to promote their area as a walking area.  More walkers would mean more money from the sale of passes which would benefit the community and contribute to the development of an area.  Farmers and landowners will want to have walkers on their land because it will be worth their while both economically and socially.  Could this scheme provide a solution?  There must be some means of offering encouragement through incentives.  I agree with the Minister that people have a right to walk on the land.  However, regardless of all the good being achieved, we must find a solution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify that the legal issues were raised by the ICMSA and by Keep Ireland Open.  They were agreeable to the proposition that these would be examined by either the Attorney General or the Law Reform Commission.  An expert group involving the various offices is regarded as the best method.  The IFA did not raise legal issues.  I note there is no funda<Col N="2017"/>mental difference between my position and that of the IFA which has conceded it is looking for maintenance money.</P>
        <P>I am not a member of Comhairle na Tuaithe but my officials are members.  I understand the IFA wanted its specific proposal to be accepted by Comhairle na Tuaithe, that maintenance money would be paid by rote, irrespective of whether a farmer had a lot or a little maintenance on his land.  This is not a good way of proceeding for a number of reasons.  My door is open to discussion and negotiation.  The IFA is no longer looking for money for access because it accepted since it published a document that it is not a tenable argument.</P>
        <P>The suggestion made by the Deputy is that anybody on their own private land can charge for access and earn more if they allow more people on the land.  I agree that private landowners can do so.  However, what was in question was the idea of the State paying for access and I said this would not happen.  This was taken on board by the IFA and it published a document.  It suggested a payment of maintenance by rote.  I am not keen to go down that route for a number of reasons.</P>
        <P>I have fully accepted the principle that farmers should not have to expend any of their money in maintaining a walkway if they are not receiving a direct benefit.  The State or somebody else, but probably the State through the rural social scheme, should bear the full cost of maintenance.</P>
        <P>The issue is that if the land of 80 farmers is on a walkway &mdash; my view is that each one should maintain their own land &mdash; the first practical issue is that many of them might not be capable of maintaining their own land, as in the case of 80 or 85-year-old farmers in hilly areas.  The second issue is why should everybody be given the same when the work might be very different?  The third issue is that if each one does their own, there may be a way of supervising&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We must proceed with the next question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister and I are in agreement.  I suggest that the pass would provide a fund which could be distributed and used to employ people to maintain the routes or given to farmers who put in a given number of hours&rsquo; work on the routes.  There could be a way of administering it with no charge on the State.  However, the State should encourage and facilitate it.  This might increase our tourism numbers, which are considerably reduced for hill walkers. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to move on to the second question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on the same wavelength in this regard and let us give it a push.  Rather than waiting for them to approach the Minister, let us suggest some initiatives.</P>

	<P>Last Friday I had a very constructive meeting with representatives of the South Kerry Partnership who had some very good ideas.  All the time we are trying to move forward.  We are not wedded to the belief that this is the only proposal.  We are considering creative ways to address the issues.  However, from a psychological point of view I am not keen on charging people to climb mountains etc. because we would lose more than we would gain for tourism.  I do not mind us investing in it and getting an indirect return as we invest in national parks.  I agree with 90% of the IFA paper.  However, the proposal for a standard payment per metre would create problems.  The obvious one is very simple.  If I start paying on 50 walks per metre, the people living around Carrauntuohill, Croagh Patrick and the Sugar Loaf in County Wicklow, all of which attract many climbers, would claim they need to maintain their&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; in the US national parks nobody minds paying a fee of $100 to get access to all areas.  I do not see what is wrong with the principle of charging for hill walking if it is done at a fair price.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>While I will consider it, I must point out the number of walking tourists increased dramatically in 2005.  It had reduced but increased again in 2005.</P>

        <Quest> if he is satisfied that the proper rules and procedures have been followed in all appointments made and contracts granted by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta since he came to office; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is a non-commercial State body which comes under the aegis of my Department and is governed by the legislative provisions of the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta Acts 1979 to 1999, in addition to national and European regulations and guidelines, including the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  Accordingly, while my Department holds responsibility for the body in regard to corporate governance matters, it has no function in the micro-management of its day-to-day administration.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, Exchequer funding is provided to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta annually through my Department&rsquo;s Vote and, as part of the formal notification process, my Department sets out appropriate guidelines and conditions in regard to the various programmes of expenditure <Col N="2019"/>with a view to ensuring good practice for both the body and the various stakeholders.  The expenditure programmes and processes are, of course, subject to formal scrutiny and audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>In fulfilment of its statutory obligations, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta publishes its report and accounts annually and these are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In addition, arising from the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, the chairman provides a report each year to me in my role as Minister in regard to the performance and compliance of the body in the particular year.  As part of this report, the chairman is required to confirm that all appropriate procedures for financial reporting, internal audit, procurement and disposal of assets are being carried out by the body and that the codes of business conduct for directors and employees, the guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals and the code of practice generally have been adhered to.  An internal audit function is also in place in the body.</P>
        <P>Moreover, as a result of particular issues which came to light during my tenure as Minister &mdash; I cite for instance, the sale of holiday homes in Eanach Mhe&aacute;in and payment of a grant to a company outside the Gaeltacht boundary, both of which have already been debated extensively in this House &mdash; I can say that procurement practices and processes have been improved to ensure good practice.  For example, following scrutiny of the procedures adopted in the case of disposal of assets in Eanach Mhe&aacute;in, my Department acted to highlight the need for board decisions and the underlying processes to be fair and transparent both in legal and administrative terms.  I can also confirm that, in accordance with its governance role, my officials hold meetings with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s executives on a regular basis to monitor and review progress and to discuss relevant issues.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the foregoing I am satisfied as to the general arrangements in place for the award of contracts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>When one cuts through the waffle, I take it from the Minister&rsquo;s answer that he is not aware of any irregularities in appointments or awarding contracts.  I understand the Minister was present at the announcement of the task force for the Donegal Gaeltacht on 16 December 2002.  Is he aware that the post of ard-bainisteoir, the person appointed by the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s to the task force, was appointed without the post being advertised or a competition taking place?  Is he aware of concerns of the AMICUS trade union regarding this appointment?  Regarding the appointment of a permanent ard-bainisteoir to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta on 8 December 2005, is he aware of a relationship between the successful applicant and any of the interviewers?</P>

It is a matter for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s to follow its procedures.  If the Deputy has specific allegations he should give me details and I will check them out.  If anybody comes to me with an allegation, I will have it checked.  It would not be the first time an allegation was made.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund was established by Government in 1998 to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  The objective of the fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people into these facilities and divert them away from substance misuse.  The fund currently covers the 14 local drug task force areas in Dublin, Bray and Cork, as well as projects in Limerick, Waterford, Carlow and Galway.  The possibility of expanding the number of urban areas which are eligible for funding from the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund may be considered in the coming period.  Any decision in that regard would be based on evidence of a significant drug problem in a particular centre or the potential for a drug problem to develop.  In that regard, I have recently received a paper from the national drugs strategy team, prepared under action 85 of the national drugs strategy, which identifies the urban areas of greatest need based on treatment numbers, seizures of heroin and cocaine and a number of indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage.  Clonmel is not identified as a priority in this paper.   </P>
        <P Just="Left">The ten regional drugs task forces, including the south-eastern regional drugs task force which <Col N="2022"/>covers the Clonmel area, are now implementing the actions plans for their regions and a sum of &euro;5 million has been allocated this year in that regard.  Opportunities for funding projects in Clonmel may arise in this context, given that the south-eastern regional drugs task force allocation is approximately &euro;900,000 for 2006.  The Deputy may also be aware that a portion of the allocations from the dormant accounts scheme in 2006 is ring-fenced for RAPID areas such as Clonmel.  In this regard, I am pleased to advise that an allocation of &euro;180,000 to Clonmel Community Partnership was approved in July.  This provision will pay for the refurbishment of a community facility, staffing for two youth workers, and activities and developmental programmes for young people in the Clonmel area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply because it indicates that the fund will not be made available to Clonmel.  Does the series of drug-related murders which took place in the town over the past few years not represent evidence of a drug problem?  A youth task force based in the town, Clann &Oacute;g, sent a request to the Minister for additional youth workers and reported that Clonmel is seriously under-resourced with regard to youth workers and facilities.  Is prevention not better than cure and is it not preferable to provide services and facilities at an early stage so as to nip problems in the bud?  Far more resources and funding will be required if these problems have to be addressed at a later stage.  The request from Clann &Oacute;g for five additional youth workers is evidence of the need to make funds available to Clonmel.  Does the Minister of State not agree on the necessity of funding programmes such as a springboard family project, a neighbourhood youth programme for Elm Park and youth services for the RAPID areas of the town?  I urge him to reconsider the issue with a view to providing funds and additional youth workers to Clonmel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>While I acknowledge the Deputy&rsquo;s comments, it would be misleading to give the impression that Clonmel or the south east has not been well resourced simply because the young people&rsquo;s fund covers the 14 local drugs task forces.  Several years ago, four additional provincial centres, namely Limerick, Waterford, Carlow and Galway, two of which are in the south east, were selected for funding for current services.  In the past couple of months, Carlow, Waterford and Limerick were the first areas outside the original 14 to receive funding for capital projects.  The south east has done extremely well and Clonmel has benefited from the dormant accounts scheme, which allocated &euro;300,000 to urban areas and &euro;200,000 to smaller towns.  The Clonmel Community Partnership received &euro;180,000 to cover the cost of two youth workers, as well as funding for other projects.  In the past <Col N="2023"/>few years, Clonmel has also received a significant grant for a swimming pool.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science provides the majority of funding for youth workers, whereas the young people&rsquo;s fund from my Department specifically covers at-risk youths.  The independent report of the drugs strategy team referred in particular to Leinster towns such as Arklow, Portlaoise and Athlone and did not identify Clonmel as a priority.  I had no part in the authorship of the report and, as far as I am aware, it based its findings on treatment, drug seizures and socioeconomic data.  I will ask the team whether murders were also considered.  A representative of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was on the team and all relevant data should have been considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>The report by Clann &Oacute;g stated that Clonmel is under-resourced with regard to the number of youth workers in the town delivering youth programmes, a deficiency which precluded the development of important initiatives which could have enhanced social inclusion.  Clonmel has not been granted funding for facilities and services for young people or for the springboard project and has not received adequate funding for projects under the drugs task force fund in 2005.  I ask the Minister of State to read the Clann &Oacute;g report and to put Clonmel on the map for the youth services fund and additional youth resource workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Education and Science provides the bulk of the funds for youth workers.  My Department has funded youth workers in Clonmel under the dormant accounts scheme and the RAPID programme.  I do not know whether these workers are in place.  We are considering an expansion of the young people&rsquo;s fund but I do not want to give the Deputy false hopes because, based on the report I have received, Clonmel is not in the running.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The RAPID programme aims to ensure priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the 45 designated RAPID areas.  In addition, RAPID priority status was recently extended to Ballyfermot.  My Department, with the support of Pobal, has overall responsibility for the co-ordination of the RAPID programme.  As I indicated in my response to Question No. 41 of 14 June 2006, it is a matter for each Department to respond to the recommendations in the report in respect of their specific areas of responsibility.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is important to note the report indicates that, in general, the experience of the RAPID programme has been positive.  The report found that the programme has made substantial progress in identifying the needs of disadvantaged communities and in implementing important local projects in response to locally identified needs.  A number of weaknesses in the delivery of the programme were identified, pertaining to strategic planning, limited implementation of the programme in a small number of areas, the interaction of some State agencies in some areas and difficulties in identifying sources of funding for some projects.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The report recommends enhanced monitoring structures, the adoption of annual work programmes and improved corporate and business planning in agencies to prioritise RAPID areas for investment.  I have initiated a process to implement these recommendations.  My aim is to address the identified weaknesses by working with the various stakeholders at national and local level.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister went through the faults of the report, so I will not have to list them, and the changes that need to be made.  There is a lack of focus in a few RAPID areas and that is addressed in the report.  It might help to have a person in each of the various bodies that are dealing with the RAPID co-ordinator assigned to RAPID.  It is hard to get things moving at a fast pace, so there should be one person in the council who deals with the RAPID co-ordinator and reverts back to the council staff.  Fingal County Council is starting that initiative in a few areas of its business so we should consider <Col N="2025"/>the same option for RAPID.  There should be one person in the health board, the Garda, the council and so forth in charge of bringing back the message.</P>
        <P>In some areas the priorities we and the co-ordinator have for RAPID are not always a top priority for the residents of those areas.  Sometimes RAPID is more involved in social capital, for example, providing a community magazine or newspaper, rather than providing for people in the area who do not have central heating, whose houses have damaged windows or where there is a litter problem.  The priority does not seem to be getting the area in shape first and then doing the additional, nice things.</P>
        <P>Many of the RAPID areas are older council estates and the houses are now worth a great deal of money.  People who try to buy their houses are hit with the market price, minus a percentage for the number of years they have been renting the house.  They cannot afford to buy them.  The council, therefore, is left with hundreds of houses that must be maintained but it cannot afford to maintain them to a high standard.  If we relaxed the conditions for certain age groups in the RAPID areas, people could buy their houses.  Money raised from the sales could go into the council fund to repair the other houses or to bring the area up to a certain standard.</P>
        <P>The people I have in mind are generally older people who want to provide for their future but they do not own an asset.  If they try to buy their house, they will be caught by the conditions.  Perhaps there is room within RAPID to consider an initiative to help them.  It might also help the area by generating money and by giving people more responsibility.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to including the Ballyfermot area when the RAPID boundary was extended.  What are the procedures in other towns and counties for the extension of RAPID?  In some places there are estates located side by side and only one of them might be in RAPID.  The boundaries were well drafted but there are a few areas where they could be moved slightly to make it more effective.  Will the Minister explain the procedures for doing that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s first question is valid but nobody has an answer to it.  No matter what structure one puts in place, it is dependent on people.  Some people are good and some are not so good.  There is no logical reason for Kerry winning so many All-Ireland titles.  The people are no taller, stronger or smarter than the rest of the country, although they think they are.  There is something in the people and in the culture to make them succeed in Gaelic football.</P>
        <P>The same issue arises here.  We cannot create a system or structure that guarantees that everybody within that system or structure works efficiently.  To a certain extent we must turn that into a strength, in other words, make it more competitive.  The areas that get ahead will get <Col N="2026"/>more and the areas that do not could be shown up, which is the best way to get them going.  A major finding in the report is that some areas are getting ahead while some are not.</P>
        <P>The second issue is agencies.  I am taking two approaches to that.  One of the dividends of the cohesion process is fewer bodies in every county.  I hope, therefore, that we will make fewer demands on bodies such as F&Aacute;S, the VECs and so forth to have to run from body to body.  As a consequence, I hope they will be able to send more senior people to the few bodies that will remain.  In County Meath, for example, there will be one Leader partnership for the county.  Instead of four or five agencies, we will now only require one person to go to one meeting per month.  That makes sense.  However, the <i>quid pro quo</i> must be that it is somebody more senior who has more clout in the subdivisions within their own organisation to make things happen.  There is a methodology behind what we are doing.  People from the agencies must take responsibility.</P>
        <P>I sometimes wonder if the second issue could apply to the House.  Some of the debates that get headlines in the newspapers do not relate to what people come to me about, which is always houses, roads, social welfare and other practical matters.  I am driven by the practical issues that affect people.  Obviously, there are very poor housing estates.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, in his capacity as Minister of State in another Department must carry out the big refurbishment of those estates.</P>
        <P>With regard to smaller works, there is huge demand for the cleaning of estates, fixing boarded-up houses and getting them back into the market.  There was a meeting of the national monitoring committee today at which we considered how we could do more for estates with the enhancement scheme.  One of the frightening things is that we cannot spend the money.  Amazingly, many of the people involved in estate enhancement have not yet spent the 2005 money, let alone the 2006 money.</P>
        <P>To give them a better opportunity to plan we said we would provide the 2006 and 2007 money together.  I was hopeful that some might spend the two years&rsquo; money in 2006.  In fact, the opposite is happening; the tendency is for them to spend the two years&rsquo; money in 2007.  It is an amazing world.  People, particularly local authorities, keep telling us they have no money but when we provide it we cannot get the work done.  There are issues in that regard and today we discussed ways of rewarding those who get up and going and penalising those who sit on their butts and do not deliver after all the talk.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked a valid question about extending the RAPID areas.  The Ballyfermot area was separate so I will deal with that first.  When the initial analysis was conducted, Ballyfermot qualified.  What disqualified Ballyfermot was the fact it had been given a European programme called URBAN.  Somebody made what I <Col N="2027"/>consider a wrong decision, that if an area is given the URBAN programme and qualifies for RAPID in every respect, it cannot participate in RAPID as well, even if it is the most deprived area in the country.  It was a long process to get it right but Ballyfermot should have been in it on the first occasion.  That is the reason it is included now.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct that there are areas adjacent to existing RAPID areas that have a good case for inclusion.  There might be new housing estates which did not exist when we started.  RAPID is different from CL&Aacute;R.  CL&Aacute;R is about leverage funds so all I need do is double the funds and double the area.  It is quite simple.  However, as RAPID involves prioritisation of mainstream funding across all Departments, if I double the areas I will dilute prioritisation by half.  That is the challenge.  If I ever get around to looking at extensions and adjustment of borders on the basis of new statistics, it will be in the 5% to 10% bracket.  It will not be a doubling like CL&Aacute;R.  If I doubled it, I would undermine the basis of the programme, which is prioritisation.  It is not analogous to CL&Aacute;R, which is 90% about leverage funds.  All I did in that programme was double the funds and double the areas.</P>
        <P>Was there another question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about people buying their houses and whether there is any hope for them.  I do not expect a full answer today as it is a new topic I have raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy made a fair point.  The Minister of State and I have discussed that issue.  A valid argument can certainly be made because the more people who own their houses, the better.  However, there is a snag.  I have been a great proponent of people owning their houses from the day I was elected to this House but I have been told that, in certain cases, when people bought the houses, particularly in towns with third level institutions, within ten years all those houses were let.  This gave rise to a new type of dereliction, with landlords letting the houses to students, migrant workers and so forth.  The houses in the estates were not cared for.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister is thinking about it.  He will get support from this end.  We can invent new clauses to prevent problems arising.  RAPID was to correct problems of the past, such as bad planning, bad housing and so on.  Can we learn from the RAPID report and the work of RAPID to prevent this happening again in other areas?  Whose job is that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy looks at even the physical design of new estates, he will see it is much different.  The second issue is providing the facilities as well as building the houses.</P>

	<P>Shortly after 8 a.m. Ryanair advised that it had acquired over 16% of the issued share capital of Aer Lingus and announced its intention to make an all cash offer of &euro;2.80 per share for the issued share capital of Aer Lingus not already in the ownership of Ryanair.  This announcement by Ryanair was made without any forewarning.  I was made aware of the announcement by the chairman of Aer Lingus and in a phone call from the chief executive of Ryanair at roughly the same time as the announcement was made to the public.</P>
        <P>From the outset in regard to the Aer Lingus IPO the Government has been committed to ensuring that our strategic interests are protected.  It was always the intention to maintain a significant minority shareholding for this purpose and <Col N="2030"/>that remains the position.  The State&rsquo;s shareholding is about 28.3%.  Aer Lingus, as a result of the IPO, now has the means at its disposal to fulfil its potential and contribute in a positive way to the country&rsquo;s economic development.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s strategic interest in aviation is best served by the provision of regular, safe, cost-effective and competitive air services linking the country to key business and tourism markets around the world, and that remains the case.  The Government  remains fully committed to competition in aviation markets.</P>
        <P>On the basis of the information available to date I do not consider that the Government&rsquo;s strategic objectives would be well served by a take-over of Aer Lingus by Ryanair.  It clearly raises fundamental questions in regard to aviation policy, competition and regulation issues and all these questions will have to be examined carefully.</P>
        <P>It is in the first instance a matter for the board of directors of the company to evaluate any Ryanair offer and to express an opinion to shareholders.  It is also the case that any proposal of this kind would require regulatory clearance from a competition perspective and it remains to be clarified as to how this would handled by the appropriate competition authorities.</P>
        <P>The deputy chief executive of Ryanair has indicated that it will post the formal offer document in two weeks which will set out further details of the offer.  I am consulting advisers and will evaluate all the strategic and policy issues arising.  Until these matters have been examined further I cannot give any further information on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Throughout the debate on the privatisation of Aer Lingus over the past two years, the Labour Party opposed this proposal from the start and suggested that we could find ourselves in precisely the situation in which we find ourselves today.  The Minister denied the possibility of that happening.  A month ago there were two very strong airlines serving this country, a privately owned airline and a publicly owned one.  We now face the prospect of a privately owned monopoly controlling the vast bulk of airline services in and out of this country.  We know from this afternoon&rsquo;s news that Ryanair has approximately 25% and it is rising.  Irrespective of any talk about golden shares, controlling shares or anything like that, is it not the reality that if Ryanair gets 51% of the company &mdash; it seems there is nothing stopping it doing that &mdash; it will in effect have full control of the company and can do with Aer Lingus what it wishes?  Does the Minister think that would be a good or a bad thing for the economy and the travelling public?  Does he think it would be a good or a bad thing for competition in this country, and if his answer is the latter, can he tell us what he intends doing to prevent that happening?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="2031"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In a sense, this is tinged with a certain amount of irony if one looks back at the Government having very much assisted Ryanair in ending a monopoly in the aviation sector.  We were very much to the fore in introducing competition, which as the Deputy has said, was without question in the best interests of the economy and the people in terms of business and tourism.  In effect, Ryanair is now trying to recreate a monopoly in the aviation sector.  I and the Government view this matter very seriously.  A monopoly is bad for business.  It is bad for this country, the customer, the travelling public and tourism interests.  All of those factors were the reasons why in the first place the Government has fostered and encouraged competition in recent years particularly in the aviation sector.  We certainly do not want to see a new monopoly created in the aviation sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a bit rich.  I asked the Minister if he thought that a privately owned monopoly was bad for airline services and what he intended doing about preventing that monopoly occurring.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I set out clearly for the Deputy in my opening remarks that a substantial range of interrelated regulatory, legislative and legal matters are being considered.  I am awaiting advice on exactly how these will unfold.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have any idea how matters will unfold?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Deputy appreciates it would be wrong for me to speculate until I have all the facts in my possession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>But the Minister rubbished people warning him about this happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I come back with other questions or should I ask all the questions together?  Will I get back in again?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Three other Deputies are offering and the matter will conclude at 4.45 p.m.  The Deputy should bear that in mind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to get all my questions in together.  I suppose the Minister was as gobsmacked as the rest of us this morning to hear this news.  I assume we, the taxpayer, employed advisers prior to the sale of Aer Lingus.  Did they ever consider this possibility in their risk assessment?  We did talk about the possibility of British Airways buying Aer Lingus.  Perhaps that was just in jest but there has always been a possibility that another airline would buy it.  Was it ever considered by the advisers that the one competing airline in Ireland might buy it?</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke to Aer Lingus this morning.  When the chief executive contacted the Mini<Col N="2032"/>ster, did he give any indication of the Aer Lingus response to this proposal?  Obviously shares are being sold all day.  Ryanair now owns almost as much of Aer Lingus as the Government.  Was there an official response from Aer Lingus as to how it might react to this bid from Ryanair to buy shares in the company?</P>
        <P>Did either Michael O&rsquo;Leary or Aer Lingus give the Minister any idea why Ryanair decided to do this?  Was it a thought out strategy, in which case one can well ask why Ryanair waited post-flotation to start buying shares?  There has been a rumour that another airline was sniffing around and that the Ryanair bid was an attempt to stymie that attempt.  Is it the case that Ryanair simply wanted to get into the long-haul business and found Aer Lingus a convenient vehicle for doing this?</P>
        <P>A great deal has been said about the loss of competition and clearly that would be a major concern for everybody from the consumers point of view as people would lose out in terms of price and choice.  Does the Minister think that if this matter goes to the European competition authorities Ryanair will have a very strong argument to the effect that when it went into new markets as well as existing markets, it grew the market in both cases?  Will that not be a strong argument against our argument that this is anti-competitive and that we will lose out?</P>
        <P>Everybody says we must block this move.  It is important to look soberly at this matter and consider what exactly it means in the long term.  Currently, Ryanair holds all the cards.  It can hold on to what it has and go no further but it can also drive Aer Lingus into the ground in terms of competing against it.  It now has access to 281 new 737s.  It can out-compete Aer Lingus, drive it into the ground and buy it for nothing in six months.  The knee-jerk reaction is not necessarily always the best one.  Has the Minister considered all of these lines of inquiry?  Is his preferred option to block the take-over or negotiate with Ryanair?  Where are we going next?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The first thing I should make clear to the House is that what we are reacting to is a press release, some comments from Ryanair and its activity on the market.  No formal offer document has been received and the Ryanair deputy chief executive indicated this would be presented in two weeks.  We must wait until we see the formal offer document.</P>
        <P>Second, the Deputy has speculated, as I am sure have many others, as to the precise agenda of Ryanair.  That is entirely a matter for Ryanair and I will not try to guess it.  What I and the Government are clear about is that this is unquestionably bad for competition.  We are against monopolies in the aviation sector.  We are not in favour of a new monopoly being created by a company that was assisted by this State to end a monopoly in the aviation sector.  Clearly, all the different regulatory authorities and legal issues, <Col N="2033"/>some of which are interrelated, are being studied as we speak.</P>
        <P>It is also my understanding that the board of Aer Lingus is obliged to consult with its advisers before it makes a formal statement to its shareholders.  We must wait for all of that to unfold in the near future.  I emphasise the Government is not going to sell its significant shareholding in Aer Lingus.  The memorandum and articles of association cannot be changed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is worthless.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should please not throw in remarks that are incorrect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is completely worthless.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Shortall is aware, the memorandum and articles of association state that once the Government has a 25.1% shareholding &mdash; we have 28.3% &mdash; and if another 5% shareholder acts we cannot change, for example, the arrangements with regard to the Heathrow slots.  That cannot be changed as long as the Government has 25.1% of the shareholding.  It is important to put that on the record.</P>
        <P>The issue is very clear.  This country has prospered in the aviation sector enormously since the introduction of competition.  It is without question that it has been of enormous benefit to the travelling public, for tourism, business and the economy.  The Government takes a very strong view of the attempt by Ryanair to recreate a monopoly in this country.  It is not something the Government wants to see happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I put it to the Minister that what is abundantly clear is that this has been one of the worst decisions and the most obvious mistake made by any Minister in the many years I can remember.  It has taken a week for the folly of his course of action to emerge.  As Deputy Shortall stated, this was argued against on this side of the House.  Our party was strongly against it.  It was an incredibly foolish and reckless decision to give up a national asset and to put it, effectively, on the market.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that nothing formal is on the table.  The fact Ryanair in one day owns more of the company than the Government shows the change of thinking.  Ryanair is running rings around the Minister.  It is acting way ahead of him.  Does the Minister agree that, even if Ryanair does not end up owning the company or taking a controlling stake, the company is &ldquo;in play&rdquo; in market terms?  As Eircom was before it, Aer Lingus will become a vehicle for market speculation and changes of ownership in a manner over which we have no control despite what the Minister says about golden stakes.</P>
        <P>I would argue and contend that this is a calamity for the company and of no benefit to the public.  It is of disastrous consequence for aviation <Col N="2034"/>policy in this country.  Given that events are evolving by the minute as Ryanair buys up the company today, has the Government considered going to the market and repurchasing some of the company, which it sold last week, in recognition of the fact that matters are out of the its control?  Has the Government contacted the European competition authorities and how does it intend to influence them in this regard?  What is the timeframe for a decision by the authorities?  How rapidly will a decision be made on whether such a takeover would be in breach of European competition rules?</P>
        <P>If the Government will not buy back some of the company or if it cannot tell the House what is the ruling of a competition authority, what can it do?  What will the Government do today if, as any sensible person would, it believes that such a takeover is not in the interests of the State?  What can the Government do after its incredible mistake in selling this company last week?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is wrong for any Deputy to talk down Aer Lingus in the House.  This is not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking down Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is the person who destroyed Aer Lingus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not surprised to get such a typical response from the Labour Party and the Green Party.  As I have enunciated in recent months, the growth potential for Aer Lingus is considerable.  It is an important company&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Aer Lingus will not exist in a week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;predicated on its base in Ireland, the potential new routes from here into the United States, the Middle East, the Far East and Australia and the substantial potential increase in short-haul routes.  We must keep matters in context.  The company is in a strong position and managed to turn itself around in a positive way thanks to great work by its workforce and management in recent years.  That is the situation today.</P>
        <P>Deputy Eamon Ryan seems to be ignoring EU competition rules in respect of our desire to ensure that Aer Lingus would not be made to face fierce competition with one hand tied behind its back.  It would probably not have been able to survive.  It needed the ability to compete on a level playing field and access to the capital markets.  It can be said that once a company is put on the Stock Exchange, people can purchase its shares, but there are Irish and EU competition rules to ensure there is no distortion of the marketplace by the creation of a monopoly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is clearly an attempt by Ryanair to create a monopoly in this country&rsquo;s aviation sector.  For Ryanair to create a monopoly would be bad for business, tourism and passengers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has allowed it to happen.  He is responsible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will not faze me.  I am far calmer than she is, bleating at me from over there.  This is a serious issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>For someone who has just thrown away the national airline, the Minister is remarkably calm.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That will not achieve anything.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a day to be calm.  Does the Minister agree that only weeks after the privatisation of Aer Lingus, he is guilty of creating what is by any standard a shocking debacle for which the Government is responsible?  Does the Minister not find it grotesque that an airline that belonged to the Irish people built by the dedication of thousands of workers over decades is in danger of being controlled by a ruthless private operator who is anti-workers&rsquo; rights, anti-trade union rights and anti-environment?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister understand the fury of Aer Lingus workers who, courtesy of his neoliberal economic agenda of privatisation, find a ravenous cuckoo in the Aer Lingus nest?  Their jobs, working conditions, wages and futures are in mortal danger.  Does the Minister agree that Aer Lingus workers are fully entitled to protect themselves from this sinister development, to fight this shark from taking Aer Lingus over and to do so with industrial action?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy asking a question?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of this debacle, for which the Government, with Fine Gael&rsquo;s support, is responsible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>There is no need for statements, just questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Why should the Minister not be kicked out of office if he does not resign?  Why will the Government not take Aer Lingus back into public ownership as it should, invest money in the future of Aer Lingus &mdash; the Minister should admit that the Government can invest this &mdash; and bring the workers to the heart of the running of Aer Lingus rather than throw them to the sharks <Col N="2036"/>on the international stock exchanges, which is what the Government has done?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the Minister answers, Deputy Crowe will speak.  He has not spoken yet, so he can be facilitated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to the Minister speak about this being bad for tourism, but does he accept that it is also bad for commuters, Aer Lingus workers, the economy and employers who must get their products to the market?  Does the Minister also accept that sharks or venture capitalists entering Aer Lingus was probably an inevitability?</P>
        <P Just="Left">What was the rush to sell Aer Lingus at this time?  In recent years, the company was doing well and making a good profit.  The Minister keeps talking about what Aer Lingus will face and how we could have entered a situation where the State began losing money, but, as an outsider looking in, the company was doing extremely well, expanding and making a profit.  Does the Minister know how the workers of Aer Lingus feel today?  Does he accept that they feel let down by the Government?  Clearly, they have been let down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should be brief because we are running out of time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister surprised by venture capitalists moving in on Aer Lingus?  Does he accept that the Government has made Aer Lingus vulnerable to people who will strip the company if they get the opportunity?  The responsibility is not Michael O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s.  Rather, it is the Government&rsquo;s for selling a successful State company that was paid for and supported by taxpayers and its workers through the years.</P>
        <P>How will this situation affect the organisations in Aer Lingus?  Does the Minister have any idea about how the people in the company&rsquo;s unions, who supported it and took difficult decisions to make it successful, feel?  His decision has left the company open to the sharks and the wolves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised to hear the question about what the rush was because the Government and I were accused constantly of delaying decisions on Aer Lingus.  People want it every way.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with the suppositions of Deputies Eamon Ryan and Crowe.  I should have responded earlier.  The process involved will be lengthy and the regulatory and legal situation will not unfold during the coming days.  A reasonable amount of time will be afforded the different requisite bodies to make their assessments and engage in processes.  Ryanair will not make a formal offer for the company for at least two weeks.</P>
        <P>On the decision to sell Aer Lingus, the business case that was put forward and the potential for which workers and management had worked over <Col N="2037"/>the past number of years could only be achieved by the strategic decision that was taken to sell a majority stake in the company.</P>
        <P>Many of us around here must grow up.  We do not operate in a bubble but in difficult markets at times, and the aviation sector is one such market.  I and the Government remain confident about the future of Aer Lingus.</P>
        <P>On the earlier question, I agree that the generally held view was that Ryanair did not appear to have an interest in Aer Lingus, but there you are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>There you are.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>There you are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister might have thought of that beforehand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, it confirms the Government&rsquo;s view that this is a strong company, which has the right business plan, the right opportunities, considerable potential for growth in the marketplace and is now on the move in terms of its own development.</P>
        <P>I agree the Government moved over the past number of years to facilitate the break-up of a monopoly in Irish aviation because we did not think it was good for business and that it facilitated the advent of Ryanair, which has worked successfully, from the aviation point of view, for the benefit of the economy.</P>
        <P>What we do not want &mdash; this is potentially what is happening &mdash; is an attempt by Ryanair to create a private monopoly in the aviation sector.  Such a monopoly would be bad for business, bad for tourism, bad for the economy and bad for customers in this country.  That is my strongly held view and that of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity the Minister did not think of that before now.  At this stage, does the Minister accept that he and his Cabinet colleagues have been utterly reckless with the national airline in pursuing his privatisation agenda?  Is it not the case that the Minister, in particular, blindly and continuously ignored frequent warnings that this particular scenario of a predatory takeover could occur?</P>
        <P Just="Left">What contact has the Minister had today with the European Commission in respect of the concerns which we all had before he moved to privatise the company and which he ignored?  Has he registered the concern of the Government over what is likely to happen now to Aer Lingus?  Does he accept that the only way he can block a takeover by Ryanair is to move to buy back shares to secure 50% of Aer Lingus?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s submission that this was an utterly reckless course to adopt.  It would have been utterly reckless to sit back and do nothing on the potential development of Aer Lingus for the future of this country.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy O&rsquo;Shea &mdash; the need to upgrade Waterford Institute of Technology to university status; (2) Deputy Costello &mdash; the need for the Minister to address the serious problem of illegal fireworks in the rush up to Hallowe&rsquo;en; (3) <Col N="2039"/>Deputy Sargent &mdash; that the Minister ensure that the steep rise in demand for school places in the fast growing communities in Fingal be matched with necessary classroom space, additional staff and necessary resources and that discussions take place with the school principals and boards of management so that best practice in terms of enrolment policy can be established in all schools taking into account that, for example, Balbriggan Educate Together National School (Roll No. 20202A) rose in numbers from 53 pupils on 30 September 2005 to 84 by the end of the school year and that as a new school such dramatic changes need attention from the Department above and beyond what is normal; (4) Deputy Broughan &mdash; the urgent need for the Minister to introduce legislation to prevent the discontinuance of essential telecommunications services and contracts without warning to households and business consumers; (5) Deputy Gormley &mdash; the need for the Minister to introduce legislation to ensure that a proper local post office network is maintained in our cities and rural areas and that all houses have access to broadband services to allow post office services to be conducted on-line; and (6) Deputy Howlin &mdash; the refusal of the Minister to accede to the request that she accept the recommendation of the transport liaison officer for County Wexford and of County Wexford Deputies on a cross-party basis to appoint a senior inspector to review and certify the school transport catchment boundary areas in County Wexford.</P>
        <P>The matters raised by Deputies Costello, O&rsquo;Shea, Sargent and Howlin have been selected for discussion.</P>

      <sTitle>Illegal Fireworks.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, is probably aware of the young student of the Dominican College Cabra, who is from Finglas in his constituency, who had a terrifying experience during the week when a banger was thrown at her, damaging her hand and neck to the extent that it is thought she will require plastic surgery.</P>
        <P>Similar incidents of this nature occur every year.  Fireworks, as he will be aware, are illegally imported into this jurisdiction and they are in the control and possession of young, irresponsible people for a period of up to two months in the run-up to Hallowe&rsquo;en.</P>
        <P>Explosions occur at all times of the day and night.  The elderly are frightened of the loud bangs as well as the possibility of having an incendiary device put through their letter boxes.  Pallets and tyres are collected for vast bonfires, again with no adult control.</P><Col N="2040"/>
        <P>In response, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has spent the past four and a half years trumpeting various proposals he intended to introduce in his new Bill, the Criminal Justice Act 2006 &mdash; which at last has seen the light of day &mdash; and said that he would deal with the illegal importation, possession, sale and use of fireworks in it.  His proposals involve nothing more than inserting a provision in the Criminal Justice Act which increases penalties for existing offences &mdash; possession, igniting, propelling and intent to sell or supply illegal fireworks without a licence.</P>
        <P>There are no proposals whatsoever to synchronise the legislation in this jurisdiction with that in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, from whence almost all the illegal fireworks emanate.  Neither has the Minister any plans to deal with the issue on the ground.  He has no proposals for protecting the young and the elderly from injury like that experienced by the young schoolgirl to whom I referred.  It is left to the local authority to organise meetings with the Fire Brigade, the Civil Defence and the Garda, who are under the Minister&rsquo;s control, to endeavour to put some co-ordinated approach together to address the issues of illegal activities and anti-social behaviour at this time.</P>
        <P>It is high time the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform began to realise that there are serious problems in the community and that they require more than the passage of legislation and a few ministerial soundbites.  They require strong leadership from the Minister, which is not forthcoming, and a multi-agency co-ordinated plan of action on the ground that should be led by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is fully aware of the difficulties which the illegal use of fireworks present each year around this time, the dangers they pose and the distress they cause to people, particularly the elderly.  In recent days we have been reminded of the serious danger fireworks pose with the injury of a young girl in Finglas.  The T&aacute;naiste and I take this opportunity to extend our sympathy to the young girl and her family and wish her a speedy and full recovery.</P>
        <P>Conscious of the dangers which fireworks present, the T&aacute;naiste introduced a number of amendments to the Explosives Act 1875, which governs fireworks, in the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  These amendments provide for new offences governing the misuse of fireworks in public places and an offence of possession of illegally imported fireworks with intent to supply.  They also provide for significantly increased penalties governing the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.  It is an offence for a person to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply <Col N="2041"/>without a licence, to throw an ignited firework at a person or property and to light unlicensed fireworks in a public place.  The penalty for such offences is a fine of up to &euro;10,000 or five years imprisonment, or both.  The simple possession of fireworks without a licence is also an offence for which a person may be liable to a fine of up to &euro;10,000.</P>
        <P>The 1875 Act provides for the control of the importation, manufacture, storage and sale of fireworks.  While current legislation on fireworks does not specifically ban the importation, manufacture, sale or use of fireworks, it is Government policy, in the interests of safety and security, to restrict, to the greatest extent possible, the availability of any category of firework to the public.  Effect is given to this policy through the use of the licensing powers, conferred on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform by the Act, which provides that fireworks may only be imported into Ireland on foot of an importation licence granted by the Minister.  It is current policy only to issue licenses for the importation of fireworks used in organised displays conducted by &ldquo;professional-competent operators&rdquo;.  This policy means that the only fireworks imported into the State and &ldquo;legally held&rdquo; are those used in professional displays.  All other fireworks imported, held, sold or used in this country are illegal and a person in possession of fireworks without a valid licence is liable to prosecution.</P>
        <P>Last year the Minister commissioned research into the public&rsquo;s attitude to the control of fireworks and his proposals to strengthen significantly the penalties for their illegal use.  The general conclusion of the research was that the public generally favours the current policy of prohibiting importation of fireworks for sale and strongly supports the proposals for increased fines and penalties.  The Minister is about to embark on a nationwide advertising campaign aimed at highlighting the dangers of fireworks and the new increased penalties for their illegal use.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This advertising campaign will commence next week and will run up to Halloween.</P>
        <P>Every effort is made by the Garda to identify persons involved in the illegal importation and sale of fireworks.  Where necessary, specific policing plans are put in place in areas where problems arise.  These plans include intelligence gathering on known dealers and suppliers and, once identified, putting plans in place to arrest them and seize their stocks of illegal fireworks.  Each year leading up to Halloween, special efforts are made by the Garda to combat the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.  This year an intelligence-led operation entitled Operation Tombola, which aims to prevent and detect <Col N="2042"/>the organised importation, for sale, of fireworks, has been put in place by the Garda Commissioner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Chief superintendents throughout the country have been instructed to introduce measures appropriate to their respective areas of responsibility, with particular emphasis on Garda divisions in the Dublin metropolitan region and in the Border region.  The operation, while intelligence driven, is also coupled with sporadic high visibility policing activities.  Operation Tombola commenced on 25 September 2006 and in the past week there have been 15 seizures of fireworks with an estimated value of &euro;87,000.  Over the past five years such operations have resulted in significant seizures of illegally imported fireworks with an estimated value of more than &euro;2 million.  All fireworks seized are forfeited by the person importing them and destroyed in accordance with the provisions of the Explosives Act 1875.  The Minister is confident that this year, following the introduction of the new offences and penalties, the Garda operations will be even more successful in combating the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this most important issue for Waterford and the south-east region.  While I have the utmost respect for the Minister of State, I lament the absence of the Minister for Education and Science to address the issue.</P>
        <P>In February 2006 Waterford Institute of Technology confirmed that it had made a formal application to the Department of Education and Science in pursuit of university designation.  The submission embraces constituent campuses throughout the south east.  At the time a spokesperson for WIT stated: &ldquo;The expectation is that a national and international panel of respected higher educationalists will adjudicate on the merits of the Institute&rsquo;s case and their report will be submitted to the Higher Education Authority&rdquo;. <Col N="2043"/> Section 9(1) of the Education Act 1997 states: &ldquo;The Government may at any time appoint a body, the membership of which shall be recommended by An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s [An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s in this case meaning the Higher Education Authority] and shall include international experts, including employees of Universities to which the Act applies to advise An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s having regard to the objects and functions of a University under sections 12 and 13, under which an Education Institution should be established as a University.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>It is early October and this national and international panel of respected higher educationalists has not been set up.  Last week I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Education and Science regarding when it is proposed to refer the submission of Waterford Institute of Technology on upgrading to university status to the independent group for appraisal.  The Minister, in her reply, completely evaded the question.  The reply was nothing other than a fob-off regarding this vital issue for the future development and prosperity of Waterford and the south-east region.</P>
        <P>My fears and suspicions that the Minister has no intention of setting up the panel, which is the next urgent necessary step in the provision of a university in the south east have, unfortunately, been realised.  The Minister stated in February 2005: &ldquo;It should be noted that last September&rsquo;s OECD Review of Higher Education in Ireland recommends that the differentiation of mission between the University and the Institute of Technology Sector be preserved and that for the foreseeable future there be no further institutional transfers into the Universities Sector.&rdquo;  This is Government policy.  However, a strategy is in place to conceal the reality and give the impression of progress in the upgrading of WIT to university status because nothing is happening.</P>
        <P>In her reply to my parliamentary question, the Minister referred to a very detailed statutory review process and said significant wider issues need to be considered in progressing the case.  She also alluded to the Institutes of Technology Act 2006, which brings institutes of technology under the remit of the HEA, and to new managerial and governance freedoms that will allow the institutes to develop their roles.  This is a load of waffle.  While these issues arise, the central issue is whether the body of international and national experts agrees WIT should be established as a university.   That is the basic issue and everything else follows from that.</P>
        <P>There are major concerns regarding the economic performance of the south east.  According to data from the Central Statistics Office, <i>per capita</i> income in the region is only 89.5% of the national average.  The region is also overly reliant on poorly paid self-employment.  According to a report commissioned by Waterford Chamber of Commerce and carried out by Goodbody Economic Consultants, more than 2,000 jobs would be <Col N="2044"/>created directly or indirectly by the upgrading of WIT to university status and, in addition, a further &euro;100 million would be generated for the local economy.  There is no more important addition to the infrastructure of the region than a university.  There is a significant need to grow the research and development capacity and knowledge base of the region, the traditional industrial base of which is being eroded.  The crying need is for capability building with regard to industry based on the best of modern technology.  I demand that the Minister immediately announce when she will establish the body of national and international experts to advise the HEA in regard to the Waterford Institute of Technology submission to be upgraded to university status.  If the Government prevaricates and delays, it will pay a very dear price come the next general election.</P>

       <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In February 2006 the governing body of Waterford Institute of Technology wrote to the Department of Education and Science requesting a review of its status under section 9 of the Universities Act 1997.  The provisions of section 9 state that the Government may appoint a body, which will include international experts, to advise the Higher Education Authority on whether, having regard to the objects and functions of a university, an educational institution should be established as a university.  On the advice of the body and the recommendation of the authority, the Government may, by order, provide that the institution shall be a university for the purposes of this Act.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The submission from Waterford Institute of Technology seeking university status remains under consideration by the Department.  Aside from the very detailed statutory review process that is required in progressing an application, there are also significant wider issues that need to be considered in advance of any statutory review.  For example, there have been important wider policy developments in the overall higher education sector that are relevant in this context.  In particular, it is important that account is taken of the very significant recent changes in the overall legislative framework governing higher education, with the passage of the new Institutes of Technology Act 2006 at the end of the last D&aacute;il term, as well as wider Government policy on foot of the review of Irish higher education carried out by the OECD in 2004, the broad thrust of which was endorsed by the Government.</P>
        <P>A central purpose of the OECD review was to support Ireland&rsquo;s strategic ambition of placing our higher education system at the front rank of the OECD in the context of the wider national objective of developing as a world-leading knowledge economy and society.  A key recommendation made in the OECD report to the Government was that Ireland should retain the <Col N="2045"/>differentiation in mission of the university and institute of technology sectors, which it identified as a key strength of our system, and that there should be no institutional transfers into the university system for the foreseeable future.  The report also recommended that the universities and institutes of technology should be brought together under the remit of a single authority for the purpose of achieving a unified higher education strategy.  It further recommended that the extent of external regulation of the institutes of technology should be lightened, giving them greater managerial freedom in responding to the opportunities and challenges of supporting regional and national social and economic development.</P>
        <P>The new Act addresses significant elements of these recommendations and marks a major milestone for the sector and for the development of higher education.  The Act provides for greater autonomy for the institutes to fulfil their missions.  By bringing them within the remit of the Higher Education Authority, it will support an integrated and cohesive strategic approach to the development of higher education in line with national priorities.  The Act means that, in practice, the HEA and the institutes of technology will engage and relate in a way that is very similar to the way the HEA and the universities engage.</P>
        <P>There are a number of areas where the current operation of the institutes will alter as a consequence of the role of the HEA, such as on budgets and finances, where the HEA will determine an institute&rsquo;s budget in line with the funding relationship that exists between the HEA and the universities.  The HEA will assume a role in establishing formal arrangements to permit institutes to borrow or to underwrite borrowings, again in a manner similar to that prevailing in the university sector, allowing a greater level of institutional flexibility and responsiveness.  The Department&rsquo;s role in regard to the approval of research, consultancy or development work or the acquisition of land will devolve to the HEA.  Similarly, specific approval from the Department to run individual courses or programmes will no longer be required.</P>
        <P>The new arrangements will provide for a more autonomous and strategic relationship with Government, through the HEA, reflecting the dynamic and competitive nature of the environment in which the institutes are now operating.  The Minister for Education and Science is cognisant of the strong support that has been built in the south-east region around the application from Waterford Institute of Technology for university status.  However, the relevant wider policy developments I have outlined are also fundamental to her consideration of the appropriate next steps in regard to the application.  The Waterford application is currently being carefully assessed in that broad context.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle, as ucht cead a thabhairt dom an cheist th&aacute;bhachtach seo a ard&uacute;.  T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm nach bhfuil an tAire i l&aacute;thair, ach cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, ar a laghad.  This issue is one which will be repeated to the Minister of State by many living in my constituency of Dublin North and the wider area, including east Meath and many other areas regarded as being in the commuter belt for Dublin, which stretches far.  When we met the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, on 20 July and signed an agreement between Fingal County Council and the Department of Education and Science, I thought we would see renewed vigour and delivery of results in the burgeoning towns and villages of my constituency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note with interest Deputy O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s case, with which I agree wholeheartedly, on the need to upgrade Waterford Institute of Technology to university status.  However, in Dublin North, the town of Swords has a population roughly equal to Waterford city.  The people of the area seek decent secondary and primary school places.  If we were to get university status for an institute of technology, we would not know what hit us we would be so delighted.</P>
        <P>Can we deal with the basics and get them right?  There is a real crisis in Dublin North and the wider area.  In spite of the United Nations Charter on the Rights of the Child stating at Article 59 that governments should ensure budgetary allocations are also directed at improving and upgrading school buildings, recreational equipment and facilities, and sanitary conditions in schools, the UN Charter is sadly neglected in Dublin North.  In Laytown, just north of the Meath border, the population in the school catchment area has quadrupled since 1996, as it has in my constituency, but no permanent classroom has been provided since 1979.  Some 150 junior infants from Laytown are bused to Bellewstown.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will know of that issue from the media but similar issues exist in Dublin North.  For example, the Balbriggan Educate Together national school accommodates many students from different social backgrounds.  However, the poorer parents are discriminated against by Government policy because there is a requirement to pay 25% of the school&rsquo;s rent on the temporary buildings in that school.  Therefore, &euro;3,275 per annum must be raised by the school families and the children themselves, and that amount of money is not available to go towards necessary equipment and the maintenance of the school.</P>
        <P>The Minister must take account of the needs of Balbriggan Educate Together national school.  The school inspector published a report in April this year indicating its viability and the enrolments up to 2010 also indicate strong viability and, indeed, chronic overcrowding for the future. <Col N="2047"/> Despite this, the Government will not give the school the permanent status it needs.  As a result, it is not able to get a minor works grant, which is only available for a permanent school, or have the rent paid on the six-room school.  Therefore, not alone does the school have only a temporary building, which is very unsatisfactory, but it must pay through the nose, as if it was some kind of private operation instead of providing the most basic fundamental human right, namely, that children can expect primary education.  Moreover, the school has no resource room.</P>
        <P>When I see the reality, I have to believe there is no joined-up thinking in Government.  I ask that it be addressed immediately.  The school has been coming under pressure to expand to a 32-room facility.  Why would the school take the Department on trust that this would not be an albatross around its neck, being left to try to provide when the Department is so slow in providing the basics for a smaller school?  That could be a six-room or a 16-teacher school, as it was originally intended to be.</P>

	<P>I assure the Deputy that the Government is acutely aware that the Fingal area of Dublin is the fastest-growing area in the country and that the Minister for Education and Science is working hard to ensure that extra school places are provided in line with or ahead of demand.</P>
        <P>New schools are being built while the capacity of existing schools is being increased.  All building projects in areas of rapid population growth are awarded a band 1 priority rating under the <Col N="2048"/>Department&rsquo;s prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  This means they will be delivered in the fastest timeframe possible.</P>
        <P>With regard to the 2006 to 2007 school year, a number of measures were implemented to ensure that significant extra classroom accommodation would be available at schools in Fingal to cater for demand.  A total of 62 extra classrooms were approved and the majority of these were in place on 1 September 2006.</P>
        <P>With regard to the provision of whole new schools, the Deputy will be aware that a major construction programme is under way in the Fingal area.  A new school building has recently been completed at Mary Mother of Hope national school in the Littlepace Castaheany area, with an additional project under way.  The delivery date for this project is September 2007.  A new primary school campus is planned for a school site in Ongar.  This campus will permanently accommodate Castaheany Educate Together national school and St. Benedict Ongar national school.</P>
        <P>Other developments in the Dublin 15 area include the planned expansion of St. Brigid&rsquo;s national school in Castleknock and extensions to St. Brigid&rsquo;s boys&rsquo; and girls&rsquo; national schools in Blanchardstown.  At post-primary level, a new 1,000-pupil post-primary school is being provided in the Phibblestown area of Dublin 15.  It is intended that this site will also be developed to cater for a 16-classroom primary school.  The provision of a further post-primary school in the area is currently under consideration.</P>
        <P>New schools will also be provided in the Hansfield and Adamstown strategic development zones.  Further north in the Fingal area, closer to the Deputy, a new 1,000-pupil post-primary school is being provided to cater for the needs of Portrane and Donabate.  The school will be a community college under the aegis of the vocational education committee.  The Minister is acutely aware of the needs of the Portrane and Donabate area and is determined to progress this as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>With regard to the Fingal school model, on top of the interventions outlined, the Department has also entered into a cross-Government agreement with Fingal County Council to provide much-needed community facilities in tandem with schools.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the agreement and based on school planning projections of the Department, Fingal will identify and acquire appropriate sites where schools with enhanced sporting, community and arts facilities will be built to the benefit of both the school and the wider community.  In practice, the local authority will identify the sites when adopting the local authority plans.  The council will go on to acquire sufficient land as recommended by the Department, on which an appropriate sized school or schools for that local area can then be built.</P>
        <P>With regard to staffing, at the beginning of the current year there were no fewer than 4,000 extra teachers in primary schools compared with four years ago.  The average class size in primary schools is 24, and there is now one teacher for every 17 pupils at primary level.</P>

      <sTitle>School Transport.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern.  As three of the four matters selected for the Adjournment were related to education, it is disappointing that none of the Ministers from the relevant Department is here.  It takes away from the spontaneity.  I wish to put forward a case, but the Minister of State <Col N="2050"/>present has no connection with the Department of Education and Science, and he will read a script that was written before any case was made.  That undermines the importance for individual Members of putting forward a case.</P>
        <P>I wish to outline a very important case to the House.  It is the ongoing saga of the denial of transport to schools in Wexford for pupils in the Blackwater area of County Wexford.  I last raised this matter on the Adjournment in January.  I raised it by way of parliamentary question this week.  It is a significant bone of contention in Wexford, where pupils with a legitimate expectation for transportation to the school that traditionally serviced the pupils and children of Blackwater are being denied that service.</P>
        <P>A new and most serious issue has arisen.  There is now more than one map of County Wexford catchment boundaries for schools.  The original map used to be on the wall of the transport liaison officer, and it was pointed out to all Wexford Deputies at the outset of this controversy.  That is no longer regarded as the official catchment boundary map.  The so-called official catchment boundary map is now published on the VEC website.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the official catchment boundary map is made up of a number of maps, snapshots of parts of the county that do not fit together.  These snapshots overlap.  Some areas are in two different catchment boundaries.  I believe this anomaly was shown to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, at a meeting with local Fianna F&aacute;il cumann members from the Blackwater area.  They reported that she was at least surprised, and that she undertook to have the matter reviewed.</P>
        <P>The issue was also addressed at a meeting of Wexford Deputies.  Four of the five attended, and the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, was unavailable.  I know he supports the unanimous conclusion of that meeting.  The meeting on 15 September was attended by myself, along with Deputies Tony Dempsey, Kehoe, Twomey and the transport liaison officer for County Wexford, Ms Clare McMahon.</P>
        <P>We accepted, across the political divide, with the transport liaison officer, that there was an anomaly.  A statement was agreed in all our names.  It reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">The existing catchment maps available to the transport liaison officer in County Wexford are inadequate and need clarification.  We call on the Minister for Education and Science to appoint a senior inspector as a matter of urgency to review the sub-county maps that now exist and certify the full county map setting out the catchment boundaries of each post-primary school in County Wexford.  Thirdly, we ask that the inspector take such submissions <Col N="2051"/>from interested groups before finalising this process.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Unfortunately, in a written reply to me yesterday, the Minister for Education and Science refused to review the current, inadequate maps.  She leaves the transport liaison officer in a totally invidious position.  How can she determine eligibility from inadequate maps?  There will be legal action on this matter and there will also be certain political action on it.  I call on the Minister of State to go back to his colleagues in the Department of Education and Science as a matter of urgency and point out to them the degree of anger and frustration that has built up, not only in Blackwater, because this will have resonances across the county.  He should ask that the unanimous call from the Deputies of County Wexford and the transport liaison officer, that an inspector reinvestigate the catchment boundaries, be investigated as a matter of urgency.  That process should be put in place at once.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am afraid that I can only give the Deputy the script that is here. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what I am afraid of. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I was landed with this at the last moment but perhaps it will clarify the matter.  Under the terms of the Department of Education and Science school transport scheme a pupil is eligible for transport if he or she resides 4.8 km or more from his or her local post-primary education centre, that is, the centre serving the catchment area in which he or she lives.  The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside the catchment in which they reside.  However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment in which they reside may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside their own catchment area, otherwise known as catchment boundary transport.  These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling&mdash;&mdash;    </P>

	<P>Catchment boundaries have provided and continue to provide a useful tool in facilitating the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs and the operation of the national school transport service.  Last year, a problem arose regarding a catchment boundary line on a map retained in the office of the transport liaison officer for County Wexford.  The matter concerned was addressed and acted upon promptly.  The Department of Education and Science has been assured by the transport liaison officer that she is satisfied that the catchment boundary maps displayed on the Wexford VEC website are the same as the Department&rsquo;s maps and those utilised by Bus &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In his question, the Deputy seems to suggest that the transport liaison officer for County Wexford, who administers the post-primary school transport scheme on behalf of the Department, is a party to a recommendation to appoint a senior inspector to review and certify the school transport catchment boundary areas in County Wexford.  The transport liaison officer has confirmed to the Department of Education and Science that she is not a party to such a recommendation.   </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

	<P>I have dealt with this issue comprehensively on a number of occasions, in particular my reply to Question Number 60 on 21 March 2006.  </P>
        <P>I wish to repeat that this Government is fully committed to providing continued supports to <Col N="2055"/>Irish communities living abroad.  This commitment is clearly demonstrated by the allocation of significant funding directly from the Exchequer to support emigrant organisations.  Indeed the funding in 2006 amounts to over &euro;12 million, an increase of 45% on 2005.</P>
        <P>In light of the significant allocation of funding to support emigrant organisations already in place, I repeat that it is my intention that allocations from the Dormant Accounts Fund will continue to focus on tackling disadvantage in Ireland.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 13 together. </P>
        <P>Following the enactment of the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2005 the Government approved the allocation of &euro;60 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund in 2006.  In this regard, &euro;24 million is being allocated towards projects tackling economic and social disadvantage; &euro;18 million towards projects tackling educational disadvantage and &euro;18 million towards projects assisting persons with a disability.</P>
        <P>On 4th January 2006, following Government approval, I announced details of the &euro;24 million allocation for the purpose of supporting the following programmes and projects tacking economic and social disadvantage:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />RAPID Programme  &mdash; up to &euro;11.5m to be ring-fenced to provide additional supports for priority projects in RAPID areas;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Support for Priority Themes &mdash; &euro;7.5m for specific measures supporting youth, older people and other priority themes (including suicide prevention; alcohol misuse; supports for immigrant families; supports for offenders/ex-offenders); and</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Support for Jointly Funded Flagship Projects &mdash; &euro;5 for innovative measures addressing matters of major public concern, <Col N="2056"/>which also involve substantial funding from private, philanthropic or community sources.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The roll-out of these measures is well underway.  In early July, I announced the details of the 188 priority projects in RAPID areas approved by Government for funding totalling &euro;11.35 million.  Full details of these allocations are available on the website of my Department at <i>www.pobail.ie</i>.  Within the projects approved, there is great diversity both in scale and purpose.  Examples include refurbishments to community facilities; supports for youth art and information technology projects; funding for football summer workshops etc.</P>
        <P>In August, I announced that the Government had approved the allocation of &euro;574,989 from the Dormant Accounts Fund to fund six projects providing employment supports to vulnerable immigrant families.  In relation to the other measures approved for funding in 2006, it is anticipated that further announcements will be made over the coming months as the applications received under these various measures are fully processed and recommendations made to Government in accordance with the legislation.</P>
        <P>The arrangements in relation to the next round of funding in 2007 are currently under consideration.  In this regard, the Deputies will be aware that the legislation requires the Minister to consult other appropriate Ministers for the purpose of developing a proposal for submission to Government for approval.  This process has commenced and I hope to be in a position to bring a proposal to Government shortly concerning the 2007 round of funding.  The possibility of ring-fencing further funding for RAPID areas will be considered in this context.</P>

        <P>The Taoiseach established the Taskforce on Active Citizenship on 18th April this year.  It was set up to advise the Government on the steps that can be taken to ensure that the wealth of civic spirit and active participation already present in Ireland continues to grow and develop.</P>

The Secretary General of my Department is a member of the Task Force and takes a lead role in supporting one of Taskforce&rsquo;s subcommittees.</P>

	<P>With the number of people employed directly as full-time farmers continuing to fall, I see new opportunities for small farmers, their families and those with off-farm jobs to diversify as primary producers and as manufacturers.  The continued growth and development of rural enterprise is the foundation on which we build a healthy and sustainable quality of life for all rural communities.    </P>
        <P>There is a growing demand for healthy foods that are locally produced and the Irish consumer is increasingly aware that in order for food from thousands of miles away to arrive &lsquo;fresh&rsquo; in Ireland, it is often packed with added salts and preservatives.  Many of our small food producers are drawing on a tradition of producing high quality safe food and are bringing those high quality foods to new customers.</P>
        <P>Farmers&rsquo; markets provide a route to meeting this demand.  Locally grown produce on sale at a farm shop or at a farmers&rsquo; market by the farmer is very attractive to the customer, as the direct contact with the producer enables greater trace<Col N="2058"/>ability and food safety.  It is in recognition of the importance of farmers&rsquo; markets that I initiated the Support for Farmers&rsquo; Markets measure under the CL&Aacute;R Programme&rsquo;s Village and Countryside Enhancement Scheme.</P>
        <P>This measure is still in its early days but I want to highlight it as an invaluable vehicle for LEADER companies to utilise more fully when the new EU Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 starts.  The funding provided from the European Agriculture Rural Development Fund for 2007-2013 represents a trebling of EU and National funding for rural development under a LEADER-type programme.  This means an increase in the annual budget from an average of &euro;21million per year to at least &euro;60 million per year from a combination of European and National funding.</P>
        <P>Finally, the issue of technical support for this developing sector is being pursued by my Department, in consultation with the relevant agencies.</P>

	<P>Illegal drug use is a global issue and so our efforts to tackle it in Ireland must be seen in that context.  The enormity and the geographic scale of the struggle we face can be illustrated by considering the sources of the drugs that are sold on our streets.  Cannabis resin comes predominately from Morocco, but it can also come from the Middle East and the Indian sub continent.  Cocaine originates in Latin America, mostly Colombia, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru while heroin comes mainly from the so-called Golden Crescent of Afghanistan and Pakistan, but also from Burma, Laos and Thailand.  To really get to grips with the international problems of drug misuse, it is imperative that the drug issue be tackled in all those countries as well as in all the countries through which drugs travel before they reach our shores. </P>
        <P>Against this background I feel that it is na&iuml;ve to believe that Ireland can be kept totally drug-free, and it is from that context, and in answer to a question, that the comment on the &ldquo;war on drugs&rdquo; is taken.</P>
        <P>The National Drugs Strategy recognises the volatility and change inherent in the misuse of drugs and so it is flexible in its approach.  The <Col N="2060"/>implementation of the Strategy, which is co-ordinated by my Department, is being progressed with the significant input of other Government Departments and Agencies &ndash; for example, the Health Services Executive, the Departments of Health &amp; Children, Education &amp; Science, Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prisons Service, the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners and F&Aacute;S.  Through this on-going process of co-operation and partnership all of these bodies are playing important roles in the implementation of the overall Strategy and in meeting the changing challenges which arise.</P>
        <P>I believe that there are encouraging signs of progress over the past couple of years &mdash; be it in the areas of drug seizures, the expansion of treatment services, the establishment of the Regional Drugs Task Forces or prevention programmes in schools.</P>
        <P>This Government has placed great emphasis on progressing the 108 Actions of the National Drugs Strategy, as revised at the Mid-Term Review stage.  While the implementation of the Actions is very challenging, I am confident that the momentum built up around the various initiatives will see them implemented within the Strategy timescale which runs to the end of 2008.</P>

        <Quest> if he will expand on recent comments by the former Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy, Mr. Eoin Ryan TD, that the Government considered legalising heroin in 2001; if the Government is still considering such a step; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised that Mr. Eoin Ryan T.D., in his capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy, looked at various approaches to tackling the problem of drugs misuse in other jurisdictions.  This included policies implemented in the Netherlands and Switzerland involving the dispensing of heroin to a small number of people in designated clinics and under strict supervision.  The introduction of such a system in Ireland was discounted and no proposal on the matter was put to Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is not considering such a step at this time.  Indeed, it is my view that any move to legalise heroin would have wholly detrimental effects.  Heroin is a dangerous and damaging drug that causes enormous harm to individuals, their families and the communities in which they live.  Moreover, any softening of our legislation in regard to heroin would be out of line with the European Drugs Strategy, to which we are committed.</P>
        <P>The methadone maintenance programme has been an enormous aid in helping thousands of heroin users to manage their addiction.  Nearly <Col N="2061"/>8,000 people are now receiving methadone treatment.  Furthermore, while we must wait for the outcome of the recently commenced drugs prevalence survey to have more definite numbers, it is estimated by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs that the number of heroin users has stabilised or fallen slightly in Dublin and that it is at low levels nationwide.  Also, the report of Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation, which I established, is expected in the coming months and any recommendations therein in regard to rehabilitation will be considered at that stage.</P>
        <P>In short, I am entirely satisfied that there is no case for reviewing the current legal position in relation to heroin.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I was pleased to be invited to launch the research to which the Deputy refers, &ldquo;The Impact of Drugs on Families&rdquo; commissioned by Ballyfermot STAR.  Generally speaking, I would accept the thrust of the recommendations therein.  Overall, the report shows that, compared to the average Irish family, the well being of the family of a drug misuser is greatly affected by that drug misuse.  Furthermore, in discussing the role of families, it is important to bear in mind that the family of a drug misuser can be a considerable support and a resource in dealing with the problem, while at the same time often having needs of their own for which they require help and support.</P>
        <P>Under the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, the needs of families of drug misusers have been identified as a priority.  The 2005 Mid-Term Review of the National Drugs Strategy stressed the positive role that families can play across all of the pillars of the Strategy.  To reinforce this, a new action (Action 108) was included in the National Drugs Strategy at that time to encourage the prioritisation of the provision of family services in Local and Regional Drugs Task Force areas.  Progress on this issue is reflected in the participation of family support groups in a number of Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to this issue was further strengthened when family support work was identified as one of the priority issues for funding under the Emerging Needs Fund when it was set up in 2005.  This Fund was established to provide a flexible and timely response to evolving needs in regard to drugs misuse in <Col N="2062"/>Local Drugs Task Force areas.  Of the &euro;4m which was approved under this Fund, over &euro;350,000 was specifically targeted to family support projects.  Furthermore, over 25% of the funding allocated under the Emerging Needs fund was targeted to projects which involved some element of family support work.</P>
        <P>In addition, a number of other Departments and Agencies including the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Health Service Executive provide a range of services and supports for families, including families with drug misusers.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that support for families of problem drug users will continue to be a priority within the National Drugs Strategy.</P>

	<P>&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta sets out in its Strategic Development Plan 2005-2010 its commitment to support the development process for the provision of third-level education through Irish in the Gaeltacht.  In this regard, the strategic impact envisaged will accrue not only to the Irish language but also in terms of direct and indirect economic benefits to the Gaeltacht itself.  </P>
        <P>Arising from a longstanding commitment to the provision of academic programmes through Irish, allied to its location on the periphery of the largest Gaeltacht community, NUI Galway has identified the Irish language as one of seven strategic priorities in its published strategic plan for the period 2003-2008.  A core aspect of that plan is the development of a network of outreach centres in the Gaeltacht and, to date, three such centres have been established, with a fourth at planning stage.</P>
        <P>I understand that delivery of the accredited courses in these Gaeltacht outreach centres is funded largely by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta through its training and education fund.  I have been informed by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s that, in view of the substantial resources being committed by NUI Galway to developing these centres, a commitment has been given to the university that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s will not fund any other third-level institution to provide similar courses in the same areas.  This would accord with the non-displacement policy adopted by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and applied across the full spectrum of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s-funded enterprises whereby grant assistance is not made available to competitors of existing businesses within the same area.</P><Col N="2063"/>
        <P>Finally, I would like to clarify that it is open to any other institution to bring forward proposals for appropriate third-level courses for the consideration of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and, in this connection, I understand that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s has provided financial assistance to a number of institutions for the provision of third-level courses, including Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Waterford Institute of Technology, Letterkenny Institute of Technology and NUI Maynooth.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 24 and 47 together.</P>
        <P>The first Drug Prevalence Survey in Ireland and Northern Ireland (commissioned by the NACD and DAIRU) was carried out in 2002/2003 covering the 15-64 age group.  This survey indicated that lifetime prevalence for cocaine use among young adults (15-34 years) was 4.7% and that 2% of young adults had taken the drug in the previous year.  The second Drug Prevalence Survey, which has just commenced and which will run to April 2007 with first results appearing in autumn next year, will provide us with an up-to-date view of the levels of change in cocaine use among the general population and, in particular, the 15-34 age group which are most at risk.</P>
        <P>Anecdotal evidence, the increase in seizures by Garda&iacute; and the numbers reporting for treatment suggests that there has been a growth in the use of cocaine, albeit from a very low base.</P>
        <P>While I am confident that, through the implementation of the actions in the National Drugs Strategy, the problem of cocaine use can be and is being addressed, I also recognised the need for an overview of the emerging threat from cocaine.  To this end, I asked the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and the National Drug Strategy Team to prepare a joint briefing paper on the current situation with regards to cocaine use.  I received this report in September and my Department is currently considering it in consultation with the other Departments and Agencies involved.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile the evaluation of the interim funded Local Drugs Task Force projects, many of which address the issue of polydrug use including cocaine, is to commence shortly and decisions on their future will be made in the light of the results of their evaluation.  It is hoped that this process will be completed by mid 2007.</P>
        <P>While the work of many existing projects includes countering the threat of all drugs, including cocaine, a number of cocaine specific projects have been set up in the last two years.  I launched four pilot cocaine treatment projects to examine different methods of treatment for cocaine use, <Col N="2065"/>as well as providing training initiatives focusing on frontline workers.  Funding of almost &euro;400,000 has been provided by me to support these initiatives.  The four pilot projects are:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Problematic intranasal cocaine users (South Dublin);</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Poly drug users (South Inner city);</P>
     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Problematic female cocaine users (East Coast Area Health Board); and</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Intravenous cocaine users (North Inner City).</P>
        <P FLI="0">The evaluation of all but one of these projects (that project is still at an early stage) is nearing completion.</P>
        <P>Under the Emerging Needs Fund, which I established in 2005, 6 projects that specifically target the issue of cocaine use are being supported with a total funding package of &euro;421,285.  Five of the projects are focused on direct community based services for cocaine users located within existing services and the sixth has supported the development of an information booklet for dissemination in the Drugs Task Force area involved.</P>
        <P>There is no substitution treatment drug for cocaine and existing services such as counselling and behavioural therapy are the best treatments available.  In this context, the Health Service Executive has recruited additional counsellors and outreach workers in the last number of years and the training initiative mentioned above has been rolled out.</P>
        <P>I might also point out that all schools now have substance misuse prevention programmes.  In addition, the National Drugs Awareness Campaign focused specifically on cocaine use in one of their campaigns.  This campaign sought to dispel the image held by some that cocaine is a clean and safe drug with few detrimental consequences.</P>
        <P>The problems associated with cocaine use are not being underestimated and I believe that progress is being made in that regard.  I will continue to respond in a flexible and focused way as the situation evolves.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department operates, either directly or through bodies under its aegis, a wide range of schemes and projects which address rural and urban disadvantage throughout the country.  The main elements are described below.  </P><Col N="2066"/>
        <P el="10"><i>Dormant Accounts:</i></P>
        <P el="0">Disbursements from the Dormant Accounts Fund are designed to assist three broad categories of persons:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />those affected by economic and social disadvantage;</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />those affected by educational disadvantage; and</P>
     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />persons with a disability.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Government has approved the allocation of &euro;60 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund in 2006.  In this regard, &euro;24 million is being allocated towards projects tackling economic and social disadvantage; &euro;18 million towards projects tackling educational disadvantage and &euro;18 million towards projects assisting persons with a disability.</P>
       <P el="10"><i>CL&Aacute;R Programme:</i></P>
        <P el="0">The CL&Aacute;R programme is a targeted investment programme for rural areas that suffered more than a 35% drop in population between 1926 and 2002.  The programme covers parts of 22 counties and all of Co. Leitrim and benefits a population of nearly 727,000.  CL&Aacute;R schemes cover a wide variety of developments such as village, housing and schools enhancement, electricity conversion, roads, water supply, sewerage disposal, health, coastal, sports and community projects.</P>
      <P el="10"><i>Rural Social Scheme:</i></P>
       <P el="0">The Rural Social Scheme is also relevant in this regard.  The RSS aims to provide income support for low-income farmers and fishermen and certain services of benefit to rural communities.  The Scheme allows low-income farmers and fishermen to earn a supplementary income while, at the same time, rural communities benefit from their skills and talents in maintaining and improving local amenities and facilities.  Currently there are almost 2,500 participants on the Scheme.  An amount of &euro;43.322m has been provided in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for the RSS in 2006.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>RAPID  Programme:</i></P>
         <P el="0">I introduced the RAPID Leverage Schemes in 2004.  Through these schemes my Department directly funds schemes to provide playgrounds, improve traffic measures, improve health facilities, support sporting organisations as well as improve local authority housing estates and flat complexes.  All funds are matched by funding from other Departments and Agencies.  The schemes are aimed at small-scale capital works &ndash; works that require relatively small amounts of funding but can produce real and concrete benefits to communities.  They also allow the local community to have a direct input into deciding what projects will be undertaken by giving the Area Implementation Teams in each RAPID area the power to select the projects involved.</P><Col N="2067"/>
        <P>Also, my Department co-funds projects with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform such as installation of Community Based CCTV, tackling the problem of graffiti and once off Dept. of Justice initiated projects to support communities in RAPID areas.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>An Ghaeltacht:</i></P>
         <P el="0">In the case of community groups wishing to address such concerns in Gaeltacht areas, assistance may be available also from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, particularly in regard to language, cultural and community development activities.</P>
        <P>Island communities are assisted by the Department in a number of ways in order to provide enhanced living standards.  These include the provision of:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />regular subsidised transport services  to the mainland thus providing access to essential services;</P>
          <P LI="2" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />grants for public infrastructure on the islands such as health centres, libraries, piers, roads and water supplies;</P>
          <P LI="2" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />grants for community facilities such as community centres and playing pitches; and</P>
         <P LI="2" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />grants for the development of small enterprises on the islands.</P>
      <P el="10"><i>National Drugs Strategy:</i></P>
    <P el="0"><i>Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces:</i></P>
       <P el="0">Fourteen Local Drugs Task Forces and Ten Regional Drugs Task Forces have been set up covering all parts of the country.  Each Task Force is chaired by an independent chair and has representation from various Departments and agencies, including the community and voluntary sectors.  The role of the Drugs Task Forces is to implement the strategic plan which it produced for its region to ensure the development of a co-ordinated and integrated response to illicit drug use.  In 2006, the allocation for the implementation of the strategic plans of Drug Task Forces is in the region of &euro;20m.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>The Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF):</i></P>
         <P el="0">The Young Peoples Facilities &amp; Services Fund (YPFSF) was established in 1998 to assist in the development of facilities (including sport and recreational facilities) and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem existed or had the potential to develop.  By developing youth, sport and other recreational facilities, the YPFSF seeks to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people away from the potential dangers of misuse, into safe, non-threatening and constructive environments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Eighteen locations are covered &mdash; the 14 Local Drugs Task Force areas (12 in Dublin and the others in Bray and Cork) and 4 other urban areas <Col N="2068"/>of Limerick, Carlow, Waterford and Galway.  A total of &euro;106 million has been allocated to date under both capital and current projects.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Programme of Grants for Locally-Based Community and Voluntary Organisations:</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Programme of Grants for Locally-Based Community and Voluntary Organisations, funded by the Department of Community, Rural &amp; Gaeltacht Affairs, supports the activities of local voluntary and community groups addressing disadvantage in their community.  This programme offers grants to local voluntary and community groups in respect of refurbishment of premises, equipment as well as training, education and research grants.  Under the 2005 Programme, almost &euro;6 million in funding was awarded to over 500 local community and voluntary groups throughout the country.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Scheme of Community Support for Older People:</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Scheme of Community Support for Older People encourages and assists the community&rsquo;s support for older people by means of a community based grant scheme to improve the security of its older members.  The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  In 2005 funding in excess of &euro;2 million was awarded under the Scheme of Community Support for Older People to community and voluntary organisations throughout the country to improve the security of over 4,000 older people in their homes.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Community Services Programme:</i></P>
       <P el="0">The Community Services Programme programme provides funding totalling &euro;42 million to over 260 projects which provide services to their local communities.  The objective of the Programme is to support local community activity to address disadvantage, while providing employment opportunities for people from the following target groups:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />People with Disabilities;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />The Long Term Unemployed;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Travellers; and</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Lone Parents.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The activities of the projects are very varied and include community childcare services, services for the elderly or people with disabilities, rural transport projects, or projects to operate community halls and facilities.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Local Development Social Inclusion Programme:</i></P>
       <P el="0">The Local Development Social Inclusion Programme is a series of measures designed to counter disadvantage and to promote equality and social and economic inclusion.</P><Col N="2069"/>
        <P>The Programme specifically targets the following groups:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Long-term unemployed;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Socially and economically disadvantaged women;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Young people at risk;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Travellers;</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />People with disabilities;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Homeless people;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Ethnic minorities;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Lone parents;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Ex-prisoners; and</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Low income households.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This Programme is managed by Pobal on behalf of my Department.  The programme is delivered at local level by:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />38 Area Partnerships;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />31 Community Partnerships; and</P>
 <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />2 Territorial Employment Pacts.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Community Development Programme:</i></P>
       <P el="0">Established in 1990 in recognition of the role of community development in tackling the causes and effects of poverty and disadvantage, the programme is designed to reduce social exclusion by targeting support at disadvantaged and socially excluded communities in order to improve their capacity to benefit from social and economic development.  All projects are managed by local voluntary management committees.  182 projects are currently supported under the programme.  These are located in recognised disadvantaged areas nationwide, in both urban and rural areas.  Funding of &euro;24m has been allocated to the programme for 2006.  Projects are expected to operate as a resource to the communities in which they are located with their main purpose being to work with the community in identifying and tackling those issues which have resulted in a lack of positive community development.  Projects are typically concerned with the needs of women and children, lone parent families, the unemployed, the elderly, young people at risk, Travellers, those with disabilities, new communities and other disadvantaged groups.  Projects provide facilities such as meeting rooms, cr&egrave;ches, office facilities, training or education projects designed to meet the needs of disadvantaged groups in their communities.  Projects are funded on a contract basis which facilitates the employment of staff and also cover project overheads and administration.  Posts covered under the programme include co-ordinator, development worker and administrator.  Many projects use the CDP structure and funding to attract funding from other sources including statutory agencies.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 79 of 16 May 2006 his views on whether his response to the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee has been adequate; if he has made further changes in regard to putting in place a proper control and accountability framework; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As indicated in my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 79 of 16 May 2006, my Department has taken account of the issues raised by the Public Accounts Committee in its report of March 2006 and we continue to have regard to these recommendations in the ongoing management of our grants schemes.</P>
        <P>The payment arrangements set out in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 79 were those operated by my Department for the 2005 Programme of Grants for Locally-Based for Community and Voluntary Organisations.  I launched the 2006 Programme of Grants in August this year and updated the arrangements for the phased payment of grants.</P>
        <P>Under the 2006 Programme, for grants of up to &euro;10,000, 90% is paid on receipt of a signed contract/letter of offer, with the balance of 10% paid retrospectively on the basis of full vouched expenditure.  Grants of over &euro;10,000 are paid in three instalments of 50% on receipt of a signed contract/letter of offer, a further 40% on receipt of an expenditure report for the first instalment and 10% retrospectively on the basis of full vouched expenditure.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that these arrangements strike the appropriate balance between a proper control and accountability framework, as recommended by the Public Accounts Committee, and facilitating the voluntary, locally-based groups covered by this Programme in advancing their projects.</P>

        <P>Notwithstanding this, my Department has provided some financial assistance to local authorities in order to facilitate improved fire fighting services on islands.

        <P>With respect to Ireland, the data relates to 2002/03 and originated from the Drug Prevalence Survey undertaken on my behalf by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs.  While Ireland is, as the Deputy points out, among the top five countries in relation to the highest life time prevalence estimates among young people aged 15-24 (5.5%), in relation to last year prevalence (1.1%) and last month prevalence (0.1%), it is among the countries with the lowest prevalence.  This might suggest that, while there may have been a significant level of experimentation with magic mushrooms, evidence of sustained use of this drug was not emerging.</P>
        <P>The Drug Prevalence Survey for 2006/07 currently underway, with first reports due in late 2007, will provide us with a clearer picture on any current trends.</P>
        <P>Ireland, as the report points out, is one of 6 EU countries that have tightened legislation in regard to magic mushrooms since 2001.  In 2005 with a growing awareness of an increased incidence of availability and visibility of the drug, and a tragic death in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, an examination of the legislation in the area was undertaken and this resulted with a Declaration Order (S.I. No. 55 of 2006) being signed on 31 January 2006 declaring magic mushrooms, whether raw or processed, to be controlled substances for the purposes of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science has implemented substance misuse prevention programmes through the Social, Personal and Health Education Programme (SPHE), which is compulsory in all primary and post-primary schools.  A consequence of this policy is that all students are equipped with knowledge about the dangers of drugs misuse including magic mushrooms.  Also the dangers of the drugs are emphasised from time to time in drug prevention programmes.</P>
        <P>Overall, I feel that the steps taken in regard to magic mushrooms in recent times are greatly reducing the risk of experimentation with these drugs by young people in Ireland.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware my Department administers and delivers a wide range of programmes.  So as to ensure that these programmes are delivered effectively, efficiently and that the objectives of these programmes are being achieved, this Department has since its establishment developed and put in place various systems of effectiveness and performance monitoring, control, review and evaluation for these programmes.</P>

	<P>As I have already indicated in response to similar Questions in this House, the development of a clear statement on the part of the Government in relation to the Irish language and its importance as a whole has been recognised as a key issue and very real progress has recently been made to significantly advance this issue.  </P>
        <P>It should also be noted, of course, that meaningful and significant advances, in line with recommendations made in the Gaeltacht Commission&rsquo;s Report in 2002 and in the context of the continuing implementation of the Official Languages Act, continue to be made.  As the Deputy will be aware, noteworthy progress has also been achieved regarding the status of Irish in the European Union.  A number of new initiatives continue to be implemented in Gaeltacht areas, including the development of public awareness measures aimed at the Gaeltacht community in particular, as well as the continuing roll-out of the language planning initiative.  These practical measures continue to further consolidate the language.  The Deputy will also be aware that significant resources continue to be made available to support the work of Foras na Gaeilge in promoting Irish on an all-island basis.</P>

	<P>The maintenance and upkeep of housing estates and flat complexes and the physical environment within those areas is a matter in the first place for my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities.</P>
        <P>The monies available under the Rapid Leverage Schemes, to which the Deputy refers, enables local communities to have a direct say in the prioritising of locally promoted capital works that produce real benefits to communities.  The matching funding available under these schemes available to Departments with primary responsibilities <Col N="2076"/>enables projects designed to improve the environments of local authority housing estates and flat complexes as well as the provision of playgrounds, traffic calming measures, health facilities, CCTV, and sporting facilities in RAPID areas.</P>
        <P>The &euro;7.8m available from my Department in 2005 under these schemes generated a further &euro;8m in commitments from other Departments giving an overall commitment to the investment of &euro;15.8m in RAPID areas.  This is in addition to mainstream funding for projects and services in such areas.  I am hopeful that the funding available from my Department this year and in 2007 and 2008 will secure similar additional prioritised investment.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 35, 51 and 52 together.  </P>
        <P>Arising from the review of local and community development structures which I initiated three years ago in conjunction with my colleagues, the Ministers for Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Government agreed a series of measures in January 2004 designed to improve delivery of services on the ground, arrangements under which community and local development initiatives are delivered and improve cohesion and focus across various measures.  Since then, I have overseen a radical change process that is informed by the following guiding principles: <Col N="2077"/>improving on the ground services; streamlining structures so as to avoid overlaps, duplication and undue administrative overheads; bringing transparency, co-ordination and improved control to the funding and operation of local and community development measures; and strengthening the democratic accountability of agencies and providers in this area.</P>
        <P>As a first step towards improving on the ground services, I mandated City and County Development Boards (CDBS) to oversee the cohesion process at local level and to facilitate the development of proposals by local agencies with a view to achieving better co-ordination of service delivery.  To this end, I allocated &euro;3,248,600 to the CDBs and &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta during 2004 in respect of proposals aimed at improving linkages between local agencies, support multi-agency actions and promote sharing of resources to maximise the impact of available funding.</P>
        <P>The 2005/2006 phase of the process aims to improve the alignment of the multiple local and community development agencies by the end of this year in a way that removes any overlaps and duplication and maximises available resources for the benefit of local communities.  The intention is that, from 2007, there will be one unified local development structure providing full coverage in any given area and fewer structures overall in the country.  In the rural context, this means that in future one agency will be responsible for delivering local and rural development programmes, making it far easier for local people to access such services.  At present, partnerships do not have full area cover and cannot reach those affected by disadvantage who live outside their catchment areas.  This serious impediment will be addressed by the new arrangements.  The new streamlined structures will have full area cover thereby enabling the State to deliver programmes such as the local development social inclusion programme on a nationwide basis.</P>
        <P>At this stage, 22 of the local authority areas and na Gaeltachta&iacute; have fully agreed the integrated structures which will provide full coverage.  A total of &euro;4,836,927 was awarded to CDB&rsquo;s in respect of agreed cohesion initiatives during 2005, including &euro;1,463,400 for volunteering measures.  So far this year, I have approved the allocation of &euro;3,295,762 for agreed cohesion measures and &euro;760,600 to promote volunteering locally.  Discussions are ongoing in the remaining areas and I am confident that arrangements will have been finalised in all areas by the end of the year.</P>

	<P>The function of the Placenames Commission is to advise me, as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, on: (a) Irish forms of placenames for legal purposes as provided for in Part 5 of the Official Languages Act 2003, including: the placenames of Ireland as they are defined in section 31 of the Act in order to confirm the Irish forms of those placenames, and preparation of placename orders as provided for in section 32 of the Act; (b) Irish forms of placenames not given in the Act, that is to say streetnames; (c) publication and official usage of Irish forms of placenames; (d) development of research and study in relation to placenames in third level institutions and other educational institutions; (e) appropriate marketing on the research of the Placenames Branch; and (f) other matters pertaining to the placenames of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Commission is appointed for a three-year term and a new Commission has been appointed with effect from 10 September 2006.  During the course of its three-year term of the appointment, the outgoing Commission met on eighteen occasions and advised me on matters relating to ten Placenames Orders which I have made under the provisions of the Official Languages Act 2003.  These related to the official Irish versions of the placenames of counties Kilkenny, Louth, Limerick, Monaghan, Waterford, Tipperary and Offaly; Gaeltacht areas; centres and districts of population; and counties and provinces.</P>
        <P>As indicated above, I have recently appointed a new Commission.  The current membership is set out in the following table.  The Commission does not have a separate budget.

	<P>Ten Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) have been established to cover all parts of the country not covered by a Local Drugs Task Force, thus achieving full coverage of the country.  The RDTFs are charged with researching, developing, implementing and monitoring a co-ordinated response to illicit drug use at regional level.  Each Task Force has an independent Chairperson and is made of representatives from the various Departments and agencies, as well as the community and voluntary sectors.  The RDTFs produced strategic plans for their respective regions, having regard to evidence available on the extent and specific location of illicit drug use in the region.  </P>
        <P>An initial total allocation of &euro;5m has been approved in 2006 to the ten RDTFs to commence <Col N="2080"/>implementation of their plans. It is envisaged that funding will be increased on an incremental basis to achieve the full roll-out of the RDTF plans currently estimated to cost &euro;12m on an annual basis.  Meanwhile, nine of the ten RDTFs now have full-time co-ordinators in place and the rate of progress is increasing.</P>
        <P>The National Drug Strategy Team has been working closely with the RDTFs to get their programmes up and running. It is envisaged that 80 projects will be started by the end of 2006.  These projects range from prevention initiatives and work with youth to treatment services and outreach work.  Overall I am satisfied with the progress being made by the RDTFs and the increasing level of co-operation and partnership which is evident as they become more established.  I have no doubt that the rate of progress being achieved will accelerate over the coming year.</P>

In April of this year, I made Regulations that updated the list of public bodies covered under the Act.  I have made 10 Placenames Orders to date including An tOrd&uacute; Logainmneacha (Ceantair Ghaeltachta) 2004.  I have this week published and laid before each House of the Oireachtas a draft of regulations that I propose to make pursuant to section 9(1) of the Act.  The draft regulations deal with the use of the Irish and English languages in pre-recorded oral announcements, on stationery and on signage by public bodies.</P>
        <P>At my request, Foras na Gaeilge has developed an accreditation system for Irish language translators.  I understand that the first panel of accredited translators has been established and is available to public bodies and the general public.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the achievements I have just outlined, I am fully satisfied with the progress made to date in the implementation of the Act.  I am also satisfied that the public bodies are able to fulfil their obligations under the Act and that they have accepted the challenge with a positive attitude and in the proper spirit.  I should remind Deputies that each language scheme prepared by the public bodies under section 11 of the Act has been drawn up in the context of the resources &mdash; both in terms of finances and personnel &mdash; currently available or to be made available to bodies during the lifetime of each scheme.  As I have stated from the beginning, while it will not be possible to achieve everything overnight, my main objective is that improvements in the range and quality of services available through Irish will be achieved over the lifetime of a number of schemes, subject to demand.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 45 together.  </P>
        <P>My Department is committed to relocating 140 posts to new headquarters at Knock Airport.  OPW have indicated that the headquarters building will be in place there by mid 2008.  To further the decentralisation process, 68 posts have been assigned to temporary offices in Tubbercurry, Co <Col N="2082"/>Sligo which opened in July of this year.  The intention is that these posts will be relocated to Knock Airport when the new building is ready.  The Department&rsquo;s programme for decentralisation to Na Forbacha, Galway involves relocating 10 posts.  8 posts have already relocated there and it is expected that the balance will be in place next year.</P>
        <P>Pobal is relocating 40 posts to Clifden, 21 of which are now in place in temporary offices there.  A selection process to fill a further 3 posts is ongoing and there is scope to increase those numbers to 29 if required.  The full complement of staff will be relocated when Pobal&rsquo;s permanent offices are complete, which is expected early in 2008.  In relation to the proposed relocation of Foras na Gaeilge posts to Gaoth Dobhair, please see my reply to other questions being answered today.</P>

	<P>Addressing crime is a matter, in the first instance, for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, the Deputy will be aware that my Department operates, either directly or through bodies under its aegis, a range of schemes and projects which address rural and urban disadvantage throughout the country.  The main elements are described below.  </P>
        <P el="10"><i>Dormant Accounts:</i></P>
        <P el="0">Disbursements from the Dormant Accounts Fund are designed to tackle economic, social and educational disadvantage and to assist persons with a disability.  In line with the commitment in the Dormant Accounts Disbursement Plan, allocations from the Fund are prioritised towards <Col N="2083"/>those areas designated as most disadvantaged (i.e.  RAPID, Local Drugs Task Force and CL&Aacute;R areas).  In July this year, details concerning the allocation of &euro;11.35 million towards 188 priority projects in RAPID areas were announced.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>CL&Aacute;R Programme:</i></P>
        <P el="0"><i>Local Authority Housing Estate Enhancement Scheme:</i></P>
        <P el="0">The purpose of this Scheme is to provide funding, with Local Authorities, for the enhancement of Local Authority Housing Estates through works on landscaping, paving, etc.  This Scheme is co-funded with Local Authority on a &euro; for &euro; basis with local contribution.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Community Services Programme:</i></P>
         <P el="0">The wide range of community activities funded by this Programme includes the staffing costs of operating community CCTV systems.  The scheme also provides funding for the provision of supervision and security of community halls and facilities.</P>
     <P el="10"><i>RAPID  Programme:</i></P>
        <P el="0">I introduced the RAPID Leverage Schemes in 2004.  Through these schemes my Department, in tandem with Departments that have primary responsibility, funds schemes to provide playgrounds, improve traffic measures, improve health facilities, support sporting organisations as well as improve local authority housing estates and flat complexes.  Funding from other Departments and Agencies is matched by RAPID Leverage funding.  The schemes are aimed at small-scale capital works &ndash; works that require relatively small amounts of funding but can produce real and concrete benefits to communities.  They also allow the local community to have a direct input into deciding what projects will be undertaken by giving the Area Implementation Teams in each RAPID area the power to select the projects involved.</P>
        <P>Also, my Department co-funds projects with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform such as installation of Community Based CCTV, tackling the problem of graffiti and once off Dept. of Justice initiated projects to support communities in RAPID areas.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Community Development Programme:</i></P>
        <P el="0">Established in 1990 in recognition of the role of community development in tackling the causes and effects of poverty and disadvantage, the programme is designed to reduce social exclusion by targeting support at disadvantaged and socially excluded communities in order to improve their capacity to benefit from social and economic development.  All projects are managed by local voluntary management committees.  182 projects are currently supported under the programme.  These are located in recognised disadvantaged areas nationwide, in both urban and rural <Col N="2084"/>areas.  Funding of &euro;24m has been allocated to the programme for 2006.  Projects are expected to operate as a resource to the communities in which they are located with their main purpose being to work with the community in identifying and tackling those issues which have resulted in a lack of positive community development.  Projects are typically concerned with the needs of women and children, lone parent families, the unemployed, the elderly, young people at risk, Travellers, those with disabilities, new communities and other disadvantaged groups.  Projects provide facilities such as meeting rooms, cr&egrave;ches, office facilities, training or education projects designed to meet the needs of disadvantaged groups in their communities.  Projects are funded on a contract basis which facilitates the employment of staff and also cover project overheads and administration.  Posts covered under the programme include co-ordinator, development worker and administrator.  Many projects use the CDP structure and funding to attract funding from other sources including statutory agencies.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>National Drugs Strategy:</i></P>
       <P el="0"><i>Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces:</i></P>
       <P el="0">Fourteen Local Drugs Task Forces and Ten Regional Drugs Task Forces have been set up covering all parts of the country.  Each Task Force is chaired by an independent chair and has representation from various Departments and agencies, including the community and voluntary sectors.  The role of the Drugs Task Forces is to implement the strategic plan which it produced for its region to ensure the development of a co-ordinated and integrated response to illicit drug use.  In 2006, the allocation for the implementation of the strategic plans of Drug Task Forces is in the region of &euro;20m.</P>
       <P el="10"><i>The Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF):</i></P>
      <P el="0">The Young Peoples Facilities &amp; Services Fund (YPFSF) was established in 1998 to assist in the development of facilities (including sport and recreational facilities) and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem existed or had the potential to develop.  By developing youth, sport and other recreational facilities, the YPFSF seeks to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people away from the potential dangers of misuse, into safe, non-threatening and constructive environments.  Eighteen locations are covered &mdash; the 14 Local Drugs Task Force areas (12 in Dublin and the others in Bray and Cork) and 4 other urban areas of Limerick, Carlow, Waterford and Galway.  A total of &euro;106 million has been allocated to date under both capital and current projects.</P>

        <Quest> the efforts <Col N="2085"/>being made to liaise with local communities regarding the benefits to the entire community of rehabilitation services for drug users; his views on whether an information campaign on this important issue should be launched; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It has long been an aim of the National Drugs Strategy to convince communities of the benefits to the drug misuser, his/her family and the whole community of placing drug treatment and rehabilitation services in local communities to meet local demand.  Indeed local provision of these services greatly helps to avoid the kind of problems that those who oppose such developments tend to fear.</P>
        <P>The Local Drugs Task Forces, and the more recently established Regional Drugs Task Forces, provide the key mechanism for the co-ordination of mainstream treatment and rehabilitation services in their areas, while also facilitating the participation of local communities and voluntary organisations in the planning, design and delivery of some services.  Drugs Task Forces are made up of nominees from Departments and agencies working in the region, involved, as well as community and voluntary representatives.</P>
        <P>Rehabilitation of problem drug users is a key element of all Local Drug Task Force and Regional Drug Task Force plans, and gaining acceptance of local service provision has been a central part of the activities of the Task Forces.  This has been achieved in many Drugs Task Force areas and where local opposition was encountered this was dealt with at a local level.  Indeed there is an increasing acceptance within most communities of the need for local treatment and rehabilitation services, with a few unfortunate exceptions, some of which have got extensive media coverage recently.  We will continue to facilitate local endeavours and work to convince reluctant communities through the success of facilities in other areas.  The need for a wider information campaign will be kept under review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 58 together.  </P>
        <P>I am pleased to say Comhairle na Tuaithe agreed its Countryside Recreation Strategy at the end of August.  It was presented to me in early September and I launched the report at the National Ploughing Championships in Tullow, Co. Carlow last week.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware Comhairle na Tuaithe comprises representatives of State bodies with an interest in the countryside, the farming organisations and recreational users of the countryside and is chaired by my Department.  Comhairle na Tuaithe&rsquo;s strategy defines the scope and vision for countryside recreation and it sets out the broad principles under which Comhairle na Tuaithe recommends that sustainable countryside recreation can be managed into the future.  All its members, with the exception of the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association, have endorsed the report.</P>
        <P>Comhairle na Tuaithe&rsquo;s vision for countryside recreation encompasses a countryside, which welcomes all visitors who practise responsible use of the resource, and where the rights and responsibilities of both landowners and recreational users are respected.  The report sets out the broad principles under which it recommends that sustainable countryside recreation can be managed into the future.  It also set out the tasks which Comhairle na Tuaithe recommends should be undertaken to achieve this vision and recommends the actions needed to be taken and by which bodies.</P>
        <P>I welcome the report and would like to put on record of this house my thanks to the members of Comhairle na Tuaithe for all of their hard work and dedication in coming to this agreement.  Its membership is diverse and the organisations represented have their own individual views on the issues presented in the report but have arrived at a consensus on its contents.  I will study the recommended strategy and will consult as appropriate with other Departments and public bodies on the wider recommendations in the report.</P>
        <P>I intend taking a number of immediate actions arising from my initial consideration of the report.  I am making &euro;1.5 million funding available for capital work under the Rural Social Scheme and I am asking the implementing bodies, which are in most cases LEADER companies, to give particular priority to walkways and ancillary services.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has already identified a selection of looped walks which it has publicised in its brochure &ndash; Walking Ireland &ndash; and on its website.  My Department in consultation with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the National Waymarked <Col N="2088"/>Ways are identifying further looped walks and waymarked ways for development.  Details will be made available over the coming weeks and months of the work required to bring these up to the best international standards.  It is my intention to set aside a further &euro;1.5 million this purpose.</P>
        <P>The Rural Development package 2007-2013 offers a trebling of EU and National funding for rural development under a LEADER type programme.  Three of my priorities under this programme will be: the development of recreational tourism including the development of facilities for walking, cycling, angling, pony trekking, bird watching etc and ancillary facilities such as car parking, and other services such as signage, village renewal etc.; the complementary development of the broader rural tourism package such as upgraded accommodation, food tourism and other services; and the development of small or regional food sectors to add significantly to the unique experience for our visitors.</P>
        <P>My Department also is actively pursuing the possibility of using former railway infrastructure as recreational trails for cycling etc. with the Department of Transport and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  I have reached agreement with F&aacute;ilte Ireland for the employment of up to 10 Walk Managers under the Community Services Programme to promote walking tourism in areas where there are clusters of suitable, accessible walks.  These Walk Managers will act as a contact person for walking tourists and will provide a wide range of support and advice.</P>
        <P>The Deputies will be aware that Comhairle na Tuaithe agreed the key features necessary for countryside code development with a focus on the potential application of the internationally-recognised Leave No Trace initiative.  A branch of Leave No Trace has recently been established in Ireland and I am pleased to announce that my Department will be supporting that organisation by allocating &euro;30,000 towards the employment of a Strategic Co-ordinator.  The Co-ordinator will be involved in actively promoting the Leave No Trace message among the many countryside recreation groups around the country.</P>
        <P>I have also allocated &euro;90,000 (&euro;30,000 per annum over the next three years) to Wicklow Uplands Council and Wicklow Rural Partnership to provide a network of access routes over private lands in areas of high scenic and amenity value in County Wicklow.  This project is an example of how community based solutions can be found to issues such as access to the countryside and is very much in keeping with Comhairle na Tuaithe&rsquo;s recommendations.  I see the project as a way of piloting some of the suggestions in Comhairle na Tuaithe&rsquo;s report and am very pleased to see that Wicklow County Council have joined my Department in funding the project.</P>
        <P>Comhairle na Tuaithe has raised a number of legal issues to be addressed.  These include that the Attorney General be requested to examine <Col N="2089"/>restating and/or reflecting in legislation the current common law position in relation to the protection of landowners&rsquo; property rights where recreational access is allowed on their land along with a proposal that the Law Reform Commission be requested to make recommendation on the broad issue of access to the countryside for recreational users.  I am concerned to ensure that these matters are addressed as a matter of priority.  To expedite matters I am establishing an expert group, comprising a Senior Counsel and officials from the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and from my own Department to urgently advise on tackling each of the legal issues raised.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The critical issue is the level of overall funding made available for the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy and in that regard I am fully satisfied with the amount of &euro;43m made available this year under the Vote of my own Department.  The earmarking of particular revenues for specific expenditure purposes is generally avoided as it is much more cumbersome to operate than utilising a central fund.  In any case, the allocation of drugs-related CAB money to drugs misuse programmes would imply uncertain and variable amounts coming available and the process of releasing such money takes a number of years.  Furthermore, the allocation of CAB receipts would not necessarily imply an increase in overall funding. </P>
        <P>The fact is that the Government&rsquo;s overall spend on drugs initiatives amounts to much more than the amount taken in by CAB over the years.  For example, in 2005 in the region of &euro;195m was allocated by the Government for drugs related programmes across the Votes of a number of Departments.  This figure far outstrips any CAB receipts that would have been available in the same period.  The allocation of &euro;43m to my Department&rsquo;s Vote for the Drugs Initiative/Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund in 2006 represents an increase of 37% on the original 2005 <Col N="2090"/>allocation and a massive 61% increase on the 2004 allocation.  Overall, I am satisfied that current Government expenditure on drugs is sufficient to meet the needs of those involved in tackling the effects of the misuse of drugs.</P>

	<P>I launched the Research Outcome Study in Ireland (ROSIE) evaluating drug treatment effectiveness in September.  The study shows that the Government&rsquo;s investment in drug treatment is producing tangible positive results.  This NACD-commissioned study (under Action 99 of the NDS) involved 404 people who were recruited when entering treatment for opiate use.  They were then interviewed periodically and changes were observed and documented.  The study group included those on methadone maintenance, structured detoxification and abstinence-based treatment, involving both in-patient and out-patient settings.  The geographical spread represented the provision of services and inner-city, urban and rural areas were involved.  There was a 75/25 mix of male and female participants.  </P>
        <P>The key messages from the outcomes at the end of the first year are as follows: significant reductions in heroin and other drug use; 27% abstinent from all drugs after 1 year (this compared to 7% at treatment intake); extensive <Col N="2091"/>reductions in drug injecting (both in the number of days and the number of times per day); improvements in physical and mental health; extensive reductions in criminal activity; increased contact with health and social care services; and low mortality rate (2 people); I welcome this research which provides reassurance that the Government&rsquo;s drug treatment initiatives are showing positive results, thus benefiting drug misusers, their families and their wider communities.  The expansion of treatment and rehabilitation services, where necessary, has always been a cornerstone of the National Drugs Strategy and this will continue to be the case.  Meanwhile, I have decided to extend the ROSIE study to track those who participated in it over a three-year period so that the medium term impact of treatment can be monitored.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On 4th January 2006, following Government approval, I announced details of the allocation of &euro;24 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund for the purpose of supporting programmes and projects tacking economic and social disad<Col N="2092"/>vantage.  The rollout of these programmes is well underway.  Within this category I announced in August last that the Government has approved the allocation of &euro;574,989 from the Dormant Accounts Fund to six projects targeted at vulnerable immigrant families.  The key objective of this funding is to provide supports that will increase the employability of vulnerable immigrant families who have been granted refugee status or who have been granted leave to remain in the State.  Projects include pre-employment training programmes and strategies, job-seeking programmes and measures to promote access to employment.  Full details of the awards are included at Appendix 1.</P>
        <P>The integration of refugees and other non-nationals into Irish society is an urgent and important issue.  This funding is a further step in the process of integration and is directed primarily at facilitating access to employment in the short to medium term.  This funding is additional and complementary to initiatives in respect of the integration of legally resident immigrants taken by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has a coordinating role in this area.</P>
        <P>In this context, the Deputy may be aware that my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform recently decided to establish a &euro;5 million Fund to support integration related activities to cover all legally resident migrants, including immigrant families.  A total of &euro;2 million will be used to fund integration initiatives both from the new Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Services and projects linked to the National Action Plan against Racism.  The balance of &euro;3 million will be used to fund projects from NGOs (&euro;1 million) and local partnerships (&euro;2 million) and will be administered on behalf of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform by Pobal.</P><Col N="2091"/>

Accordingly, no consultations took place with my Department in this regard.</P>
        <P>However, in the period leading up to the imminent chief executive vacancy, contacts were made between officials of my Department and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta regarding proper procedures to be adhered to in relation to the appointment of a new chief executive, and in matters relating to the severance arrangements for the outgoing chief executive.  In the course of this dialogue, my officials emphasised that the severance arrangements were required to be in line with the conditions set down by the Department of Finance in May 1998 regarding Severance and Early Retirement for Chief Executives of State Sponsored Bodies.</P>

	<P>Through the implementation structures of the National Drugs Strategy, my officials have on-going contact with representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the prevalence of crack cocaine in the country is among the issues discussed from time to time.  I also periodically meet senior officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to review developments in regard to illicit drugs. </P>
        <P>The Garda&iacute; are satisfied that the use of crack cocaine is largely confined to a small geographical area in Dublin.  Furthermore, they have had some success in targeting the supply and use of this drug in that area.  Also, in my visits to various Drugs Task Force areas in the past year or so, the issue of crack cocaine did not arise to any great <Col N="2095"/>extent in my discussions with community representatives and others on the nature of the drug problem in their regions.</P>
        <P>I am confident that, through the implementation of the actions in the National Drugs Strategy, the projects and initiatives operated through the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces and the operations of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the problem of crack cocaine use can be, and is being, addressed.  Each of the Drugs Task Forces has in place an action plan to tackle drug use in their area based on their own identified priorities and they continue to have ongoing contact with their local communities.</P>
        <P>However, I fully accept that a potential danger exists that the use of crack cocaine could spread rapidly and I assure the Deputy that I will continue to monitor the situation and that I will ensure that any necessary steps are taken to address increased threats, should they arise.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September, 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed that the personnel strength (all ranks) of Miltown Malbay Garda Station as at 4 October, 2006 was 3.  Miltown Malbay Garda Station forms part of the Clare Division.  The personnel strength (all ranks) of the <Col N="2096"/>Clare Division as at 31 December, 1997 and 4 October, 2006 was 219 and 319, respectively, representing an increase of 100 (or 46%) in the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Clare Division during that period.</P>
        <P>In addition, I would point out to the Deputy that the Division&rsquo;s resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Miltown Malbay Garda station will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my previous reply to Parliamentary Question No. 445 of 27 September, 2006 regarding the opening hours of Ardee Garda Station.</P>
        <P>Garda personnel assigned to Ardee Garda Station, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are the responsibility of Garda management and are continually monitored and reviewed.  I am informed that such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed that Local Garda Management report that there is a local Garda presence between the hours of 8 a.m. and 2 a.m. on weekdays and 8 a.m. to 4 a.m. at weekends.  During the remaining periods Garda&iacute; attached to the District Headquarters Station at Navan cover the Ardee Sub-District.</P>
        <P>Resources are augmented from within the Division/District as required.  The area is also patrolled by the District Detective Unit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of the acquisition of a prison site at Thornton was included in the 2005 report of the Comptroller <Col N="2099"/>and Auditor General at the request of the Public Accounts Committee and will be examined by them in October.  The relevant officials from my Department will be present to account in detail to the Public Accounts Committee on all the issues raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  </P>
        <P>The Public Accounts Committee is the proper forum to address these matters and I am reluctant to show any lack of respect to that Committee by trying to anticipate or pre-empt their examination.  However, I have to note that the Comptroller and Auditor General does not state that too much was paid for Thornton.  Rather, to quote his main conclusion, he states that &ldquo;a well-managed, third party approach might have allowed the Prison Service to procure suitable land at a  much lower price than was paid for the land at Thornton&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Let us be clear that in this context a &ldquo;third party approach&rdquo; means that a site would be acquired in secret.  No one would be told that the State was involved or that land was being sought for the most significant penal development in the history of the State.  There would have been no public advertisement, no information given in D&aacute;il answers and a very restricted assessment process.</P>
        <P>The Accounting Officer of my Department has already gone on record stating that in the light of the nature of this particular project and to ensure proper accountability, a deliberate and principled decision was taken not to use a third party approach.  The strategic, moral and practical reasons for that decision are outlined in the report and have not been contradicted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s Accounting Officer is satisfied that it would not have been possible to obtain a site as suitable as Thornton for any less than was paid.  The information available to me is that no site of comparable quality and suitability closer to Dublin City Centre has changed hands in recent times for less than what was paid for Thornton.</P>
        <P>I have already met with representatives of the local community concerning the decision to build the new prison complex at Thornton Hall.  In addition, there have been a number of meetings held between officials from the Irish Prison Service and members of the local community.  Any further such requests for meeting will be facilitated by the Irish Prison Service, where possible.</P>
        <P>Finally, any requests for visits to the current Mountjoy Prison Complex by members or officials of Dublin City Council will be considered by the Irish Prison Service on foot of a formal request setting out the context and purpose of the proposed visit.</P>

	<P>The two persons referred to are a married couple, both Romanian nationals, who previously applied for asylum in the State.</P>
        <P>The first person concerned arrived in the State on 10 March, 1995 and applied for asylum.  Initially he was refused status as a refugee but subsequently was granted temporary leave to remain in the State, on 26 August, 1999.  The leave to remain was further extended until 15 September, 2006.  He has applied for renewal of this leave to remain and a decision is expected in due course.</P>
        <P>The second person concerned arrived in the State on 19 November, 2000 and applied for asylum.  She was refused status as a refugee.  A deportation order was signed in respect of her on 30 November, 2001 following consideration of her case under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996.  A notification of the deportation order issued to her last known address on 7 December, 2001 requiring her to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau on 14 December 2001.  The person failed to attend and was deemed to have evaded deportation.</P>
        <P>The couple married in Dublin on 28 March 2002.  The second person concerned has since applied for revocation of the deportation order based on her marriage to a long-term resident, her own time in the State and promise of employment in her husband&rsquo;s business.  Consideration is being given to this application at present and a decision will issue in due course.</P>

	<P>One of my Department&rsquo;s functions is the promotion of social inclusion for people with disabilities through raising awareness of disability equality and access issues.  My Department has set in motion a number of initiatives aimed at achieving this goal which have proved successful over the past number of years.  The following are the main activities currently undertaken by my Department in this area:</P><Col N="2101"/>
        <P>The European Commission supports events at European level to mark the UN&rsquo;s International Day for Persons with Disabilities.  EU Governments support their own National Information Days on Disability.  Ireland has held a National Information Day on Disability in each of the last nine years.  This year marks the tenth National Information Day on Disabilities and my Department together with the Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) will run a primary schools essay writing competition, under the theme of &ldquo;Games we can all play&rdquo;.  The aim is to get younger children thinking about people with disabilities in a positive way, through the sharing of ideas and through interaction with people with disabilities.  The competition culminates in a national prize giving ceremony in Dublin and this year the winning entries will be used to supplement the revised primary schools curriculum in Physical Education.</P>
        <P>My Department supported the production of a third television series of &ldquo;Three60&rdquo; in 2006.  The programme, produced by Animo Communications, was shown on RTE1 between July and August of 2006.  The main sponsors of the programme were F&Aacute;S, Rehab, RTE and my Department.  The series, consisting of nine half-hour programmes focused on people with disabilities and their families and carers.</P>
        <P>My Department is also supporting the production of the seventh series of the television programme &ldquo;About the House&rdquo;.  The programme is produced by Earth Horizon Productions and will consist of 13 programmes to be screened on RTE1 between September and December 2006.  The &ldquo;About the House&rdquo; series tackles issues of accessible architectural design and the application of building regulations; it will also highlight accessibility issues such as Part M of the building regulations, adaptation and independent living for those with disabilities.</P>

	<P>The person concerned, a Nigerian national, arrived in the State on 24 November, 2004 and applied for asylum.  Her application was refused following consideration of the case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and on appeal by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed by letter dated 27 October, 2005 that the Minister was proposing to make a deportation order in respect of her.  She was, in accordance with the Act, given the option of making representations, within 15 working days, setting out the reasons why she should not be deported i.e. be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before the deportation order was made; or consenting to the making of the deportation order.  She applied on 23 March, 2005 for permission to remain in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child born before 1 January, 2005; her application was refused on 14 November, 2005 because her Irish born daughter was born on 7 March 2005.  Representations setting out reasons why she should not be deported were subsequently received on 30 November, 2005.</P>
        <P>I expect the case file in this matter to be submitted to me for decision in due course.  This decision will be taken having regard to considerations specified in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended.

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent basic data on incomes available from <Col N="2110"/>which information of the type requested by the Deputy could be derived are in respect of the income tax year 2003 and are set out the following tables.  For completeness, the numbers of income earners liable for tax at the top rate of 42 per cent are also included.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that this material is dated in that major changes I made in my Budgets to the structure and extent of tax reliefs will increase the average tax rate for those on higher incomes using such reliefs.  Caution should be used in basing policy pronouncements on this data.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.  Married couples and individuals with income chargeable to tax under both Schedule E and Schedule D have been classified in the following tables by reference to the Schedule under which the larger amount of income is taxable.</P>
        <P>The designation of a tax rate to an income earner in the tables is based on identifying the top tax rate applying to the taxable income of each earner.  To arrive at the figure for taxable income, the gross income is reduced by various relevant deductions and allowances such as capital allowances, losses, allowable expenses and retirement annuities.  In some cases, these will reduce the taxable income to nil.</P>
        <P>The information on incomes is based on income returns on Revenue records at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes, representing about 96 per cent of all returns expected.</P><Col N="2109"/>

        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information requested by the Deputy is provided in the following tables.  Self-employed income earners have been distributed over the same income ranges as PAYE earners.  For the tax years 2002 and 2003, the numbers of income earners at all income levels in the tables are best estimates based on data from completed end-of-year returns but adjusted to take account of returns which had not been received when the data were compiled.  For later years, the numbers of earners in the various ranges of income are based on the adjusted data for 2003 projected forward in accordance with macroeconomic data relating to actual and expected growth in wages and employment.</P><Col N="2111"/>

        <P FLI="0">The figures for the years to 2003 are based on returns made by individual PAYE taxpayers.  New procedures introduced from 1 January 2004 mean that employers are now required to account for PAYE, PRSI and Health Contributions on the taxable value of certain benefits-in-kind and other non-cash benefits provided by them to their employees.  Provision was made for the return of this information in the form P35 for 2004 due for filing by employers in February 2005. Technical enhancements to the Revenue computer system to enable this data to be captured and reported are close to finalisation.  However, as details of taxable benefits are required in aggregate form only on the P35 return it will not be possible to separately identify different types of  benefits.</P>
        <P>The above figures include income earners whose main source of income is assessable to tax under Schedule D (self-employed) but who also have income from an employment subject to PAYE in respect of which a benefit-in-kind arises.  It should be noted that as PAYE taxpayers were charged to tax on their earnings in the period from 6 April to 31 December 2001 and self-employed taxpayers were assessed to tax for <Col N="2118"/>the short &ldquo;year&rdquo; on 74% of the profits earned in a 12 month accounting period, the income figures will not be directly comparable with those of earlier or later years.</P>

        <Quest> the amount of income tax paid by a double income family with a gross pay of &euro;64,000 and a single income family with a total gross pay of &euro;64,000 and to compare this to the amount of income tax paid by a single income family with gross pay of &euro;64,000. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the tax rates and bands for a married couple for 2006 are as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">Married couple (one spouse with income) First &euro;41,000 @ 20%</P>
         <P LI="1">Balance @ 42%.</P>
         <P LI="1">Married couple (both spouses with income) First &euro;41,000 with increase of &euro;23,000 maximum @ 20%</P>
        <P LI="1">Balance @ 42%.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the case of married couples with two incomes, the standard rate band available to one spouse will not be greater than that available to a one income married couple i.e. &euro;41,000.  The second spouse may avail of the balance of the &euro;64,000 band.</P>
        <P>A Home Carer Tax Credit of &euro;770 can be claimed by married persons who are jointly assessed to tax and where one spouse works at home to care for a dependent person (which includes a dependent child) provided certain conditions are satisfied.  A married couple cannot <Col N="2120"/>claim both the Home Carer Tax Credit and the increased standard rate band.  They can, however, claim whichever of the two is the most beneficial.  The Home Carer Tax Credit is not due where the home caring spouse&rsquo;s income equals or exceeds &euro;6,620.</P>
        <P>The following eight examples show the income tax payable by single and double income families as requested by the Deputy on gross incomes of &euro;64,000 and &euro;64,000 for the current tax year.  The examples refer to earners in the PAYE and self-employed sectors and are based on the assumption in each case that the married couple is jointly assessed for tax purposes.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Figures for years 2004 and 2005 are provisional and subject to revision.  This may result in increased figures of PAYE claimants.</P>
        <P>The numbers availing represent income earners who were in a position to absorb at least some of the home carer&rsquo;s tax credit and thereby give rise to an Exchequer cost.  They do not include the numbers of potential claimants whose entitlements to other tax credits were sufficient to reduce their liability to tax to nil without reference to the home carer&rsquo;s credit.  The numbers availing of the credit are rounded to the nearest hundred as appropriate.  A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</P>

        <Quest> if the Revenue Commissioner will waive collection of capital acquisition tax in the circumstances of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 the Revenue Commissioners do not have the power to waive gift or inheritance tax properly due.  However Section 59 does provide for the postponement of tax by the Commissioners where excessive hardship would be involved.  The Revenue Commissioners statement of practice (SP-CAT/1/90) outlines the practice and procedure to be followed in relation to applications for postponement of payment of tax and each case is examined on an individual basis.</P>
        <P>In relation to the specific case referred to in the question, the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied, after discussions with the taxpayer that <Col N="2125"/>she is entitled to claim dwelling house relief under Section 151 of the Finance Act 2000 when taking this gift.  Section 151 provides that gifts or inheritances of a dwelling-house taken on or after 1 December 1999, will be exempt from capital acquisitions tax provided that the following conditions are complied with:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />the recipient must have occupied the dwelling house continuously as his or her only or main residence for a period of three years prior to the date of the gift or inheritance;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />the recipient must not at the date of the gift or inheritance be beneficially entitled to any other dwelling-house or to any interest in any other dwelling house; and</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />the recipient must continue, except where such recipient was aged 55 years at the date of the gift or inheritance or has died, to occupy that dwelling-house as his or her only or main residence for a period of 6 years commencing on the date of the gift or inheritance.</P>
        <P FLI="0">To apply for this exemption a claim form for dwelling house relief should be completed and forwarded with a completed IT38 Gift/Inheritance Tax Return to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Unit, Revenue Commissioners, City Centre District, &Aacute;ras Bhrugha, 9/10 Upper O&rsquo;Connell Street, Dublin 1.  These forms are available on the <i>Revenue.ie</i> website.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners Capital Acquisitions Tax Advisory Unit provide a Lo-call 1890 20 11 04 service to taxpayers in relation to gift/inheritance tax and any information in relation to the above can be accessed on that number or on the <i>Revenue.ie</i> website under Capital Acquisitions Tax.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that while there is no public service embargo in place, the Government has followed a targeted numbers policy since December 2002.  Under this policy the growth in public sector employment has slowed substantially overall and has been reversed in several areas.  </P>
        <P>I have indicated previously that duplication of professional and technical staff is not proposed in the context of decentralisation.  This remains the position.

        <P>My Department is not conducting a national procurement process for radiotherapy services, nor does it have any plans to do so.  The provision of radiotherapy services for public patients is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The HSE has advised my Department that it is considering a request from the Whitfield Clinic, the private facility referred to by the Deputy, to provide services to public patients.  Quality standards for the provision of radiation oncology services for public patients have been prepared by an expert group established on foot of a Government decision in January 2004.  The HSE has advised my Department that it is applying these standards to radiation oncology services that it provides or arranges to have provided.</P>
        <P>My Department is working closely with the HSE to progress the National Radiation Oncology Plan announced by Government in July 2005.  It will deliver integrated care to cancer patients by multi-disciplinary teams of cancer experts at centres in Dublin (at Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals), Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The health service has been successful in attracting nurses and midwives into the workforce over the last number of years.  The number of whole time equivalent nurses and midwives employed in the public health service has increased by 10,207 (39.9%) during the period 1997 to June 2006.  In addition to the above, the Government has provided significantly enhanced education programmes for student nurses.  A total of 1,880 places on undergraduate nursing and midwifery education programmes are now available each year.</P>

	<P>As I have indicated to the House previously the Government attaches a very high priority to the Report of the Ferns Inquiry and to following up on the Report&rsquo;s recommendations in the context of ensuring that effective child protection and welfare systems are in place to protect children.  Before the publication of the Ferns Report I sought the advice of the Attorney General on the Report including the issue of the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s powers in relation to third party abuse raised in the Report and the advice was that the Executive had general powers under the Child Care Act 1991 in relation to third party abuse.</P>
        <P>In line with the recommendations, however, it was considered that the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office should undertake an in depth study of the HSE&rsquo;s powers in relation to third party abuse and this would be followed by legislative proposals as required.  Following further detailed discussions between the Office of the Minister for Children and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office on the question of conducting the in depth examination of these issues the Office of the Minister for Children and the Health Service Executive are examining in detail the various issues involved.  I expect that this process will be concluded in the near future and that the advice of the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office will be sought on the outcome of these deliberations as necessary.</P>

	<P>I have received representations concerning the transfer of radiation oncology services from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Rathgar to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin.  The decision to transfer St. Luke&rsquo;s was taken by the Government in the context of its consideration of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology Services.  The decision is based on expert advice and is designed to ensure that radiation oncology, one element of cancer care, is integrated with all other aspects of care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.  I am convinced that this model will provide better patient centred treatment with improved quality of service and outcome for patients.  The Board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and it&rsquo;s Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government&rsquo;s decision in relation to the development of radiation oncology.  A transfer on similar lines took place earlier this year in Northern Ireland when radiation oncology services transferred to Belfast City Hospital, a major academic teaching hospital.</P>
        <P>In progressing the transfer, I will build on the expertise and ethos of St. Luke&rsquo;s.  I have ensured that experts at St. Luke&rsquo;s are centrally involved in the planning and delivery of the National Plan.  The plan consists of large centres in Dublin (at Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals), Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at <Col N="2136"/>Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital, conditional on conformity to certain quality assurance arrangements.  Medical and scientific experts from the hospital are involved in developing the output specifications for the delivery of new radiation oncology services nationally.  The Chief Executive at St. Luke&rsquo;s will lead the management team of the new facility at St James&rsquo;s.  I also appointed the Chairman of St. Luke&rsquo;s to chair a National Radiation Oncology Oversight Group to advise me on progress on the implementation of the plan.  I have also approved the provision of two additional linear accelerators at St. Luke&rsquo;s to provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the national plan.  I expect these services to commence late next year.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market.  There are many areas of the country where, for demographic or other reasons, the private sector has been slow to respond to demand for broadband.  In cases where the market is seen to have failed, my Department is addressing the investment shortfall in infrastructure using a combination of Government and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funding through the Regional Broadband Programme.</P>
        <P>My Department operates a dedicated website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i> where potential broadband customers can ascertain the availability of services in their area.  According to information provided by broadband service providers, DSL is available in the Burt and Greencastle areas and satellite is available in all three areas in question.</P>
        <P>I recognise there are some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify <Col N="2139"/>the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  I am currently examining options to address the delivery of competitively priced broadband services to these areas and I expect to be in a position to bring proposals to Government shortly.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding long-term temporary employees who have been employed in the Passport Office in Cork, in view of the recruitment drive being made for full-time staff; the rights temporary workers have under European legislation that limits the rights of an employer to terminate employment of contract workers who have been employed over a period of time; and if it is expected that temporary contract staff will lose their jobs as a result of the new recruitment drive. </Quest>
        <QRef>[31433/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department has recruited Temporary Clerical Officers in the Passport Offices in Dublin, Cork and Balbriggan over many years in order to meet the additional demand for passports in the period leading up to the busy summer season.  In recent years the number of passports issued by the Department has reached record levels.  This, in turn, has increased the Department&rsquo;s reliance on temporary staff.  In 2006, a total of 189 Temporary Clerical Officers were recruited to work in the three Passport Offices. </P>
        <P>In the Cork Passport Office, a total of 47 Temporary Clerical Officers were recruited in 2006.  Of these, thirty were engaged for the first time this year, while nine were first recruited in 2005.  Of the remaining eight temporary staff, two were offered their first temporary contract in 2001, four in 2002 and two in 2004.</P>
        <P>The terms and conditions of employment of the temporary staff in the Passport Offices are governed by the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Workers) Act 2003, and <Col N="2141"/>the Department is fully aware of its obligations under this Act.</P>
        <P>In July this year the Department received sanction from the Department of Finance to recruit an additional 19 supervisory staff for the passport service, and to convert 121 Temporary Clerical Officer posts to permanent positions.  Arrangements for the recruitment of the additional staff are currently being planned.  It is expected that the majority of the posts will be filled by early 2007.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>In the case of the Cork Passport Office, the number of new permanent Clerical Officer posts which has been approved is 34.  In filling these vacancies, the Department will comply with Civil Service recruitment policy, as set out in the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, which provides the framework for fair and open competition for permanent posts in the Civil Service.  It will also take account of the rights of temporary staff under the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Workers) Act 2003.  In this regard, the Department will take due account of the outcome of the case, currently before the Labour Court, concerning the employment status of six Temporary Clerical Officers in the Passport Office in Dublin.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will wish to be aware that, despite the creation of a significant number of new Clerical Officer posts in the Cork Passport Office, there will continue to be an ongoing requirement for temporary clerical staff to cover the continuing increased demand for passports.  Therefore, in line with the practice which has existed up to now, the most experienced temporary clerical staff will be the first to be again offered temporary employment in the Cork Passport Office next year.</P>

The Authority will, of course, advise the family of the outcome of its investigation in due course.</P>

	<P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over.  All carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass.  It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person&rsquo;s pension.  People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel. </P>
        <P>The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.  These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  The vast majority of private contractors providing services under the scheme operate in rural areas.  The underlying feature of the scheme is the use of spare capacity on these transport services.</P>
        <P>The issue of access to public transport in rural areas is being addressed at present through the Rural Transport Initiative, which is being managed by Pobal, formerly Area Development Management (ADM), on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport.</P><Col N="2143"/>
        <P>My Department contributed &euro;500,000 to the Initiative in 2004, &euro;750,000 in 2005 and is contributing &euro;850,000 to the Initiative in 2006.  This will ensure that free travel pass holders continue to have full access to community based transport services.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements have been made to the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, in recent Budgets both in terms of the qualifying conditions and the coverage of the schemes.  I will continue to review the operation of these schemes with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.</P>

        <P>The Executive has advised that it has disallowed an application by the person concerned for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance as her total household income was above the prescribed &euro;401.30 limit for entitlement to the allowance.

        <P>A mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.

        <Quest> if in the situation regarding rent allowance payments to persons in receipt of the back to education allowance who also, under the terms of the back to education allowance, take up part-time employment, he will consider for the duration of the course freezing the rent supplement allowance amount; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>People participating in approved courses under the back-to-education allowance scheme receive a standard weekly rate of payment equivalent to the maximum rate of their previous social welfare payment.  The scheme also provides for the retention of entitlement to secondary benefits, such as rent or mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme.  This is an important feature as SWA is not normally paid to people in full-time education.  </P>
        <P>Under standard assessment rules rent supplements are calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution, currently &euro;13, which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.</P>
        <P>While earnings from part-time employment do not affect the basic rate of back-to-education allowance to which participants are entitled, such earnings are assessable for rent supplement purposes in the normal way.  This may result in a reduction in the rate of rent supplement in payment.  However, where a person has an additional <Col N="2145"/>income as a result of part-time employment the standard means test provides for a weekly disregard of up to &euro;60 per week of additional income with half of any additional income between &euro;60 and &euro;90 also disregarded for means assessment purposes.</P>
        <P>The benefit to those participating in the back to education allowance scheme is that their status as a full time student does not preclude them from getting SWA.  I consider this to be a positive financial incentive to take up educational opportunities and I would regard the existing arrangements applying as satisfactory.  I would encourage people availing of the back to-education allowance to contact their local community welfare officer to clarify their continuing entitlement to rent supplement in their new circumstances.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes mortgage interest supplement, is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive. </P>
        <P>A mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.</P>
        <P>The Executive has advised that the persons concerned had been in receipt of a mortgage interest supplement but payment was stopped as the household income was deemed sufficient to meet their interest costs.</P>
        <P>The Executive has further advised that the house has also been offered for sale. Under the provisions governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, mortgage interest supplement is not payable where the residence in respect of which the loan is payable is offered for sale.</P>

	<P>The Emergency Service Award was set up by the Irish Government in 1947 to recognise the services performed by the Mercantile Marine during the Emergency (1939-1946).  The criteria for entitlement to the Irish Marine Service Medal, were set out in 1950 (by the Department of Industry and Commerce), as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. Service on Irish-Registered foreign-going ships;</P>
        <P LI="1">2. Service on Irish-Registered home trade ships;</P>
        <P LI="1">3. Service on Irish-Registered decked fishing boats (over 15 tons net which were registered under part 1 and within the meaning of sections 253 and 263 of the 1894 Merchant Shipping Act) this description covers trawlers, which took considerable risks when engaging in deep-sea fishing; and</P>
       <P LI="1">4. Any Service on an Irish ship which resulted in death or disablement through belligerent action.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The criteria of the Scheme therefore exclude consideration of the two persons referred to, as the ship on which they served was not an Irish registered ship.</P>
        <P>I understand the concerns of their family and have had inquiries made on their behalf with the Registry of Shipping and Seaman in the United Kingdom.  It is possible to make a claim for valour medals for seafarers serving on British registered ships during this period, and such claims can be made to that Registry, which holds the relevant service records.  The address is: Medals Officer, Registry of Registry of Shipping and Seaman, Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency, Anchor Court, Keen Road, Cardiff CF24 5JW, Wales.  In light of this, I currently have no plans to amend the Emergency Service Award Scheme.</P>

	<P>As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report progress with their projects under the RAPID programme.  In support of my Department, Pobal collects data from each RAPID area in respect of funding allocations received by projects from Government Departments and local state agencies.  The latest data in respect of the programme is available on Pobal&rsquo;s website under the RAPID section (<i>http://www.pobal.ie/live/RAPID</i>).

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department operates, either directly or through bodies under its aegis, a range of schemes and projects which support communities in addressing local issues and improve their quality of life generally.  The main elements are described below.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Dormant Accounts</i></P>
        <P>Disbursements from the Dormant Accounts Fund are designed to assist three broad categories of persons:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />those affected by economic and social disadvantage;</P>
          <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />those affected by educational disadvantage; and</P>
          <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />persons with a disability.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Government has approved the allocation of &euro;60 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund in 2006.  In this regard, &euro;24 million is being allocated towards projects tackling economic and social disadvantage; &euro;18 million towards projects tackling educational disadvantage and &euro;18 million towards projects assisting persons with a disability.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>CL&Aacute;R  Programme:</i></P>
        <P>Local Authority Housing Estate Enhancement Scheme:</P>
        <P>The purpose of this Scheme is to provide funding, with Local Authorities, for the enhancement of Local Authority Housing Estates through <Col N="2149"/>works on landscaping, paving, etc.  This Scheme is co-funded with Local Authority on a &euro; for &euro; basis with local contribution</P>

        <P el="10"><i>Community Services Programme:</i></P>
        <P>The wide range of community activities funded by this Programme includes the staffing costs of operating community CCTV systems.  The scheme also provides funding for the provision of supervision and security of community halls and facilities.</P>

        <P el="10"><i>RAPID  Programme:</i></P>
        <P>I introduced the RAPID Leverage Schemes in 2004.  Through these schemes my Department, in tandem with Departments that have primary responsibility, funds schemes to provide playgrounds, improve traffic measures, improve health facilities, support sporting organisations as well as improve local authority housing estates and flat complexes.  Funding from other Departments and Agencies is matched by RAPID Leverage funding.  The schemes are aimed at small-scale capital works &ndash; works that require relatively small amounts of funding but can produce real and concrete benefits to communities.  They also allow the local community to have a direct input into deciding what projects will be undertaken by giving the Area Implementation Teams in each RAPID area the power to select the projects involved.</P>
        <P>Also, my Department co-funds projects with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform such as installation of Community Based CCTV, tackling the problem of graffiti and once off Dept. of Justice initiated projects to support communities in RAPID areas.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Community Development Programme:</i></P>
        <P>Established in 1990 in recognition of the role of community development in tackling the causes and effects of poverty and disadvantage, the programme is designed to reduce social exclusion by targeting support at disadvantaged and socially excluded communities in order to improve their capacity to benefit from social and economic development.  All projects are managed by local voluntary management committees.  182 projects are currently supported under the programme.  These are located in recognised disadvantaged areas nationwide, in both urban and rural areas.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;24m has been allocated to the programme for 2006.  Projects are expected to operate as a resource to the communities in which they are located with their main purpose being to work with the community in identifying and tackling those issues which have resulted in a lack of positive community development.  Projects are typically concerned with the needs of women and children, lone parent families, the unemployed, the elderly, young people at risk, Travellers, <Col N="2150"/>those with disabilities, new communities and other disadvantaged groups.  Projects provide facilities such as meeting rooms, cr&egrave;ches, office facilities, training or education projects designed to meet the needs of disadvantaged groups in their communities.  Projects are funded on a contract basis which facilitates the employment of staff and also cover project overheads and administration.  Posts covered under the programme include co-ordinator, development worker and administrator.  Many projects use the CDP structure and funding to attract funding from other sources including statutory agencies.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>National Drugs Strategy:</i></P>
        <P>Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces:</P>
        <P>Fourteen Local Drugs Task Forces and Ten Regional Drugs Task Forces have been set up covering all parts of the country.  Each Task Force is chaired by an independent chair and has representation from various Departments and agencies, including the community and voluntary sectors.  The role of the Drugs Task Forces is to implement the strategic plan which it produced for its region to ensure the development of a co-ordinated and integrated response to illicit drug use.  In 2006, the allocation for the implementation of the strategic plans of Drug Task Forces is in the region of &euro;20m.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>The Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF):</i></P>
        <P>The Young Peoples Facilities &amp; Services Fund (YPFSF) was established in 1998 to assist in the development of facilities (including sport and recreational facilities) and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem existed or had the potential to develop.  By developing youth, sport and other recreational facilities, the YPFSF seeks to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people away from the potential dangers of misuse, into safe, non-threatening and constructive environments</P>
        <P Just="Left">Eighteen locations are covered &mdash; the 14 Local Drugs Task Force areas (12 in Dublin and the others in Bray and Cork) and 4 other urban areas of Limerick, Carlow, Waterford and Galway.  A total of &euro;106 million has been allocated to date under both capital and current projects.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 151 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001&ndash;2008.  The setting up of treatment programmes is a matter for the Health Services Executive and the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The current year&rsquo;s allocation to my Department for expenditure on Drugs Initiatives and the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund is &euro;43m which represents a substantial 37% increase on the 2005 initial allocation and an increase of 61% on the 2004 figure.  These figures emphasise that tackling the drug problem is a key Government priority and that it will remain so.</P>
        <P>Local Drugs Task Forces (LDTFs) are overseeing the implementation of a range of projects at an annual cost in excess of &euro;16m.  Twelve of the 14 Local Drugs Task Forces are located in Dublin, with the others in Bray and Cork.  Since 1997, nearly &euro;125m has been allocated to support work across the 14 LDTF areas.  Over 400 community-based projects have been established, employing more than 300 staff.  These projects deliver services such as community drug treatment programmes as well as advice and support for drug misusers and their families, outreach and crisis intervention services and drug training programmes for community groups.  Additionally, under the Emerging Needs Fund, which was established in 2005, I have allocated almost &euro;4m to 67 projects in various LDTF areas.  This Fund was devised to provide a flexible and timely response to evolving needs in regard to drug misuse.</P>
        <P>Ten Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) have been set up more recently in the areas not covered by Local Drugs Task Forces.  Thus a Drugs Task Force now services all parts of the country with consequential support for community-based groups.  An allocation of &euro;5m has been made available for the RDTFs this year and this will increase in the coming years as they become more established and achieve increased progress on their action plans.</P>
        <P>Under the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund I recently announced allocations of &euro;1.66m for 9 projects in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Waterford and Cork, bringing the total commitment from the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund to  &euro;106m since its establishment.</P><Col N="2152"/>
        <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the funding now available facilitates the provision of a comprehensive range of drug treatment interventions including those organised at community group level.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 and 153 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Decisions on the disbursements of funds from dormant accounts under the initial round of funding were a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts.  Under this round, the Board approved 521 projects for funding totalling over &euro;60 million.  Details of these allocations are included in Appendix A of the Board&rsquo;s 2005 Annual Report, copies of which were laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 31st August 2006 and subsequently circulated to all Oireachtas members on 8th September 2006.  12 of the projects approved by the Board, involving the allocation of &euro;2.7 million, are based in Co. Kildare.  A breakdown of the approved projects in Co. Kildare is provided in Appendix 1.</P>
        <P>Following the enactment of the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2005, the Government approved a series of funding measures providing for the allocation of a further &euro;60 million from the Fund in 2006.  These measures are being rolled-out on a phased basis as the operational arrangements are finalised.</P>
        <P>In July 2006, details of the specific projects approved in respect of the first &euro;12 million of this 2006 allocation were announced.  These allocations were in respect of funding for priority projects in RAPID areas (&euro;11.35 million) and also supports for vulnerable immigrants (&euro;575,000).  Included in these allocations was one project in Athy, Co. Kildare, which was approved for a grant of &euro;200,000 (details in Appendix 2).</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that Government will make further decisions in relation to a number of other measures over the coming months as roll-out continues with regard to the 2006 round of funding.</P><Col N="2153"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 155 together.</P>
        <P>The CL&Aacute;R programme is a targeted investment programme for rural areas.  Earlier this year, following a further analysis of the 2002 population census data, new areas were selected for inclusion in the Programme on the basis of average population loss in each county of not less than 35% between 1926 and 2002.  Towns of 3,000 and over and their peri-urban areas are excluded, <Col N="2154"/>irrespective of county decline in population.  The Programme now covers parts of 22 counties and all of Co. Leitrim and benefits a population of nearly 727,000.</P>
        <P>In order for a school to be eligible for consideration under the School Outdoors Play Facilities Enhancement Scheme, it must be located in a District Electoral Division (DED) designated as a CL&Aacute;R area.  The DED is confirmed by the Registrar of Electors at the local County Council.  The school referred to by the Deputy is not located in a CL&Aacute;R area and it is, therefore, not eligible for consideration under the Programme.</P>

        <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the practice operated by a company (details supplied) in selectively accepting milk suppliers whose main supply goes elsewhere; if she is satisfied that the offer to lease or purchase quota to these selected suppliers is not in breach of any Irish or EU quota regulations; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Regulation 38 of the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 2000, as amended, provides that milk producers may transfer quota from their existing milk purchaser to a new milk purchaser in any quarter beginning 1st January, 1st April, 1st July or 1st October, provided a set notification procedure is followed.</P>
        <P>A producer may, in certain circumstances, apply in writing to my Department to transfer all or part of his or her quota to another purchaser with effect from a date specified in the application and stating a reason for such an application.  The relevant milk purchasers are given an opportunity to state their views prior to such a transfer being effected.</P>
        <P>In the case of recent quota transfers to the company referred to, I am satisfied that the appropriate procedures were followed.  Producers may apply to purchase quota from a scheme operated by a milk purchaser in which they hold permanent quota, and to which they have made deliveries in the current year.  However, producers who hold quota in more than one co-op may purchase quota from one co-op only.  Under the annual Temporary Leasing Scheme, a producer may apply for a temporary allocation of quota provided he or she is a supplier to the co-op in question.</P>
        <P>These schemes and the quota transfer procedures are operated in accordance with the provisions of the relevant Council and Commission Regulations.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> the plans she has to review the practice whereby cattle must be within the period specified for the test for tuberculosis when they are being slaughtered; the reason for this practice; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[31414/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The requirement that animals may be sent for slaughter only if they have been tested for TB within the previous 12 months is a necessary component of the Eradication Programme to ensure that individual animals do not go for prolonged periods without test and that the exposure pattern to TB within herds is regularly evaluated.  While cattle are routinely tested for TB lesions at post mortem, cattle with TB do not present with lesions in the early stages of the disease and, in any event, it is often very difficult, for reasons relating to the location of lesions and the speed of the slaughter line, to detect lesions at post-mortem at meat plants.  In view of this, the TB skin test is the optimum mechanism for detecting TB in herds and annual tuberculin testing provides essential epidemiological information.  In addition, the design, operation and outcome of the Bovine TB Eradication Programme is subjected to routine scrutiny at EU level and Ireland&rsquo;s fulfilment of the terms of Directive 64/432/EEC, i.e. the Directive governing the trade in live animals is closely monitored.  Ireland&rsquo;s ability to trade in live animals in EU and third country markets is contingent primarily on compliance with this Directive.  Our EU partners consider that a credible Eradication Programme must be comprehensive and that all animals are subject to test at intervals determined by the national disease level &mdash; for Ireland this interval is 12 months and thus all herds and all animals must be tested annually.</P>
        <P>In view of the foregoing, I believe that the practice of permitting only animals that are in test to be sent for slaughter is an essential element in our efforts aimed at preventing the spread of TB and protecting domestic and international trade and should be retained.</P>

        <Quest> the plans she has to review the decision to award the cattle tag contract to just one company; the reason for this decision; her <Col N="2157"/>views on whether it is acceptable that those who were unsuccessful should be informed via the media rather than her Department; the steps being taken to review the communication policy in such circumstances; the reason no clear specifications were given for the tendering process; the reason each of the seven companies failed in the tender process; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no plans to review the decision taken to award the contract following the recent public tender process for the supply of cattle tags.  The tendering process was conducted in a fair, open and transparent manner in accordance with EU and national legislation on public procurement.  The award criteria were set out in the Invitation to Tender document.  This document also outlined the general requirements for the tag but, as has been the policy for the past ten years, it did not include direct specifications so as to facilitate a response from the industry that would give the widest representation of the products on offer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One supplier of cattle tags was selected because the overall solution offered by that company was deemed to be significantly superior to the alternatives offered in the tender process.  A copy of the report of the evaluation committee, which outlined the methodology used to assess the tenders, was provided to each company that submitted a valid tender.  The contract to be awarded on foot of this tender process will be for a period of one year and may be extended for a further period of up to a maximum of two years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All companies who submitted valid tenders for the supply of cattle tags were informed of the decision in the normal way, by fax and registered post, immediately following completion of all the steps in the decision making process.  While one newspaper anticipated the outcome of the decision making process and published an article on the subject prior to my Department notifying the results, I can confirm that my Department did not make the information available for publication.</P>

	<P>The Technical Working Group referred to was established in 2003 to evaluate the possible introduction into agricultural practice of a number of new structures, including Earth-Lined Stores and Out-Wintering Pads, and to make recommendations as to whether or not such structures should be permitted.  Based on the Group&rsquo;s recommendations, I approved the specification for Earth-Lined Stores last March, and a course for site assessors is expected to commence in early November.</P>
        <P>The work of the Technical Working Group on the suitability of Out-Wintering Pads was dependent on the results of ongoing research into the environmental implications and construction requirements associated with the system becoming available.  I understand that the Technical Working Group has only recently received this information and that it will be examined at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>The Technical Working Group consists of officials nominated by my Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Teagasc, EPA and GSI.  Since its establishment in 2003, the costs incurred by the Technical Working Group amount to &euro;3,140.83.  These costs relate to the Group&rsquo;s work on all of the alternative storage systems under examination.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category D.</P>
        <P>Category D caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year.  The person named did not qualify for this category as he commenced farming prior to the reference period 2000-2002.  A formal letter setting out my Department&rsquo;s decision issued to the person named which was subsequently appealed.  This appeal has now been forwarded to the Independent Payment Appeals Committee who will carry out a full review of the case and will correspond directly with the person named following the outcome of the review.</P><Col N="2160"/>
        <P>My Department has also carried out a full review of the application from the person named under the Force Majeure measure of the Single Payment Scheme.  A decision has been made that his entitlements will now be based on the alternative reference period 1997-1999 and a formal letter will issue to the person named in due course.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the Single Payments Scheme National Reserve under category C.</P>
        <P>Category C caters for farmers who sold the milk quota into the Milk Quota Restructuring Scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia/or Arable Aid Schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002.  The person named was unsuccessful as he was not an Active Milk Producer up to the date of sale of his Milk Quota.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest> the way in which farmers who do not fit into either category A or category B will be treated under the single farm payment scheme and the various categories in the 2006 National Reserve; if force majeure will be applied especially where people had land leased in 2005; if it is possible for 2005 entitlements to be topped up; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that unlike the 2005 National Reserve Scheme, when there was a number of mandatory categories to be catered for, this year there is only one mandatory category &mdash; Category A.  This category caters for farmers who inherited, leased or otherwise received free of charge, or for a nominal amount (&euro;100 per hectare), from a farmer who retired or died before 16 May 2005, a holding that was leased out to a third party during the 2000-2002 reference period.</P>
        <P>Following consultations with the Single Payment Advisory Committee (comprising representatives from the farming organisations and Teagasc), I also decided to include a non-mandatory category in the 2006 National Reserve.  This category (category B) caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who, while farming during 2002, did not receive any direct payments in respect of that year.  The income and educational qualification that applied in 2005 will again apply to this category.  In addition, new entrants who are farming leased/rented land will be eligible for an allocation provided they can demonstrate a genuine commitment to farming.  In this context the leased/rented land must have been declared on the 2004 Area Aid application and on the 2005 and 2006 Single Payment Scheme applications.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, successful applicants under category C of the 2005 National Reserve (those who participated in the milk restructuring scheme and converted to a farming sector for which a direct payment would have been payable during the reference period) will now be eligible for a top-up from the 2006 National Reserve to reflect the increased value of the Dairy Premium in 2006.  My Department will automatically apply this top-up and therefore the farmers concerned need not make application to the 2006 National Reserve.  Separate arrangements concerning a National Reserve category for Sugar Beet farmers will be announced separately later on.</P>
        <P>There is no provision for the application of Force Majeure to farmers who had land leased during 2005 where the land in question is no longer available to them.  However, where a farmer was leasing land during the reference period 2000-2002 and the lease agreement has <Col N="2162"/>now expired, the farmer in question may be eligible to consolidate his/her entitlements for 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The data requested by the Deputy are contained in the following table.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary and post-primary level in recent years.  At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
        <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
        <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</P>
        <P>As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year, as is the case in many schools.  170 such posts were sanctioned in the 2005/06 school year, compared to 105 in 2004/05.</P>
        <P>This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.</P><Col N="2165"/>

	<P>The three Third Level Student Support Schemes, administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees on behalf of my Department, offer financial assistance to eligible students attending approved third level courses.  Students entering approved courses for the first time are, generally speaking eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.  The closing date for receipt of grant applications for the current academic year was 31 August 2006.  However the awarding bodies, at their own absolute discretion, may accept applications after this date.</P>

	<P>Under the provisions of the Education Act 1998 and the regulations of the Department of Education and Science, the board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school.  The overall responsibility for the day to day management of school supervision rests with the Principal Teacher.  The terms of Circular 16/73, which issued to all primary schools, provide that the Principal Teacher of primary schools should organise supervision for the order and general behaviour of the pupils during school hours.  In particular, he or she should organise and participate in the effective supervision of the pupils during breaks, lunch-breaks, assembly and dismissal.  This circular was drawn up in consultation with the school management representative bodies at that time.  Rule 121(4) and 124(1) of the Rules for National Schools and Section 23(2) of the Education Act 1998 oblige teachers to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of pupils and to participate in supervising pupils when the pupils are on school premises, during school time and/or on school activities.  Accordingly, the responsibility of all teachers individually and collectively to provide a duty of care at all times towards the children in the school in which they teach, including periods of supervision, remains.</P>

	<P>Earlier this year, I announced new Support Teams to work directly with schools experiencing serious behaviour problems in post-primary schools.  I announced the plan following the publication of the final report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools &mdash; School Matters.  A new package of measures announced includes: A New regionally-based National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) to work with schools that have significant discipline problems; and Behaviour Support classrooms to be piloted in a number of schools.</P>
        <P>The NBSS&rsquo;s role ranges from diagnosis of school problems to assistance with their remediation.  This team will work with post-primary schools that are experiencing significant discipline problems.  It is staffed by experienced practitioners from across the education sector, including additional Psychologists dedicated to this area.  Administrative support is provided to the National Behaviour Support Service by Navan Education Centre.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are no plans by my Department to introduce a behaviour support service for primary schools.  However, my Department established the Special Education Support Service (SESS) in September, 2003 which is based at the Cork Education Centre.  The aim of the service is to enhance the quality of teaching and learning with particular reference to the education of children with special needs in both primary and post-primary schools.  The service provides support for school personnel working with pupils and students with special educational needs in a variety of educational settings including special schools and special classes.  Challenging behaviour is one of the areas covered by the SESS.</P>
        <P>Professional development and support is available to principals, middle management in schools, class teachers, subject teachers, special-class teachers, resource teachers and special needs assistants.  It is open to the management authorities in schools to address any additional training needs for staff employed in their schools through the SESS.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the school year 2005-2006 Schools for Students with Mild General Learning Disability were invited to avail of the following: 3-hour school whole-staff session &mdash; &lsquo;Introduction to Challenging Behaviour&rsquo;; and 1-day seminar for whole staff &mdash; &lsquo;Managing Challenging Behaviour&rsquo;.  Special Schools that deal with serious and persistent challenging behaviour on a day-to-day basis that requires specific interventions, require specific continuous professional development on the use of such interventions at whole-staff and whole-team level.  SESS full-funding for specialist <Col N="2171"/>training was made available to enable schools to provide whole-staff training as a summer course.</P>
        <P>Teachers are able to avail of Extra Personal Vacation days.  Almost &euro;150,000 was made available for this purpose in summer 2006.  It is intended to continue to provide for this as part of the SESS summer course programme in June 2007.  SESS have received request from Mainstream Primary schools in which some students&rsquo; behaviour is of grave concern to the principal and school.  On a pilot basis, SESS has provided the following supports to a number of schools:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />Delivery of whole-staff training on managing challenging behaviour;</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />Provision of support through engagement of personnel with specific expertise; and</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />Funding for specialist whole-staff training on managing challenging behaviour (on a pilot basis).</P>
        <P FLI="0">In 2005-2006 over 600 teachers participated in on-line course as follows:</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />&lsquo;Positive Behaviour Support and Discipline&rsquo; (287);</P>

        <P FLI="0">In 2005-2006 over &euro;11,000 was provided to enable teachers/schools avail of courses on challenging behaviour under the SESS-Local Initiatives Scheme.</P>

	<P>The matter raised in the question has not been the subject of a study by my Department&rsquo;s Value for Money Unit; however, local authorities, when employing consultants for infrastructural works, must adhere to relevant guidelines set out in circular letters from my Department and guidelines by the Department of Finance for the public sector generally, which include appropriate emphasis on value for money considerations.  While overall local government staff numbers are controlled in accordance with Government policy in relation to public sector numbers, staffing and organisational arrangements for purposes of carrying out local authority functions are a matter for each County/City Manager.</P>
        <P>The issue of the use of consultants by local authorities will be considered in the context of the ongoing work of the Value for Money Unit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 187 and 188 together.</P>
        <P>The EU Civil Protection Mechanism was established by Council Decision 2001/792/EC, which was adopted in October 2001 following negotiations between the Member States in which Ireland participated fully.  There were no formal discussions at sub-national level in relation to these negotiations.</P>
        <P>Eight Irish nominees have undertaken Civil Protection training courses to date.  The courses in question are the Community Mechanism Induction Course, the Operational Management Course and the High Level Co-ordination Course.  These training courses are essentially directed at team leaders and incident assessors.  Participation in training courses is ongoing and my Department anticipates that at least one further nominee will participate in civil protection training before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>While we indicated in 2003, following wide consultation, that up to 42 personnel comprising 15 experts and 6 intervention teams could potentially be made available within the framework of the Mechanism, it has become clear in the meantime that the most likely roles for Irish personnel are as team leaders or assessors; in practice, countries which regularly experience incidents such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, major forest fires and major floods tend to have significant contingency search and rescue capacity and are in a position to provide substantial resources to assist requesting countries at very short notice.  Therefore, it is our intention to concentrate on identifying and training additional personnel as team leaders and assessors rather than pursuing the establishment of intervention teams.</P>

	<P>A network of National Parks and Wildlife Service Conservation Rangers operating in coastal areas participates in a scheme to identify and respond to strandings of live and dead whales and dolphins.  The scheme is co-ordinated by the Irish Whale and Dolphin <Col N="2192"/>Group, which is funded by my Department, the Marine Institute, the Heritage Council and the Northern Ireland Environment and Heritage Service.  Professional and volunteer members from universities (particularly UCC) and the public are also involved.</P>
        <P>In most instances an effort is made by this network, with the co-operation of local authority and State resources, to aid live-stranded cetaceans to return to the sea.  There are many instances every year where whales and dolphins are successfully returned.  However, occasionally these animals, whether injured or diseased or for some other natural reason, will re-strand themselves on the shore and die.</P>
        <P>Dead whales and dolphins washed up on the shore are also reported under these arrangements.  In these instances a member of the network will make an inspection on site to record the species, size, gender and probable cause of death.  This data is maintained in a public access database <i>www.iwdg.ie</i> and published annually in the Irish Naturalists Journal.</P>

	<P>Carbon credits will be used by the government for the sole purpose of achieving compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to limit its greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels. </P>
        <P>Under the EU burden sharing arrangements Ireland will have the benefit of approximately 63 million allowances per annum each of which must be surrendered by the State in lieu of one tonne of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions during the 2008-2012 period.

	<P>Under the EU Birds Directive, Ireland, like other Member States, is required to maintain the population of bird species, and to designate Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for species which are identified in Annex 1 of the Directive, including the Hen Harrier.</P>
        <P>In 2002, based on the then available information, a range of possible SPA catchments were identified for Hen Harriers in the State. Since then, my Department has thoroughly reviewed the research and information on the Hen Harrier, including the results of a second national survey in 2005.  Based on this work a significant reduction in the number and extent of SPAs is now envisaged.</P>
        <P>In general, it is not anticipated that the designation of a site for Hen Harriers will have effects on existing farming, existing forestry, or other ongoing activities. Neither should designation of a Hen Harrier SPA result in any restrictions on future rural housing development, on the intensification of grassland management nor on the reseeding of rough grass fields in the area.</P>
        <P>The main activities likely to require regulation would be land reclamation/habitat destruction; commercial turf extraction; scrub, gorse or hedgerow removal; and too intensive use of off-road vehicles &ndash; other than by farmers.</P><Col N="2194"/>
        <P>Any proposed windfarm developments will continue to be assessed through the planning process and planning authorities will assess each proposal on a case-by-case basis.  In that regard, I have published Guidelines for planning authorities on wind energy development. These Guidelines point out there is huge potential to avoid or reduce negative environmental impacts, including those on the natural heritage, in designing wind energy projects.</P>
        <P>A Working Group of relevant interests both farming and forestry, the Forest Service and my Department has been established to develop a practical management regime for further forestry in the proposed Hen Harrier SPAs.  Following completion of these discussions and final decisions on the designations, the proposed SPAs for the Hen Harrier will be notified to individual landowners and the normal appeal process will apply.</P>

        <Quest> the role and function of An Taisce in relation to the planning process; the way the body is structured; the membership and funding of same; the decision making process and to whom it is accountable; if he has satisfied himself regarding its role in the planning process; and the legislative proposals he has to change this in the future. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 33 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that regulations regarding applications for permission may be made requiring, inter alia, that planning authorities must notify prescribed bodies of the receipt of certain classes of development.  Article 28 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 includes An Taisce in the list of bodies prescribed for this purpose.   An Taisce is given notice of planning applications only in circumstances where it appears to the planning authority that the proposed development might impact on matters such as areas of special amenity, protected structures, National Monuments and nature conservation.  </P>
        <P>An Taisce is an independent, voluntary, non-governmental organisation and is responsible for regulating its own activities.  I have no responsibility or detailed information regarding its membership nor its financing.</P>
        <P>My Department provides grant aid to An Taisce under a number of initiatives, namely administration expenses of the Blue Flag Scheme in Ireland (&euro;94,096 for the operation in 2005), a Clean Coast awards scheme (&euro;5,000 in 2005), an An Taisce&ndash;led anti-litter initiative National Spring Clean (&euro;324,448 in 2005), and core funding of &euro;7,531 in 2005, which was paid through the <Col N="2195"/>Environmental (Ecological) Non-Governmental Organisations Core Funding Ltd.</P>
        <P>As Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I will keep the Regulations, including the list of prescribed bodies, under continual review, to ensure that they deliver an effective and efficient planning service leading to quality planning decisions.  I will see that any necessary changes to support this outcome are addressed on a timely basis.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> if, when he is reviewing part V of the Planning and <Col N="2196"/>Development Act, 2000 he will include purpose built cr&egrave;ches, currently constructed with every 75 dwellings, as a community gain with developments that return cash not houses; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation provides that any Part V monies accumulated by a planning authority should be lodged to a separate account which should only be used as capital for its functions under Part V or as capital by a housing authority for its functions in relation to the provision of housing under the Housing Acts 1966 to 2002.   This could include meeting the capital costs of providing childcare facilities in both new and existing local authority housing estates.</P>
        <P>A review of Part V was undertaken by my Department in consultation with major stakeholders in 2002 and resulted in a number of changes to Part V, which were introduced in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002.  I am satisfied that Part V is contributing significantly to the provision of social and affordable housing and while I have no proposals for another formal review of Part V at this time, I can confirm that my Department keeps its operation under continuous appraisal.</P>
