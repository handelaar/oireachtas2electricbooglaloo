   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I recall the incident which occurred 20 years ago in Chernobyl and our thoughts and prayers are with the people of the Ukraine. On this day 20 years ago 80 miles north of Kiev, a fireball exploded in one of four reactors, affecting not only ecosystems, human genes and the entire northern hemisphere but also the collective psyche of the developed western world.</P>
    <P>As the Government is aware, we face a clear and present danger in Sellafield. Given the potential radiation threat we face from terrorism or accidental nuclear fall-out, everybody hopes that children in this country will never be deemed the new Chernobyl children. It is only right and proper that we pay tribute to Adi Roche, Ali Hewson and the many others from this country who have played their parts over the years in dealing with the human consequences of the Chernobyl accident. Over the years, Irish Governments have had difficulties with BNFL in terms of radiation leaks, accidents and deliberate cover-ups of radiation levels in the Irish sea, which have caused great concern to everybody in this country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that radiation, like terrorism, does not observe any borders, so this country is in a doubly difficult position. First, Sellafield, which is located 90 miles from the Irish coast, is inescapably close. Second, Britain has been declared a preferred target for international terrorism by such as al-Qaeda on a number of occasions. Therefore, on the 20th anniversary of Chernobyl, Ireland can certainly hope for the best but should also meticulously prepare for the worst.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Fallout&rdquo; programme on RTE, which was broadcast in two parts, gave a chilling indication of what might happen in the event of a catastrophic accident at Sellafield. While the programme was fictional, many who watched it felt it reflected the scale of the difficulties that this country would face. That calls into question this country&rsquo;s level of preparedness for dealing with a possible incident. While the Irish character is one <Col N="618"/>which would always say &ldquo;it will be all right on the night&rdquo;, there is no room for complacency on an issue like this.</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach happy that we have the structures in place to react rapidly and effectively in the event of a serious accident at Sellafield? What level of funding has the Government provided to deal with preparations for a national emergency? Are the emergency services satisfied that they have all the necessary equipment, such as chemical jackets, to cope with the results of a nuclear accident? What discussions has the Taoiseach held with the British Prime Minister with regard to being informed in the event of a terrorist attack on Sellafield? Is the Taoiseach aware of Britain&rsquo;s intentions in respect of its enhanced nuclear programme, which may include other nuclear generating stations on the west coast of Britain?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Deputy Kenny in observing the 20th anniversary of Chernobyl. Our thoughts are with the families who died or suffered and who continue to suffer, as we have seen in the programmes broadcast in the past week. Thousands of families in Ireland have become personally involved with children and families from the region through the efforts of Adi Roche and many others who worked on this issue during the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>Across Europe, renewed debate is taking place on the viability of nuclear energy. As I noted here on a number of occasions recently, it is my belief that nuclear energy is not a solution. Its consequences are dangerous in the short, medium and long term and, as a non-nuclear State, we have played a strong role in preventing the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and in developing a legal strategy to force the eventual closure of Sellafield, which is located on our doorstep. Today is a day for remembrance and reflection on the victims, both living and dead, of the Chernobyl disaster and I am sure everybody in the House will join Deputy Kenny in that.</P>
    <P>On the wider issue, the Deputy will be aware that the Government has continued to fight for the safe closure of Sellafield. The site poses an unacceptable threat to this country on the grounds that ongoing pollution, poor safety records and the potentially serious impact of a major disaster or terrorist attack could affect all aspects of life here. The Government has been proactive at every level in taking political, diplomatic and legal action to advance Ireland&rsquo;s cause.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s questions on the level of preparedness, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has spoken about that, as has the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland in recent days. For the past 20 years, national administrations, in accordance with guidance from the UN, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Commission, have been developing and updating nuclear emergency responses on an <Col N="619"/>ongoing basis. Our national plan, which was updated last Christmas and has been published, is designed to respond to a major disaster in a nuclear installation in the UK or elsewhere. It contains comprehensive arrangements for the early notification of nuclear accidents to the competent Irish authorities.</P>
    <P>On the specific question put by Deputy Kenny, an agreement is in place between Ireland and Britain, as well as internationally, to immediately relay to governments information on any incident of this kind. That would be done at EU level and by national governments. In fairness to the British Government, it has relayed detailed information when incidents took place and has become stronger in doing so in recent years. That does not change our position that we would rather see it updated. There is also timely accurate advice to the public, mobilisation of the emergency services, monitoring radioactive emissions and co-operation with international agencies. The plan has been audited and validated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny asked if I was satisfied. One is never satisfied on such an issue because one hopes it will never be tested and the only way to guarantee that would be if Sellafield were not there. The national emergency committee meeting involves all the services, including the Garda, the Defence Forces and international experts. We have used many international experts in recent years, particularly in the preparation of our cases. People with world expertise have assisted us in our planning and our fight in the case.</P>
    <P>On Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s last question, although I do not know what the final British policy will be, everything I have heard from British politicians from the two main parties is that they are still committed to nuclear energy. I was watching a debate last night in which politicians spoke about Chernobyl. They all said how terrible Chernobyl was, but said they were pro-nuclear. It is up to every politician to reconcile his or her mind on these issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has responded on what the Government has been doing about this. The advice given to the Government and the decision it took on the closure of Sellafield was to proceed through the United Nations, which was the incorrect approach. What is the status of the Government&rsquo;s case against Britain for the closure of Sellafield?</P>
    <P>I hope the national emergency plan will never be tested. Following its updating, as has been pointed out by Deputy Timmins on a number of occasions, when so many Departments and committees are involved and when everybody is in charge, nobody is in charge. God forbid it would ever happen, but in the same way former Mayor of New York, Mr. Rudolph Guiliani, took charge after 11 September, would it not be more feasible, as indicated by the Emergency Planning Society report, to have one central control unit in charge <Col N="620"/>of such a national emergency? In a survey seven out of ten people felt the Government was ill prepared for a national emergency. Is it not the case that no independent audit of the national emergency plan has been done to verify that it would work in practice? Is the Taoiseach concerned about the recent comments by a representative of fire fighters that they do not have sufficient equipment and resources to deal with something like this? Will the Taoiseach indicate when the Minister, Deputy Roche, will be in a position to take the case for Government to Europe for closure of Sellafield?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Our national plan has been audited, tested and validated internationally in line with best practice. That is a continual process. On Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s point about co-ordination of the various organisations such as the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, the Garda and the Defence Forces, the plan sets out how these should be co-ordinated and the centre of co-ordination. Not only are these detailed in the plan but in the trial runs, the latest one being last year, the co-ordination scheme was implemented. We have followed best international practice in this.</P>
    <P>Regarding our case, we have brought together some of the world&rsquo;s best experts in this field from the US and elsewhere, people who have been on both sides of this argument and who have considerable expertise in the preparation of our case. We are pressing on with our case and will continue to do so. We await the final judgement of the European Court and we have indicated clearly that we will go to the European Court of Justice and have presented a strong case that is being prepared by the Minister, the Attorney General and the team that has worked on this for us. We have made our position on this clear to the British Government. While this issue has been raised in recent days, we have been proactive and are prepared for a nuclear emergency, we have anticipated everything it is likely we would be asked to do and have applied internationally set criteria and continue to validate it against international best practice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I raised questions with the Taoiseach about the integrity of the criminal prosecution system following the collapse of the case against Mr. Dermot Laide in the Circuit Criminal Court and the responsibility of Government to maintain the integrity of that system. The Taoiseach pleaded he was inadequately briefed and could not deal with my questions. However a spokesperson for the Government last night reassured the public that it believed no other cases would collapse like the Dermot Laide case because of the infirmity of the former eminent State pathologist, Dr. John Harbison. While that assurance is welcome, I would like to get it on <Col N="621"/>the record of this House rather than a fleeting statement on the RTE news.</P>
    <P>Now that I am sure the Taoiseach has been briefed, has a note and has spoken to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as he told me he would, I would like to ask my questions again. Yesterday&rsquo;s attempt to muddy the waters about the roles of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not help. The State pathology service is directly contracted to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister, not the DPP, is responsible.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach now say issues about Dr. Harbison&rsquo;s availability to give evidence, and the reliability of that evidence, have not arisen in any case in the criminal courts before the Dermot Laide case? I ask the Taoiseach to be precise and to tell the House the answer to the questions I raised yesterday. When did the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform become aware that Dr. Harbison&rsquo;s infirmity may have this kind of impact? When did he put the DPP in possession of all the information? Given the onerous disclosure duties on the DPP in criminal trials, it is important to know when the DPP was put in possession of this information.</P>
    <P>I have not been reassured by the fact that we have not heard from the Minister for 24 hours. I challenge any Member of the House to give me an instance when that has happened since he became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Government dealt with this important question. While we are accustomed to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform speaking on behalf of the Government on any issue, we are not accustomed to the Government speaking on behalf of the Minister. Here is the man who told us on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; on Monday night and in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday that he was dismissive of the idea of two State pathologists. He said it could not be entertained. This morning we heard on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that the Scottish system is to be applied here and we will have two State pathologists. I want to know why the Minister has been silent for 24 hours and what he told the Taoiseach about when he came into possession of this knowledge that has serious implications for the integrity of the criminal prosecution system.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
	<P>He is sulking.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with the two points on which Deputy Rabbitte questioned me yesterday. I was fully briefed on the first point. The second question he asked was when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform knew about this matter. I stated yesterday that I did not know and that it was a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. A spokesperson for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform put the reply to that question into the public domain immediately afterwards. I <Col N="622"/>understand there is a D&aacute;il question in that regard or that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated he would in some way deal with the matter in the House today. I understand he is well prepared to do that.</P>
    <P>I was briefed on the first issue yesterday and my position, which I will restate, is exactly the same today. The Deputy asks whether I can give an assurance on the record of the House that no case might arise in the future, that no case is pending or that no case might come through the Court of Appeal where this evidence would be required. I cannot give such an assurance because it is not my responsibility.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said it last night.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A decision in regard to proceeding with a trial or a retrial is exclusively a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Legislation has been passed by this House to make that the case. The DPP is an independent officer who makes his own independent and objective assessment of the circumstances applying in each case. It is not the function of this House or any entity to seek to influence the decision of the DPP. I am not going to get into that. I never have and will not do so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>What implications, if any, arise from Dr. Harbison&rsquo;s condition are a matter for assessment by the DPP on a case by case basis. For me to suggest that the DPP could be definite that he would not be prepared for some case that might arise in one or two year&rsquo;s time in the Court of Appeal is not possible &mdash; I could not do that. I will not make such a stupid guess on a matter like that.</P>
    <P>Whether any trial or retrial is to proceed is solely a matter for the DPP and his decision will be made on the basis of the evidence available to him. It is totally unwise to speculate on the effect, if any, that Dr. Harbison&rsquo;s condition might have on the DPP&rsquo;s decision in any particular case, the evidence that will be available to him when he makes that decision and what issues will be in contest in any trial.</P>
    <P>I also point out that the <i>sub judice</i> rule applies in cases pending before our courts. I was careful in answering on this matter yesterday. My position is the same today. Somebody else might make an assessment of what might happen in the Court of Appeal in one or two year&rsquo;s time with regard to a case or a murder that happened five or six years ago &mdash; I will not go down that road.</P>

   </Speaker><Col N="623"/>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, no spokesperson on my behalf made any statement last night. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform made the statement.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

	<P>Allow Deputy Rabbitte to speak without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Brian, you are surely levering him out now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>How is it going, Deputy? The Deputy always comes to his defence.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>You are leaving McDowell in the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is the first Labour Party man to propose it. Well done to him.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>You are disowning him.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy always comes to his defence.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputies Penrose and Cowen should allow Deputy Rabbitte to continue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Deputy stands as firmly behind Deputy Parlon as he stands behind Deputy McDowell. He is on watery ground.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We know that the Deputy will be on his own at the back in any case.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it we will hear from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform after that act of disowning.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is the Minister not in the House?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact of the matter is that the Taoiseach and the Government do not now take responsibility collectively for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The statement which I just read clearly sought last night to give the impression, which is repeated in the newspapers today, that no further cases will arise. That is now being disowned by the Taoiseach.</P><Col N="624"/>
    <P>The Taoiseach goes back into &ldquo;muddying the waters&rdquo; mode as between the role of the DPP and the role of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I have made clear the responsibility for the State pathology services is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Taoiseach again today evaded the critical questions. I asked him whether any issues arise in respect of the evidence of Dr. Harbison or the reliability of that evidence in any case prior to the Laide case. He did not answer that question.</P>
    <P>It is not something that he cannot know. Has any such case arisen? I am aware that one has. In the Kiely case, a situation arose where a person was convicted for murder and rape. In a retrial, that conviction was changed to manslaughter and rape. The presiding judge, Mr. Justice Barry White, stated that the fact that former State pathologist Professor John Harbison became ill and was not available to give evidence was perhaps to the defendant&rsquo;s benefit.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time is concluded.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>He stated that the pathology evidence given by Dr. Marie Cassidy, based on photographs, was less forceful. It led to a change of conviction in that case also.</P>
    <P>This is a very important issue. The Taoiseach is the leader of the Government. I am merely seeking that he would reassure the House and through it the public with regard to the integrity of the criminal prosecution system. He ought to have a detailed note on this matter. I am amazed that he is disowning the statement from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am amazed that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform made a statement which the Minister did not front. I am amazed that the Minister sought to create a distraction by stating that reform of the deposition system was necessary and that he intended to introduce law to make that change but he then resiled from that position on the same programme when challenged about it. I am amazed that there was a statement yesterday morning from the Minister that to have two State pathologists could not be contemplated for a variety of reasons best known to an eminent criminal lawyer who uses his position to cow people from asking questions, yet, this morning, we can have two State pathologists.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time is concluded.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to come to the House and disown the Minister, Deputy McDowell, and his officials. What are the answers to the questions I raised yesterday? I do not believe the Taoiseach was not briefed. I believe he could easily have anticipated <Col N="625"/>one of the more obvious and important questions that would be raised in the House. The fact that he feigns lack of briefing does not persuade me.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte raises two issues. First, he asks whether we can give an assurance on the integrity of the criminal justice system. Of course we can &mdash; it is an independent system. The issue of prosecution of offences, which the Deputy tried to gloss over, is a matter solely for the DPP.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the issue I am raising.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy tried to go a little away but then he stopped.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I did not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about the pathology service. The Taoiseach is avoiding the issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A decision on proceeding with a trial or a retrial, which is the core of the Deputy&rsquo;s point, is exclusively a matter for the DPP. Therefore, I cannot understand how anybody other than the DPP can give that answer.</P>
    <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s next question, the Minister last night clarified whether there were any known cases &mdash; Deputy Rabbitte also asked that question today. There was no confusion. The Minister clarified it. I stated in the House that I did not have the detail&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What did he clarify?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and neither should I have the detail of previous cases. The Minister answered on that through his spokesperson&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>He did nothing of the kind.</P>
  
   </Speaker>
    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which was quite in order.</P>
    <P>In his third question, Deputy Rabbitte asked me to put on record when the Minister knew the position with regard to Professor Harbison. The Minister clarified that point last night. I will restate the position. He said that in January 2003 garda&iacute; had suggested to a senior official in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that Professor Harbison should not take on new cases, given that he was getting on and that the murder cases were generally taking a considerable time to reach trial. Professor Harbison was then aged approximately 68. He subsequently retired and performed no new autopsies after that time. Until recently, he dealt with his work giving evidence in pre-2003 cases. That is the answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question. There is no confusion regarding any of those issues.</P>
    <P>To answer the question that the Deputy was asking yesterday and today, it has nothing to do with briefing. He asks whether I can give him an assurance that there is no case, either under way <Col N="626"/>or that ultimately might go to the Court of Appeal, the judgment of which evidence from Professor Harbison or some other fact could alter. I cannot do so, since it would be totally improper. It will be decided case by case on the day. The very point that Deputy Rabbitte makes is that for the integrity of the criminal justice system and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the only person who can make that judgment is the DPP.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>On this day 20 years ago, the devastating potential of nuclear power was unleashed by the explosion of just one reactor at Chernobyl. Some 190 tonnes of uranium and graphite were expelled into the atmosphere, contaminating for thousands of years an area around the plant the size of England and Ireland combined. The people of Chernobyl were exposed to radioactivity 90 times greater than the explosion at Hiroshima, and yet only 3% of the radioactivity contained in the plant was released. I acknowledge that the Government has been helpful in supporting the work of the Chernobyl Children&rsquo;s Project and the many other groups trying to alleviate the victims&rsquo; suffering, which continues across the generations. I also thank Adi Roche and the many volunteers and families involved since the disaster, many of them in my constituency.</P>
    <P>The question is whether the Taoiseach will to any practical extent help prevent another such disaster closer to home at Sellafield. It is ominous that after the RTE &ldquo;Fallout&rdquo; programme, the Government number, 1890 443322, was playing a recorded announcement or else engaged when people to whom I spoke sought more information. God help us were we to have a disaster. The Taoiseach speaks of having an emergency plan published, but will he circulate it? Now is when people are most likely to read it, given the anniversary we are discussing today. Will the Taoiseach require the emergency services to carry out an exercise, something that the fire service, for example, has mentioned? <i>The Irish Times</i> has reported that the emergency services are ill-equipped to deal with nuclear disaster. One reason is that they have never carried out an exercise to assess how they might cope in the event of a major emergency. I know that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, who was in the House, has not audited local authorities&rsquo; emergency plans, and the emergency services are not clear that they have acceptable measures in place.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach speaks of paying attention to television and finding out what the British Government is thinking. Will he make a submission on behalf of the Government to the British regarding their talk of expanding their nuclear programme? Is it not a basic requirement of the Government that it state that we will not stand idly by while the potential for another Chernobyl grows across the water?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="627"/>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding publishing the information, the plans are on the websites of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. Both are readily available.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>How many hits have they received?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The RPII has been very active in promoting its plan through its literature, which I have seen. A public information leaflet on what to do in a nuclear emergency was distributed to all households a few years ago. A new print run of the revised leaflet is to be distributed to public libraries and citizens&rsquo; information centres. The full emergency plan has been disseminated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. There is no need to circulate the entire plan among the public since many parts are very detailed and technical, but it is available where necessary.</P>
    <P>In passing, I will mention a debate that I heard last night. I have discussed the matter and raised it formally with the British Government on many occasions. We will continue the fight for the safe closure of Sellafield, which poses an unacceptable threat on the grounds of pollution, poor safety and the potentially devastating impact of a serious incident. We have initiated legal proceedings in two separate fora regarding the Sellafield MOX plant, under the OSPAR Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Judge Advocate General issued an opinion regarding the European Court of Justice ruling against us last January, which we continue to dispute, with a full legal team working on it. The national plan has been audited, tested and validated in line with best practice, and we have used very high-ranking experts, details of whom the Minister, Deputy Roche, has provided in recent days.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Sargent that none of these issues should be taken lightly. Nowadays there is always a risk of terrorist attacks, including some that one can hardly envisage. For those reasons, we must be careful. We will continue helping, in every way possible, the various organisations and individuals that have assisted Chernobyl, particularly Adi Roche.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked four questions and received an answer to one, namely, that the Government will not circulate the plan to every household.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>That is quite a good score.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps one out of four from the Taoiseach is not that bad.</P>
    <P>However, I also asked whether the fire service would have an emergency exercise to assess how <Col N="628"/>we might cope. That is what it seeks, but I have not had an answer. There has never been such an exercise. Second, I requested an audit of the local authority plans rather than of the national plan, which is different. The local authority plans have not been audited by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Third, I asked whether the Taoiseach had made a formal submission to the British Government. We know about the cases against Sellafield under UNCLOS and so forth, but the current issue is expansion rather than the retention of existing installations.</P>
    <P>Since the Government supported my amendment in 1999 ruling out nuclear power in law, we know what it is against. The question that people need answered is what the Government is for. We are the fifth most oil-dependent country in the world, and that position is getting worse. We are building 300 km of road this year and no rail. What is the Government for when it comes to acting on the potential of renewables and energy savings?</P>
    <P>A report has stated that wind farms could transform the Irish Sea from the most radioactive in the world to the green energy powerhouse of Europe. Will the Government act on that or will it continue supporting EURATOM, which promotes nuclear expansion? Will it shrug its shoulders when Forf&aacute;s presents nuclear power as an option for Ireland and the proposed Schedule 7 in the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill leaves open the possibility of building a plant?</P>
    <P>Apart from helping the victims and closing nuclear installations, which we hope will happen, the best commemoration would be to follow the example of Sweden which has said that by 2020 it will end its reliance on oil and phase out nuclear power. That is the sort of action that we require from the Government. Will the Taoiseach show us the only real action that can truly commemorate Chernobyl and indicate that we have learnt lessons?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As regards the fire service and emergency plans, the fire service has been involved in many exercises and I have no difficulty with any of those issues which are for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Deputy knows there is a renewed debate across Europe about the viability of nuclear energy and he knows our view on it. We do not see it as a solution. Its consequences are dangerous in the short, medium and long term. In the paper on energy reform, which will be published shortly, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will set out our options on this issue</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>Will the Government make a submission to the British Government?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="629"/>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us be very clear about this. As a result of the cases, actions and meetings at official and ministerial levels and at my level, the British Government is very much aware of our position. The British Government, as a sovereign one, has announced details of a review of energy policy, including nuclear energy, for an updated energy policy which will be published in a few months&rsquo; time. We are fully engaged in a consultation process on this policy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has not made a submission.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We robustly represent the concerns of the people on any proposals which have a negative impact on public health. The Deputy may think writing a letter is better than setting out our position. I would say to the Green Party that, thankfully, this side of the House did not have to wait until its formation to take a position on non-proliferation. This side of the House has been doing that since 1959&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 20, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>I met Prime Minister Blair on the margins of the EU summit in Brussels on 24 March. At that meeting, we discussed our plans for the restoration of the Assembly and the Executive, which we announced on 6 April. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and I met the leaders of Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP and the Alliance Party on 30 March. These meetings were part of a wider range of contacts by the two Governments in advance of our joint statement in Armagh.</P>
    <P>When we met in Armagh on 6 April, Prime Minister Blair and I announced our intention to recall the Assembly on 15 May. The primary responsibility of the Assembly will be to elect a First Minister and Deputy First Minister and to allocate ministerial posts under the d&rsquo;Hondt formula and to make other preparations for government in Northern Ireland. If, despite best efforts, the Assembly is not able to elect a First Minister and Deputy First Minister on a cross-community basis within the normal six week period, we have said that we are prepared to allow a further period of 12 weeks after the summer recess in which to form an Executive.</P>
    <P>The restored Assembly will, however, be required to form an Executive by 24 November. If an Executive cannot be successfully formed by that date, there will be no choice but to cancel the salaries and allowances of the MLAs and to defer restoration of the Assembly and Executive until there is a clear political willingness to exercise devolved power.</P>
    <P>The two Governments are working for a successful outcome to our initiative. We are giving Northern Ireland&rsquo;s politicians space and reasonable time to reach agreement. For our part, Prime Minister Blair and I will devote ourselves in every <Col N="632"/>way possible in these coming months to help them achieve this.</P>
    <P>While we will continue to work for success, we know that we must also address what we would have to do in the event that an Executive is not formed by 24 November. We are agreed that this would have immediate implications for our joint stewardship of the process. Our joint statement stated that we are beginning detailed work on British-Irish partnership arrangements that will be necessary in these circumstances. We have made it very clear that we will together actively develop the agreement across its structures and functions.</P>
    <P>The British Government last week published emergency legislation to facilitate the restoration of the Assembly and the election of an Executive. The parties must now engage if this initiative is to be successful. Their response following the announcement in Armagh has been measured and it is the hope of the two Governments that this initial reaction will provide a solid foundation for real progress after 15 May. Every party has a role to play but there is a particular onus on the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in. They will take their seats in the Assembly for the first time as the largest parties representing their respective communities. I hope that we will at an early stage see the opening of productive dialogue between them and with the other parties.</P>
    <P>Everyone in Northern Ireland is aware of the dangers of a political vacuum. We want to see the politicians who are elected by the people carry out their democratic mandate and make decisions for the people. The two Governments are united in our conviction that the devolved government of the Good Friday Agreement is what will best allow Northern Ireland to move on and to prosper. The opportunity to restore devolved government in Northern Ireland may not arise again for some time if it is not seized this year.</P>
    <P>Earlier this morning, the two Governments published the tenth report of the Independent Monitoring Commission. This is the most positive IMC report to date and I welcome it. It is the IMC&rsquo;s view that the IRA leadership has committed itself to following a peaceful path and has expended considerable effort to refocus the movement in support of its objective. The IMC says it is not aware of current terrorist, paramilitary or violent activity sanctioned by the IRA leadership. It says the leadership continues to seek to stop criminal activity by its members and to prevent them from engaging in it. It also states that it is not aware of any intelligence-related activity that is outside the aims of the statement of July last year. Its overall assessment on the Provisional IRA is positive.</P>
    <P>This report from the IMC comes at a crucial time. It is an encouraging boost to the process. I hope the developments outlined in the report will help to create a constructive climate and add momentum to the initiative of restoring devolved government in Northern Ireland this year. While <Col N="633"/>there is an inevitable focus on the Provisional IRA, the IMC also reports on the activities of loyalist paramilitaries and is a timely reminder of the ongoing threat posed by dissident republican groups.</P>
    <P>My discussions with President Bush on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day focused on Northern Ireland, immigration reform and a range of relevant international issues. I have no plans to meet the President. I expect to meet the US Special Envoy, Mitchell Reiss, in the coming weeks. I very much welcome the firm support of the President and his Administration for our ongoing efforts.</P>
    <P>I have not yet had an opportunity to discuss the privatisation of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant with Prime Minister Blair. I next expect to meet the Prime Minister during the EU Latin America Caribbean summit in Vienna on 11 and 12 May.</P>
    <P>In light of the various views I have received, I hope to be in touch in the coming period with party leaders in the House with revised proposals in regard to participation, on a cross-community basis, by Northern MPs in an Oireachtas committee on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and North-South relations.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I was going to ask the Taoiseach about the IMC report but he dealt with it in his reply. I welcome what he said and presume his interpretation of it is that the contents of this latest IMC is helpful to the process. What precisely do the two Government have in mind when they talk about joint stewardship in the event of discussions not being successful between now and November? What exactly is involved? Will it be a reversion to the Anglo-Irish Agreement with cross-Border bodies added on? If that is the case, is it not a considerable step back from the Good Friday Agreement?</P>
    <P>Has the Government received a report yet from the Garda on the murder of Denis Donaldson? Has a file been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of that killing?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The short answer to the first question on the IMC report is that this was always going to be an important report because while the last one was positive, there were a few areas which created concern. I highlighted those at the time and there was much focus on them. This report covers the period from the end of last year up to the first quarter and it has been a positive one across all the sectors. I do not want to go into any of the negative aspects of it, which do not relate to the Provisional IRA, but we must continue to focus on some of the loyalist paramilitary activity which is not too positive and on what has been said about dissident republicans, particularly the Continuity IRA. Some strong issues have been raised regarding that organisation and we are required to bear them in mind. On the central issue in the process, the Deputy <Col N="634"/>stated correctly that the report is positive in light of what we are trying to do to get the institutions to work.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked me to outline plan B. On the day of the press conference, we outlined what we wanted to do for the next eight months. We obviously want to devote all our energy and effort to making plan A work. However, we must also be honest in that one cannot just leave a vacuum. While the focus of the two Governments is on making the Assembly and Executive work, any alternatives would clearly be second best. I consider this to be the case and have made this very clear for the people of Northern Ireland. No matter how good the alternative in terms of co-operation between the two Governments may be, one would be doing it in the absence of the political process in Northern Ireland. That would not be a good or healthy position. There is no doubt that a partnership arrangement dealing with all the issues could well be achieved but it is certainly not what I want to put in place.</P>
    <P>In the event of a failure to form a power-sharing Executive on 24 November, we will have to examine the immediate implications of what we have called our &ldquo;joint stewardship&rdquo; of the process. We have obligations to people on both parts of the island under the Good Friday Agreement. In the absence of a power-sharing executive, we would have no choice but to bring forward alternative arrangements to ensure the implementation of all aspects of the Agreement other than those related to the institutions. We would have to do this to the maximum extent possible. The simple answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question is that all the aspects of the Good Friday Agreement not concerning the Executive or Assembly would have to be dealt with in another way. We will do the detailed work on this. Plan B is very much a second-best option. The Good Friday Agreement envisages an inclusive cross-community process and this is what I want to achieve.</P>
    <P>No information on the Denis Donaldson murder has been brought to my attention. There is a very active Garda investigation into the issue and obviously the Garda and PSNI will collaborate closely and share information on the case. Nothing of any substance has been reported to me since the murder.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">To follow on Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s question, I welcome the report of the IMC, which points to further progress regarding the IRA fulfilling its commitments. I urge the DUP, in particular, to use the opportunity presented by the forthcoming recall of the Assembly to engage further in dialogue that might bring about further trust before the recall of the Executive later in the year. Does the Taoiseach have a view on the IMC&rsquo;s opinion that the proceeds of IRA crime might be used as what it calls a &ldquo;strategic asset&rdquo; in the Twenty-six Counties? Is this not a clear indication that every resource and facility should be made available to the Garda, the PSNI and <Col N="635"/>the CAB so they can follow the money trail to ensure assets acquired through criminality by the IRA are not channelled into strategic asset use, as the IMC report indicates? In this context, has the Taoiseach examined the rates of duty that apply to diesel and petrol on either side of the Border? There is obviously a racket going on all the time in this regard and it needs to be monitored and stamped out.</P>
    <P>Arising from Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s question on the murder of Denis Donaldson, has the Taoiseach any information on the possible outing of further persons alleged to be involved in spying activities north or south of the Border?</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach outline the changed position on representation by Northern Ireland representatives in a committee of the House? Surely this could not work if Unionist representatives were not included. Is the Taoiseach aware of their position on this?</P>
    <P>Yesterday at the meeting of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body in Killarney, Mr. Eddie McGrady, MP, a member of the SDLP, stated, significantly, that the SDLP and other parties are being ignored in the current talks and have not been advised fully by the Taoiseach or UK Prime Minister on the proposals in hand. I do not know if the Taoiseach is aware of this statement but there were obviously occasions on which the SDLP in particular felt left out. Given that the Taoiseach must now deal with Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, the UUP and SDLP may sometimes feel left out of the discussions. Therefore, is it not in the interest of everybody that they should be informed fully? Perhaps the Taoiseach will take the opportunity to respond to Mr. McGrady&rsquo;s comment in view of his party&rsquo;s long association with constitutional politics and its belief that communities should be able to live together and deal with normal politics.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Deputy Kenny asked a number of questions, the first of which raises an important issue. He is correct in that the view is the Provisional IRA has built up a considerable asset base over the past 30 years and its resources are somewhere. Powers of investigation exist and it is a matter for the CAB and other bodies to engage with this issue and investigate it fully. The powers are very strong, as they are in respect of any form of criminality. It is important to deal with the issue. I do not have any information on any cross-over into politics but obviously the view is that significant assets were built up over the years and that they are somewhere. The legal authorities, the PSNI, the Garda and the CAB have to and should deal with these issues and there should be co-operation between them. We have seen such action recently in the Border region and have seen investigations in other areas to deal with these issues. Any development in the ongoing peace process will never remove the obligation <Col N="636"/>on the State to continue to pursue these issues &mdash; it is very important that they be pursued.</P>
    <P>As I said, I have no information on the Denis Donaldson issue. On the outing of spies, we were talking about the McCord case yesterday. It is a matter of how much and the extent to which spying took place. The issue of Denis Donaldson arose around Christmas and I reported to the House on what was said to me at that stage by the head of the PSNI. I have my own view on the matter but, as with many matters, when dealing with spies and espionage one must ask what one can ever prove. There was certainly much dealing, double-dealing and treble-dealing taking place at all levels. God knows what kind of outing could happen.</P>
    <P>Regarding public representatives from Northern Ireland, anything we do here regarding proposals to invite members to attend a committee, which is what we are talking about, would have to be done in an even-handed way. Nothing else can be done on it. There is scope for this in dealing with European issues and issues that are important. I have talked to all the parties and am informed about that.</P>
    <P>On the issue of people not being informed, we go to enormous lengths with everybody to keep everybody briefed, but I am afraid it is just a bit of a catch call of everybody that the officials talk to them. I have great regard and respect for Eddie McGrady and I do not know the context in which he said what he did yesterday. Before we undertook the initiative I personally briefed the leader of Eddie McGrady&rsquo;s party and my officials have been with him several times. I am afraid this is just an ongoing part of the process. When the relationship was UUP and SDLP, Sinn F&eacute;in and other parties said they were not in the loop, and now this has changed as numbers changed. I can honestly say for our part we do great work to keep them in the loop. Officials bend inside out trying to assist all parties. They are available to them and they go to huge lengths. They have always had an understanding of their position. We will continue to do that.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the importance of this is that it is a very positive report. This report has been talked about. I know we could just jump over it today and say that it is now out. However, since October I have had to listen to people say: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not answering you now: we will wait till the end of April report&rdquo;. I have heard that endlessly. Obviously I welcome the DUP&rsquo;s presence and comments at the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body in Killarney. It has nothing to fear from that body and has much to contribute to it. I welcome its focus on power sharing. However, I urge it not to delay too long. Deputy Kenny is right in what he has said on this matter. The timeframe we have set is fixed for this year. If agreement is not possible in this timeframe it might be a long while before the opportunity comes around again. That is the view of the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and it is my view.</P><Col N="637"/>
    <P>In the short term we would like to see open and direct dialogue between all the parties. I believe one way in which the DUP can seek to establish the bona fides of Sinn F&eacute;in and <i>vice versa</i> is through direct dialogue. This report allows that direct dialogue to start and I know the DUP wants to be satisfied before going into government with Sinn F&eacute;in. However, if it is serious about working towards that end, it should talk to Sinn F&eacute;in now. This report allows that position. I do not believe there is any reason it should not do so. I believe that opening a dialogue with Sinn F&eacute;in could make a real difference and I hope that happens.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Taoiseach to note my regret that he has withdrawn his proposal to allow Six Counties MPs to attend here in this institution and this year to participate in meetings of the D&aacute;il, sitting as a committee of the entire House. The Taoiseach should use the opportunity to call on the leaders of the Fine Gael and Labour parties to withdraw their opposition to such a proposition, which would have ensured access for all Six Counties MPs to this new and very important opportunity. Does the Taoiseach agree that partitionism, plain and simple, is at the root of their respective opposition to the proposal? Recognising the ever-changing situation, the importance of imaginative initiatives being taken and his own previously stated commitment to the proposal he constructed and tabled, would the Taoiseach not now restore the proposal and put his plan into effect?</P>
    <P>As a former member of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, I record my welcome for the DUP&rsquo;s attendance at the meeting of that body on Monday in County Kerry. Having previously declined to attend any of its meetings, in Britain, the Six Counties or this State, the fact that the DUP representatives have now travelled south &mdash; they could hardly have travelled further south than to Kerry &mdash; must be interpreted as a positive signal. In this context, did the Taoiseach note Peter Robinson&rsquo;s statement that his party wants to form part of a power-sharing government? Does the Taoiseach agree that there can only be a power-sharing executive with DUP participation if Sinn F&eacute;in is an integral component part? That is exactly what a power-sharing administration equates with in terms of the Northern configuration as it currently presents.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the apparently more conciliatory remarks of Mr. Robinson would be very helpfully repeated in address to his own community and his party&rsquo;s support base, which is where it needs to be heard most clearly? Does the Taoiseach agree that the best interests of not only the DUP but also the broader Unionist community in the Six Counties can be served best when the DUP fully takes on its responsibilities of the political leadership of Unionism today and fully engages with all other parties, including Sinn F&eacute;in, in addressing the important issues that <Col N="638"/>affect the lives of the people they represent and of all people living in the Six Counties area and the echoes of that throughout Ireland?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy raised three different issues. On Oireachtas participation, as I said in my reply, I will be in touch with party leaders with revised proposals. Last year I agreed I would consult with everybody and we listened to what people in the North said as well as the parties in the House. We have worked on a cross-party basis on many of these issues. A joint Oireachtas report was prepared on this matter. It was not my proposal, but a proposal of an all-party committee. While I tried to implement the report, it did not find favour, which is the reality of the situation. We tried to find revised proposals.</P>
    <P>What I have in mind is the establishment of a new joint Oireachtas committee to address the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and North-South relations. These are clearly matters of the utmost national importance and would benefit from the attention a dedicated joint committee could afford them. In addition to its membership, in accordance with normal practice it would be open to all Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad to attend and contribute to the proceedings of the joint committee as is the case with all committees. Existing committee procedures regarding the conduct of business would apply and the normal committee facilities and resources would be made available. As I said in response to Deputy Kenny, Northern Ireland MPs would be invited on a cross-community basis to attend and contribute to the proceedings of the joint committee following the precedent that applies in the case of Northern Ireland MEPs at the Oireachtas Joint Committees on European Affairs and Foreign Affairs. I am sure their expertise and experience would make an important contribution to the work of a new joint committee. Of course we will continue to progress the establishment of the North-South parliamentary forum and the North-South consultative forum, which also form part of the Good Friday Agreement. I will discuss these proposals with the Whips and the party leaders shortly.</P>
    <P>I have already answered the question and will restate the position. Based on the progress that has been made in the past nine or ten months I believe there should be dialogue between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, which would make a real difference. The better those two parties get on with each other based on the strength of their mandates in the last election, the better it would be to work an inclusive agreement.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s question, my idea of an inclusive agreement is, obviously, an agreement with which the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in are involved. If they are not part of the process, it will not be in line with the basis of the Good Friday Agreement as it was envisaged. As I have said, the d&rsquo;Hondt system is the only system that can resolve that particular difficulty. The important <Col N="639"/>thing is for us to capitalise on the positive developments of recent months. As I have said on many occasions, there is no reason the parties cannot make progress long before the final date of 24 November. I would be the happiest person in the world if the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in and all the other parties were to follow the normal arrangement by trying to work and get on together in the first six weeks. I urge all the parties to be as responsible as they can and to work together as best they can.</P>
    <P>We do not want to have to deal with a very unsatisfactory position after 24 November. That date is not being used to threaten anyone. The reality is that the position cannot go on as it is at present. Politicians in Northern Ireland understand that as well as I do. The greatest difficulty I had in the United States &mdash; all the parties know that because they were there &mdash; was to try to make people understand how people who had been elected to an assembly and an organisation for over four years had not met during that time, despite all the progress that had been made. I was really stretched to try to explain that in the US Senate and on Capitol Hill. People throughout the world have political differences, but it is hard to explain to politicians in the United States or the United Kingdom who take an interest why people will not sit down to try to work to an agreement that was voted on by the people.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to return to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s earlier comment that the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, is well aware of his views on the privatisation of Sellafield. I know from what he has said that he has not made a formal written submission on the British Government&rsquo;s nuclear plans in general, but I suggest that he should do so. He spoke a moment ago about the parties in Northern Ireland cosying up to each other, but a fair bit of cosying up is taking place in those debates and discussions. If the Government were to make a written submission, it would be on the record. It could be referred to as a matter of <Col N="640"/>record that this country has made a submission in respect of the UK&rsquo;s nuclear expansion plans.</P>
    <P>I thank Mr. Hickey and the other officials in the Department of the Taoiseach for meeting us to update us on the peace process, but it was a little too late, unfortunately. The meeting did not represent the type of engagement with Opposition parties that is needed. Future briefings on the peace process should be given to Opposition parties at an earlier stage of the proceedings to facilitate an exchange of views. They should not merely involve passing on a message, which is what happened in this instance, in effect.</P>
    <P>The Governments have set a target date of 24 November and given some aspirational indications of what might happen under the default mechanism. Will they make absolutely clear the divisions of power that are envisaged in that scenario? There is a danger that the British Government will do to the parties in Northern Ireland what the Government does, in effect, to the Opposition parties in this House. The Government sets out its policy and expects the Green Party and other parties to go along with it. Will the structures under which a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister are in place be retained? Can the Taoiseach give the House some reassurances in that regard? The imposition of any other structures would represent a victory for anti-agreement Unionists and republicans. We need to guard against that. Have the details of the default mechanism, apart from the aspirations we have heard about in the media, been worked out?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, I have not had an opportunity to discuss the privatisation of Sellafield with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. The issue has been raised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at official level, however. Issues of this nature are regularly raised at meetings attended by officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and their counterparts in the UK. I will check whether the officials in question have made some submissions in this regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has consistently held the UK Government accountable and responsible for the continued operation of the Sellafield complex. It has submitted some very detailed papers, admittedly in the context of the cases taken under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The UK Government is well aware of the Irish position. I have had endless discussions with the British Prime Minister over the years on Sellafield and related issues, following from what happened under successive Governments over many years. The announcement by Mr. Alan Johnson MP, the UK Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, of the proposed sale of the British Nuclear Group to the private sector does not change our position. It has been <Col N="641"/>stated that the decision to privatise the group was taken to facilitate competition in the UK nuclear clean-up industry. The Government has emphasised to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and the UK Government that competition should not compromise safety and environmental standards. We have dealt with that position.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what Deputy Sargent said about consultation. The two Governments are trying as hard as we can to get the parties to buy into the proposals in a positive manner so that we can move forward together in the run-up to 6 May. It would be unhelpful to the process to lose either side or any of the parties. The toing and froing will continue almost to the end. If it had been finished and a clearer position had been known, we would have been able to brief the Opposition parties at an earlier stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The point I am making is that it needs to be better in the future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that. I was referring to the toing and froing that always seems to happen. We have no difficulty with giving briefings on any aspect of the process and we are always available to do so. Our officials are always glad to discuss the various matters because they appreciate the support they get from Members on all sides of the House as they engage in their detailed work.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the involvement of the DUP in Killarney this week. It was good to see the representatives of that party in a more realistic and conciliatory mood. Does the Taoiseach accept that criminality and the lack of support for policing are two of the biggest issues which have yet to be dealt with? Does he accept that the only way to address the first of those issues is to ensure that the Garda and the PSNI have a clearer involvement in dealing with criminality? Will he seriously examine the number of garda&iacute; who are needed to deal with criminality in the Border counties? The Taoiseach should read the transcript of the sincere comments made by Mr. Eddie McGrady, MP, at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body. It is important that the centre groups which did so much for the peace process should not feel left out. I welcome the spirit that existed between the various groups in Killarney. That spirit represents the basis for a move forward in the new context.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, express my good feeling as regards what happened at Killarney where the DUP attended. The next step, I hope, will be its involvement in the whole process so we may achieve what is hoped for. Because of the Good Friday Agreement many good things have happened. One good outcome was that a North-South body looked at the feasibility of a helicopter emergency medical service. The two parts of this island are the only areas in Europe which do <Col N="642"/>not have such a service &mdash; in particular, a centralised hospital transport service. I ask the Taoiseach to examine the feasibility of such an initiative. If a service such as this could be shared between North and South, it would instil confidence into our ability to work together and to have a much better country for all our people, particularly as regards health needs. The report on helicopter emergency services was published in 2004 and we are still waiting for action.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Crawford that the policing issue is very important. It is enormously important that communities support and ultimately participate in policing. That is the best way to address and ultimately to defeat criminality and so, policing is a key issue. I welcome the new announcement of the Policing Board and I wish it well in what is a challenging responsibility. It is important that progress is made in extending active support across all sections and communities for the new policing arrangements throughout Northern Ireland, so no individual community is denied its rightful access to police protection. I hope the draft British legislation on devolution of policing and justice will help move the issue forward on the republican side as well. Deputy Crawford asked about co-operation and of course that has to continue. We have seen much of that by the specialist units in recent times.</P>
    <P>On Deputy Cowley&rsquo;s question about North-South aspects, there has been very good co-operation recently, particularly on the health side between officials. Secretary of State Hain has been very active in progressing co-operation on those issues. In the last six months in particular we have seen far more engagement on these issues. I have not got the details of that particular report, but the amount of co-operation, activity and engagement has been stepped up dramatically, in general, as regards health. I understand that today, or perhaps last night, a large number of Secretaries General from various Departments have been engaging with their Northern Ireland counterparts. That level of engagement is growing all the time.</P>

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the important matter of an 80 year old man who became seriously ill while walking across a field in east Galway, last Friday. He was immediately assisted by his next door neighbour who fortuitously is involved in the private ambulance service system, and had at his disposal the choice of three top of the range ambulances standing within a few yards of where the man became ill. However, he was prevented from taking the severely ill patient to Portiuncula Hospital, Ballin<Col N="643"/>asloe, and had to wait for the arrival of a HSE ambulance from Galway 30 minutes later.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the patient was made comfortable and given oxygen in his neighbour&rsquo;s ambulance, but had to be transferred to the HSE vehicle for transportation to the hospital.

   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach was very forthright this morning in his response to questions about the preparedness of the Government and the country in the event of an accident at Sellafield. <Col N="646"/>He spoke about international best practice and high ranking experts being here. In that context can I ask him about No. 72, the criminal justice (suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism) Bill? Given all the activity in which the Government has been involved, it is not possible from the list to indicate when this Bill might even see the light of day. As a country we are prepared and have tested a national plan &mdash; at least on paper &mdash; so why has this Bill not been given priority given that we should prepare meticulously for such a possible catastrophic event?</P>
    <P>The registrar of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland wrote to the T&aacute;naiste in November 2005 about the appointment of a chief pharmacist. When will the two pharmacy Bills be brought forward? This is a matter of considerable concern. The Taoiseach has the information now anyway. The Bills are listed on the C list with no indication of when they will be brought forward.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a date for the criminal justice (suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism) Bill. The heads have not been presented. I will raise the issue of what will be the likely timescale for it. The pharmacy (No. 1) Bill to provide for fitness to practice regulations for pharmacists and to remove the restriction on pharmacists educated in other EU countries will come to Cabinet in the coming weeks.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>On that point of Minister&rsquo;s Question Time this afternoon, will the Taoiseach clarify for the House what he meant when he told the House this morning that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would address the issues I raised about the implications for the criminal prosecution system arising from the collapse of the Dermot Laide case? This morning the Taoiseach clearly disowned a Government spokesperson who clearly said that it was the belief in Government that no further cases would arise. The Taoiseach holds a different view. Will he explain under what stratagem the Minister will come to the House to deal with these questions about when precisely he knew about the infirmity in question and why he has been making proposals off the top of his head and then changing them when coming under pressure from journalists and from questioning in this House?</P>

	<P>I understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is in a committee today.

He said he understood there was a D&aacute;il question or some way in which the Minister would deal with this in the House today. He said he understood the Minister was well prepared to do that. The import I and other commentators have taken from that is that we will hear the Minister on the divergence of position between him and the Government. We now find there is not any such question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte asked me yesterday if the Minister would make a statement on the matter in the House. The Minister said he is quite prepared to do so but he must find some mechanism to do it. He can only do so if somebody tables a question or raises a matter on the Adjournment. The Minister is quite prepared to put on record his reply on the Dr. Harbison issue but he must find a mechanism to do it. If nobody provides a mechanism for him he cannot do it but he is prepared to do it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I tabled a Private Notice Question of which the Taoiseach is unaware because I only tabled it since he informed me there was a question.

	<P>We have a long list of promised legislation and, as the Taoiseach indicated, we are <Col N="649"/>expecting a general election in 2007. Are all those Bills genuinely promised or is this a pre-election list to encourage re-election on the understanding the Government will process the rest of the Bills? Are there two separate lists or can we take it that they are all promised legislation for this D&aacute;il? It is quite puzzling if the criminal justice (suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism) Bill is not promised for any date. What urgency is being attached to it or is there any substance to it at all?</P>
    <P>Will the childcare amendment Bill or the family law Bill legislate for the outlawing of the slapping of children?

    <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity today to set out some facts about the actions under way to improve patients&rsquo; experience at the accident and emergency departments in the country where there are problems and delays.</P>
    <P>I reiterate to the House the Government&rsquo;s total commitment to achieve sustained results by working with the Health Service Executive to address all the issues that cause problems at certain accident and emergency departments. These are complex problems which require a full spectrum of actions to address them. The problems will be solved with a combination of reform, resources, management actions and improved efficiency, tailored to each individual hospital.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Government takes the responsibility to lead reform for real improvements and we are giving this priority. We are providing all necessary funding. We have empowered HSE management to act and we will support and back up its actions.</P><Col N="653"/>
    <P>We plan to recruit many new consultants in the coming years. We are providing funding for new beds in hospital wards, in accident and emergency areas and in the community. We urge all concerned to contribute to solutions and we will continue to work to get this right.</P>
    <P>Last year, more than 1.2 million people attended accident and emergency departments nationally, an average of nearly 3,300 a day. On average, 75% of these patients are treated and discharged without the need for admission to an acute hospital bed. Not every hospital has problems with its accident and emergency services; some of the accident and emergency departments function very well.</P>
    <P>There are 53 acute public hospitals in the country; 35 of these have accident and emergency departments and a minority of these experience consistent problems. The problems are different in each hospital and this is the reason the solutions are hospital-by-hospital. The bottom line for all of us is that no old person should have to sleep overnight on a trolley in a corridor. This has to stop and I am determined that it will.</P>
    <P>We also have to speed up our accident and emergency services for everybody. I said I wanted the accident and emergency situation to be treated as an emergency, so as to up the pace, so to speak, in achieving better outcomes for patients. It is entirely appropriate for the Minister for Health and Children to exhort maximum effort and speed from all concerned to improve care for patients.</P>
    <P>The actions in the ten point plan which started in 2005 continue to be implemented. I will update the House later on each of them. This time last year, the HSE had no permanent CEO. Professor Brendan Drumm is now leading the management focus on accident and emergency solutions, hospital by hospital. This focused and consistent management action would never have been possible when we had the old health board system.</P>
    <P>The HSE is setting targets for each hospital to drive continuous improvement in waiting times. Consistent with international standards, its ultimate objective is to ensure no patient will wait any longer than six hours to be admitted after the clinical decision to admit has been made. This will be a ceiling, not a floor. It is to be bettered and is currently bettered for many of the 1.2 million accident and emergency patients annually in our hospitals. Our challenge is to support these hospitals to ensure they maintain this standard and bring all hospitals up to the same level of performance.</P>
    <P>The HSE is taking the following approach on a hospital by hospital basis. It is developing specific time-based targets in relation to accident and emergency and delayed discharges, it is putting in place financial and other incentives linked to performance which is a new development in accident and emergency in our health services and it is developing targeted initiatives aimed at <Col N="654"/>delivering immediate and sustained impact in attendances, delayed discharges, and efficiency.</P>
    <P>The board and the management of the Health Service Executive are fully focused on accident and emergency improvements as their priority. The HSE board agreed that the allocation of hospital budgets for 2006 would include financial incentives linked to specific, time-based performance improvements. In addition, specific funding is being set aside for projects to advance innovation and reform in the areas of efficiency and throughput. This is a welcome and effective initiative in public hospital funding. Hospitals and organisations respond to positive incentives. Another result of having the HSE for the first time is that each hospital network manager has been instructed to treat accident and emergency as his or her top operational priority and to deliver a measurable improvement in accident and emergency services. It is intended that this will be reflected in the performance-related pay scheme. This is also new and welcome in our health service.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Responsibility for delivering measurable improvements in accident and emergency services has been assigned to each hospital CEO or a named senior alternative. The performance targets for individual hospitals relate to the numbers of patients on trolleys awaiting admission, and the time those patients spend waiting. The HSE will begin now to publish waiting times at accident and emergency units next week &mdash; another first in our health services &mdash; so that improvement can be monitored and encouraged by all concerned. The hospitals will be assisted in achieving their targets by the task force which has been established by the HSE.</P>
    <P>I applaud the commitment of those who are voluntarily giving their expertise to the task force. They include emergency department consultants, a consultant geriatrician, a respiratory physician, a director of nursing, a hospital CEO and full-time representatives from the national hospitals office and primary, community and continuing care services. The task force will advise on how improvements can be made to the effectiveness of some emergency departments.</P>
    <P>We will also free up hospital beds by helping people leave hospital as soon as they are medically ready. We are providing more care in the community, in step down beds and nursing home places. There is no question of discharging people who are not medically fit for discharge but people who are medically ready to leave hospital should be able to avail of appropriate care outside a hospital setting.</P>
    <P>This year the Government is providing funding for the largest ever expansion of services for older people &mdash; &euro;110 million in 2006 and &euro;150 million in a full year. Under this funding, we will treble the number of home care packages, some of which will be used to assist older people who would otherwise have their discharge from hospital delayed.</P><Col N="655"/>
    <P>Care at home is still the preference of the vast majority of our older citizens. Long-term nursing home care is also necessary for some patients after their hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that the HSE should go ahead and use as many public and private nursing home beds as required to free up beds for patients awaiting admission. The acute beds that become available as a result of this initiative will be ring-fenced for those patients awaiting admission in accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It is important that patients&rsquo; comfort and dignity are fully safeguarded while they wait for admission to a ward bed. We are providing more appropriate facilities for patients awaiting admission. The 33-bed transit unit in the Mater Misericordiae Hospital has been operational since January last and is working well.</P>
    <P>Transit units are being fast-tracked now with capital funding in Tallaght, where a 40-bed transit ward is being developed and is scheduled for commissioning by July of this year, in Cavan General Hospital, Wexford General Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda and elsewhere. These initiatives are designed to provide immediate support to accident and emergency departments. However, it is essential that they are supported by significant changes within and outside the hospital system in capacity, the optimal use of capacity, practices and procedures and non-acute hospital services.</P>
    <P>There are continual calls for more hospital beds as the solution to the accident and emergency problems and, it seems sometimes, to all problems. Let me state clearly to the House that we have provided more acute hospital beds, we are providing more acute hospital beds at present and we will provide more hospital beds in the future to cater for a growing and ageing population. There are now 13,255 beds in public acute hospitals and 1,800 in private hospitals. Since 1997, the number of public acute hospital beds has increased by 1,528, up from 11,727. Most of the increase &mdash; over 900 &mdash; comprised inpatient beds.</P>
    <P>Our five year capital investment programme includes provision for 450 more acute beds. We also are encouraging the private sector to invest to create new public beds by moving 1,000 of the existing private beds out of public hospitals.</P>
    <P>The HSE is reviewing the long-term acute bed requirement nationally. It is my view and that of the HSE that it would be an inefficient use of taxpayers&rsquo; money to put additional beds into an unreformed acute hospital system, effectively to compensate for inefficient processes. Therefore, as we plan for additional acute hospital beds, we intend to address the underlying processes and wider service issues that impact on the services provided in accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>The HSE commissioned a process mapping exercise across ten acute hospitals. The project focused on the maximum utilisation of existing <Col N="656"/>acute capacity and, in particular, the blockages, causes and potential solutions in the patient&rsquo;s journey through the hospital, from the decision to admit through to discharge.</P>
    <P>The exercise has shown that a patient arriving in an accident and emergency department with a letter from a general practitioner can have up to five separate contacts with medical personnel before eventually being admitted to a bed. Some hospitals have simplified this process with very positive results. We need to examine the processes and procedures in other hospitals to make sure that they operate in the most efficient way to avoid wasting time and resources.</P>
    <P>Difficulties in accessing diagnostic services outside normal working hours also contribute significantly to delays for patients. The HSE is clear that access to diagnostic facilities will be broadened so that they operate 12 to 15 hours a day as a rostered service. In addition, private sector diagnostics will continue to be used where they can contribute to faster patient services.</P>
    <P>Consultants play a pivotal role in the efficiency of hospitals across virtually all departments. They are the senior decision makers, and the importance of their clinical decision-making skills in speeding up the patient&rsquo;s journey through the hospital system cannot be overstated. We need to have far more consultants available at all times, both in accident and emergency departments and in hospital wards.</P>
    <P>Consultants are very much part of the solution and I want to hear their ideas for practical measures that will help improve services to patients. I very much welcome the comments of Professor John Higgins of Cork at the IMO conference where he encouraged his colleagues to be innovators and problem solvers in the health service.</P>
    <P>Hospitals cannot be the only setting for medical care. Many people with chronic illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease regularly attend hospitals but could, with a well developed community service, get most of the treatment they need from their general practitioner and primary care team. With enhanced primary care services, patients can get local care from health professionals such as physiotherapists, who otherwise would require hospital referrals.</P>
    <P>The HSE is establishing community intervention teams in Cork city, west Dublin, north Dublin and Limerick. These teams will provide services to enable dependant people to remain at home rather than be admitted to hospitals or other care facilities. Nationally, all general practitioners have been invited to become involved with the HSE in the further development of primary care services and there has been a very positive response to this invitation.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the ten-point action plan for accident and emergency and it would be useful to mention some of the measures taken under the plan. These actions continue. I have not heard <Col N="657"/>anyone argue that any of the actions in the ten-point plan are mistaken or should be abandoned.</P>
    <P>A particular focus of the plan, which is continuing, is on those patients in acute hospitals who have completed the acute phase of their care and are awaiting discharge to a more appropriate setting. I want to outline some of the measures that have been taken under the ten-point plan.</P>
    <P>A number of the new accident and emergency departments commissioned in 2005-06 provide for minor injury clinics, including Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Cork University Hospital, St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital in Dublin and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital. Outside of Dublin, funding was provided for the expansion of minor injuries services at St. John&rsquo;s Hospital in Limerick, and the provision of a minor injuries unit at Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>A second MRI scanner is due to be commissioned in Beaumont Hospital by the end of 2006. Following a tendering process, interim arrangements with a private provider have been put in place. Additional capacity is also available at weekends to deal with urgent inpatients and 320 patients have benefited under this initiative since November last.</P>
    <P>The planning for the provision of acute medical assessment units, AMAUs, in Beaumont Hospital and St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital is under way. In Beaumont Hospital, planning is under way for the development of a 29-bed AMAU, to be ready for commissioning by the end of the year. In St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital the unit is partially developed. The aim is to have 20 beds fully operational by the end of June next.</P>
    <P>A number of patients with very demanding care needs have been discharged to high dependency beds contracted from private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>Intermediate care beds were provided to allow the discharge of 560 patients from acute hospitals in 2005. Some 270 patients have been discharged to intermediate care beds so far this year.</P>
    <P>Additional home care packages facilitated the discharge of 409 patients from acute hospitals in 2005. Some 182 patients have been discharged to date in 2006.</P>
    <P>The HSE hopes to have an out-of-hours general practitioner service for north Dublin in place by the summer.</P>
    <P>The first national hospital hygiene audit took place in all 54 acute hospital sites during July and August 2005. The audit was carried out by a UK based contractor. The report of the audit was published in November last. The second hospital hygiene audit is under way, using the same methodology as last year. The results of the audit will be available in June or July.</P>
    <P>Palliative care services have been developed at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospice, Harold&rsquo;s Cross, and have been in operation since October last.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Arrangements were put in place with private providers for the commissioning of CT scans and MRIs to facilitate direct access to diagnostics for <Col N="658"/>general practitioners. During 2005, more than 1,000 CT scans and 100 MRI scans were carried out under this initiative. Every piece of the jigsaw to address accident and emergency department problems is in place: the analysis, the resources, the reform programme, the management, the targets, and the incentives. Implementation at local level in each hospital and in the community services in its locality is the key to success, as there is no other way. I urge all involved in medical and other organisations to contribute to the implementation of ideas and actions to improve these services for all our families. The Government and the Health Service Executive will continue to give this top priority. I am confident the actions will result in the sustained improvements that patients and their families deserve.</P>

   <P el="5"><?oasys _is2p6- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children clearly outline the measures she intends to take to improve all aspects of acute hospital care that will allow patients to be treated in a dignified and respected manner.&rdquo;</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5"><?oasys _dc14- ?>The Government parties have not that much to show after nine years in office in regard to improvements in the health services but it would be no harm to go back over the recent history of our health services to examine why we have arrived at the current crisis. In October 2001, the Government held a special Cabinet meeting, attended by the T&aacute;naiste, in Ballymascanlon, County Louth, the purpose of which was to discuss only the health services. The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, was confident that his day of publishing reports and doing little else was about to change as he was about to announce the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You. As he left that meeting, the ghost of former times, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, stated: &ldquo;Putting money into the health services is like pouring money down a black hole.&rdquo; On the same day the Taoiseach informed us the health services were well resourced and further stated we had a world class health service.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s views were at the time but, since she was at the Cabinet table and would have read these comments in the media reports and given that she did not announce a ten-point plan at the time, I assume she was in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s corner and that she also thought the health services were well resourced and world class. However, what happened next was the greatest fraud ever perpetrated against the people of Ireland. The health strategy and the primary care strategy, which was published two months later, were announced as Government policy and they both found their way into the Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats manifestos for the 2002 general election. The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Mr. McCreevy never intended to fund these reports to the extent they proclaimed prior to the general election and that contributed greatly to the position we are in today.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
    <P>At the same time, it is unbelievable that the Government parties have doubled health spending since their re-election but they have also managed to double the number of patients on trolleys waiting for an acute bed in our hospitals over the past 18 months. The Progressive Democrats <Col N="660"/>members consider themselves accountable and providers of value of money as they look after the taxpayer&rsquo;s money but they should ask themselves where all the money has gone over the past four years. When &euro;150 million went down the Swanee during the PPARS debacle, the T&aacute;naiste informed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children that maybe that was where all the money had gone. However, the taxpayer should receive improved accountability for what has gone wrong with the health service, given the amount invested.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Why was the accident and emergency department problem allowed to go so much out of control that at first it became a crisis and then was finally declared a national emergency by the T&aacute;naiste last month? In October 2004 she stated it was unacceptable for people to spend up to 12 hours on a trolley while last month she stated it was unacceptable that the waiting period in accident and emergency departments had increased to 24 hours. She announced a six-hour waiting list earlier. This was an announcement for consumption by people who do not pay much attention and it sounded like spin. However, the position has deteriorated over the past four years, no matter which way one looks at it, and the Government should be more accountable.</P>
    <P>The public will tolerate the arrogance of a number of Ministers but not when it is mixed with the incompetence and complacency we are witnessing. I have sympathy for the T&aacute;naiste because she is trying to put a Band-Aid on a gaping wound in our health services so that the Progressive Democrats can limp past the post following the next general election. However, while I agree many of the problems she faces were developed by her predecessor, she bears collective responsibility as a Cabinet member for what has gone wrong in our health services.</P>
    <P>During her 18 months in the portfolio, she has suffered a dose of &ldquo;Miche&aacute;litis&rdquo; as she publishes one report after another without making great improvements to the health services. She has taken to publishing reports with the same gusto as her predecessor, Deputy Martin. The Health Service Executive commissioned a report on acute hospitals.</P>
    <P>The report on Wexford General Hospital was exactly the same as one commissioned by the hospital in 2001. The problems highlighted in both reports were the same, even though they were published five years apart. Both reports acknowledged that the accident and emergency department was too small to cater for the numbers attending, was not fit to provide modern day emergency health care, was cramped and offered little patient comfort, privacy or dignity. The same report on Wexford Hospital could apply to many other hospitals because it states the hospital has fewer beds and staff <i>per capita </i>than many other acute hospitals. However, I would like the T&aacute;naiste to pay particular attention to the following statement in the report: <Col N="661"/>&ldquo;That hospital&rsquo;s medical admissions unit, which opened 18 months ago, is experiencing difficulties moving patients on to wards due to the lack of beds&rdquo;. She is attempting to portray the medical admissions unit concept as the solution to the accident and emergency department problem but it is only part of the solution.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste referred to the accident and emergency departments in Kilkenny and Waterford hospitals as success stories. The reason the medical admissions unit in Kilkenny is successful is that consultants work well together and have equal responsibility for the unit. In addition, in 1997 a number of acute beds were opened in the hospital which allowed management to move patients ready for admission from the medical admissions unit to the hospital proper.</P>
    <P>When Professor Drumm appeared before the Oireachtas joint committee, he stated Waterford Regional Hospital was a success story in terms of patients not waiting on trolleys. However, the reason for the success story is the accident and emergency department is located near the ENT ward, which holds 30 beds. Many patients who attend for ear, nose and throat procedures are told their appointments have been cancelled because accident and emergency department patients have taken their beds. ENT consultants are therefore attending the hospital with no work to do. The T&aacute;naiste should be honest with the public. Waterford Regional Hospital has not resolved its accident and emergency department crisis because it is penalising ear, nose and throat patients.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny hospital has succeeded because management secured additional acute beds while consultants are working well together. Wexford General Hospital is falling down in this regard. Accident and emergency departments represent a bottleneck in the system. Patients must queue to gain access to an acute bed in a hospital. The solution to this crisis is the proper delivery of acute beds. Many of the other solutions mentioned will have a varying impact on the crisis but the only solution that will make a difference is an increase in the number of acute beds. The T&aacute;naiste is moving too slowly in this regard. The Government parties have only delivered 380 new inpatient beds since the previous general election, even though they published a report prior to it in which they stated they would deliver 3,000 new acute hospital beds. At that time, she did not describe them as day beds, acute beds, recliners or couches. She said that there would be new beds in the hospital system, but she has not delivered on that. That is why the crisis exists at the moment.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has put forward some solutions to the accident and emergency crisis. The solutions will not in themselves solve the problem, but they will help. To solve the hygiene problems, there is little point in auditing hospitals by informing them that they will be checked once or twice a year. Some form of flying squad must be set up <Col N="662"/>that can arrive at these hospitals unannounced. In her speech, the T&aacute;naiste spoke about making someone responsible for accident and emergency departments, but she must do the same for hygiene. Patients should be able to contact someone to report that bathrooms or wards are filthy. That is the only way to improve standards. Security, alcohol abuse and the behaviour of drunks in accident and emergency departments has also been made a top priority by Fine Gael. It is not acceptable that staff and patients, particularly the young and the elderly, should put up with the behaviour that goes on in accident and emergency departments on weekend nights.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste again paid lip service to this problem. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is trying to legislate for it, but we must ensure people&rsquo;s experience of hospitals is more acceptable. People are afraid to enter hospitals as patients or visitors because they are afraid they will pick up something. That is a disgraceful standard for a country that has seen the best of times in the past nine years, but we have had the worst of Governments when it comes to delivering an acceptable health service.</P>
    <P>We must examine the kind of patients that enter accident and emergency departments. Many of these patients could easily be treated in primary care by their general practitioners. Others have problems that could be dealt with by GPs, but they need access to diagnostic services, which are not being delivered. However, the real problem in accident and emergency departments is the number of patients lying on trolleys that need to be admitted to a bed. These are the most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>There has been much commentary about what Derek Davis said at the IMO conference in Killarney. He is right in many respects. His comments may have been too general, but that can often be the case. There is a manpower crisis in general practice. GPs have done their best to cope with the pressures on them. There were about 50 practice nurses in Ireland 15 years ago, but now there are more than 800. GPs have invested in primary care centres, mainly because the Government has done nothing about it. The Government has provided tax concessions to build private hospitals, but there are no tax concessions for primary care. If a problem exists whereby patients cannot access general practice services, it is because such services are shrinking due to the lack of Government involvement in primary care. I fear for the future of general practice and primary care.</P>
    <P>I know the patients who will be worst affected by the fact that the Government is doing nothing. The patients that are worst affected are those to whom the Government has most responsibility, that is, those who have medical cards. They will be squeezed out of the system because the T&aacute;naiste is not taking control of the situation. GPs will provide the service and it is insulting that the T&aacute;naiste can state that there is no GP <Col N="663"/>service out of hours. Does she know how much her Department pays out every year for out-of-hours services in this country? Either someone is carrying out massive fraud in the health service, or an out-of-hours service is being provided. North County Dublin is the one area over which she had control in terms of out-of-hours service, but she and the HSE did not seem to be committed to its delivery. It could have been easily provided over a year ago.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the lack of an out-of-hours service has contributed to the rise in numbers attending accident and emergency departments. I will be working in such a service next weekend in County Wexford, but 41% of patients will still go to accident and emergency departments. In some respects, it is the choice of the patient. Tourists, immigrants, young people who do not have a GP and others who do not understand how the system works will often attend the local accident and emergency department. They do not do this because they cannot access a GP service or because they think it is expensive. If one attends a GP out of hours and then attends an accident and emergency department with a letter from the GP, one will not be charged in the accident and emergency department. That should be highlighted a little more.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the solutions proposed by the T&aacute;naiste. Derek Davis stated that if his GP provided blood results and x-rays to patients on site, more patients would go to primary care, but I do not think that is true. There is only one place in which patients can receive a consultation, get a blood test and an x-ray carried out and have results given on site, that is the VHI Swiftcare clinic in Dundrum, opened by the T&aacute;naiste. Not many patients in the country would pay the &euro;200 demanded for such a service if we offered it to them. Only a small percentage of the population can pay such an amount of money for such a service. A service which involves access to diagnostics and blood tests must be provided in the public system. I am not interested in her comments about people making more money. People who are earning good incomes in this country do not have that kind of money to pay out on health care costs. That money is there to pay high mortgages and for a range of stealth taxes that have been brought in under this Government. Just because they have high incomes does not mean that they have the disposable income the T&aacute;naiste imagines. We should still be providing these health services to people in the public system like before. The T&aacute;naiste is privatising the health services and it is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>People often pay these high costs in places like Dundrum out of fear, especially for their young children. That is why I am a strong advocate of providing medical cards for children under five years of age. People come to the doctor out of fear for their babies and young children. My wife and I are both doctors and we have often been <Col N="664"/>concerned about our own children at that age. The T&aacute;naiste is disconnected from what is happening to the public. Many issues raised in her speech constitute a list of failures in the delivery of health services.</P>
    <P>The role of consultants in the health service is very important. Some of the consultants feel hard done by as a result of some of the comments we have made. I have been critical of a number of consultants and the Lourdes report has confirmed many of the things about which I have spoken. The criticisms only relate to a small cohort of consultants. It is disappointing to see how little importance the T&aacute;naiste put on the recommendations of Judge Harding Clark and that she is not moving on the issues that need to be addressed urgently. We only need to worry about a very small percentage of consultants in our health care service. The vast majority of them are doing a good job.</P>
    <P>There are major industrial relations issues in the acute hospital sector, yet the T&aacute;naiste talks about expanding the availability of diagnostic services for longer periods of time. She has been talking about this since the day she entered office and the Government is now nine years in power. Instead of talking about it, she should be telling us how she overcame these problems. It is an absolute disgrace that these diagnostic services are not available for longer periods of time in our acute hospitals. If one suffers a stroke in Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, Wexford or south Wicklow, one must go to Waterford to get a CT scan. The other acute hospitals in the south east go off-call at 5 p.m. That is a disgraceful use of an extremely valuable service.</P>
    <P>Even CT scans are not considered as high-tech as before. There is now a whole range of diagnostic services such as MRIs and PET scanners. The fact that our CT scanners are not working 24 hours a day shows that Government has been paying lip service to the problems in our acute hospital sector.</P>
    <P>Accident and emergency departments are in crisis but that is just the tip of the iceberg. They are problems patients do not understand and to which people do not pay much attention because they have not yet become crises. Problems are building in the HSE and in general practice. The day will soon come when GPs are not available and the crisis in accident and emergency units will become worse. Regardless of the spin put on cancelled elective procedures and patients who must wait forever for operations, patients have lost hope. These problems will become worse over the coming years, yet we will be able to do little about them because the Government has allowed them to build up over the past nine years.</P>

   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The second anniversary is approaching of the publication by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children of her ten point plan to resolve the accident and emergency <Col N="665"/>crisis. She promised real and measurable improvements within months, stating:</P>
    <P LI="1">Accident and emergency is a litmus test for me, for the government and for the people of our country. By focussing our analysis, our funding and our energy on this area I believe we will achieve tangible improvements this year.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The year she referred to was 2005. We are now in the second quarter of 2006 and are still waiting for the colour of the litmus paper to change. There are no signs of the promised real and measurable improvements. This year, the situation has worsened and there is no relief for patients. When it comes to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s solutions for the accident and emergency crisis, I am reminded of Estragon&rsquo;s line in &ldquo;Waiting for Godot&rdquo;: &ldquo;Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it&rsquo;s awful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Recently in the Coroners Court, a case was highlighted of a woman who died on a trolley in the nurses&rsquo; tea station after waiting four hours to see a doctor. The doctor giving evidence said: &ldquo;it is inexcusable what happened&rdquo;. A doctor in Letterkenny explained how hospital staff move heaven and earth to find beds for terminally ill patients on trolleys so that they can have a chance to die with dignity but noted: &ldquo;the tragedy is we are not always successful...it&rsquo;s awful, awful, awful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yesterday, 198 patients were on trolleys in our accident and emergency departments. The winter is over, the seasonal pressures are off and there is no flu epidemic, yet 198 people were waiting, nothing happened and it was awful. Not as awful as last month, when the number of patients on trolleys nearly topped 500. In Wexford hospital, where 40 patients were waiting, staff ran out of trolleys and had to go as far as Tipperary to find more.</P>
    <P>The ten point plan has been shelved alongside all the other plans to tackle the accident and emergency crisis. The ten point plan bears a close resemblance to plans that the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, used to serve to us on a regular basis. The minor injury units and chest pain and respiratory clinics have not materialized. Unbelievably, the promised MRI scanner for Beaumont hospital still has not been provided. The word is now that it will not be in place until October or even April of next year. The acute medical units are still awaited and the promised provision of GP out of hours cover for north Dublin has become a farce. Less than 10% of our hospitals have proper hygiene standards and, every day, members of staff are put at risk because of insufficient security.</P>
    <P>The record of the T&aacute;naiste with regard to keeping her word is abysmal. She staked her reputation on the successful delivery of her ten point plan. The reality is she has performed so dismally that it is even beyond her to provide diagnostic equipment to Beaumont hospital to relieve the <Col N="666"/>pressure. It seems the central task of taking responsibility for the health service is also getting beyond her. Increasingly, she is off-loading her burden on to the HSE and, in particular, Professor Drumm. We no longer receive answers to parliamentary questions from the T&aacute;naiste but referral letters to Professor Drumm, who then refers us to the parliamentary unit in the HSE. Then, like patients waiting for an appointment to see a specialist or for a bed in a hospital ward, we are left waiting weeks and sometimes months for a reply.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the T&aacute;naiste gives lectures to everyone else in the health service about how they should be more efficient and harder working. It is particularly risible that the T&aacute;naiste ticked off doctors for not working 24 hours a day like her old GP, given that she was on a lengthy break from the D&aacute;il herself. The hallmark of this Government is the extraordinarily low number of parliamentary working days it delegates to itself.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach does not lecture in the way his T&aacute;naiste does but depends on plain old verbal abuse. When referring to the relatives of patients on trolleys he merely said:</P>
    <P LI="1">People say &ldquo;so what about Joe and Mary down in A and E; they shouldn&rsquo;t be on a waiting list&rdquo;. Now, I think it&rsquo;s a pity that people are so unintelligent, really.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This Government considered us fools when we complained about patients on trolleys, until the actor Brendan Gleeson articulated on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; the deep and widespread anger and dismay about what is happening in our hospitals. That caused the T&aacute;naiste to snap to attention and declare an emergency in accident and emergency services. A declaration of national emergency demands rapid and significant action but, in this case, the Minister declared an emergency and disappeared to Limerick to address the party faithful. Nothing happened. Not one additional resource was provided or action taken as a result of her announcement. The task force in which she lays such store is not markedly different from what was previously in place and what should always be in place if the HSE is ever going to live up to its ambition to deliver a streamlined administration.</P>
    <P>The single most important response to the emergency has been a one day debate around a smug, self-congratulatory and delusional motion which only proves to the public that this Government has lost touch with the people and is quickly losing its grasp on reality. That is why I proposed on behalf of the Labour Party an amendment which not only sets out the problem but outlines the solution.</P>
    <P>On 1 November 2004, when the T&aacute;naiste took over as Minister for Health and Children, 166 patients were on trolleys. On 8 March 2006, 495 patients were left on trolleys. The deterioration in the service has been real and measurable. This was foreseen by doctors working in accident and <Col N="667"/>emergency departments but their concerns were ignored. If a declaration of emergency is to have any meaning, the necessary changes must be fast and funded but that has not happened. We need a clear programme of capacity building and the provision of more beds must be central to that programme.</P>
    <P>In 1980, 33% of acute bed capacity was removed from the system, yet our population has increased by almost that amount. Of the patients admitted through accident and emergency departments, 71% are elderly people. By 2026, our elderly population will have doubled and the Government&rsquo;s own health strategy determined that 3,000 new acute beds are needed, yet all we have from the Government are muddled thinking and mixed messages. Professor Drumm does not agree to new beds, so the Government flip-flops on the issue. Yesterday, the Taoiseach said we do not need any new beds, yet three days earlier, the Minister for State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power informed the IMO conference that the Government planned to provide 450 beds over the next six years. That figure falls far short of what is required but does answer questions about the content of Government policy. We hear various declarations from Ministers and it is difficult to ascertain the proposals coming from the Government. It is clear, however, that the great capacity building project promised in the health strategy has stalled. The 900 beds the Minister of Health and Children has promised are too few, too late and hundreds of them are chairs and trolleys rather than beds. At least the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, had the grace to turn up. His senior Minister was too busy talking to the party faithful and Professor Brendan Drumm, the CEO of the HSE, made the extraordinarily shortsighted choice to attend the PD conference instead of meeting the organisation that represents 6,000 doctors. At a time of emergency, officers usually talk to the troops on the ground and by showing them leadership build up their morale, which needs to be done considering the state of the health service. In this emergency the officers absented themselves and went to Limerick instead of to the front line. Is it any wonder health professionals feel let down? This lack of leadership is at the core of the problem. Health professionals and their patients need strong and clear direction from the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste. They are not getting it and they will have to wait for a new Government before it happens.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Professor Drumm has argued for more beds for the elderly in the community and I agree with him. At least 1,500 new community long-stay beds must be provided by 2010, but he and the Minister are disingenuous when they talk about this issue. This week for the first time I was able to publish the truth of what is happening with community beds. Figures in the latest Labour policy document that <Col N="668"/>we launched this week record that the number of such beds is falling, not rising. The information was extracted from the Minister as if it were a State secret. I put in a parliamentary question on 29 November 2005 and did not receive a reply until 29 March 2006, and even then some of the data was blank. It is clear the Minister and the Government have presided over a significant reduction in the number of long-stay community beds for the elderly since taking office in 1997.</P>
    <P>In Dublin south city there are 80 fewer beds for the elderly now than in 1996. In Limerick there are 60 fewer beds, in north Tipperary 43, in Meath 25, in Westmeath 28 and in Longford 16. Many of these are areas where the elderly population is higher than the national average. All her rhetoric about elder care is contradicted by the facts. Far from investing in new beds in the community, Deputy Harney and the HSE have closed beds and denied elderly people the chance of a bed in a community nursing environment close to their homes.</P>
    <P>To solve the accident and emergency crisis a radical shift towards primary and community care is required. Labour will tackle the issue effectively and comprehensively by its commitment to the following proposals: to provide acute hospital beds to meet current and future needs; to ensure accident and emergency departments are dealing with accidents and emergencies and that direct referral by GPs of patients is facilitated and encouraged; to increase the percentage of those on medical cards to 40% of the population; to ensure high-class management of chronic illness in general practice; to implement a primary care preventative strategy; to increase the numbers of GP training places to approximately 160 annually and double undergraduate places for Irish and EU citizens; to integrate primary health care services at community level; to integrate primary and secondary care; to expand and support GP out of hours service, with particular encouragement of GP co-ops; to encourage GP-based audit and research and have universal patient registration and robust data collection systems; to ensure there is comprehensive legislation to allow for compulsory peer review by the Medical Council for standards of care; to ensure accountability by making the Minister for Health and Children answerable to parliamentary questions; to aim to have a hospice in every former health board area with a palliative care team in the local hospital or primary care centre; to increase the numbers of home care hours and ensure proper contracts; to expand community support services for elderly people to enable them to live independent lives as far as possible; to build at least 1,500 additional community beds by 2010 to meet current and future needs; and to ensure a comprehensive, integrated and well-funded range of mental health services at primary care level.</P>
    <P>When the public began to protest at the way elderly and frail people were being marooned on trolleys in corridors without dignity or comfort <Col N="669"/>they were insulted by the Taoiseach and lectured by the Minister. People are entitled to a well planned, fair, well resourced and efficient health service to meet their needs. Like the patients on trolleys in accident and emergency the people are being forced to wait for this by an incompetent and bloated Government. Fortunately we live in a democracy and the people will have an opportunity to choose not just a new and different Government, but a better one.</P>
    <P>When one speaks in a debate such as this there are many cases of people who are having difficulty accessing care one wants to bring forward. When we concentrate only on the accident and emergency department we do not give the full picture of people who are sick and suffering. I know a man who has an extreme case of psoriasis and who needs treatment to relieve the pain and suffering it causes. He wants to have that treatment in Hume Street hospital and will have to wait until December. I was contacted in the last few days by another patient who requires treatment for a dermatological condition but has been told she will not see a specialist for three years. That is the experience. These people are paying taxes and are entitled to expect a decent service in return. One of the reasons there are so many pressures on our accident and emergency departments is that the services and capacity are not there to meet people&rsquo;s needs earlier. A condition becomes an emergency and people present at accident and emergency departments. Accident and emergency departments must deal with crisis cases while other people are admitted to hospitals via alternative routes to hospital care such as a GP&rsquo;s referral or other means we see in a few isolated cases where hospitals such as St. Luke&rsquo;s in Kilkenny operate different systems of admission. That must be developed but it requires capacity.</P>
    <P>It is disingenuous on the part of the Minister and Professor Drumm to say we will not need extra capacity in our acute hospitals. Our population is growing rapidly and aging and we will have to provide the acute hospital beds to meet its needs. There is no other way to do it. Beds are not the sole solution but are part of it. When doctors complain and make that point we must listen to them. While the Minister says she wants to hear from consultants, she wants to hear only what she wants to hear. She does not absorb the message she is being given. The most startling event in recent times has been the public statement by neurosurgeons on the demands that they cannot meet. The fact that they, as professionals, are concerned about standards of care that are not being met for their patients, could be exposed to litigation and have been driven to the extreme measure of going public is telling. Hospital consultants are not known for their radicalism. If one was seeking an example of a non-radical group, hospital consultants would fit the bill. Yet, increasingly, when they are not being muzzled &mdash; I know of cases where attempts have been made &mdash; it is those like hospital consultants or nurses <Col N="670"/>who are on the front line speaking out on behalf of patients. The Government is not listening. The motion shows that it is disconnected from the reality of the health needs of our population. It is time for a complete change in the mindset that dominates a Government that is either incompetent, incapable or unwilling to meet the challenges that exist in the community and which desperately need to be addressed.</P>

	<P>The T&aacute;naiste stated in her address: &ldquo;Every piece of the jigsaw to address accident and emergency department problems is in place: the analysis, the resources, the reform programme, the management, the targets, and the incentives&rdquo;. As the father of two children under the age of eight, I have experience of jigsaws. When I look at the health service, I do not see a jigsaw puzzle that has its pieces in place but one which has its pieces all over the living room floor and which must be cleaned up and put in place, perhaps by the next Government. The T&aacute;naiste described the situation as a crisis and a national emergency. However, what we got from her today was an exercise in spin. It was self-serving, self-congratulatory rhetoric. The previous Government spun its way out of this problem prior to the previous general election and got away with it.</P>
    <P>I hope the T&aacute;naiste is not about to leave the Chamber just as I am getting into my stride.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am not. I look forward to the Deputy&rsquo;s contribution. I think he will be doing his own spinning, given what I have heard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste should hear me out. My contribution will not be over-complimentary.</P>

	<P>I am surprised to hear that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government got away with it at the previous general election but I do not believe it can pull off the same trick twice. The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s predecessors in office as Minister were Deputy Cowen, who kept his head down and described the Department as Angola, so full of landmines was it, and Deputy Martin, who was really the Minister for reports and who published document after document about the health service. He even established a commission on water fluoridation, which was a ridiculous exercise that cost a lot of money. All he needed to do was ask me and I could have told him about water fluoridation without costing him or the taxpayer a penny.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste took office like a sheriff coming into town on a horse. She was going to clean up <Col N="671"/>the Department of Health and Children and take no nonsense. The T&aacute;naiste, like the Taoiseach, stated in this Chamber that she would deliver a world class health service. I said at the time: &ldquo;Dream on&rdquo;. The T&aacute;naiste took umbrage at my comment but we are still far away from a world class health service. Instead of delivering such a service, the T&aacute;naiste has begun to indulge in the blame game. She is dumping on the doctors and nurses who are apparently to blame for the crisis in accident and emergency. These are the staff on the front line who have contributed more to our health service than the T&aacute;naiste ever has or will.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste has overseen the introduction of the Health Service Executive. My amendment to the Government motion states that the HSE has resulted in less accountability and transparency. Professor Brendan Drumm has effectively become a ventriloquist&rsquo;s dummy. The T&aacute;naiste is spinning a line which Professor Drumm takes up to propagate the same message, which is that lack of bed capacity is not the problem.</P>
    <P>Some figures will help to encapsulate the problem. We have experienced a 25% increase in population since the 1980s but in that period there has been a 25% reduction in bed capacity. It does not take a rocket scientist to work out that there is a problem in this regard but, apparently, the T&aacute;naiste has not worked it out yet.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a 100% increase in day cases.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>This problem applies across the board, not just in the health service. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform also must realise that we need more garda&iacute; because our population has increased. Across the board, there is an infrastructural deficit and a problem with which the Government cannot cope which results from the growth in population caused by the growth in the economy. It is clear that the Government cannot manage growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>Another problem the T&aacute;naiste has failed to recognise is that 25% of those who present at accident and emergency units are intoxicated. The T&aacute;naiste is not dealing with the unruly people who cause serious problems. The alcohol products Bill would have been a start but the T&aacute;naiste shelved it and it mysteriously disappeared from the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste stated that this would be the litmus test. When I used litmus paper at school it was to judge the pH value of a substance. Someone would always mess about and put in a lump of potassium when we were trying to measure the pH values, which had severe consequences. The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s privatisation and Americanisation of the health service is similar. She is destroying the health service and making the accident and emergency crisis much worse through her actions. It is <Col N="672"/>time to discover that we want to be closer to Berlin than to Boston.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>We all knew that this Government was in disarray in its stewardship of the health services but this motion shows clearly that it has lost the plot altogether. Yesterday 331 patients were on trolleys and chairs in accident and emergency units in this State. That is the most telling answer to this bizarre, self-congratulatory motion from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. It would be laughable if we were not dealing with such a tragic situation for people who suffer daily in our hospitals. One must wonder at the real reason the Government decided to introduce the motion. It may well be the spin-off effect I highlighted earlier today in the course of the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste and her colleagues must take the people for fools. She recently described the situation in accident and emergency units as a national emergency. At the IMO conference last weekend the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, spoke of the &ldquo;perceived flaws&rdquo; in the health system and said that highlighting these &ldquo;helped to create a false impression of a health system in crisis&rdquo;. So, on the one hand, the T&aacute;naiste states we have a national emergency while, on the other, the Minister State says there is no crisis.</P>
    <P>The reality known only too well to people the length and breadth of this country is that we have had a crisis for years, not just this past winter or since the Minister, Deputy Harney, took up the health portfolio. This reality translates all too sadly into thousands of individual crises for patients and their families. People are being subjected to the dangers and indignities of overcrowded and often chaotic accident and emergency units year on year, with the situation worsening every winter. In the first three months of 2006 there has been a daily average of 300 patients on chairs and trolleys in accident and emergency units.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I commend the Irish Nurses Organisation on keeping the public informed of this through its Trolley Watch. This is in contrast to the HSE and the Minister&rsquo;s office, which wish to conceal the real extent of suffering in our hospitals. In that regard, in certain hospitals patients on trolleys are now being accommodated in designated rooms or wards. They are still accident and emergency patients who are not admitted to a proper ward and still waiting for a proper bed, but patients in such rooms or wards are not included in daily figures for trolley-bound patients.</P>
    <P>There is no mention of a national emergency in the Government motion, nor of one of the most essential measures needed to address the accident and emergency crisis, namely, a fully resourced plan to provide the 3,000 additional public hospital beds required in the system. That figure is not plucked from the sky but in the Government&rsquo;s health strategy published in 2001, yet <Col N="673"/>there is no plan to provide those beds. There has not even been a proper audit of beds, an assessment of bed needs.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s solution to the bed shortage is one of the greatest frauds ever perpetrated on the Irish people. She quite rightly tells us that private beds are heavily subsidised by the State in the public hospital system and that those beds should be public beds. She is right about that, but her solution is to pour even more public money into the private health business through tax breaks for developers of private, profit-driven hospitals and gifts of land at public hospital sites. She claims that will free 1,000 beds in public hospitals, yet she does not tell us when or where we will see these beds. To achieve that alleged aim, the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government reinforces the two-tier public private apartheid in our health services. The T&aacute;naiste pursues a privatisation agenda, rewarding the greed of those who see the health service first and foremost as a profitable business rather than as a basic right to which all are equally entitled &mdash; I emphasise &mdash; on the basis of need alone.</P>
    <P>As the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to the Government motion states, all Government spending on health services should be on the public system only. The money spent on tax breaks for developers of private hospitals together with the money wasted on the HSE&rsquo;s failed computer systems would already have funded 1,000 acute hospital beds in the public system.</P>
    <P>The accident and emergency crisis has also been compounded by the closure of such units in smaller hospitals, including in Monaghan and Dundalk in my region. Those services should be restored as part of the overall measures needed to address both the immediate crisis and the longer-term reform of health services. On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, I urge all Members to reject the Government motion and support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment as the real alternative.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>In three and a quarter minutes, it is very hard to make a major contribution to the debate, but I will mention a few points.</P>
    <P>As someone who has worked in the accident and emergency department of Mayo General Hospital and in University College Hospital Galway, as well as having seen matters from the perspective of a GP over many years, I agree that it is a problem with many different causes. After our press conference, in which we outlined the case of a patient who died after having waited ten days to get into UCHG, the T&aacute;naiste declared the accident and emergency situation a national emergency. However, it is not simply an accident and emergency crisis but one of the health service as a whole.</P>
    <P>The man in question, who was in his mid-70s, died waiting for a bed that was simply not there for him. In a Republic where the citizen is king, we let him down. He was born around 1916 into a country where there was very little. However, <Col N="674"/>in this day and age, when we are supposed to be so rich, he died waiting for a bed.</P>
    <P>Whether it is admitted, beds are a major part of the problem. It is a matter of simple mathematics that if an accident and emergency department is the portal of entry, once people are deemed in need of admission, they have no place to go. Two days before the man died, 12 people were waiting on trolleys in Mayo General Hospital and 20 at University College Hospital Galway. Before he could be admitted to a bed in UCHG, those 20 people would have had to be cleared from the trolleys.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It is not acceptable that this situation should continue. The neurosurgeons have said that they will all resign because of this. Hundreds are waiting for such services. I know that neurosurgeons have approximately 55 beds, with some for intensive care. That is very little for a country with such great needs. People are in acute hospitals who would not be there if there were adequate beds in neurosurgery, for example. Another example is the National Rehabilitation Centre, which has 200 people waiting for beds. There are 150 beds, 25 of which are for road traffic accident victims. People are occupying beds right across the board that they should not be occupying were there enough beds elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I could continue, but my time is up. I have only begun to speak, and there are many other things that I could say, but beds are a very important part of the equation. We must ensure that numbers attending are reduced, but that cannot happen without investment in general practice. Some &euro;1.3 billion has been promised, only approximately &euro;14 million of which has gone into services to date. That tells its own story.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I too welcome the opportunity to speak in today&rsquo;s debate. Problems regarding accident and emergency services have been aired daily for the past three years and I see no sign of debate having improved the situation. We should acknowledge that staff work very hard in what are often quite cramped conditions in accident and emergency departments. It is not a secure working environment and health and safety could be described as non-existent in what should be a rather safe place to be. That could lead to mistakes and it is not a safe environment for a patient.</P>
    <P>Before today&rsquo;s debate, I spoke to several staff in accident and emergency wards, asking for their opinions and assessment of the situation. It is very important to listen to what staff have to say. On several occasions, one of the first comments made has been that accident and emergency departments should be used for just that. Among problems described were admitted patients remaining in the department, which should not happen. A patient who has been admitted will receive no further active treatment there <i>per se</i>.</P>
    <P>We should consider Nenagh, where GPs regularly contact accident and emergency admissions <Col N="675"/>officers and will only send the patient when they know that a bed has become available. That might mean holding the patient for an extra night at home, and GPs are often prepared to do that to offer the patient a service. GPs generally like to offer the best service, involving, for example, their sending the patient to hospital for a test. It is also wise for the patient to remain in the accident and emergency department for the result of the test.</P>
    <P>If the GPs had the same access to diagnostic reporting as the hospital or could get it at the same speed, it would mean that the patient could go back under his or her care. Effectively, the patient is there waiting for the result of a test, and I have cited the example of a venogram. The patient would have to be treated for deep vein thrombosis for a period until a negative result was forthcoming. That is part of the problem.</P>
    <P>Accident and emergency departments have been used by garda&iacute; under section 12 as a place of safety for children. That too is inappropriate and unhelpful. Staff also cited the absence of social workers as a major problem, particularly when no social worker is available for young children or people who might need such a service. There is no weekend service and when it comes to 4 p.m. on a Friday, staff find that there is no social worker available, although many social problems present themselves at accident and emergency departments. Those are the matters that we should resource in the community and we should ensure that people are sent there.</P>
    <P>Old people are sometimes sent to hospital despite the fact that appropriate treatment could be provided for them in a nursing home. Effectively, they find themselves there while they wait for a nursing home bed, again putting additional strain on hospital resources. The idea of a patient having to be seen by five people before admission is not safe. One goes to a GP and then has a sequence of people to see in the accident and emergency department, which is not the best use of resources. We should not second-guess GPs, who should know when someone requires elective admission to hospital. That person should be sent straight to a hospital bed.</P>
    <P>In recent years, while problems have grown in accident and emergency departments, we have planned to close them in smaller hospitals. There were plans to close the surgical accident and emergency service in Monaghan General Hospital, as well as threats regarding Nenagh and Ennis. By now, we must have seen enough to shelve those plans and state publicly that such small hospitals play a major role in delivering accident and emergency care where allowed to do so. We have all sorts of ten-point plans, but I would like to see people listen to staff on the ground. I found that they had much to contribute, with many useful ideas.</P>

     <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
     <Quest>if the recommendations contained in the report of the national task force on medical staffing, the Hanly report, remains Government policy; the steps she has taken to date on foot of this report; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[15607/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The national task force on medical staffing was set up to devise a strategy for reducing the average working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors to achieve the requirements of the European working time directive, address the consequent medical staffing needs of Irish hospitals, analyse the practical implications of moving to a consultant-provided hospital system, and consider the requirements for medical education and training arising from any changes to the current model of delivering services.</P>
    <P>The report of the national task force &mdash; the Hanly report &mdash; made a series of important recommendations. These covered issues such as the changes needed in non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, work patterns, the need for a significantly revised contract for medical consultants, the need for a significant increase in the number of consultants, reform of medical education and training, and the reorganisation of acute hospital services.</P>
    <P>My Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive to build on, and progress, these recommendations. Negotiations on NCHD work patterns and a new contract for consultants have begun. The Government also announced details of a &euro;200 million initiative for a major reform of medical education and training, including an increase in the number of medical training places. These measures, combined with ongoing investment in acute hospital facilities, extra consultant posts and the organisation of services around hospital networks, are designed to provide patients with faster access to high quality consultant provided services.</P>
    <P>The issues that led to the establishment of the national task force remain to be resolved, including the full implementation of the EU working time directive and the introduction of a consultant-provided service. Addressing these issues requires negotiation and agreement with the medical representative bodies. This process is under way.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="677"/>
   <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>This report was published in June 2003, almost three years ago. The former Minister, Deputy Martin, wrote the foreword which stated: &ldquo;the Task Force has also concluded that a consultant-provided service is the only viable means of providing safe high quality patient care while reducing the working hours of NCHDs&rdquo;. If we are to replace junior doctors with consultants, we will need a new consultants&rsquo; contract which deals with the extended working day and issues around who will be on duty at night and at weekends. There was nothing in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reply which gave us any indication where this consultants&rsquo; contract is going. Getting rid of category two consultants is only a red herring; it will not make a fundamental difference. Locating new private hospitals in the grounds of public hospitals will not change this fundamental problem. Who will be on duty at night and at weekends when the EU working time directive is implemented? That is what the Hanly report is all about.</P>
    <P>There should have been a new consultants&rsquo; contract by now which would provide for an extended working day and cover issues around on-call and working at night and at weekends. The T&aacute;naiste has given no indication that we have moved on this issue in the past three years. We are in exactly the same position in which we were when all these discussions started. That is not good enough. Nothing which has been said on this issue will make the crisis in the health service better. We need to see a change to the consultants&rsquo; contract, a reduction in the number of non-consultant hospital doctors and more consultants doing the job about which we are talking. While the Hanly report has very much been taken up with the closure of smaller hospitals, this fundamental issue covers every hospital in the country, the largest and the smallest.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We would have agreement if we threw in the towel and gave everybody what they wanted, which seems to be Deputy Twomey&rsquo;s attitude, that is, every time we go into negotiations, we should agree and then they will be over. At present non-consultant hospital doctors get approximately &euro;200 million per year in overtime for the long hours they work. One cannot reduce working hours and pay people the same amount. I do not believe anybody would find that acceptable.</P>
    <P>An analysis was done in nine different sites where there was agreement with the doctors to do some pilot work around the new working time directive, including rostering, etc. Unfortunately, I understand the Irish Medical Organisation has instructed them not to participate in that process, which is regrettable. In the context of that analysis, it is worth noting that 21.9% of the junior doctor&rsquo;s time was spent reviewing a patient already seen by a colleague while almost 10% of his or her time was spent talking to another clinician.</P><Col N="678"/>
    <P>We must move to a situation where we have fewer non-consultant hospital doctors. At present there are approximately 4,000 non-consultant hospital doctors but we want to move that figure down towards 2,000. We need to double the number of consultants because it is only when consultants &mdash; the key decision makers &mdash; deliver the service as opposed to leading it that we will get the best outcome for patients and greater efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The talks are before the Labour Relations Commission. I appeal to the doctors involved to agree to the implementation in the nine sites. We are already in breach of the 58-hour provision in the EU working time directive, which should have been introduced on 1 August 2004. Since we are in the process of implementation, apparently we can be facilitated. However, in the interest of the reform of the health care system, we need to reach agreement. There are proposals from the Government side, including the HSE, on rostering and sharing. It is not a question of people working a 39-hour week from 9 a.m. to 5 a.m. and that everything else will be dealt with on an overtime basis. That is not the manner in which we will get the type of health service we need.</P>

	<P>I am not asking the T&aacute;naiste to throw in the towel in any negotiations. I am asking her to tell the House whether she has no hope of renegotiating, or has failed to renegotiate the, consultants&rsquo; contract or whether there is some light at the end of the tunnel. Given that nothing has happened in the past three years, are we talking about another nine years before we move forward and see these changes? These changes are fundamental and will affect every aspect of hospital services, yet we have not moved one inch in the past three years since this report was published. Rather than criticise me and act like an innocent bystander in all this, the T&aacute;naiste should tell the House if we are getting anywhere on these issues. If we are not, she should tell the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The process is under way in the LRC. I accept what the Deputy said, that we need changed work practices whereby doctors work as part of teams and clinical directors. We have already seen some initiatives, especially in Blanchardstown hospital where seven new consultants have been appointed. They will work on a team and on a 24-hour per day basis. These are the types of initiatives which will deliver the best health care for patients. We are in discussions for a contract for consultants too and it may well be that all of them will be concluded together. I know the chairman is hoping to have those talks resumed quickly. We need to move quickly to get a more flexible and appropriate contract of employment for consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors. It is my intention and that of the <Col N="679"/>HSE and the Department of Health and Children to have that soon.</P>

     <Quest>her views on the strong criticisms made at the recent IMO annual meeting of her proposal for private hospitals on public hospital grounds and the fact these proposals do not represent an evidence-based approach to health policy; if she will review her insistence on pushing through proposals that are likely to have a serious and adverse impact on the health services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is to be expected that diverse views are expressed at a gathering of the Irish Medical Organisation. For example, Professor John Higgins, consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology at Cork University Hospital, stated the following at the organisation&rsquo;s conference: &ldquo;If dynamic, flexible arrangements are put in place then I think the co-location model recently suggested by the T&aacute;naiste should be an absolute winner [for us all]&rdquo;. Similar views were expressed in the media last week by Dr. Rob Landers, consultant pathologist at Waterford Regional Hospital and chairman of its medical board.</P>
    <P>The policy direction I have given to the Health Service Executive is to achieve 1,000 new public beds. If we build a new public bed in the traditional way, the Exchequer bears 100% of the capital cost. If we do it in the new way, that is, by moving the private beds into new co-located facilities and freeing up new public beds, the capital cost to the State is less than 50%. In addition, the running cost of the private beds would no longer be subsidised or managed by the State. The HSE is now taking the necessary steps to implement this policy to achieve a significant increase in the number public beds.</P>
    <P>Like very many other countries, we have a mixed system of financing and provision of hospital services and there is no reason we should not continue to build on this. We already have excellent private hospital management dating back to the 18th century when St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin was founded by Jonathan Swift. The Highfield group has been offering services in the Dublin area for 150 years. There are many other hospital providers which have, more recently, established strong reputations for quality and service among the public.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence from Ireland that for-profit hospitals have a lower patient safety record than all others. It is highly relevant that the same body of consultants largely treats patients in both public and private settings. I do not believe those consultants would accept, still less promote, a proposition that their patient care and patient safety be lower in one location than in another. <Col N="680"/>Patient safety is vital in all hospitals, both public and private. I will promote accreditation and clinical auditing for all settings, irrespective of their financing structures. I urge support from medical organisations and practitioners for all measure to assure quality care for all patients in all locations.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The board of governors of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital will be surprised that it is a for-profit organisation. Is the Minister not taking on board the fact that, overall, there was widespread criticism of her proposal, not just from the IMO but also from others? Does she not need to listen to this? Will she indicate what research she has carried out to justify what appears to everybody else to be a top-of-the-head kind of proposal?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not accept that international evidence indicates that for-profit hospitals are more costly and do not have outcomes as good as those in public hospitals? Will she indicate how she can justify the diversion of so much public money into private hands? The hospitals in question are not private, they are publicly funded for-profit hospitals. Does the Minister not accept that by saying the State will have no management role in these hospitals, although it is funding them to a great degree, she is exposing a weakness in her argument? Whatever happens in those hospitals will be determined largely by the desire to make profit rather than anything else.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not feel at this stage that it is important to circulate among the public evidence to back her claims and to agree to take on board and consider carefully the criticisms that have been made, not only those of the medical profession but also those of economists, who reckon the proposal will cause more problems in the health service than exist at present?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 2,500 private beds in the public hospitals. The policy pursued by the Deputy&rsquo;s party, when it was in Government, was that 20% of beds in all new hospitals would be private. The taxpayer pays the full cost of these and, furthermore, staffs them and subsidises them to the tune of 40%. The only staff members getting any income from the insurers are the consultants. I recently compared this to pilots getting all business-class air fares.</P>
    <P>I want to convert 1,000 of the 2,500 beds into public beds for all patients, not just private patients. The manner in which I suggest doing so is such that these beds would be provided to the taxpayer at less than half the cost, including the capital allowances, of building the beds in the traditional way. Furthermore, these beds are already staffed by nurses who are being paid through the public system, and therefore all that is required is the relocation of the private beds to a different facility that would be totally financed by private investors. Hospitals would have these facilities co-located so the consultant staff could be on-site. We all know that consultants can use <Col N="681"/>their time more effectively if they are on-site as opposed to operating at a number of different sites under a system of bi-location. This is why this policy is being pursued. Before I announced the policy, Prospectus, which has great expertise in this area, did some consultancy work for me.</P>
    <P>In the OECD approximately 27% of health care is provided privately and 72% or 73% is provided publicly. In the United States, where the reverse is the case, some 60% of health care is private and 40% is public. I noted recently that the Prime Minister of British Columbia, Gordon Campbell, asked why Canada was so afraid to consider a mixed health care delivery model like those in many European states and others which would deliver results for its patients at a lower cost to taxpayers. That is what I am trying to do.</P>
    <P>I am trying to provide 1,000 beds at less than half the cost of doing so in the traditional way, thus avoiding the need for the huge subsidy of 40%. Much private work is carried out in our public hospitals and the rate is increasing very rapidly because of the great numbers with private health care insurance. The taxpayer should not fund the capital provision of the private beds, nor should he or she subsidise them to the tune of 40%.</P>

   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>There will still be private patients in the public hospital system because they can be there as of right. I suggest that the Minister publish every scrap of evidence because she will need to make her case to the public and those working in the health service. She will admit that these are not privately funded hospitals but State-subsidised hospitals over which the State will have no direct control. Those hospitals could care for patients from Asia apart from those earmarked by the Minister. An entirely new business could be created and we will have no control over it. All we will have done is handed over a great deal of money, which could have been used to invest in the health service, to private for-profit organisations interested in making money.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not require rocket science to realise that one can provide 1,000 public beds for less than half the cost of building them in the traditional way, yet the Deputy says this does not make sense and suggests we should instead pay &euro;1 million per bed to build the 1,000 beds, which sum we are currently paying.</P><Col N="682"/>
    <P>The public hospitals will either lease or sell the required land and will not invest any money in the beds. At present, the public system is funding the entire cost of the private beds. Patients have to enter a public hospital on the basis of equity and not on the basis of whether one can pay and another cannot. My policy is one of total equity in respect of facilities provided by the taxpayer. We do not have this at present.</P>

     <Quest>if the recently established health fora are to be sidetracked by the Health Service Executive in the issuing of protocols, such as occurred recently in the executive&rsquo;s north-east region in respect of its removal of paediatric services from Louth, Navan and Monaghan general hospitals without prior consultation or discussion with the health forum; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[15561/06]</QRef><Col N="683"/>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The function of regional health fora is clearly set out in section 42 of the Health Act 2004, which provides for the establishment of the fora to make representations to the Health Service Executive as they consider appropriate on the range and operation of health and personal social services provided within their functional areas. I understand the first meeting of the forum for the north east took place on 27 March 2006 and that a wide range of issues was discussed.</P>
    <P>On the specific service referred to by the Deputy, I am advised there has been no change in the provision of paediatric services in the north east region in recent times. A paediatric transfer protocol was developed by a multidisciplinary regional group, established by the North Eastern Health Board in 2003, to establish clear, concise and workable guidelines for the assessment and management of all children under the age of 14 presenting at a non-paediatric facility in the north east. This protocol has been operational as a draft protocol since spring 2005 and was formally implemented on 10 April, with a review date of six months from that date.</P>
    <P>In accordance with its terms of reference, it is open to the Dublin and north-east forum to make representations on this matter to the CEO of the Health Service Executive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for her response. The major decision to remove paediatric admissions from Dundalk, Navan and Monaghan hospitals, which was implemented on 10 April, should have been discussed at forum level. The forum members should have been given the opportunity to make representations or observations prior to a service being removed. It is any parent&rsquo;s nightmare to be forced to drive past Dundalk, Navan or Monaghan hospital with a critically ill child, suffering from an asthmatic attack, meningitis, an epileptic seizure or choking. The forum members should have been able to discuss the matter and give assurances to people that these children would be looked after if they were taken to the nearest hospital, where they could be stabilised. If necessary, they could subsequently be transferred. There is no point in the next meeting of the forum discussing or making an observation on a decision that has already been taken. From the executive&rsquo;s point of view it would be somewhat like a thunderstorm, something that will pass after an hour or two and the air will clear afterwards. This is why I believe these new fora&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should put a question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that these fora are completely irrelevant if they are not allowed to discuss matters of policy or service delivery to the public and the effects they have on the public? We talked about appropriate <Col N="684"/>observations. Would the T&aacute;naiste agree nothing could be more appropriate than wanting to save the life of a child while being forced to drive past a hospital, which represents the worst nightmare for any parent?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The fora are free to discuss policy issues. However, the fora are prohibited from having a role when it comes to clinical judgment issues and the appointment of staff. This issue falls into the broad area of policy, on the one hand, and patient safety and clinical judgment on the other hand. This is why it was decided this service should not be supplied in four different hospitals covering a relatively small population base. As the Deputy is aware, these services are provided in Cavan and Drogheda.</P>
    <P>The protocol came into effect in April and it will be reviewed in six months&rsquo; time. In the meantime, perhaps the matter could be discussed at the next meeting of the forum.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the T&aacute;naiste give an assurance that a critically ill child may be brought to any hospital in the region to be stabilised?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, anybody who is critically ill may be brought to a hospital with an accident and emergency unit that is on call for emergencies. Clearly for all patients, the sooner they are brought to the most appropriate place for treatment the better. The sooner a patient can get to the place that can deal with his or her difficulty, the better the outcome. If a patient is brought to a hospital that is not able to provide the kind of service required, the delay in taking him or her to the more appropriate setting, in this case Cavan or Drogheda, could cause serious difficulties for him or her.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the T&aacute;naiste to call on the HSE to make this fact public and reassure people that a critically ill person is allowed to be brought to any hospital. The public need that reassurance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>A review of what happened to the late Pat Joe Walsh in Monaghan General Hospital is expected to be complete next month. The review of services in the region will also be available in May. As a matter of urgency we need greater clarity as to what should happen in the north east because there have been major difficulties. For almost as long as I have been a Member of this House, the hospital services in that region have been the source of much debate here. Many of the problems stem from having so many hospitals for such a small population base, which causes great confusion and difficulty.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is fully committed to the implementation of the principles contained in the primary care strategy and this includes the development of primary care teams and networks. The implementation process at operational level is a function of the HSE, whose chief executive officer has identified as a priority the development of multidisciplinary primary care teams. The 2006 Estimate for the HSE includes an additional &euro;10 million in revenue funding to enable the establishment of up to 100 new primary care teams. This will enable the provision of 300 additional front-line personnel to work alongside GPs to provide integrated and accessible services in the community. Work by the HSE to establish these teams is under way. In planning for the establishment of these teams, the executive intends to focus where possible on areas of disadvantage and with significant health inequalities.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged to learn that in excess of 1,000 general practitioners have responded positively to an invitation from the HSE seeking expressions of interest. Following the identification by the executive of the GPs to be involved in the development of the teams, work will be required to realign HSE services to give best efficiencies for teamwork and to determine ideal team compositions to meet the needs of identified areas.</P>
    <P>Ongoing implementation of the primary care strategy will focus on the reorganisation of the resources already available. This whole-system approach to implementation means change will be required in many sectors in the health service and not solely within primary care.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to know where to start regarding this report. Much of this stems from what Mr. Derek Davis said at the IMO conference and the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s comments afterwards criticising GPs. Again she was acting as if she was an outsider and not involved. As legislators we have responsibility for patients with medical cards and a moral responsibility for private patients. What will the T&aacute;naiste do to ensure the country has a GP service in five years&rsquo; time? This is the next crisis brewing after that in accident and emergency services. Medical card patients have difficulty in accessing GPs in some areas, which usually indicates the start of a developing crisis. It will soon start to affect private patients.</P>
    <P>Where does the T&aacute;naiste stand regarding the primary care strategy? We seem to be back at square one. When the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, announced the primary care strategy in 2001, he said that 60 primary care teams would be established within five years. The T&aacute;naiste is now making the same promise to establish 75 primary care teams five years later. When the primary care strategy was published it was a ten-year plan. Is it Government <Col N="686"/>policy that it is now a 15-year plan because nothing has been done in the past five years?</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste needs to be honest in admitting that there is a major problem in general practice and in primary care. The T&aacute;naiste has said that GPs are not available outside of office hours and are not on call. However, Members of this House have a responsibility for one third of the population with medical cards. It is not good enough simply to pass the buck on the matter. We must determine what the Government has or has not done in this case and what it will do to correct this problem. There is no point in us coming back to the House in three years&rsquo; time with the same crisis in general practice as exists in the accident and emergency service now. Accident and emergency units only cater for 3,000 patients per day whereas general practice deals with 20,000. We cannot blame the people working in the area. As the T&aacute;naiste indicated, 1,000 GPs applied for these new posts.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will tell the Deputy what we are doing. This year current expenditure on health care will be &euro;12 billion, &euro;7 billion of which will be on primary continuing community care. Of the &euro;7 billion, primary care and community health services get approximately &euro;3.2 billion, which is a considerable amount of money. We are trying to strengthen the personnel and expertise available to general practitioners. As the Deputy will be aware, we made provision this year for 300 people, including physiotherapists and other therapists to be made available to primary care teams.</P>
    <P>We also need to improve the organisation of services on the ground. At the moment, when leaving a hospital a patient&rsquo;s case will be reviewed by a hospital&rsquo;s occupational therapist. However, the occupational therapist in the community needs to go to the patient&rsquo;s house and those people rarely meet or talk to each other. The HSE is seeking to bring many people together. Let us consider the recently opened Ballymun health centre. Instead of people operating in many different offices in the area, they are now together. The same number of people can now provide a much better service. I understand one of the public health nurses has said that since moving to the new centre, she now spends approximately 10% of her time on the phone as opposed to the 25% she used to spend trying to talk to other colleagues. Much of what needs to be done involves bringing together the existing people on the ground. We are also increasing the number of university places for medical students and the number of training places for general practitioners. We intend to introduce graduate entry into medical school from the 2007 academic year. We are reducing the number of points required to 450, although we are still talking about the top group because the top 16% of students who do the leaving certificate get 450 points or more. We are investing in more clinical <Col N="687"/>placements with a view to increasing the number of people who intend to pursue medicine as a career. It is obvious that a new contract of employment is being negotiated with the Irish Medical Organisation, which is working on behalf of general practitioners. I am a strong fan of trying to empower general practitioners to have a greater role, particularly in respect of things like chronic illness and smear testing which are more appropriate for primary care. It is clear that we have to put in place a contract of employment that incentivises that happening at that level.</P>

	<P>I am also a great fan of things being done at primary care level, but we do not have the personnel. I am sure the T&aacute;naiste is aware that a small percentage of patients are having difficulty in accessing general practice. This is the beginning of the problem. It takes four or five years to train a general practitioner. If we wait that long, it will not be good enough. I would like the Government to propose how we can correct the manpower problem that is starting to lead to problems in accessing services.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to ensure we do not limit the number of people who can access general medical service contracts, which is something we have done. I regularly meet doctors who would love to have general medical service practices, but are prohibited from doing so under the current rules which were agreed with the IMO. I met two such doctors last week. We have to use our existing capacity as best we can. I share the view that was expressed by the Deputy. It is clear there will be a focus on primary care in the future. I understand there are approximately 18 million contacts between doctors and patients under the general medical service each year. When one considers that approximately 1.1 million people have medical cards, it is clear that each of them makes an average of almost 18 visits each year. There is a huge level of contact between doctors and patients at that level. It is clear we have to resource the general medical service, in which the greatest amount of activity takes place, in a better manner.</P>

The Government&rsquo;s objectives are to reduce the number of people waiting for admission, the amount of time they spend waiting for admission and the turnaround time for those who can be treated without requiring admission. As the Minister for Health and Children, it is appropriate for me to exhort maximum effort and speed from all concerned to improve care for patients. The HSE, which is continuing to implement the ten-point action plan, is also implementing other initiatives, including the establishment of performance targets for individual hospitals and the development of financial incentives which are linked to performance. In the immediate term, the HSE is introducing a series of measures to improve facilities for patients and staff in accident and emergency departments. Long-term care beds are being secured from the private sector to facilitate the discharge of patients who have completed the acute phase of their care. Additional acute beds and day places have been provided in recent years and more beds are in various stages of planning. I share Professor Drumm&rsquo;s view that the achievement of improvements in accident and emergency services depends on fundamental changes being made in hospitals and in other areas of the health service. It is not just a question of putting extra acute beds in place. The measures being examined by the HSE include improvements in hospital processes and procedures to ensure they operate more effectively, the introduction of rigorous admission and discharge planning processes, the broadening of access to diagnostic facilities and the enhancement and development of primary and community care services.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the T&aacute;naiste whether she thinks the state of emergency in accident and emergency services will continue for the foreseeable future. What does she consider to be an acceptable number of patients on trolleys? When will she declare the state of emergency to have come to an end? What is an acceptable number of people on trolleys? I think the T&aacute;naiste said at one time that it was not acceptable for anybody to be on a trolley. At what stage will she declare that the state of emergency is finally finished? Can we expect it to continue for the next 12 months, until the general election? When the T&aacute;naiste published the ten-point plan, she said we would see tangible results in 2005, but the problem has got much worse since then. When will we see the results of the ten-point plan?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>We will see results when there is a change of Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is just not happening. Deputies have received a number of replies from the <Col N="689"/>T&aacute;naiste in response to questions about beds. She said this afternoon that 1,000 public beds will be freed up as a result of her privatisation proposals. Was she referring to 1,000 public beds? She said at another stage that she was talking about 1,000 beds which could be used by private and public patients. Does she see the proposal as a genuine option? Why is she continuing with this policy when she and Professor Drumm have said that beds are not the main source of the problem?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Deputy Gormley that the conversion of 1,000 private beds into public beds is not privatisation. He does not seem to understand what is privatisation. It would be privatisation if I was doing the reverse, by converting some public beds to private beds.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>What are they?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make that clear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Are they public beds or private beds?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 2,500 private beds in our public hospitals at present. That some 46% of the elective work at Tallaght Hospital last year involved private patients does not cast any reflection on its catchment area or on its accident and emergency activities. The beds in question were entirely funded and are 40% subsidised by the taxpayer. The wages of the nursing and other staff are paid by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I want to reduce the amount of private activity in public hospitals so patients are seen on the basis of medical need. Ireland has more beds <i>pro rata</i> than Finland or Sweden and the same number as Britain, even though 18% of the population of Britain is over the age of 65 and just 11% of the population of Ireland is over the age of 65. It almost does not matter how many beds one has if they are not being used efficiently. The results of the process mapping exercise at Cork University Hospital, which were published last week, highlighted that 2,280 bed days were lost at that hospital because people who were fit to be medically discharged were not discharged for all kinds of reasons. Very few people are discharged from our hospitals, particularly those in Dublin, on Saturdays or Sundays. If one is not seen by a consultant until late in the evening, one will not be able to go home until the following day.</P>
    <P>We need to change many aspects of how we use our beds. While there are fewer beds in Finland than in Ireland, there is more hospital activity in that country than there is here. When one talks about beds one has to consider how they are used. The number of procedures carried out on a day case basis doubled from 250,000 in 1997 to 500,000 in 2004. That means there should not be as much need for inpatient beds. Deputy Gormley asked me to outline the extent to which it is acceptable that there are patients on trolleys. <Col N="690"/>People will always be treated on trolleys &mdash; that is a fact throughout the world. Many treatments are performed while patients are on trolleys. We are trying to ensure that people who are waiting to be admitted to acute beds in hospitals do not have to wait for more than six hours. That is the aim and the ambition. In autumn 2005, there was a reduction of 20% in the number of people waiting on trolleys.</P>
    <P>The care of the elderly is one of the issues that arises in this regard. Approximately 4.5% of those over the age of 65 are in long-term care, which is in line with the international average. Some people who are in care could be at home if a set of measures had been in place in the past to support such people. We do not have such supports, however, and it will take some time for us to catch up. We are putting them in place at present because we understand that over the next few years we will have to expand the services we provide to older people in the community. We need to provide home help and home support and to recruit additional chiropodists, physiotherapists and other professionals who can help people to stay in the community. I have given the HSE additional resources to procure beds for older people in the acute system. There were approximately 440 such people in the Dublin area a few weeks ago. Older people who have been medically discharged are being moved from the acute system to alternative settings. That will continue for the rest of this year. It will have a major impact on accident and emergency services as the year progresses.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is saying that six hours is now the benchmark as far as she is concerned.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I said that earlier but the Deputy was not listening.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not matter to the T&aacute;naiste, therefore, if there are 450 people lying on trolleys as long as they are there for no more than six hours. Is that okay as far as she is concerned?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Such targets are in place in the best health care systems in the world. Under our system, before a patient even gets to see a doctor, he or she can have to wait quite some time. Many of the processes within accident and emergency departments can, I hope, expedite the time period before a patient gets to see a doctor. Remember that 75% of those presenting at accident and emergency departments do not need to be admitted to hospital. Equally, we want to ensure that these patients are dealt with quickly. It is not just a question of the people being admitted to hospital. We want to see more rapid responses as regards all activity in accident and emergency departments.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
     <Quest>if, in view of the fact that breast cancer is a terrible killer, health care apartheid exists here and that 260 more women will die needlessly in the west and south before BreastCheck is up and running; if she will take up the offer made by the Galway Clinic on 11 February 2003 to provide a BreastCheck service until a unit is built in Galway; if she cannot fast-track BreastCheck before 2007, will she allow the Galway Clinic to provide a breast screening service in the meantime to save these 260 women&rsquo;s valuable lives; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[15108/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in 2000 with the programme covering the former Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board regions. In 2003 the extension of the programme to counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford and its national expansion to the rest of the country was announced. Screening commenced in Wexford in March 2004, in Carlow in April 2005 and in Kilkenny in March this year.</P>
    <P>I informed the Deputy last month of my meeting with representatives of BreastCheck and of my wish to have the programme rolled out to the remaining regions of the country as quickly as possible. Some &euro;2.3 million was made available to BreastCheck this year to provide among other things for the early recruitment and training of staff. The interview process for the posts of clinical directors is now completed and BreastCheck has also commenced the recruitment process for other essential staff. The notice for the procurement of a construction company for the new clinical units in Cork and Galway has been published in the <i>EU Journal</i> and the design team is in the process of short listing applicants. Following the selection of the contractor, construction of the units will commence. BreastCheck is confident that the target date of next year for the commencement of the national roll out will be met. On full roll out, all women in the target age group in every county will have access to breast screening and follow up treatment where appropriate.</P>
    <P>As I previously informed the Deputy, any proposal received by BreastCheck to support the roll out of its screening programme is carefully examined to assess the extent to which it complies with existing standards. BreastCheck has advised my Department that it has engaged in extensive discussions with the Galway Clinic. BreastCheck conducted an evaluation of this proposal and has concluded that the clinic in question would not be in a position to provide a population based <Col N="692"/>screening programme in line with its requirements.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the T&aacute;naiste for that reply. As she knows this is something that I am particularly anxious about. When it was introduced in 2000 BreastCheck covered half the population. It is now 2006, however, and it will be 2009 before the full roll-out is completed, according to BreastCheck. There is no other term for this but cancer care apartheid. I have calculated that at least 200 women have died in the south and west since BreastCheck was rolled out for half the population. That is a disgrace, considering the position in other countries. This is not rocket science, as the T&aacute;naiste has conceded. This information has been available for 20 years and it is a terrible disgrace that BreastCheck was allowed to cover half the country and not the other half. On my calculations more than 200 more women will have died by 2009, who need not have. I know the T&aacute;naiste says the Department has talked to the Galway Clinic, which offered to intervene in 2003. If that offer had been taken up, at least 150 more women would be alive today. The excuse then was that BreastCheck was an analog service and the Galway Clinic&rsquo;s service was digital. BreastCheck has upgraded its service to Galway Clinic level, however, and is now digital. I am asking the T&aacute;naiste how she can let those 200 women die who need not. It is a question of money. Money was available for all sorts of matters, the wasteful PPARS system, the horse racing industry and all types of stupid things. We are talking about real lives here.</P>
    <P>It is not Galway Clinic that is saying this, but the Department of Health and Children. This is the same Department that said that this must be done on a phased basis, as it was so complicated. The complication is how the service is available to half the population and not the other half. I ask the T&aacute;naiste to please save the lives of those 250 women. She has the power to intervene. Has she the will to do it? It can be done.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have looked at population screening as regards another area in which I am interested in pursuing when we can. Any population screening is always done on a gradual basis for a host of reasons. One cannot move from a situation where there is no population screening for a particular type of cancer to one where the entire population is covered in a short period of time. That is not to say that perhaps things could not be done quicker. However, this is the reality.</P>
    <P>BreastCheck did not get subsumed into the HSE. It is an autonomous body with a board of directors. I asked it to look at the proposal from the Galway Clinic which had been sent to me and the Department has discussed matters with BreastCheck. It is a matter for BreastCheck to assess whether the proposal meets its requirements and it has concluded that it does not. I have to accept that.</P><Col N="693"/>
    <P>I was criticised earlier for encouraging the private sector. Here I am being criticised because we are not giving business to a private independent operator. I want to see it rolled out as quickly as possible. That is why we made the funding available. We also need to see cervical screening rolled out. That is in only one pilot project at present and I hope it will form part of the new contract with general practitioners since it clearly can be done at primary care level. Again, this is an area where early detection can bring about fantastic results, which Deputy Cowley knows, as a doctor. I am committed to ensuring that we put the resources in place to do that as part of the new contract of employment.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The roll-out will begin next year. Clearly it will take time before everybody in a given catchment area is called. I know the response rate to BreastCheck is about 70%, which by international standards is apparently very good. However, this means that about 30% of those called do not respond. We should all do everything we can to encourage people. I meet people from time to time who receive a letter and take the view that they prefer not to know. Yet we know there can be fantastic results if cancer is detected early. I would encourage everybody who is called to respond and to go for the mammogram. It is a wonderful service, and I hope we can have it in place everywhere before long.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been happening all over the world, in the USA, the UK and so on. There is no reason the service could not have been extended to the whole country in 2000. We are suffering the effects of this now. I know the T&aacute;naiste argues that she is not an advocate of anything other than keeping people alive. If the Galway Clinic route is the way to go, then it should be let do it. I spoke to the clinic and was told it could do it. We keep getting the same answer as regards the intricacies. There is no intricacy here except the conundrum as regards how people in the west and south cannot have this service which is in the other half of the country. I just cannot understand it. It does not make sense. Why did those people die?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy it is my intention and that of the Government to have it rolled out as well. That is why provision has been made by way of resources for that to happen and why we have gone to tender for procurement of a contractor to build the facility. However, it is not just about a building. It is also a question of highly qualified staff such as a radiologist, specially trained nurses and others. As I told the Deputy earlier, clinical directors and other key staff have been selected. In addition to the screening pro<Col N="694"/>cess and the 2% of the population that require follow-up, there is the question of the surgical team. In the case of the west there is the University College Hospital, Galway. Staff in the whole facility must work together and it is not just an issue of screening, as the Deputy is aware.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s earlier response on the number of women who do not take up the opportunity, for the following reason. Does she recall that a mammography machine was located at Cavan General Hospital for several years, that it was never used and was then transferred to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda? During its time at Cavan a number of radiographers were specially trained in England to use it, but never allowed to actually put the equipment into use at Cavan General Hospital. Does the T&aacute;naiste not agree that this is yet another indication of the folly of over-centralisation and that the powers-that-be have decreed from on high that services as regards BreastCheck in the north east will be centred at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda?</P>
    <P Just="Left">On the numbers of women to whom she refers as not taking up the opportunity &mdash; and some who require after-care referral &mdash; it is not always a question of preferring not to know. While I appreciate the importance of the roll-out throughout the rest of the State and fully concur with Deputy Cowley&rsquo;s points, nevertheless, where the service is in place it is not being taken up by all the women who should avail of it. Part of the reason is that we have a very serious transport problem. The T&aacute;naiste should know that there is practically no public transport system in place in the north east. It is virtually non-existent. There is no regular service to Drogheda from any of the other key locations within the neighbouring counties, certainly not Cavan and Monaghan. Accepting that deficiency, will the T&aacute;naiste outline steps she may be considering to help ensure all women have the opportunity to avail of the service already in existence and, in preparing for its roll-out throughout the rest of the State, will she build in to the plan transport arrangements because often women are left isolated and alone? There may be a vehicle at home that is used by another person in the home for work and other reasons. It is not always simple. I would like to know if any measures are being considered to address that deficiency.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, we have mobile units that go to more remote areas to do the screening. Not everybody has to come to the big centre. Among the people I referred to earlier, one person in particular whom I met last weekend lives within a mile and a half or two miles of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital where BreastCheck is located in Dublin. There are different issues. I am not taking away from the transport issue but we do have mobile screening facilities and clearly they are of great use in the <Col N="695"/>more peripheral areas of the country. Some 98% of people do not require any follow-up. Thankfully they get good news after being screened. Only 2% of people may come for follow-up treatment.</P>
    <P>Breast surgery takes place in a large number of centres. All the evidence would suggest that a unit should carry out at least 100 operations a year and that it is not safe for the procedure to be carried out in a facility that is smaller. That is why I asked Professor Niall O&rsquo;Higgins, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons, and a group of experts to make recommendations in regard to this area in particular. The Minister for Health and Children of the day and the Department should at least make sure that surgery takes place under safe conditions. We cannot stand over a situation where a patient&rsquo;s outcome is disimproved because an operation is not taking place in an appropriate setting.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Work on the new medical practitioners Bill is well advanced and it is envisaged the heads of the Bill will be circulated for comment to interested parties, including the Deputy, before the summer. This will assist in drafting the Bill. I intend to publish the Bill later this year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is good to hear because there is a fear that somehow this legislation will not be implemented before the next general election and considering the recommendations that were made in the Lourdes hospital report, this is very serious legislation. However, I also wish to ask the T&aacute;naiste what is being done in regard to clinical governance, clinical audit and com<Col N="696"/>petence assurance because these are not just catch phrases we can throw out all the time. In some respects the T&aacute;naiste is trying to slip away from the importance of these issues by saying she will ensure a lay majority on the Medical Council.</P>
    <P>As a State organisation, whether the Medical Council has a lay majority or is self-regulated with a majority of doctors is of no benefit to patients unless the issues around clinical governance, clinical audit and competence assurance are dealt with. As we saw from the Lourdes hospital report the Medical Council acted appropriately once it was informed. In fact, the Medical Council had to report Dr. Neary to itself in order to investigate the matter. Many facts have been lost in the very emotive issues that surrounded this crisis in the north east. What does the T&aacute;naiste intend to do before the summer in regard to issues such as clinical audit and competence assurance?</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste has quoted Professor John Higgins in CUH about clinical directorates and doctors having to do more themselves. It is our responsibility to protect patients. It is not up to the goodwill of a few consultants, doctors or voluntary organisations, it is our responsibility. I would like to hear more, not just about the legislation, because even if we do bring the Bill to the House in September it will not be enacted before the next general election, and we need to know what will happen in regard to those other big issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I certainly hope it will be enacted because otherwise it will fall. A huge effort is being made in the Department of Health and Children to try to make sure we have modern and robust legislation enacted with great speed.</P>
    <P>Clearly, there are deficiencies in the 1978 legislation. We need more modern and robust legislation but, notwithstanding the deficiencies, that is no excuse for what happened in the maternity unit of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital for 25 years. To be quite frank, if it were not for that brave midwife and the response of both Ambrose McLoughlin at the time and Mr. Lennon we might never have got to the stage of finding out what happened there. Notwithstanding the legislation or the deficiencies in it, many things could have been reported that were not reported and we need to learn from that. Everybody has responsibilities in regard to this issue.</P>
    <P>Specifically on competence assurance, in medicine in particular, but more and more in other professions, continuing professional development is an important prerequisite for maintaining one&rsquo;s skill base. That will become mandatory in the new legislation. We need to ensure that those who are on the register, the specialists in our health care system, are involved in a process where the patients can be reassured that they are competent to do the job they originally qualified to do. I know most progressive doctors feel very strongly about this as well.</P><Col N="697"/>
    <P>The Lourdes hospital report also raised issues for the college of obstetrics, the Royal College of Surgeons and others, as well as for hospital management. That is why we want to have clinical directors in the context of a new consultants&rsquo; contract. Currently in the health care system consultants are independent contractors. They are not required to work as part of a team. Each person is his or her own boss, as it were. I know some doctors are critical of this but the best health care systems in the world are ones where people work as a team and there is a clinical director with specific responsibilities. Generally, the chairperson of the medical board of a hospital does this on a <i>pro bono</i> basis and maybe in some places they might get a session or something in lieu of the work they put in. We have to take this issue more seriously and see this role as a job in itself where people are hopefully appointed to the position based on their expertise and competence. They would then be responsible for the team with which they work. That is when we would get the best results.</P>
    <P>Clearly, there has to be a national audit. As Members are aware, we have given resources to Cork University Hospital to establish an audit in regard to maternity issues. Professor John Higgins from Cork is the person who put the idea to me. It is borne out of something he had seen elsewhere. I am happy to say we have provided the funding to get that up and running so that details in regard to all births nationwide will be fed into a central unit at Cork University Hospital. I hope it will be possible to detect something like what was happening in the maternity unit in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital much earlier because it should be evident if the pattern in one hospital is very different from the pattern in some of the other hospitals in the country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>While I acknowledge that the T&aacute;naiste clearly envisages that the legislation will address the important issue of ensuring that all medical practitioners are properly qualified and trained, would she not also accept that we can have no dependence on whistleblowing alone in terms of drawing public and wider attention to malpractice or irregularities in terms of service delivery in any of the disciplines? The legislation must contain a guarantee of regular monitoring and ongoing assessment.</P>
    <P>Will the T&aacute;naiste give an indication of what is intended in the medical practitioners Bill in that regard because, ultimately, it is the only real safety net and the one that can instil the greatest confidence in the widest number of people. The confidence of many people has been greatly diminished and in some cases shattered by the experiences of the Neary case and others in recent years. What can the T&aacute;naiste tell us about that and can she give us an indication of when exactly the medical practitioners Bill will come before us? If she is in a position to do so, will the T&aacute;naiste release the heads of the Bill which <Col N="698"/>would be of assistance to Opposition Members in assessing exactly what she intends?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I intend to release the heads of the Bill. This will be helpful given that it will be major legislation that will be of great interest not only in this House. A better debate on the Bill will ensue if there is feedback and input at an earlier stage. There will be an ongoing process of competence assurance because we have noted this happens elsewhere. Most of our best doctors constantly attend seminars or international events and keep their skills up to speed by writing in journals and undertaking research. We must ensure this becomes the norm for all specialists in the health care system. The president of the medical council, Dr. Hillery, has done some very innovative work in this area and we are working closely with him on those aspects of the legislation, whatever about the issue of lay participation.</P>
    <P>The medical council currently has 25 members. Any member involved in a fitness to practise inquiry could be involved for up to three days a week and this would also entail considerable advance preparation, yet the lay members do not receive any remuneration nor is the fact that they have other lives and other careers taken into account. These are some of the issues that need to be examined. If we want to have lay participation &mdash; which most people would welcome &mdash; we must facilitate this happening. We must consider the significant time involvement by the current members, particularly those on the fitness to practise committee which is an onerous committee for many of them. It is certain that we would not be able to continue with the current regime on an ongoing basis if there were to be many fitness to practise inquiries in any one year. These inquiries can go on for a considerable length of time.</P>

Is it true that this will not include any regulation to cover alternative practitioners and will be just a voluntary code?

     <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
     <Quest>her views on the State&rsquo;s &euro;65 million bill for drugs and medicines in hospitals and in the community which is significantly ahead of expectations; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that in six of the country&rsquo;s major acute hospitals, drug costs increased by an average of 19%; her plans to address these rising costs; if she has plans to encourage use of generic drugs; if so the way in which she intends to do so and the timescale of this plan; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[15472/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The financial report to the board of the Health Service Executive in respect of the cumulative expenditure to end December 2005 highlighted the growth in expenditure on drugs and medicines of &euro;65 million over the 2004 expenditure level. This represents an increase of 13% on a total expenditure figure for 2004 of &euro;500 million on both major hospitals and the community drug schemes. This expenditure excludes the cost of drugs and medicines provided to medical card holders under the GMS scheme. The growth in expenditure is attributable to increased patient numbers and the introduction of new drug treatments.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I have previously expressed concern about the increasing cost to the Exchequer of drugs and medicines and the sustainability of trends in this regard. It is essential to secure maximum value for money for this expenditure. All aspects of the drug delivery system, from the manufacturer to the patient, are being reviewed by my Department and the Health Service Executive. A number of possible measures to address the rapidly rising medicine costs being incurred by the State are being considered. These include greater access to generic drugs and supply chain costs such as pharmacy mark-ups.</P>
    <P>I stress that no single measure will contain the rate of increase in expenditure on medicines and drugs. International experience has shown that this is a very difficult task, as the sophistication and range of treatments continue to increase along with increased expectations on the part of patients.</P>
    <P>On the specific issue of generic drugs, it is my intention to give patients and ultimately the taxpayer, as the biggest buyer of medicines, better access to generic drugs where this is possible and appropriate. Negotiations are currently under way with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland, on a new national pricing and supply agreement for the supply of medicines to the health service. The agreement covers all reimbursable prescription medicines in the GMS and community drug schemes and all medicines supplied to hospitals and the HSE. It is intended to address the issue of access to generic drugs within this new agreement.</P>

   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply. I assure her the Labour Party will be keen to support her in any move towards the use of generic drugs, so long as it is reasonable.</P>
    <P>Is it not possible for the Minister to ensure that generic drugs are prescribed more often by GPs to those patients who are not GMS patients? The GMS scheme currently encourages the use of generic drugs. What is stopping the Minister from ensuring that the same principle is applied to private patients of GPs? The Minister has stated she is considering a number of options. Does this include a cap on very expensive drugs? Will she comment on the fact that some new drugs are extremely expensive and that a cap on their use is applied in other countries? Is she considering its application here?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No. These are very controversial areas and they are probably more appropriate for those with medical expertise. I am aware that many countries have protocols regulating when particular drugs may be used, for example, drugs that can cure as opposed to drugs used for an incurable illness. We have not considered going down that road as it is a very sensitive issue. In the first instance it is the intention to get better value in the whole supply chain, whether it is from the manufacturers&rsquo; piece or the wholesalers&rsquo; piece or the pharmacy piece. There cannot be a situation whereby we are paying the same price for a drug when it is off patent as when it was on patent. The patent should cover the innovation and I am a strong fan of supporting innovation in the pharmaceutical sector. Innovation is extraordinarily expensive. Many of the innovations never turn into products that can be sold and huge sums of money can be spent in the process. It is clearly a very expensive investment for pharmaceutical companies. I believe the patent period covers the innovation costs and the profits companies are entitled to expect. Therefore when a drug is no longer a branded product I do not believe we should pay anything like that price. This is the approach being taken by the HSE with the Department in these negotiations. Some considerable work has been done by the pharmo-economics division of Trinity College, Dublin, and others in assisting the HSE in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Deputy makes an interesting point about private patients. We used financial incentives to encourage GPs to prescribe on the medical card. It is a good idea which we should examine.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>When will we get a chief pharmacist?</P>
    <P>Issues have arisen from time to time regarding scarcity of drugs and the unavailability of certain drugs through pharmacies. This matter has been raised with the T&aacute;naiste. In recent months, drugs which I suspect are more expensive but are not licensed in the same way as the original drug, have been substituted because drugs are not available on the market. I know the Minister is a <Col N="701"/>great supporter of the market but the market does not always deliver and from time to time, quite important drugs have not been available. How is the T&aacute;naiste dealing with this matter?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In answer to the question about the chief pharmacist &mdash; until we can pay a public sector salary commensurate with what the market regards as reasonable we will find it considerably difficult. This has been the experience when the Department recruited some professionals in recent times. It is a real issue because of the salaries being earned in the private sector. In some of these areas we rely on retired persons coming back on a part-time consultative basis. I am currently in discussion on the matter and I hope to be able to say something about it later.</P>
    <P>The drug industry is not quite like the market elsewhere in that prices are negotiated with governments which can vary from one country to another. This is unsatisfactory mainly because there are unique suppliers of particular products. I am not aware of the specific shortage to which the Deputy refers. It may have been brought to the attention of the Department but it has not been brought to my attention with regard to any specific drug. For a country like ours, for example, in the case of the influenza pandemic, it was much more attractive for us financially to join the UK in dealings on the H5N1 vaccine than to seek to negotiate ourselves, as a small country with a small population, with the supplier of the vaccine. That is often the story where small populations are dealing with large companies and real issues are involved.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the contract is to guarantee supply of medicines. Clearly, unless we can move to prescribing more generic drugs, we will not be able to afford many of the new treatments. The new breast cancer drug, Herceptin, which cuts of the supply of blood to the tumour, costs about &euro;20,000 per patient per year over a five-year period and is being prescribed in Ireland. We want ensure that patients have access to such drugs and any other drugs that can greatly assist, but the <i>quid pro quo</i> would have to be to try to get savings when drugs go off patent and more prescribing of generic drugs where possible.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 83 together.</P>
    <P>The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including child and adolescent psychiatry, were considered by the expert group on mental health policy. The Government has accepted and published the group&rsquo;s report entitled A Vision for Change, and &euro;25 million has been provided this year for the further enhancement of mental health services.</P>
    <P>A Vision for Change acknowledges gaps in the current provision of child and adolescent services and makes several recommendations for the further improvement of these services. Recommendations include early intervention and health promotion programmes, primary and community care services, specialist mental health services for the treatment of complex disorders and the provision of additional child community mental health teams. In particular, the group recommended that child and adolescent mental health services should provide mental health services to all those aged up to 18 years who need such services. It also recommended that transitional arrangements to facilitate the expansion of current service provision should be planned by the proposed national mental health service directorate and the local child community mental health teams.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the Health Service Executive has established a high level working group to advise on the transition arrangements and to make recommendations on the most appropriate provision for young people aged 16 and 17 years with mental health needs, both within the community and on an inpatient basis.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of waiting times for psychological assessment, I am informed that the HSE is conducting a review of services nationally to identify and address gaps in service where they exist, and to identify opportunities for additional capacity in line with recommendations in the report A Vision for Change.</P>
    <P>The development of child and adolescent psychiatric services has been a priority for the Department in recent years. Since 1997 additional funding of almost &euro;20 million has been provided to allow for the appointment of additional consultants in child and adolescent psychiatry, for the enhancement of existing consultant-led multidisciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. This has resulted in the funding of an extra 23 child and adolescent consultant psychiatrists. Nationally 56 such child and adolescent psychiatrists are now employed by the HSE.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Am I correct in saying that there are only 16 acute beds for children and adolescents in the country, none of which is in the south and all of which are in Galway or Dublin? What plans has the Minister of State to increase the number of such beds and what timescale has he set?</P>
    <P>How come more than 3,000 children and adolescents now await psychiatric assessment? If it was a priority of the Government that it should not arise, how did that arise? What timescale has the Minister of State set to reduce this number to acceptable levels, in other words, to zero? What has he to say to parents who have children with psychiatric difficulties when no service is available at present? It is a failure. It is a disgrace. Will the Minister of State provide the House with some timescales and stop the blather? This is a life and death issue for many parents, families and young people.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NiallBlaneyIND"><NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is with great dismay that I speak again about the dire circumstances being faced in accident and emergency units. I am well aware this is a national problem but let me focus on the problems facing the accident and emergency unit in Letterkenny General Hospital. The professional staff at the hospital are trying to deal with very sick members of the public in what only can be described as very cramped facilities. The accident and emergency unit in the hospital is too small, equipment is inadequate and old, there are far too few beds to cater for those who need to be admitted to the hospital, and the staff and public are tired of the situation.</P>
    <P>While I very much welcome the sanctioning of a new accident and emergency unit for Letterkenny General Hospital by the T&aacute;naiste with work due to start next year, this unit will not become available for use until 2008. I dread to think of the number of people who will have to be cared for in the existing unit in the meantime. I believe that discussions are ongoing about providing additional beds for a new accident and emergency unit. I urge the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to ensure that this takes place. If the beds are provided, it will be a major factor in providing the answer to Letterkenny General Hospital&rsquo;s current overcrowding problem. If that were to be the case, it would solve the problem of an inadequate accident and emergency unit while also providing additional beds which are so badly required.</P>
    <P>Clearance has been given for an additional 30 beds in a special prefabricated development which is expected to come into operation before the end of the year. This development is indeed welcome but a prefabricated development is not a long-term solution.</P>
    <P>The day services unit is being used to house people on trolleys daily, with 14 people on trolleys in Letterkenny General Hospital last night. This results in inpatient and day case procedures being cancelled daily owing to the unavailability of inpatient beds and the fact that the day service unit is being used as an accident and emergency overflow. With the economy booming, it is not <Col N="708"/>acceptable that people are expected to tolerate the conditions at Letterkenny General Hospital.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Last year the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children announced the possible sharing of radiotherapy cancer services with Northern Ireland. While I welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s efforts to find a solution to this debacle, services will have to be provided in the north west, not in Belfast. However, I welcome the agreement in principle between the breast care teams in Letterkenny General Hospital and Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry on a model for co-operation and the provision of services for breast cancer patients in County Donegal. I urge the Minister to see this through, while ensuring it is not based on bed capacity and that it complements the service on offer in both hospitals in the best interest of patients in counties Donegal and Derry. An effective arrangement between the two hospitals, which would ensure the retention of the current services in Letterkenny General Hospital, is very much needed.</P>
    <P>I refer to other problems people face in the north west. No neurologist has been appointed to the region for some time, despite a recommendation in 2003 by Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al that two consultant neurologists should be appointed to the north west. Three years have passed and all we have been offered to date is a teleneurophysiology pilot project with Beaumont Hospital. While I welcome progress, it is not staggeringly positive. EEG recordings were due to commence earlier this month and I urge the Minister to roll out the pilot project and appoint at least one consultant neurologist to the north west. Patients suffer from many conditions ranging from multiple sclerosis to brain tumours and so on and they cannot face the trauma of travelling to Dublin or Galway to visit a neurologist on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>BreastCheck is expected to be rolled out in the north west next year. This service once again has been rolled out in many other parts of the State ahead of the north west. While we have had to wait longer than most for the roll-out of the service, the development is welcome and I ask the Minister and her officials to correspond with the Donegal Action for Cancer Care group regarding the implementation of this service in the region.</P>
    <P>Given Donegal&rsquo;s peripheral location, I fully support the concept of cross-Border services. It could be the way forward. I urge the Minister to take stock of all the issues I raised and to reflect upon the health services the people of Donegal must put up with. The county is often marketed under the slogan, &ldquo;Up here it is different&rdquo;, and Donegal is certainly different when it comes to health care. I invite the Minister to visit Letterkenny General Hospital, despite the controversy surrounding it recently, because a visit would boost the overworked staff.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I wish to raise with the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, the <Col N="709"/>issue of Limerick Regional Hospital. Yesterday 12 people were on trolleys in the hospital, although it has one of the better accident and emergency departments. I raised the accident and emergency department issue with Professor Drumm when he appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and he highlighted three hospitals, one of which was Limerick Regional Hospital, that were doing well in this area. Each day we read the Trolley Watch figures and usually between four and six patients are on trolleys in the hospital. On one occasion, the number reached 35 because there was a crisis but, overall, the hospital in Limerick is one of the better ones in this regard.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand, therefore, why it was fined &euro;1.2 million for being inefficient. I do not understand the criteria for evaluating hospitals, given that it is accepted that the efficiency of a hospital has a great deal to do with the operation of its accident and emergency department. In other words, the department is a barometer of a hospital&rsquo;s efficiency. How could Limerick hospital be fined &euro;1.2 million when other less efficient hospitals obtained an increased allocation because of their efficiency? That does not make sense and I hope the Minister of State addresses why the hospital was fined in this fashion. The implication is the hospital is efficient but it is being fined &euro;1.2 million to make sure that efficiency does not continue. However, if the hospital&rsquo;s budget is reduced, its efficiency will not be maintained.</P>
    <P>The manner in which elderly people are treated in hospital is an issue. It is accepted the number of elderly people who will attend hospital will increase substantially because of our ageing population. The way they are treated leaves a lot to be desired. I dealt with a case in this regard last week. When an elderly person is in hospital, he or she is practically ignored while discussions take place with family members and decisions are made on their treatment, continuing care, transfer to a nursing home, the winter initiative and so on. The patient, who is the key person, is often not consulted. It is almost as if when one reaches a certain age, one does not have a view or one should not be consulted on one&rsquo;s treatment and so on. Families face difficulties because of a lack of information about the care and treatment of their elderly relatives and it is a sensitive issue. Discussions take place on whether a patient should be transferred to a private or public nursing home, but criteria should be laid down, as far as possible, in this area so that people can fully understand what is happening and decisions are explained to them.</P>
    <P>Last week I was contacted by a family regarding an elderly relative in hospital who was told she was being transferred to a nursing home. When the family members visited the hospital, the elderly relative was dressed to go to the nursing home. She did not understand that she was being transferred to a nursing home for two <Col N="710"/>weeks under the winter initiative and that was not explained to her relatives. They were worried about how to pay for her care in the nursing home because she was only on an old age pension and the relatives were not a son or daughter. The person most affected by the move was the patient, who was not consulted and did not know what was happening.</P>
    <P>I refer to the waiting lists for initial psychiatric assessment for children. I received a letter from the HSE on 7 April, following the referral by the Minister of State of a parliamentary question I tabled a number of months ago, in which I was informed there is a considerable waiting list for assessments and the waiting times are also lengthy. If this is not an emergency, I do not know what is. It is accepted that early intervention for children with difficulties who are in need of psychiatric assessment is vital to their recovery. The waiting times can vary significantly. For example, 214 children are waiting in Kerry and the waiting period is between 22 and 41 months. It is surely not acceptable that a child in need of psychiatric assessment must wait up to 41 months. In Cork, there are 267 children waiting between 12 and 17 months. In south Tipperary, 40 children are waiting 18 months. Professor Drumm has noted the efficiency of Waterford, where only four children are on the list, waiting between six and eight weeks. There are 300 children waiting an average of ten months in Limerick, Clare and Tipperary.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Very little attention is paid to the issue of waiting lists for psychiatric illness, especially child psychiatric illness. Early intervention for children with psychiatric difficulties multiplies the chances of early recovery. It represents bad economics to allow children become chronically ill before they are assessed. If early intervention can be achieved in Waterford, why can it not be achieved in the mid-west, in Kerry, Cork and elsewhere? There is a ten-month waiting list in Dublin. There is a waiting list of 1,000 in the Lucena clinic, with a waiting time of approximately two years.</P>
    <P>The report of the Irish College of Psychiatrists into child psychiatric services, published last autumn, showed that in excess of 200,000 children have a mental or behavioural problem at any one time. While in excess of 100,000 of these have a mild disorder, 80,000 have a moderate to severe disorder and 20,000 have a disabling disorder. Dealing with this serious situation effectively requires 236 inpatient psychiatric beds, but there are currently only 20 beds in Galway and Dublin. Responding effectively to the psychiatric needs of these children requires 150 consultant child and adolescent psychiatric posts, but there are currently only 62 psychiatrists in this field of the profession.</P>
    <P>The lack of psychotherapists, family therapists, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists and other key staff seriously inhibits the internationally acknowledged best practice for the <Col N="711"/>provision of child psychiatric services through multi-disciplinary teams. When a child gets into emotional or psychiatric difficulties, early intervention is crucial to deal with the situation urgently. It may have a profound effect on the future life opportunities of that child.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate. I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I remind him that it is a little while since he has been in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I was going to make a general speech on this issue, but I noticed other colleagues, including the main Opposition spokesperson on health, made very parochial contributions so I will speak about Tallaght for a little while. I represent the third largest population centre in the country. Dublin South-West embraces Tallaght, Firhouse, Templeogue, Greenhills and Brittas. The catchment area for Tallaght hospital stretches through Kildare and Wicklow, all the way to Carnew. The Ceann Comhairle, who was Minister for Health in 1987, developed the project and made the decision to appoint me to the board. At the time, I was the first person with a Tallaght address to be appointed to that board.</P>
    <P>Tallaght hospital is very important for the local community and I have been proud to be associated with the hospital through membership of the planning board, which was only wound up last year. I pay tribute to the members of that planning board, including Des Rogan, the project manager and the former Senator Richard Conroy, who chaired the board. I was also proud to be a member of the new AMANCH board when it was set up, following the move of the Adelaide, Meath and National Children&rsquo;s Hospital to Tallaght in 1998.</P>
    <P>Last weekend, the T&aacute;naiste pointed out that we should be very careful not to speak badly of the services as that will help nobody. We all get political pamphlets in our letter boxes making political points about the service, which is fair enough, but I am upset that these people run down the services and those involved in the provision of services. There should be a different way of making political points. I am a politician and I understand the thrust of politics, but we should not throw the baby out with the bath water. I am a Government backbencher and I am proud to be a supporter of this coalition, but I am not afraid to admit that there are problems with the health service. Tallaght hospital, with the other Dublin hospitals, often gets bad press and we should continue to press their needs.</P>
    <P>Tallaght hospital has one of the busiest accident and emergency departments in the country. In 2005, there were almost 75,000 accident and emergency attendances, 29,000 attendances in the children&rsquo;s accident and emergency department and 45,000 in the adult department. The hospital has 350 acute adult beds to manage this work<Col N="712"/>load. This equates to one bed for every 600 persons in the catchment area. In contrast, Beaumont Hospital has one bed for every 350 persons. The past few years have seen a significant increase in the number of patients admitted from the accident and emergency department.</P>
    <P>New services have been established in Tallaght hospital, such as the very busy oncology service. However, no additional beds have been provided to cater for the needs of the new service or the increasing needs of emergency admissions from the accident and emergency department. Tallaght hospital has taken a very proactive approach in an attempt to reduce the numbers of patients who must wait on trolleys. The HSE&rsquo;s figures confirm that the number of patients waiting on trolleys has been reduced significantly, as has the waiting time. The figures also confirm significant improvements in the long-term care waiting list in the hospital. Much of this has been achieved by the establishment of a multi-disciplinary discharge team at the hospital. This initiative has not yet been funded by the HSE.</P>
    <P>A 41-bed temporary transition unit is being constructed at Tallaght hospital, which will be operational by July. This will be used to accommodate acute admissions from the accident and emergency department. When it is opened, it is expected that patients will not have to wait on trolleys for more than six hours. A number of key issues for Tallaght hospital have also been identified that must be put in place if an optimal acute service is to be provided for patients in the area. These include a new CT scanner to improve speed and quality of diagnostic services, an extension to the ICU unit which currently cannot meet the demands of critical care beds, the establishment of a permanent acute hospital admission unit for which funding has long been sought, an increase in consultant numbers, particularly in the acute medical specialties, and diagnostic support services. The management and staff at Tallaght Hospital are committed to providing for the acute care needs of people in the community and the wider catchment area. Many of the difficulties experienced over recent years have begun to ease and the hospital has a plan and a strategic approach for the future which will minimise many accident and emergency problems by the second half of this year. It is hoped that elective surgical and orthopaedics practices, which have been severely curtailed in recent months, will be restored to full activity. The hospital is confident that it can obtain the necessary support and resources from the HSE and the Department to progress these plans. I ask the Minister of State to inform the T&aacute;naiste of my strong support for these activities because it is important that she understands the special needs of Tallaght Hospital. My colleagues will discuss other areas and hospitals but I am not afraid to express the concerns I have with regard to Tallaght Hospital.</P>
    <P>Recently, there has been a great deal of speculation about plans for a new paediatric hospital. <Col N="713"/>In terms of the criteria and infrastructure, the case for Tallaght is very strong. Tallaght Hospital can be accessed from all parts of the country, is connected with Limerick by a good road and accessible from Dublin&rsquo;s train stations by Luas. I hope those who are charged with the responsibility for making important decisions on the future hospital care needs of our children will take account of Tallaght&rsquo;s potential.</P>
    <P>The contributions of different disciplines and the role of GPs has been subject to extensive discussion in recent times. I support local GP services and often visit my local GP. It is important that we realise difficulties can arise at each end. In a community such as Tallaght, with its busy and active hospital, there is a role for GP services. In my local GP clinic, the Mary Mercer Health Centre in Jobstown, a successful service is run by Professor Tom O&rsquo;Dowd which could be a great model for the rest of the country. We should try to relieve the pressure on hospitals by providing good GP and other medical services in modern and properly equipped facilities. The Mary Mercer Health Centre was partly funded by the Mercer&rsquo;s Hospital Foundation. Anyone who walks around St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green will remember the old Mercer&rsquo;s Hospital and it is great that the foundation is making a contribution to communities in Tallaght and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I want to be upbeat about the future but must also acknowledge the problems. I often visit neighbours in Tallaght Hospital, who recognise that they are being provided with a tremendous service. I have no sympathy for those who go to accident and emergency departments when they are not ill but have cut their fingers or have taken too much drink. However, when people genuinely need care, we all have to stand up to say that something has to be done about a system which, to some extent, has let people down. I hope the Minister of State will take my message about the needs of Tallaght to the T&aacute;naiste.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody living here can fail to realise that there is a serious crisis in the health service. It is sad that families have to contact Deputies on a daily basis to find hospital beds so that loved ones can be moved from trolleys. In my constituency, Mayo, there have been ongoing problems of people waiting on trolleys. It is a disgrace that when the people who pay their taxes need a hospital bed, they have to spend days on trolleys waiting. We never had as much money as we do now. As I said ten years ago as a Fine Gael deputy spokesman, if the managements of hospitals are unable to do the job, we should sack them all and start again. We are worse off today than we were ten years ago because services have deteriorated.</P><Col N="714"/>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Malley, is here because he has responsibility for the elderly. I have been contacted by many people who are vulnerable because their loved ones have been told to leave hospital. People over 70 years of age are put into State beds but, before they are there 24 hours, they are pressured to move to private nursing homes. These patients, with no resources, are being bullied by the health system. I told the family of one such patient that the law of the land provides that a person over 70 years of age in need of a hospital bed and in possession of a medical card is entitled to that bed. The patient in question was told to move to the private sector and was described last week as fit to leave hospital. However, the patient died last Tuesday and is now buried. Why was the State trying to force that person out of a bed? We cannot have a situation in which we want people to leave hospital beds when they need to be there.</P>
    <P>For more than ten years, the people of Ballinrobe have been waiting for a nursing home but the State will not provide the necessary money. We cannot say we need to free up beds in hospitals if we do not provide step down beds for patients. How many people have contacted the Members of this House with regard to loved ones who need two or three weeks of physiotherapy? Families know that if they bring their loved ones home, they will have to wait a further two years for treatment but all they want is to look after their loved ones and to bring them home.</P>
    <P>I blame the Government for the fact that my county did not use the winter initiative scheme, despite drawing money from the Department for that purpose. If a scheme is put in place, the T&aacute;naiste should instruct Mayo General Hospital to make use of it. She should be strong enough to say that the time has come to provide more step down facilities.</P>
    <P>I also blame the Government for the problems that have arisen with regard to home help services. We are told to keep our loved ones at home and that support will be provided. I know of a young man with four children whose wife died of cancer. He had seven hours of home help per day but the service was reduced by four hours last week. The helper now works from 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and the four little children coming home from school will neither have a mother or a father, who is trying to keep his job, from 12.30 p.m. until 9.30 the following morning. That is the kind of health service we have here.</P>
    <P>Many people will enjoy themselves in Punchestown today. Money is made available for that industry and for the builders but not for the people who need it the most.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>In the last 12 months I had some experience of seeing the health service from a bed and I pay tribute to the Mater Private Hospital, where I was for a short time, and in particular Beaumont Hospital. We hear all sorts of bunkum about how these issues will be solved. The consultants, nurses and other staff are under pressure. Above all they need step-down beds to which people who need longer treatment than expected can be moved. They do not need a new hospital. Since I was in Beaumont it estimated it needs approximately an extra 200 step-down beds to ensure the acute beds can be used. Imagine if a loved one was waiting three months in serious pain for neurosurgery while somebody, through no fault of his or her own, was holding up one of those beds for a number of weeks or months. We must deal with that as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I return to the situation in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. Many areas of Monaghan General Hospital are under-utilised. The new, state-of-the-art theatre was being used for national treatment purchase type schemes in Northern Ireland when the hatchet was brought down on it by some outside body and it was closed. I urge the Minister to ensure that facility is used. I listened with pain to the T&aacute;naiste talking about the scarcity of numbers in the Cavan-Monaghan region. If the people were allowed to be treated in the Cavan-Monaghan region instead of being sent away under the national treatment <Col N="716"/>purchase scheme there would be plenty of work for the theatre and hospital.</P>
    <P>The late Mr. Benny McCullough, who lived a few yards from Monaghan hospital gates, died on the way to Cavan. Since his widow died, their handicapped daughter whom they both loved and looked after, must be looked after by the State for the rest of her life. The T&aacute;naiste talks about safe service. How safe was that service? It seems to be safe if one dies outside the hospital but not if one dies inside it. Many lives have been saved by Monaghan hospital because people were brought there by car. I urge the Minister to ensure the T&aacute;naiste takes a little time to visit Monaghan General Hospital, talks to the people there and sees the situation. She has plenty of time to visit other institutions including pubs, which the Government seems to be good at.</P>
    <P>Cavan General Hospital was never extended to take the overflow from Monaghan. Some 20 to 30 patients are on trolleys there every week. I have a letter from a Monaghan nurse who gave her life service to the State health service and who had to spend three desperate days on a trolley in Cavan waiting for a bed in Beaumont. I hope when the Minister receives this letter he will read it in full and see what he is imposing on the people of Cavan and Monaghan through neglect. It is a failure of management to provide extra beds. There are beds available in the psychiatric section of the hospital, where there is less than half usage of the beds, and with realistic thinking these could be used. Other beds are used for full-time elder care. Some of these could be used as step-down beds if the occupants were moved out to permanent homes. There are many ways of dealing with this that need little cost, just some common sense.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring mentioned subvention. Why should somebody have to wait eight weeks to have a subvention form dealt with? If any other business operated in this way it would not survive two days. Because subvention forms are being held up, patients are being held in wards. Another issue is the failure of home help. The Ceann Comhairle is aware of a case in our county in which a person moved from Donegal, where he received 12 hours of home help, to Carrickmacross, County Monaghan where he receives two hours. How does the Minister explain this difference? How does the Minister explain that medical cards are not available in areas such as Cavan-Monaghan, compared to areas such as Cork? The figures show that there is a discrepancy in allocation. Why should a community welfare officer not be able to hand out a medical card? Why must it go through six different layers? I urge the Minister to examine the administration, how the health system is being worked and deliver what the people require and could have.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to be able to speak on this important issue. In my area a number of important changes have taken place recently, <Col N="717"/>particularly in St. Vincent&rsquo;s, into which St. Michael&rsquo;s has been subsumed. This has given extra specialties to St. Michael&rsquo;s and it has become a first-class hospital. Its accident and emergency department operates between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. and it has been successful. There are waiting lists, but that is inevitable. It has developed specialties and on visits I have noticed a pride among the staff in the work they do and the specialties they have undertaken. It is an example for the centralisation of certain specialist deliveries, which should be continued to be rolled out nationwide.</P>
    <P>I claim no great expertise in this area, and my one observation is a shortage of senior clinical decision makers in hospitals. No matter how good the primary care service, if the person with a headache visits a GP, and the GP cannot definitively say the person is okay, he or she will try to set up an appointment with a consultant. Because the consultants are unavailable and the patient must wait 14 or 16 months for an appointment, a visit to an accident and emergency department is his or her only recourse. The junior hospital doctor in the accident and emergency department is unwilling to take a clinical decision because there is somebody above him or her and services, such as a scan, are unavailable. The patient must therefore wait until either a consultant or a scan is available. If the patient goes to the accident and emergency department on a Friday or a Saturday he or she could wait two or three days for a decision. The patient may or may not have a serious illness.</P>
    <P>More senior clinical decision makers are needed in the system and without this we will face a continuing logjam. As the T&aacute;naiste pointed out to the Committee on Health and Children, accident and emergency is a symptom of other problems in the health service. There was an illuminating letter in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> which contained in one long and farcical sentence all the problems identified in a debate of three or four hours here.</P>
    <P>All of those problems exist, but the most grave and serious symptom is of course the trolley problem. It is clear that problem is more significant during the winter months. At the time, the Irish Nurses Organisation opposed the HSE proposal in regard to moving accident and emergency patients into hospital wards to relieve congestion.</P>
    <P>My next point concerns the industrial relations problems being experienced as the attempt is made to roll out this massive health reform strategy. Deputy Crawford referred to the individual problems in regard to the HSE. If 12 hours home care is available in Donegal and only two hours is available in Monaghan, that is an inevitable consequence of the fact that there were 11 health boards in the Eastern Regional Health Authority. When the system is centralised, the anomalies will be revealed. It will take some time for that to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="718"/>
   <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>It was Fianna F&aacute;il which controlled the health boards. The Deputy should not have any doubt about that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have the opportunity to make a contribution shortly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Whether anybody controlled the health boards, the medical staff decided who got home care health packages, as the Deputy well knows. I know it is the knee-jerk reaction of Opposition Deputies to try to draw politicians into blame.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fact.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>That is inevitable and is part and parcel of the work we do. Clinical decisions are made by hospital staff, not by councillors on health boards, as the Deputy knows. I make the point that the HSE in its present organisation will inevitably take time to reform. During that period of reform, during which it is difficult to have patience, it will take time to iron out anomalies. We may suffer a political fall-out as a result but that is not as important as whether patients are properly treated.</P>
    <P>On the question of industrial relations, the IMO is always blamed by the politicians for all the problems that exist in the health service, which is to take a simplistic view. Let us focus on the facts. The IMO advises its members not to co-operate with the setting up of primary care teams &mdash; one of the points being made concerns the development of out-of-hours services. While the Government has invested &euro;60 million, Opposition Deputies and Senators tell it to provide primary care services and ask why it has not been done as it was part of the health care strategy of 2001. I am not suggesting the IMO is to blame. This is a democracy and it is entitled to oppose such policies, but the IMO is a factor in this problem, and a symptom of the problem is the situation in accident and emergency units.</P>
    <P>The number of doctor-only medical cards was increased last October by 20%, and 30% in other cases, but the IMO objected to that increase at the Labour Relations Commission. It also objected to discussion on the consultant contract, which is the <i>sine qua non</i> for real reform within the health service. It even refused to take part in talks and, while I stand open to correction, my impression is that it refused to allow Professor Drumm to address its conference. The IMO objected to the introduction of cervical screening at primary care level.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>It may not have objected specifically to that but there were objections to the way in which it was delivered. I do not want to give the simplistic impression that the IMO is simply <Col N="719"/>in it for its own interests. However, as we are having this debate, it is important to recognise that there is a major industrial relations problem which is not all the fault of the Government. That is how I will leave the matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to improvements, the T&aacute;naiste is more than capable of defending her record and that of the Government back to 1997. She made the point that we spend more on health than France and Great Britain, which is a fact. I have heard Members state in the Chamber that we have employed an extra 35,000 to 40,000 staff but that none of these is doing anything useful because they are all in their offices playing sudoku and business games. Ten out of 11 of those staff are direct line service providers, which is why 93% of patients who come through our hospitals are satisfied with the service they receive.</P>
    <P>We cannot constantly run down our health service and feed into a spiral of despair. I notice that Fine Gael&rsquo;s latest disastrous billboard campaign, which follows the tradition of the Celtic snail campaign, delivers a body-blow to all those who are proud of the services they provide in the health service. It demoralises and diminishes the work being done by doctors, nurses and health care professionals throughout the system to claim that people are scared to go into hospital. They are not scared. People are concerned about accident and emergency units and waiting on trolleys, but nobody is scared. These facts should be acknowledged by Fine Gael, although, from a narrow political perspective, I am pleased to see Fine Gael shoot itself in the foot once again.</P>
    <P>Ireland&rsquo;s spending on health shows the fastest growth of any OECD country. However, spending is not everything. We must acknowledge that many of the best developments in our health service will be free. We need to provide better information for patients entering accident and emergency. For example, Deputy James Breen has personal experience of the dangers associated with people not washing their hands. Improved practice in this area will be free of charge to the health service. Patients should be treated with respect and as important clients of the service. Basic courtesy and manners cost nothing but would make a significant improvement to the health service.</P>
    <P>The home care packages are important. The waste of money and the handing back of &euro;135 million by the HSE is unbelievable. I am fortunate that my family and I do not have many health problems but a personal anecdote may underline the wastage that occurs. Last year I visited a health centre which had just bought a new bed for one of its rooms. I commented on the bed as it looked fantastic and was told that it had been bought because if the money had not been spent, the health centre would not get the same budgetary allocation the following year. The old bed was lying somewhere despite being in perfect con<Col N="720"/>dition. This kind of problem is rampant throughout the HSE and it has much to do with budgeting. However, we must remember that the HSE balanced its budget in its first year. That is a good news story that should also be acknowledged if we are to be honest about this debate.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss this issue. Huge progress has been made. On a political level, I fully support the T&aacute;naiste in what she is doing in an extremely difficult job. Major, revolutionary changes are under way and we must be patient to some extent.</P>

	<P>It appears that Tallaght is cloud cuckooland also because Deputy Andrews shares territory with the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
    <P>Three years ago the situation in the accident and emergency unit of the Mater hospital had reached such a pass that the Labour Party decided to mount a protest outside the hospital from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. on occasional Saturdays. It was only then that the full appalling state of affairs became known to us from regularly visiting the accident and emergency unit and speaking to patients and relatives who were visiting the hospital. Consequently, we decided to mount the protest on a weekly basis and have done so for almost three years.</P>
    <P>At the time, 20 to 35 people were lying on trolleys at any one time. The accident and emergency department was short four nurses and needed more medical staff. There were 60 nurse vacancies in the hospital, over 70 beds were occupied by patients who could be catered for in a recovery unit, if there was a recovery unit, 100 new beds were desperately needed and the waiting list for serious operations and treatment was a massive 4,000. That was the position in the Mater hospital in 2003. That situation was replicated in all major hospitals throughout the country at the time. Hospital consultants said there were 3,000 fewer beds than in 1990. Three years on, the situation is worse. There are clearly now chairs as well as trolleys in overcrowded accident and emergency departments. A new hyrdo-tilt chair has been installed in the Mater Hospital within the last few weeks, and the hospital authorities clearly do not expect major changes in the foreseeable future.</P><Col N="721"/>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste became Minister for Health and Children in September 2004 and immediately launched a ten-point plan to eliminate the accident and emergency crisis once and for all. Major improvements were promised within a few months. She said the Government&rsquo;s credibility would depend on its delivery. Now, 18 months later, she has declared a national emergency. She clearly does not have a clue what to do, and the ten-point plan is in tatters.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party published a policy document entitled Healthcare &mdash; A New Direction Towards Primary Care. It spells out a long-term strategic approach to delivering community-based health care that has the funds and resources to treat the many patients clogging up accident and emergency departments and that can acquire the confidence of the patient. In the short term, however, there is a need for urgent action to address the national emergency.</P>
    <P>First, we must separate accident and emergency reception areas to divide ill people who are elderly and frail from the noisy and boisterous who have overdosed on illegal drugs or are drunk and disorderly. Second, existing wards and hospitals closed for years should be opened and staffed immediately. Third, a formal link should be established between each local authority and the bed management section of the local hospital. Remedial work required on the home of someone in hospital recovering from a serious illness such as a stroke or heart attack should be able to bypass the usual bureaucracy and queue and be carried out without delay, dovetailing with the patient&rsquo;s readiness to return to his or her home and community.</P>
    <P>Fourth, there is a need to enforce strict hygiene standards for all staff and overhaul the system of contract cleaners, who clean the hospitals at certain times of the day rather than according to need, thus cutting the appalling level of MRSA to which vulnerable patients are prone. It damages their health no end and extends their stays in hospital. Fifth, there is a great need to sort out the industrial relations procedures to which Deputy Andrews referred. Those result in virtually no GP service after hours or at weekends on the north side of Dublin. Finally, there is a need for a recovery unit or step-down bed facility on the grounds of every hospital or adjacent thereto.</P>
    <P>None of those measures is rocket science. They are simple, logical procedures that do not cost an arm and a leg, if the Minister will pardon the pun. They can be introduced quickly and prevent untold suffering on the part of old and ill citizens at their most fearful and vulnerable.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for the development of services at Mallow General Hospital rather than transferring patients to Cork University Hospital, as has been suggested. Some 125 GPs referred to Mallow General Hospital, which is the only emergency facility and acute hospital service north of <Col N="722"/>the River Lee. It is an asset to Cork University Hospital and can help ease some of the problems there by catering for the local population&rsquo;s secondary hospital needs. Mallow General Hospital currently services 90,000 to 100,000 people, and the entire area is developing rapidly, having been designated a hub town and growth area under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>Despite that, there is a belief locally that badly needed acute, 24-hour accident and emergency services may be transferred to the larger Cork University Hospital in an effort to centralise. While that may make some sense from a bureaucratic perspective, it makes absolutely none in reality. Downgrading or removing 24-hour accident and emergency services at Mallow would leave some patients two hours&rsquo; journey from acute care, something totally unacceptable by international standards.</P>
    <P>However, a gradual erosion of services at Mallow General Hospital has been under way for several years. In the mid 1980s, it was a major 101-bed hospital servicing the needs of the local community. Its status was confirmed by Mr. Justice Gannon in the High Court in 1989, when he designated it a general hospital. Now, however, despite a growing population and the development of new industries in the area, the hospital has only 81 beds.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to develop a day facility, a position adopted by the health board in 2002 but, to date, not provided. That must come alongside a new day theatre and more day beds, including 150 new rehabilitation beds. It appears the Government&rsquo;s answer to the problems of the health service is to encourage people to pursue private health care as much as possible. That may be an option for a small number who can afford it, but not for the overwhelming majority, including those who rely on Mallow General Hospital.</P>
    <P>Part of that strategy involved the consolidation of services in large city hospitals rather than the development of facilities at local units. However, I want to impress upon the Minister that it makes little financial sense to transfer patients by ambulance from Mallow to Cork and treat them at University Hospital, considering the estimated daily cost per patient in Cork in 2005 was &euro;848 but only &euro;574 in Mallow, a great difference.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children must be aware of the potential for development on the hospital grounds. Certain buildings are currently vacant and could be refurbished and made available, thus retaining and improving all the services that the hospital currently provides. There must be improvements in nurse, clerical and general grade staffing levels.</P>
    <P>I invite the T&aacute;naiste to visit Mallow General Hospital and see the vital work being done and the potential for even more development, after which I will ask her to consider appointing a new management board rather than allow officials at Cork University Hospital to manage Mallow, keeping finances in their own institution. That is <Col N="723"/>what we have been dealing with in recent years, and I would like to see the T&aacute;naiste do something about it. There should be a local management board and a manager appointed to look after moneys allocated to Mallow, ending dependence on Cork University Hospital.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this timely and important motion.</P>
    <P>Sometimes commentators claim that much of what is debated and discussed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann lacks relevance to the citizens of the State. However, this motion flies in the face of such beliefs. It is extremely relevant, not just to those who attend accident and emergency departments but to every citizen. The enormous media coverage that has taken place recently proves the importance of accident and emergency services in all our lives. It also proves that all is not well with those services.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I state quite categorically that there are serious problems with accident and emergency services in certain hospitals. Approximately 35 of them provide such services in the country, and I understand that research undertaken by the HSE shows that approximately 15 such units have specific issues.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that the level of service provided by each accident and emergency unit depends on the specific service commitment of the individual hospital. As a result, the number of patients presenting themselves at accident and emergency departments depends on the hospital&rsquo;s location, the service that it offers, and other factors such as the level of GP cover available in the hospital catchment area. A hospital serving a large population base will generally have more attendees at its accident and emergency department.</P>
    <P>As a non-consultant hospital doctor many years ago, I engaged in a training programme for general practice. As part of that programme, I spent six months as a casualty officer in one of the main Dublin hospitals, part of the city&rsquo;s on-call ambulance rota. That six months&rsquo; training was very rewarding on a personal level and very informative on a professional level. It gave me great insight into the enormous pressure cooker an accident and emergency unit is and how stressful it is for all the staff who work in it. It is only right and proper that I pay tribute to all the staff, whether nurses, doctors, paramedics or support staff, who work day and night in all the accident and emergency units. I know many of the staff in the accident and emergency unit in Sligo General Hospital and there is no doubt in my mind that there are very few jobs anywhere which are as stressful as the jobs they undertake. It is a rewarding job but it is also exceptionally stressful. <Col N="724"/>In all the debate about accident and emergency, it is frequently forgotten that these vital units would not function without these dedicated people.</P>
    <P>Accident and emergency units are simply that &mdash; units which deal with accidents and emergencies. One of the issues which contributes to some of the overcrowding in accident and emergency units is inappropriate attendances at such units. Patients may chose to go to accident and emergency units inappropriately for a variety of reasons but frequent educational programmes throughout the media can better inform the public what cases are best dealt with in accident and emergency units and what can be best dealt with elsewhere. In that regard, we in the Republic can take a lesson from the NHS and our friends across the water in the United Kingdom who frequently show well prepared, informative advertisements on television informing the public on what accident and emergency units are specifically equipped to dealt with.</P>
    <P>Much comment has been made of the trolley count and the difference between the figures produced by the Health Service Executive and the Irish Nurses Organisation. This is a side argument. It is obvious the number of people in accident and emergency units can vary depending on the time of day and the day of the week. There are certain times of the year when admission rates to hospital rise and this can put more pressure on accident and emergency units.</P>
    <P>In the limited time available to me, it is not possible to discuss in detail the many causes contributing to the problems experienced in some accident and emergency units. Let us not beat about the bush. There are severe problems in some accident and emergency units. I am delighted the HSE set up a dedicated accident and emergency team last month to deal with the problems in these hospitals. The HSE has made dealing with the accident and emergency situation its number one priority this year. I welcome the commitment by the T&aacute;naiste and the HSE that no person should have to stay overnight on a trolley. We want the best service for all who attend accident and emergency units and it is intolerable that anybody should be required to stay overnight or longer on a trolley.</P>
    <P>I say this in full cognisance of the enormous range and complexity of medical and surgical problems which can present at accident and emergency units. Emergencies by their very nature must be dealt with immediately, whether a potential stroke, heart attack or whatever. Many of them will need immediate treatment followed by further and continuing assessment with admission the end result in many cases. At the same time, all accidents must be dealt with, whether severe ones from road traffic accidents or minor accidents. Recognising the complexity of these problems and the need for immediate treatment in many of them, the commitment by the HSE to <Col N="725"/>end the practice of overnight stays on trolleys is most welcome.</P>
    <P>While the cause of overcrowding in accident and emergency units is multifactorial, there is little doubt that the unavailability in certain areas of suitable beds for discharge patients has resulted in some of the problems. I welcome the fact the HSE is sourcing an additional 250 beds to accommodate some of these discharge patients. It has been frequently reported to me that patients are kept in acute hospitals after their due discharge dates because of the unavailability of a suitable bed elsewhere, whether for short or long-term care.</P>
    <P>In my area of Sligo-north Leitrim, there are geriatric hospitals such as St. John&rsquo;s, long-stay facilities such as Nazareth House and many excellent nursing homes available to accommodate people who are ready for discharge from Sligo General Hospital but not ready to go straight home. I urge the T&aacute;naiste to ensure full use is made of all these excellent facilities whenever they are required. Using such facilities will ensure that the acute beds in Sligo General Hospital are occupied by people who need the full range of investigative and therapeutic services a hospital such as Sligo can give them.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I have asked before, and I do so again today, that approval be given for the establishment of an acute medical assessment unit in Sligo General Hospital. Such units have worked exceptionally well in other hospitals and have resulted in accident and emergency units in such hospitals not experiencing the overcrowding that exists elsewhere. There is no doubt that such units are a vital component in the smooth running of accident and emergency units. Sligo General Hospital submitted detailed planning of such a unit to the HSE some time ago. I have spoken to the T&aacute;naiste and Professor Drumm of the HSE about the urgent need for such a unit. I again ask that immediate approval be given for the establishment of such a unit in Sligo.</P>
    <P>The patients who attend accident and emergency in Sligo need and fully deserve an acute medical assessment unit immediately. Its establishment will result in a much better service for patients. The patients of the north west want this unit and I again ask the T&aacute;naiste to use her influence with the HSE to ensure this unit is established as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I refer briefly to Trolley Watch, as published by the INO. On 5 April last a record number of patients were recorded as being on trolleys in accident and emergency units &mdash; in excess of 360. Since then the figures nationally have shown a very welcome decrease to a low of 186 last Friday. While there was a slight rise yesterday, I note the figures for Sligo General Hospital have been among the lowest nationally and I say well done to all concerned. However, we need that acute medical assessment unit to keep up the high standards in the hospital. I fully support the T&aacute;naiste <Col N="726"/>in her work to date to deal with this very difficult problem. I support the motion.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; m&eacute; ag roinnt mo chuid ama leis na Teachta&iacute; Crowe, Gregory agus Finian McGrath.</P>
    <P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht mar is deis th&aacute;bhachtach d&uacute;inn &eacute; an sc&eacute;al pr&aacute;inneach seo a ini&uacute;chadh agus a phl&eacute;. Accident and emergency facilities are rarely out of the news and, unfortunately, it is all too often because they are so inadequate. We talk about the need for resources but, first and foremost, there is a need for more beds in our hospitals to deal with the demands created by accident and emergency units. The legacy of this Government and of previous ones comprising the same parties is multiple bed closures over the years. Despite all the talk, spin and the latest press releases and so on from the Government, the reality is that Ireland is below the European average in terms of acute beds. We have three acute beds per 1,000 of population whereas Germany has six acute beds per 1,000 &mdash; twice as many. We must face up to that reality.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste said that last year, more than 1.2 million people attended accident and emergency &mdash; an average of 3,300 per day. If we want people to go to their doctors, we must have more doctors. Ireland has 20 doctors per 10,000 of population while Germany has 36 doctors per 10,000. We all want more primary care.</P>
    <P>This is a question of resources and it will not be dealt with by a few short debates or press statements. The former Minister, Deputy Martin, told us not to blame him in that people were getting sick more. That is probably true but the Government must take responsibility for failing to prioritise preventative health care. The last time I looked, it comprised 1% of overall health spending. If that is still the case, it is a disgrace. Alcohol advertisements are still allowed and we do not have an alcohol control office. Accident and emergency is about an end-of-pipe approach to health and the Department must take on board the need for a more holistic approach.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The bottom line is that an unhealthy lifestyle is a consequence of poverty. The Government has widened the gap between the rich and poor. From 1997 onwards, the top 20% got 40% of the budget giveaways, while the bottom 20% got 5%. The top 20% received six times the share of wealth afforded to the bottom 20%, whereas in Denmark the top 20% received three times the share of the wealth afforded to the bottom 20%. A divided society creates an unhealthy society. That is the bottom line.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Many sods were turned over the years before the opening of Tallaght hospital, the hospital for the area I represent, and many politicians have visited the area in which it is located. It was supposed to be a flagship hospital, yet <Col N="727"/>there are more people lying on trolleys in its accident and emergency department than there are in most other hospitals in the country. At one stage there were three times more patients on trolleys there than in other hospitals. Many patients in the hospital must spend up to eight days on trolleys. One man who had a heart complaint said, on the basis of what he went through in the hospital, that he would rather die than go back into its accident and emergency department.</P>
    <P>The staff of the hospital should not be criticised because the T&aacute;naiste is responsible. Will she explain to its staff and patients, and to residents of Tallaght and its hinterland, why there are nearly three times more patients on trolleys there than in any other hospital in the State. She can no longer get away with the excuse that she is new in the job. Circumstances have become significantly worse since she took office more than a year ago. She needs to act on plans to deal with the bottleneck in the accident and emergency unit which is now overwhelming other sections of the hospital. The necessary funds exist but the political will is lacking. The T&aacute;naiste has made no positive impact on the crisis in Tallaght hospital and has failed in her role.</P>
    <P>Less than a month after my highlighting a case in which a man was eight days on a trolley, similar cases arose. This is unacceptable. We hear nightmare stories weekly and I dread to think what stories will have to be heard to get the Government to act.</P>
    <P>People should understand what is involved in waiting on a trolley in an accident and emergency department. I visited people in the accident and emergency department of Tallaght hospital and know of people who died in the hospital. What is happening dishonours the memory of the latter.</P>
    <P>All public representatives have a responsibility to address this matter and it demeans us all that this problem exists in one of the richest countries in the world. Quick action is needed. In this regard, the T&aacute;naiste should note that the answer does not involve prefabs outside Tallaght hospital. A proper unit is required and the site exists. Money and political will are the only elements that are lacking.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on this important debate on the crisis in the accident and emergency departments of our hospitals. After nine years in power, the Government, in spite of its having had substantial resources and finances at its disposal, has done nothing about the nightmare of patients on trolleys in our hospitals. To me, it is a crime, scandal and disgrace. I find it a bit rich to hear Government parties talking about tax cuts for the wealthy while people are lying on trolleys, children with disabilities cannot avail of a speech therapy service, there is a lack of beds in our hospitals and a lack of proper home care packages for the elderly, there are students at second level without <Col N="728"/>proper support services and there are many urgent needs to be met in society. I challenge the populist politics of Members of this House and must say straight out that health and education are much higher on my agenda than tax cuts. It is time for our politicians to hold their nerve, hold the line and demand investment in and reform of the health service. Let us put health ahead of greed and tax cuts.</P>
    <P>The Ministers and other politicians should note that we need more beds and they should put a stop to the nonsense and guff in the media to the effect that the problem can be solved by reforming the service alone. This is misleading and dishonest and is conning the public. The reality is that successive Governments have failed to provide the necessary infrastructural support required by vulnerable citizens. The health system is sick and we need investment and reform to make it better. I reject the new mantra that the elderly patients are somehow to blame and I urge all Deputies to stop using the term &ldquo;bed blocking&rdquo; in respect of them. They deserve the service they get and they also deserve respect and, above all, our support.</P>
    <P>The Independent Deputies in this House will stand by good practice in the health service and by patients and the citizens who pay their taxes for a quality health service. We have had too much old talk about accident and emergency services and we have had too much old guff and too many reports. We now want action. The solution comprises beds, investment and reform. If we provide for these, we will solve the problem.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste was probably correct about one matter, that is, that the accident and emergency crisis should be regarded as a national emergency. The problem is that the Progressive Democrats and Fianna F&aacute;il have now been in office for more than nine years during which time the accident and emergency crisis has festered. It has caused dreadful pain and suffering and, worse, it has caused deaths, especially of elderly people. It is only now, with an upcoming general election, that the crisis is being recognised for what it is &mdash; a national emergency and scandal.</P>
    <P>What is being done about the crisis and where are the emergency measures to deal with it? The Government seems to be bankrupt of ideas in responding to this national emergency. Perhaps the statement of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children was just another public relations ploy to give the impression of concern while she lacks the political will to take effective action.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s responses to the following practical questions. Why is there no consultant on the floor of accident and emergency units throughout the evening and night, thereby resulting in a backlog of patients who must wait until 6 a.m. for a consultant to make decisions. Why are x-rays, blood <Col N="729"/>tests, scans, etc. not available on a 24-hour basis? Why are persons under the influence of drugs and alcohol not diverted from accident and emergency units to a more appropriate location at weekends? Why do 411 elderly patients in the Mater, Beaumont and Blanchardstown hospitals still await the provision of beds in nursing homes, for which the Government will not provide funds? Why are the necessary, additional nursing staff not recruited? Why is the system becoming top-heavy with managerial and administrative staff?</P>
    <P>If the Government genuinely regarded the accident and emergency crisis as a national emergency, the aforementioned issues would be dealt with on an emergency basis. The Government is bankrupt of ideas on this issue and this leads to only one conclusion, that is, greed is uppermost in the minds and on the agenda of the Progressive Democrats members and their partners in government. Health is simply not accorded sufficient priority. This is the bottom line.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to deliver the deliver the world class health service the Taoiseach promised us in 2001. He made this commitment to the people and has reneged on it. The people will remember this at the next general election.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn"><NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the opportunity to speak on the problems with accident and emergency services. When the T&aacute;naiste outlined her ten-point plan last year, I stated it could not work throughout the country, particularly in the west. The majority of points in the plan were geared towards problems in hospitals in Dublin, yet the problem in accident and emergency units was and is countrywide. I am very conscious of this in County Mayo. Almost four weeks ago, there were 30 people on trolleys in Mayo General Hospital, which is the highest ever number recorded in that hospital.</P>
    <P>I listened very carefully to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s contribution. In outlining what has been achieved to date under her plan, she referred to the minor injuries unit. This is inapplicable to Mayo General Hospital in that it did not benefit from it. The T&aacute;naiste also referred to the MRI scanner for Beaumont Hospital. I am sure it is very welcome in that hospital but it does not help Mayo General Hospital. She referred to the acute medical assessment units but Mayo General Hospital has not benefited from these either.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned contract beds, which is a real bone of contention for me. No contract beds, either medium or long-term, have been allocated to County Mayo and Mayo General Hospital. Three times in recent weeks people were sent from Mayo General Hospital to beds in nursing homes, without budget, as an emergency response to the problem in the accident and emergency unit. I mentioned this problem to Professor Drumm at the meeting of the Oireachtas <Col N="730"/>Joint Committee on Health and Children and it needs to be addressed as a priority.</P>
    <P>Last year the T&aacute;naiste announced 500 home-care packages under the plan, of which five were allocated to Mayo General Hospital. The home-care package is an excellent scheme. How could this option be mentioned to an elderly person when only five are available in a county with 110,000 people, of whom 12% are over 65? In reality nobody is getting it and it is unfair to offer such an attractive option. In rural communities people are much more inclined to want to stay in their own home and community because very often nursing homes and hospitals necessitate travelling in excess of 50 miles across very bad roads. When I brought this issue to the attention of Professor Drumm I was delighted that he expressed horror and surprise at Mayo having got only five places. He reassured me that between 2,000 and 3,000 home-care packages will be announced and we will get a greater percentage of those in the west. I ask that the matter be dealt with as an absolute priority.</P>
    <P>The out-of-hours GP service operates only in the east of County Mayo, which means that people on the west side need to go to accident and emergency units at all hours of the day and night. The one positive aspect of the plan is the direct GP access to diagnostic equipment, which is working quite well in Mayo General Hospital and has ensured that many more people do not need to go to accident and emergency units.</P>
    <P>However, this is not just a Dublin problem. I do not always want to talk about Dublin versus the west. In reality we need a nationwide response. In this regard I congratulate Professor Drumm on a new initiative which could be successful in dealing with the accident and emergency problems. I refer to a new pilot scheme to apply to 15 accident and emergency units throughout the country, of which, I am pleased to say, Mayo General Hospital is one. For a change the HSE is now asking the local hospitals to give the solutions to the problem in their areas. It recognises for the first time that every area has different problems. It might be beds and capacity in one area and something completely different in another. Our hospital is seeking 20 contract beds, which is not an unrealistic request. We are seeking an increase in the home-care packages.</P>
    <P>One of the step-down facilities catering for elderly people in County Mayo is the Sacred Heart Hospital in Castlebar. In the past five years the capacity of that hospital has been reduced from 300 to 160. Phase 2 of Mayo General Hospital, which cost &euro;40 million &mdash; I signed the contract documents when I was chairperson of the Western Health Board &mdash; increased the capacity of the hospital by 100 beds. During the same time, a step-down facility has reduced its capacity by 140 beds, which is crazy. Part of the local scheme to address the problem in Mayo will be to increase the capacity of the Sacred Heart Hospital. Another aspect will be to carry out tests locally <Col N="731"/>that are currently being carried out in Galway. People are staying in beds for three or four nights when they only need to stay for one night. At the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, Professor Drumm accepted that this was a critical component in dealing with the accident and emergency problem.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the performance appraisal indicators. Last year my local hospital received a penalty of &euro;1.2 million based on the performance indicators adjudicated by the HSE, which deemed the hospital to be inefficient. I made the point that the hospital was not inefficient. It had a problem relating to the new orthopaedic unit which had been set up but was not operational. The indicators examined, the inpatient numbers in the hospital, gave an inaccurate reading for Mayo General Hospital and as a result we suffered this penalty of &euro;1.2 million. How can a hospital be expected to improve its efficiency when that level of penalty is levied against it? When the new performance appraisal indicators are determined by the HSE, it should consider all hospital activity, not just inpatient activity. It must also consider outpatient activity, particularly for the smaller hospitals. Otherwise these performance indicators will favour the bigger hospitals and the smaller hospitals will suffer as a result. This was certainly the case last year with hospitals such as those in Letterkenny, Sligo and Mayo, which all suffered on the basis of the performance appraisal that took place. That will not be acceptable in future.</P>
    <P>Between January and June last year, Mayo General Hospital had an average of between ten and 15 people on trolleys, reaching a high of 30 three and a half weeks ago and on occasions a low of absolutely nobody. Between June and December the average was between four and eight people on trolleys, which indicates a seasonal aspect to the problem. The accident and emergency unit in Mayo General Hospital has seen a year-on-year increase of 5% in the past three years. The number of people attending accident and emergency units in the county has increased substantially. While I was surprised this is not the case throughout the country, I believe that while the numbers of people attending accident and emergency units has declined, the number of admissions to hospitals has increased. We need to carefully consider this trend, which is obviously a direct result of the age profile of our population. In ten years&rsquo; time 16% of our people will be more than 65 and the problem will continue to increase. While we may see a further reduction in the numbers in hospitals, particularly if we improve the out-of-hours GP services, the number of admissions will be greater.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned about the mechanism for admitting a person through an accident and emergency unit. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children was informed that up to five different people could attend to a patient <Col N="732"/>presenting at an accident and emergency unit. The person deciding whether to admit a patient may ultimately be a junior doctor. In my county recently an elderly man, who had been admitted to hospital through the accident and emergency unit, was discharged from hospital at 2 a.m. and sent home in a taxi, which arrived at a rural part of the county at 4 a.m. He was readmitted the following day in an ambulance. What kind of decision is that? Surely a mechanism should exist to prevent an elderly person from being discharged after a certain time in the evening. This sad case in particular was outrageous.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Gregory talking about accident and emergency consultants at 6 a.m. Where are they? There are no accident and emergency consultants on duty at 6 a.m. In my county the service operates from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Today I asked my local hospital manager whether having an additional accident and emergency consultant would improve the situation. There is no point in recruiting an additional accident and emergency consultant if he will only work between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. We need 24-hour cover and not to have junior doctors making the decision to admit patients. It is ludicrous to have a chain of events whereby a person is admitted, seen by a nurse, a junior doctor and a consultant, who should make the decision, and finally a few hours later seen by another junior doctor who second-guesses what the consultant should have decided a number of hours previously. A junior doctor under that type of pressure will err on the side of caution and will admit rather than discharge. Many of the problems in our accident and emergency units arise as a direct result of that process.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about this matter. For the first time I believe there will be a regional focus to the problem. However, only time will tell. The pilot scheme has not yet started and I urge the Government to put the resources into the regions as well as into the city of Dublin.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the motion. Everybody has experience of the problems in accident and emergency departments, particularly the staff in those departments. Those staff are under tremendous pressure, are stressed out and overworked, and in most accident and emergency departments the staff have to work in very small spaces. In my county, Wexford, I meet the staff in accident and emergency departments on a regular basis. The union representative said the staff at Wexford General Hospital are totally stressed out by the amount of people who are coming to the accident and emergency department there. They are stressed because they have to rush here and there from one end of the day to the other. There are constant queues of people outside the door of the accident and emergency departments of Wexford General Hospital and most other hospitals in this country.</P><Col N="733"/>
    <P>I have spoken to patients who had to wait at accident and emergency departments for five, six or seven hours. I recently spoke to a lady whose son was injured in a hurling game. He went into the accident and emergency department at 4.30 p.m. on a Saturday evening and did not leave until 12.30 a.m. the next morning. That is totally unacceptable. Having waited from 4.30 p.m. to 12.30 a.m., he was told to go to Waterford Regional Hospital the next day. That is totally unworkable and totally unsatisfactory. No business would be run in such a manner. Accident and emergency departments should be run like businesses &mdash; they should be able to deal with people as quickly and efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper-Flynn spoke about the case of an elderly person from a rural part of her constituency who was discharged from a hospital at 2.30 a.m. I am familiar with a similar case in County Wexford not too long ago, when an elderly lady in her 80s who is blind and lives alone was dropped home in a taxi in the early hours of the morning. The taxi driver did not even get out of the car to open the woman&rsquo;s door. The woman got into bed when she got inside her house, but she fell out during the night and was readmitted to Wexford General Hospital the following day. She spent three or four weeks in Wexford General Hospital following that fall. It could be argued the woman was holding up the supply of a bed during that time. She should have been treated in the first place, rather than being sent home to a rural part of County Wexford alone. It is totally unacceptable that a person with a sight impairment was treated in such a manner.</P>
    <P>The accident and emergency department in Wexford General Hospital is very small. It has just six or eight beds, which is totally unsatisfactory. The patients are almost on top of each other. The small department fills up on a regular basis because it has to deal with many people each year. One of the major problems in County Wexford is that its population almost doubles in the summer months, from May to August or September, when many tourists come to the county. Children who are on holiday are brought straight to the local accident and emergency department when they get injured while playing. This is a major concern for the hospital manager in County Wexford over the summer months. It is great that we have accident and emergency consultants, but they are of no use if they only work between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Most of the work of accident and emergency departments is generated after 5 p.m., especially at weekends. Many people are admitted to such departments at weekends when injuries occur while people are playing sports like hurling and football. That can cause chronic problems for nurses and doctors. There are plans to build a new accident and emergency department at Wexford General Hospital. A Deputy referred earlier to a Minister visiting a constituency to turn the sod on a new development. It is great to see someone coming <Col N="734"/>to turn the sod, but there is not much use in turning the sod unless further action is taken. In this case, the accident and emergency department needs to be built.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about the fact that the CT scan machine in County Wexford is manned just five days a week, between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. The machine cost the Department very little because it funded just a small percentage of the cost. The larger percentage of the funding &mdash; up to 80% of it &mdash; was acquired by the people of County Wexford by means of fundraising. The people were led to understand the machine would be in operation seven days a week, 24 hours a day, but that has not happened. The Department has not lived up to the commitment it gave the people of Wexford six or seven years ago. It is totally unacceptable that the machine is not in operation other than between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. between Monday and Friday. The people of Wexford accepted in good faith the Department&rsquo;s commitment to ensure the machine would be in operation at all times.</P>
    <P>I would like to have a clearer understanding of an issue relating to trolleys. Perhaps the Minister or the Minister of State can confirm, when concluding this debate, whether patients on trolleys have to pay the full bills for hospital beds. One of my constituents who spent five nights in Wexford General Hospital, four nights on trolleys and one night in a bed, is due to go to court soon. I assure the House the man will go to jail before he pays the amount he has been charged. He did not enjoy the level of service or comfort he would have received if he had been in a bed. He has been charged the same amount he would have been charged if he had spent five nights in a bed. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, to clear up this matter. Do people have to pay to spend nights on trolleys? The number of people on trolleys at Wexford General Hospital is one of the highest of any of the hospitals outside our cities. Some 19 people were on trolleys at the hospital yesterday, 25 April, and I suppose it is more or less the same today. The number of people on trolleys at the hospital is usually one of the highest of any of the rural hospitals. I ask the Minister to address this matter as soon as possible because people are constantly being left on trolleys.</P>
    <P>Elective surgery is being cancelled on a regular basis as a consequence of the lack of beds at Wexford General Hospital. Many people have been telephoned at 7 a.m. on the day of their operations to be told they should not attend for surgery because there are no beds for them. It is totally unacceptable. Such people are being returned to waiting lists for two or three months. It is unfair on a person who has prepared for surgery, especially an elderly person, to get a telephone call from the hospital manager on the morning of the operation to say no bed is available and they will have to wait. I have raised this matter with consultants on a number of occasions, <Col N="735"/>to be told the hospital is full and no beds or trolleys are available for people who are due for elective surgery.</P>
    <P>I ask the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State to address the major issues in County Wexford and to ensure Wexford General Hospital receives the same slice of the cake as the other hospitals throughout the country. I have asked the T&aacute;naiste on numerous occasions to visit the hospital, to witness the chronic overcrowding there and to learn about exactly what is happening there. It is sad she has not yet found an opportunity to visit the hospital. I emphasise to her the importance of visiting Wexford General Hospital, where she can see what is happening at first hand.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this motion for a few minutes. I do not intend to suggest that all is well in accident and emergency departments. It is not the case that Government Deputies are expected to do so. I accept the points made by Deputy Cooper-Flynn. It is obvious that not all accident and emergency departments face the same demands. It is clear, therefore, that the same responses or solutions are not required. As a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children in recent months, I refute any allegation that the health service is being neglected by the T&aacute;naiste or the Government. I recognise that the T&aacute;naiste made a commitment, shortly after she became Minister for Health and Children, to attend a meeting of the joint committee every three months to deal with the issues which crop up on a daily basis, unfortunately, and to respond directly to them. The last meeting of the committee that the T&aacute;naiste and Professor Drumm attended was scheduled for an hour and a half, began at 9.30 a.m. and ended at some time close to 2 p.m. Obviously the longevity of a meeting is no indicator of the outcome. That suggests, however, that there has been no hidden agenda or attempt to run away from the facts. They were quite clearly outlined to members of the committee.</P>
    <P>Some accident and emergency units throughout the country work well and successfully. From memory I believe Kilkenny, Waterford and Limerick were in this category. On the other hand, some accident and emergency units have a very poor record. The most startling statistic to emerge that morning was the fact that often in some accident and emergency units a patient may be seen by up to five medical practitioners, and quite obviously this is something that must be attended to. Obviously, that is only part of the problem. Nevertheless, it shows there is no consistency throughout the service and, more importantly, people may be left waiting unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>Those who have the privilege of serving on the Joint Committee on Health and Children have the time to listen to the T&aacute;naiste give specific <Col N="736"/>details on the issue. A few minutes ago it was asserted that the greed of the Government meant it was ignoring the health service. Rather than waste the few minutes I have talking about the health spend, it is important for us to realise that health funding has gone from &euro;3.6 billion to &euro;12.6 billion.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>Rather than spending the few minutes I have talking about the financial statistics, it is important to note that there certainly has been no cutback by way of financial allocations. Neither have there been any cutbacks in the level of services. To be critical of the fact that the Government has neglected the health service does not take into account what has been done over the years.</P>
    <P>I heard criticism a few minutes ago of the various Ministers of the Department over the years. When one recalls the mid-1990s, there were very few capital programmes being disbursed throughout the main towns and counties. It is fair to suggest that much of the health endeavour in those years was aimed at putting hospitals in place in most of the main towns in every county. We now have state-of-the-art hospitals. In the Laois-Offaly and Longford-Westmeath area over recent years, three modern hospitals have been built in Portlaoise, Tullamore and Mullingar. I make those points not to be parochial or to say that we have three hospitals so what about the rest, but to show that while the reality is that the health policy has not worked in every region, it has worked in some.</P>
    <P>The points made a few minutes ago by Deputy Cooper-Flynn must be borne in mind as well. I do not believe for a minute that patients would be treated so shabbily in the midlands region. I certainly do not see or recognise any difficulty.</P>
    <P>I presented as a patient at my own accident and emergency department in Portlaoise shortly before Christmas, thankfully for a short time. Nevertheless, I saw the activity levels, the turnaround in patients and the level of patient care. More recently I had to call to the Mater Hospital on a private matter and was in the accident and emergency unit at 8 p.m. There I saw at first hand the enormous pressure on the nursing staff. When I asked whether it was normally like that, I was told it was very quiet at that time and that the real pressure would be felt at around midnight.</P>
    <P>Rather than indulge in general practitioner bashing, and I read the reports of the Irish Medical Organisation conference, it nevertheless must <Col N="739"/>be taken into account, as the T&aacute;naiste cited, that 75% of those who present at accident and emergency departments are discharged the same day. In other words, they do not require acute beds. An issue exists which needs to be dealt with by means of better services at primary care level. That is neither a cop out nor us neglecting our responsibilities in Government. The reality is that with a spiralling population and the enormous demands on the health service, a radical response is needed. I recognise the dramatic impact on the health service over the years wrought by changing population patterns.</P>
    <P>I also recognise, however, that this Administration and its predecessor went out of the way to try to regionalise services. It has not happened in some places. Where it has, there is very little difficulty with either trolleys or accident and emergency units. Obviously the level of services is being delivered in those regions where change has been accepted. I again refer to my area, the former Midland Health Board. The cancer service based at Tullamore, the orthopaedic service, etc. has lessened the strain on hospitals in the capital. As long as this policy continues, I believe we can get to where we want to go.</P>
    <P>It is important for Members to read the presentation Professor Drumm made some time ago to the Joint Committee on Health and Children in which he acknowledged the difficulties in accident and emergency departments. At the same time he recognised that some hospitals were working to a degree whereby there was no complaint. We must home in on that. The committee has invited people from the so-called successful hospitals to come before it to explain the procedures and processes involved which ensure that there are no complaints. On the other hand, we want to invite consultants and other staff from those hospitals which have not performed to the best hoped-for levels. Rather than penalise them by way of financial penalty, the Minister and the Department should identify initiatives that will recognise best practice and, most importantly, best outcomes. Until that time comes, there will be problems in certain hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Professor Drumm have come before the committee, listened to concerns and outlined their responses to the problems, specifically as regards accident and emergency departments and the rising numbers. I have heard it said that the Government is closing its eyes to criticism. It is fair to point out that the Joint Committee on Health and Children has the facility to pursue specific issues and look for policy change. That is where we will see the responses, whereby the HSE and the Minister come before the committee, respond to various criticisms and come back on a three-monthly basis to resolve or at least explain problems.</P>
    <P>I have always believed there is no quck-fix solution to problems in many accident and emergency units. Many of the problems are complex. <Col N="740"/>A wide variety of actions will be required to address them, whether through a combination of reform, resource management to improve efficiency in such a way that suits the individual hospitals concerned or whatever. It is important to suit the individual hospitals concerned. Obviously the demands on a rural general hospital will be different from those on an urban central hospital complex. Therein lies the solution. It is not enough to have solutions at the same level for every hospital in the country. There should be some means of assessing the efficiency of hospital facilities to see if the systems in place are successful and, if so, to work from there.</P>
    <P>I do not believe everything is as it should be. However, outlandish as it might sound, some years ago all the parties in the House came to recognise that the only way to sort out all the problems in the North was through a combined unified effort. If the Opposition believes we have a crisis on our hands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I should have made the point that I did not waste my time reading out the 25 enormous financial increases in health introduced by this Administration.

It is nonsense that, while people make a genuine effort to resolve the difficulties in the health service, as soon as an issue crops up somewhere, we spend the morning attacking the relevant Minister as if it was his or her doing. If we all believe in trying to sort out the problems in the health service, there should be a combined effort in support of the Government for a period of time rather than being critical of the huge advances that have been made in the past nine years.</P>

	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise a number of issues in the short time that is available and to support the amendment tabled by my colleague, Deputy McManus.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak about accident and emergency services in Tralee General Hospital. There is a perception that the accident and emergency crisis is confined to Dublin, but I assure the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, that we have a crisis in the accident and emergency unit in Tralee General Hospital. In November last year 40 GPs picketed Tralee General Hospital. That was <Col N="741"/>unprecedented for GPs. They were not looking for anything for themselves, they were trying to highlight the inadequacies and deficiencies in the hospital. They send their patients to the hospital to be looked after but &mdash; I regret to say this to Deputy Moloney &mdash; because of lack of funding their patients were not looked after as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We lost our accident and emergency consultant, Mr. Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Rourke, to another area because he was looking for a number of extra staff, including registrars, and they were not provided. A wonderful man has been lost to the health services in Tralee. The weekend before last the accident and emergency service in Tralee was extremely busy due to a number of accidents. Some of the people being treated did not even have the luxury of a trolley. They were standing up against the wall with IV drips in them. What is going on in the accident and emergency unit is unreal. The medical staff, porters, nurses, other staff and patients are under extreme stress because of the conditions there.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the T&aacute;naiste stated that when she was growing up if one got sick during the night the GP came to the house. I assure her that the problems in accident and emergency units are not due to GPs. I also remind her that we are living in a different world. We cannot expect GPs to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week if they are to provide a proper service and have lives of their own. We cannot expect GPs to take the blame for the problems in accident and emergency services.</P>
    <P>I speak from experience. I have been in the D&aacute;il for 14 years and the problems with hospital beds has become acute in the past three or four years. When I entered the D&aacute;il this was not an issue. I recently dealt with a case in which an elderly lady was to be discharged from hospital but she had nowhere to go as she had no immediate family. Her extended family pre-empted the fact that she would need to go into a nursing home and applied for a nursing home subvention. I raised this matter in the House previously. The Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, was in the House on that occasion, but I will outline it again because it shows that while funding will not solve all the crises in the health service it will solve some of them if it is targeted in the right place.</P>
    <P>The woman of whom I speak applied for the nursing home subvention on 30 November 2005. She was placed No. 467 on the waiting list. On 31 December she was No. 452 on the list and on 31 January 2006 she was No. 438. I rang this morning to find she is now No. 423. This woman does not have immediate family members but her extended family is helping out. She is currently in a nursing home. She could not remain in hospital as her needs were not of an acute nature. We should tackle this issue. Perhaps we could provide public beds in private nursing homes to allow some people who are in hospitals to go into nursing homes, or provide money for the nursing <Col N="742"/>home subvention. In that way, at least those patients who are in a position to be discharged to a nursing home can be discharged.</P>
    <P>Somebody in the Government will have to take responsibility for the health crisis. People will not accept farming it off to the HSE all the time. Funding is a political responsibility and the funding of nursing home care, extra hospital beds in community hospitals and accident and emergency registrars is vitally important. I do not accept that funding will not solve the health crisis. It will solve much of it. Plenty of money is available and the Government should stop passing the buck and deal with the issue now.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Moynihan-Cronin for sharing her time with me. I rise to support the amendment tabled today by my colleague, the Labour Party health spokesperson, Deputy McManus. I listened to Deputy Moloney, a Member for whom I have great respect, and if there was ever a statement of admission of the failure of the Government to deal with the health crisis it was the appeal that has just been made by him. What do we get after nine years of this Government, in the best of times with unprecedented revenues available to it? We get the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children announcing a national emergency in respect of accident and emergency services in hospitals. We also get a highly respected and experienced member of a Government party and a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children throwing up his hands in despair and calling on Members of the House to get together to solve the problem that the Government has failed to solve for the past nine years and asking the Opposition parties to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>When it comes to the crisis in accident and emergency services and other areas of the health service the Government is the problem, and that problem will not be solved until the Government gets out of the way and lets those of us who are prepared and able to deal with the problem resolve it.</P>
    <P>In regard to accident and emergency services, there is no solving of the problem without increasing the bed capacity in our hospitals. I will illustrate this by reference to the experience in my constituency. I hear many constituents complain that if they need to be sent to hospital they are dispatched directly into St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital. There was a time when they would have been sent to Loughlinstown or St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital, <Col N="743"/>the two local hospitals, but now they are only used as staging posts until the patients are transferred by ambulance to St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital.</P>
    <P>I have heard repeated complaints about the length of time people have to wait in accident and emergency departments even though it is acknowledged they receive very good care when they eventually get into a ward. St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital cannot cater for the hospital needs of an area of the south east of this country stretching from Ballsbridge to Rosslare. The solution to the accident and emergency problem and the hospital needs of the people of my constituency and of neighbouring constituencies in Wicklow and north Wexford will not be met until there is a serious investment in the two local hospitals in the constituency I represent, Loughlinstown hospital and St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire. No matter how many times it is called a major hospital, one hospital cannot physically be expected to cater for the needs of one of the fastest growing areas of population in the country. That problem is replicated many times throughout the country. It seems that the strategy is being pursued by stealth whereby accident and emergency services are being concentrated more and more in the large general hospitals.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin by paying tribute to the T&aacute;naiste. I have a vested interest in doing so because she is my party leader, but 15 months ago she took on what is generally described as the most difficult political job.</P>

   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

	<P>I doubt that very much. Her enthusiasm and commitment to the task remain undiminished. It is a tribute to the person she is that she relishes a challenge. She has the courage and the vision and most importantly she is honest in recognising that she does not have the magic wand to provide the solution. She also acknowledges that neither does any other party in the House. She has the vision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a magician we need but a Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the courage, and those are what are required to bring about reform. We will bore each other recounting the changes that have taken place since 1997 in terms of resourcing, which has increased from &euro;3 billion to &euro;12 billion and will probably be higher next year. The question of resources is a myth at this stage &mdash; there is no question mark about resources. I listened to Deputy Moynihan-Cronin&rsquo;s contribution, her reference to the needy and that it is a question of resources, but I disagree. We would have solved all the problems if that was the case. I do not deny that resources <Col N="744"/>need to be applied in different areas but that is a different matter to the reform that is required first of all.</P>
    <P>We have a duty as a Government and as a Parliament to get value for money for our taxpayers. It is only natural that we are looking at what has happened to those additional resources that have been ploughed into the health service in recent times. Professor Drumm has referred to the assumption that all the problems can be solved by more capacity, more resources and more money. I am sorry that Deputy Gilmore will not listen to my final point. The assumption presupposes that the system is not at fault, and the Opposition Members, not to mind the public, are fooling themselves if they do not think the system itself is at fault.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that Deputy Gilmore has come back to listen to more because I wanted him to hear that point in particular. If that were the case we would just need bigger and more. Deputy Twomey who is a doctor is more familiar than most of us with the service.</P>

	<P>It is not politicians, the Government, the Minister or the Department alone that can do this, it must be done in co-operation with the people who work in the sector. It is regrettable that time after time when the Government has tried to introduce initiatives which the IMO wanted, the Opposition has put obstacles in the way. For instance, with the GP visit card, which was initially welcomed by Fine Gael and was to be introduced in the budget, it took a year to finally get agreement on it.</P>

	<P>The IMO and the GPs in particular showed there was some issue in play other than patient care in their stand on that matter and that is regrettable. Thankfully the agreement is now in place.</P>
    <P>Some of us who are members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children attended the GP-IMO conference in Croke Park recently. A delegate castigated the Government for having introduced a system whereby those over 70 who had not previously held a medical card were now in possession of what is described as a golden medical card worth four times the amount to a GP. It has caused problems in the service. The GP in question wanted me to answer for it. I pointed out to him that this was not Government policy but it was a question of their union deciding that they would not deliver this service and that they would demand more money to provide that service. We all acknowledge the disruption that has been caused in the placing of GPs certainly in Dublin city &mdash; I am not sure about other parts of the country. My area is well enough served but I know there are large areas in north and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>They are lucky they are not in County Clare.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;west Dublin where there is no incentive for GPs to provide these services.</P>
    <P>I have been diverted from my point. I wish to underline the necessity and the importance of putting the patient back at the centre of care and at the centre of the service.</P>
    <P>I refer to the nine to five service operating in many hospitals. Medical care cannot be delivered on a nine to five basis and both Professor Drumm and the T&aacute;naiste are trying to change this. I acknowledge that anybody providing a service outside the normal hours should be properly recompensed and that is not a problem for anybody. It is a question of rostering. People in the health service must recognise that 24-hour rostering is essential because services cannot be closed down at 5 p.m.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The recent Tribal Secta Global Management report cited the request for an extra CT scanner in either Wexford or Galway &mdash; I am not sure which. The request was made because the existing CT scanner was not used after 5 p.m. This is nonsense. I know that CT scanners are very costly and, therefore, the country should be getting more than a nine to five service from these machines. As Professor Drumm stated to the committee, these are the things we must do. He <Col N="746"/>said we have paid for a service and we need to ensure it is delivered.</P>
    <P>I do not think the T&aacute;naiste thought it was going to be easy to deliver an improved health service. Deputy Moloney referred to the fact that she might have been grateful for a certain amount of help from Members of this Parliament. I acknowledge it is the job of the Opposition and of all of us to be representatives of the people and we must highlight problems when they exist. However, we should not make political causes out of all of them.</P>
    <P>We need to be careful of what we say this side of a general election because if we find ourselves on the other side subsequently, we will not automatically start decrying the health services&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>No fear of that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>

	<P>The patient experience we are most focusing on in the debate is that of accident and emergency. While it has been acknowledged by both the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and Professor Drumm that conditions in some accident and emergency departments are unacceptable, both for patients and for staff, the difficulties in accident and emergency are symptomatic of wider problems in the hospital sector which need reform. In particular, it is about blockages in the system.</P>
    <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>We all are aware of people who are not in a position to be discharged because they do not have either facilities in their homes or somebody to take care of them, and who occupy acute beds as a result. They must remain within the acute system because there is nowhere for them to go on leaving <Col N="747"/>it. That is not an efficient use of acute services. That is why many care packages have been put together in the recent budget by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children and this will be a good way of freeing up beds. The difficulty in accident and emergency is because there are so few beds to which people may move. We all know what the problems are and we must get rid of the difficulties that arise through these blockages.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
    <P>When Professor Drumm was before the Joint Committee on Health and Children, we heard about individual instances in certain hospitals, Kilkenny particularly, where practice is good. We need to have an individual responsible who will deliver the change and who will manage the services of the hospital in a more efficient way, and we must learn from best practice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Ferris, Catherine Murphy and James Breen.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley who is trying admirably to defend the indefensible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not find it indefensible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley is correct in saying that we need somebody who will manage the health service efficiently and it certainly is not the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. A year after coming into office and having said there is a crisis, she is now trying to address it and state all sorts of platitudes before the general election in the hope of getting back in to office again.</P>
    <P>If the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children had her way the health service would be privatised and hardly anything would be left except for the dregs to cater for the poorest of the poor. That is the way it is going. We need a state-of-the-art, publicly funded health service which is able to provide the capacity needed.</P>
    <P>My colleagues, Deputies Gormley and Sargent, have referred to the mess in the health service. In the short time available, I want to point to a number of examples. On 19 April last, a constituent of mine was brought into St. James&rsquo;s Hospital with severe triple vessel coronary disease. He was told he would be looked after but, because it happened to be the Easter period, he was discharged. He now must wait three to four weeks for an operation. He could be dead within that three to four weeks and if that is the case, it is the responsibility not only of the hospital but of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children and the Health Service Executive because ultimately it boils down to the resources being invested in the service. One can plan all one wants but it will not happen unless the resources are provided to back that up.</P>
    <P>There is scope for investing cleverly. The Green Party has constantly spoken of the need <Col N="748"/>for a three-tier health care system whereby one deals with the situation at local level first before going to accident and emergency. There are a number of well-run 24-hour private clinics. There are very few public ones. One could provide more public clinics where there would be a rostered general practitioner who is properly paid for his or her services, a registered general nurse and a certain basic modicum of facilities before a person would be sent to accident and emergency. At present, people still appear at accident and emergency units rather than go to their general practitioner. Others who go to general practitioners are still being told to go to accident and emergency. Surely there is a need for a middle tier where if somebody falls down when he or she is drunk and needs stitches, he or she can get them in a local 24-hour clinic.</P>
    <P>I have used the following example previously, although I am not sure whether I used it in this Chamber. Being a GAA and soccer enthusiast, I got a stud through my toe a couple of years ago. It caused a little bruising and swelled up and I ended up going into St. James&rsquo;s Hospital because it happened in the evening. I spent eight hours there. Eventually, I was seen by a nurse who took a paper clip, heated it under a Bunsen burner and stuck it into my toe providing instant, if painful, relief. Why must a person go to a major hospital to get a paper clip stuck through his or her toe? That sort of basic service could be provided locally. If we started planning a regional and community-wide network of local tertiary treatment centres in the first instance, it would save the taxpayer money and ease some of the pressure on the accident and emergency departments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>At her party conference at the weekend the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and her colleagues were fond of quoting figures to prove how beneficial they had been to the country over their years in Government. One set of statistics conspicuously absent from any of the self-congratulatory speeches was that found on the Irish Nurses Organisation&rsquo;s website showing the numbers of people each day on trolleys in the hospitals under the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s responsibility. This happens when we are living through a period of unprecedented wealth. Despite that wealth, there has been no improvement in the health service, especially in the past ten years. In fact, many would argue it has gone from bad to worse.</P>
    <P>Yesterday 331 patients spent the day, for many not the first, on trolleys because no beds were available. In my town of Tralee, in Kerry General Hospital there were ten people on trolleys. Whether this is coincidental, on 8 November last I was asked to leave this House because I raised the conditions in the accident and emergency unit in Kerry General Hospital. Nothing has been done in the succeeding six months to improve that situation. Last weekend 17 people, including four on the permanent casualty beds and others <Col N="749"/>sitting on chairs, awaited treatment in the accident and emergency unit in Tralee.</P>
    <P>When I was in Kerry General Hospital a few weeks ago one man with a broken leg had been there for about six hours waiting to get treatment. On another occasion when I was there, in November last, a 74 year old woman had spent the entire previous night and that day awaiting treatment in the corridor and some of that time she spent sitting on a chair. Such cases continue to arise. This is not the fault of the hospital staff, who are attempting to work under extreme and difficult conditions without proper staffing levels or facilities to cope with the demand.</P>
    <P>There is also the ongoing situation where cleaning is being inadequately performed owing to lack of staff and materials. I stated at the time Kerry was given a poor rating in the report on hospital hygiene that it was simply impossible for the staff to do a proper job and, in some cases, nurses were having to perform the work of cleaning staff.</P>
    <P>The seriousness of the situation cannot be emphasised enough. Everybody who has spoken during this debate has alluded to the fact that despite the massive resources that are supposedly going into the health service, it is inadequate and needs to be rectified.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I point out to Deputy Ferris that if a Deputy is asked to leave the House by anybody in the Chair, it is never for an issue raised but for being disorderly in the House. Nobody is ever asked to leave the House because of an issue that he or she raises. A Deputy is asked to leave the House because he or she is disorderly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>The accident and emergency trolley issue and hospital bugs are seen as the two major elements of the current emergency. They are very much a symptom of a wider problem, that is, the insufficient number of beds and support staff who should accompany those beds.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the trolley emergency must not be resolved at the expense of the postponement of elective surgery. One aspect I have come across repeatedly and recently is the sheer terror among those awaiting surgery, not just because of the surgery but because of their concern about the probability of their procedure being postponed. It is cruel for a patient to arrange their schedule and emotions around that surgery only for it to be postponed several times. There is a risk that in sorting out one problem, a range of other problems will be created. The same people could ultimately present as acute cases and this must be factored into the resolution of the accident and emergency department crisis.</P>
    <P>A total of 24 patients were on trolleys in Naas hospital yesterday while the numbers in Tallaght and Blanchardstown hospitals were 20 and 16, respectively, giving a total of 60 patients on trolleys in the catchment area that includes Kildare. <Col N="750"/>These hospitals cater for one of the fastest growing parts in the State but no planning has taken account of the expanding population in the region and we are experiencing the results of that. We are moving towards a system with a stronger primary care focus, which is the way to go. However, it is not a panacea and a planned response is needed. When people move into an area, new provision must be made.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste tabled a motion of confidence in herself, but if the whip was not imposed, my former colleagues on the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenches would table a motion of no confidence in her and her predecessor because of the mess they have made of the health service. Constituents of Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers are lying on trolleys waiting for beds. Six patients are on trolleys in Ennis General Hospital while 16 patients are waiting for beds in Limerick Regional Hospital. Later, the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers will, like sheep going to be slaughtered, vote with the Government, which has let down the State&rsquo;s health service.</P>
    <P>The accident and emergency department in Ennis hospital was so crowded a few weeks ago that patients were put in the reception area. I tabled a question to the Minister regarding whether there was a health and safety issue and she replied there was not. What would happen if a chair blocked an exit door to the Chamber and a fire broke out? Would it be a health and safety issue? What would the Minister say? There would be uproar, but poor patients are lying on trolleys blocking entry and exit doors to the hospital and that is not good enough. It is disgraceful that Government backbenchers and a few of my Independent colleagues will vote with the Government on this issue. The Ceann Comhairle is a lucky man he does not have to stand for election.</P>

	<P>I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for my sins, and recently, Professor Drumm, the chief executive of the HSE, addressed the committee. He stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">What needs to radically change are some of the outdated work practices which exist within our hospital systems, practices that do not serve our patients or staff and sometimes manifest themselves in people waiting an unacceptable length of time for diagnostics, outpatient appointments and both elective and emergency admissions. This is why we really have to ask ourselves why some hospitals are experiencing problems in their emergency departments and others are not.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">Let us look, for example, at the process that occurs in some emergency departments. When somebody arrives with a GP letter, they can have up to five contacts with medical personnel before coming to the end of the process and a decision is reached on whether to admit them, threat them or transfer them. A patient can see an experienced senior nurse who then refers him or her to a junior doctor and, possibly, a registrar within the emergency department. If the patient is attending during normal working hours, he or she may be seen by a consultant. If there is a decision to admit, a junior doctor will be brought down from the ward in the main hospital to again assess the patient and this is despite the fact that the decision to admit has already been made by an experienced consultant. The junior doctor will then consult with his or her registrar to reassess the patient prior to admission.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Such work practices are unacceptable in 2006. Professor Drumm further stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">Consultants highlight that they are on call and frequently attend for emergencies. This commitment is appreciated but is not sufficient to meet the needs of today&rsquo;s patients. For example, the majority of attendances at emer<Col N="752"/>gency departments take place between 5 p.m. and 1 a.m. We need emergency consultants and diagnostic personnel working during those hours when their expert decision making skills are most needed. We obviously have to be willing to pay for such a service from skilled professionals.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I agree with Professor Drumm in this regard. A hospital cannot have an accident and emergency department staffed by consultants between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and staffed by non-consultant junior doctors for the remaining time. As anyone who has worked in the medical profession in Dublin will know, such departments get busy between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. This is when experienced, trained consultants should be on duty.</P>
    <P>Professor Drumm stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">I appreciate that emergency department staff can experience frustration with hospitals systems that need to become more efficient, for example, when admitted patients often have to remain in hospital awaiting diagnostic tests, which sometimes cannot be provided for a number of days because of excess workloads for X-ray and other departments. We need to extend the length of time that these types of services are available and, as a result, reduce the length of time people need to spend in hospitals. If we continue to put up with unwieldy and outdated practices in the health system, where patients and staff must navigate through cumbersome hospital processes, and do not address the gaps in our community and primary care, it is certain that we will need more acute beds. If we change our present practices and follow all those advanced health systems around the world, it is likely that we will have sufficient acute beds for our present population but we will naturally have to plan to accommodate our growing and, more importantly, ageing population.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Professor Drumm has told us we do not have to provide more beds but we need to be more efficient with our use of them. This can be done by extending the hours consultants and senior staff are on duty and ensuring experienced and expert cover is available during the most appropriate hours. He continued:</P>
    <P LI="1">At present we have a shortage of publicly owned community long-stay beds. In addition, the spread of acute beds around the country may not be ideally balanced. The HSE is studying its overall bed requirements, particularly in light of growing numbers of acute beds being developed by the private sector and if a response is required, it will be based on patient need and evidence, not on inefficient processes.</P>
    <P FLI="0">In my constituency, a rapid access unit has been opened in St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital where general practitioners can arrange to have elderly patients seen within 24 hours. This is one of the models we should follow.</P><Col N="753"/>
    <P>I have been in practice for 35 years and my colleagues and I have never met the representatives of our local hospitals to discuss our mutual problems. We have never tried to arrive at a consensus on how to treat our patients expeditiously and with dignity. It is a communication problem again and I do not wish to blame any particular class for it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to make a brief contribution to this important issue. I have a report entitled Alcohol and Injuries in the Accident and Emergency Department: a national perspective. I am interested in this report and I note that alcohol has not been mentioned by a number of contributors. I am Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and we are examining the proposal to bring alcohol under the national drugs strategy.</P>
    <P>The report to which I referred confirms that alcohol injuries carry a significant burden for accident and emergency services in acute hospitals in Ireland in terms of increased numbers in attendance, the range of presenting injuries and the high level of repeat visits. It also states that there is an increased risk for staff working in the accident and emergency departments due to the level of intoxication among patients, which has significant health and safety implications. A quarter of all those who arrive in accident and emergency departments present with an alcohol related injury, while others delay attending hospital so that the blood-alcohol levels can drop. Therefore, the figures in the report may be an under-estimation. We cannot afford to ignore the alcohol issue much longer.</P>
    <P>Is the Government examining the experience in the UK with the alcohol bus? People are being picked up by the bus and if they only have a minor problem, they can be driven home rather than presenting at an accident and emergency department at the peak time of 3 a.m. on weekends. We must impose imaginative solutions like that and we should look at what other countries are doing.</P>
    <P>The role of the GP is very important. There are more co-operatives working at that time of the evenings where people may not have access to patient records. As the GP is unsure and is liable to litigation, the person is referred to an accident and emergency department. I believe that there should be more support at primary care level. People could be x-rayed in the local primary care centre and we have excellent examples of those in Donegal. These centres could have their services strengthened and that may take the burden off the main hospital such as the one in Letterkenny. I hope the T&aacute;naiste expedites the proposal on the Letterkenny accident and emergency department which is at the planning stage and which will add 70 beds to the accident and emergency department there.</P><Col N="754"/>
    <P>The overall bed problem has been eased by the new 11-bed oncology unit, but I feel a manager should be put in place as soon as possible. Management is a very important issue for the efficient use of the hospital and the manager&rsquo;s post has already been advertised. Intervention should occur to ensure that we have a full multidisciplinary cancer team with a permanent consultant and radiotherapy as well as the expediting of the BreastCheck programme. Prevention is ultimately better than cure.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to say a few words on this issue. I recently received a phone call from a lady in Navan who went to the casualty department in the hospital in Drogheda. She entered the department at 7 p.m. with severe pains in her stomach and back. She was only seen briefly at midnight and it was 4.15 a.m. before she was properly examined. During her nine-hour wait, she watched a child vomit on the floor in the casualty department, yet it was three hours before that was cleaned up. Someone cleaned the room at midnight and took three and a half black refuse sacks of rubbish out of the accident and emergency department. We are trying to prevent MRSA and other bugs in our accident and emergency departments, yet these departments are covered in filth. All that is needed is for one person to be put in charge of each accident and emergency department. A similar level of responsibility should occur on the wards.</P>
    <P>During this lady&rsquo;s wait in the accident and emergency department, an ambulance arrived with a patient and had to wait for two hours before its trolley could be returned and it could leave again. The driver could not leave because the accident and emergency department in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital needed the trolley.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago, the T&aacute;naiste declared the accident and emergency unit situation to be an emergency, but it has been one for years. It is too late to be putting our hands up and wondering what to do about it. People on the Government side of the House will speak of the causes of this and how it cannot be fixed, while we will speak about why it can be fixed. However, if there is real political will in this House, we can make changes quickly. The smoking ban is a great example of this and it was carried out by the Department of Health and Children. It was done because it sounded good, but it was political will that delivered on that. As a young politician, that proved to me that we can do things in this House when we really want to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be told that it was the consultant&rsquo;s, the health board&rsquo;s or someone else&rsquo;s fault, because the buck stops with the Minister of Health and Children. I do not blame this Government alone, but we have been told for ten years that things are going to get better. We have had money and time to make changes in the past ten years, but we have not done so. We have had <Col N="755"/>major problems, yet the buck has been passed to someone else.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste told the House today that certain things that will be done could not have been done under the old health board system. That is nonsense because the HSE is just the health boards with another layer on top. Nothing has changed because most of the same people are still employed. We did not have to wait for the advent of the HSE to make changes. We could have had changes a long time ago, but we did not make them.</P>
    <P>The main problems with accident and emergency departments are quite simple. We need more beds, more staff and more resources. Day after day, the Taoiseach tells us that the problems in accident and emergency departments have nothing to do with resources, but that is not the case. Accident and emergency cover in my hospital was supposed to close down last November owing solely to a lack of resources. We were short of surgical staff owing to a lack of &euro;100,000. That was a resource issue and while it has not been fully solved, we are getting there.</P>
    <P>The problem was due to a shortage of money, which is a problem across the north east. We are about &euro;60 million short per head of the population in the past five or six years. We are not getting the health service we need for the area. The accident and emergency department in my local hospital in Navan is a portakabin with about six trolleys. The hospital needs a purpose-built accident and emergency department. How can staff be expected to deliver a service to at least 20,000 clients per year? The accident and emergency unit has occupied a portakabin for a long time, yet the population it serves has trebled to 200,000.</P>
    <P>Last March, the T&aacute;naiste had the cheek to claim that the accident and emergency unit at Navan hospital was upgraded. It was painted and its chairs were rearranged but that is not an upgrade. We must have proper purpose-built accident and emergency units. A population of 200,000 needs an adequate building and sufficient staff. The surgical team in Navan hospital has one and a half surgeons, whereas most surgical teams have at least three. The team has been criticised for not performing well and reports point out problems in the hospital which arose from the underfunding of staff and resources.</P>
    <P>I could continue for ages to discuss problems in primary care, home help services and public health nursing. Public health nurses can no longer do their jobs because there are not enough to cover the growing population. Deputy McManus noted that community care beds in County Meath have been reduced by 25, whereas the population has increased by 40%. We are not being looked after and there is no point in the T&aacute;naiste expressing surprise that there is an emergency.</P>

	<P>We are here to solve the Minister of State&rsquo;s problems with the health system. There is no point in holding discussions without results.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State claimed that there is a tendency among some commentators to highlight the perceived flaws in the health system. I can assure him that the commentators&rsquo; perception is real but his is a fantasy. I acknowledge the excellent work carried out by medical and nursing staff in our hospitals, not least in under-resourced hospitals such as Ennis General Hospital. One crisis leads to another and I am reminded of how the Government first attempted to deny the rip-off culture that exists in many parts of the economy before acknowledging the reality of that matter. I only hope that the Government will do a similar U-turn on accident and emergency services.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister of State to visit Ennis General Hospital and to see at first hand the crisis that faces every hospital in the country. When it comes to the Hanly report, Ennis is similar to many other hospitals in being on the wrong side of the track. Hardly a day passes in which I do not hear complaints about the hospital&rsquo;s services and resources, appalling waiting conditions or patients lying on trolleys. The medical staff are beyond reproach for operating in such conditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Breen raised the issue of the locked reception area doors. More recently, I learned of an elderly man with a heart condition who went to Limerick for tests and, upon his return, discovered that his bed was occupied. He had to stand for more than three hours because no chairs were available. Today, 119 patients are occupying this 88-bed hospital, including six on trolleys and many more in day wards. That does not describe the discomfort, misery and loss of dignity suffered by patients who present for care. The waiting room is cramped and people are often forced to stand for hours due to the lack of seats. Despite these issues, we are told there is no crisis.</P>
    <P>I received a complaint this morning about a woman who presented to the hospital with a nose bleed. She was from west County Clare and had travelled 40 miles to Ennis, yet after waiting several hours, she was told to go to Limerick Regional Hospital. People in west County Clare have to drive more than 50 miles to Limerick and that in itself compounds the problem. Recently I <Col N="757"/>spoke with a constituent from west County Clare who said he would be better off ringing the undertaker than making that journey.</P>
    <P>Women of a certain generation have worked in tough times to build this State. Last week, we celebrated the 90th anniversary of the Easter Rising. We should look again at the ideals of the Rising and pay heed to its basic values. The people of County Clare and, in particular, those in the west whose journeys to Limerick Regional Hospital take longer than the golden hour, will not accept the downgrading of Ennis General Hospital. Over the past ten years, &euro;20 million has been promised but, aside from a portakabin on the front lawn, not a penny has been spent in upgrading the hospital. The hospital does not even have a CT scan facility.</P>
    <P>The recent report of the Nenagh Hospital Action Committee stated that small facilities provide better services. The cost per day to treat a patient in Nenagh is &euro;711, whereas it costs &euro;953 in Limerick Regional Hospital and &euro;1,153 in Beaumont. A similar cost efficiency system applies to Ennis. I appeal to the Minister of State to make the development plan work for Ennis General Hospital and to free up accident and emergency units because if he does not, he will be forgotten at the polling booth in the next general election.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody is happy with a situation in which people, whether old, young or middle aged, have to spend a few hours on hospital trolleys, let alone the 24 to 48 hours reported by hospitals. Constituents have contacted me regarding elderly parents who had to occupy trolleys for 24 hours. That is not acceptable. Complaints are also made that doctors do not attend to patients and that consultants are unavailable. That is hard to believe because accident and emergency units seem to have plenty of staff. It leads one to wonder whether a plan of action is in place for treating patients.</P>
    <P>When the accident and emergency unit in my constituency in Mayo is under pressure and no beds are available, patients who are capable of being discharged cannot be sent to private nursing homes with plenty of beds which could be used as step-down facilities until the patients are ready to return home. People in County Mayo are not allowed to stay in private nursing homes unless their families pay for them. However, patients discharged from hospitals in neighbouring counties can stay in private nursing homes. If this was the case across the board, the pressure would be alleviated because much needed beds would be freed. It is wrong that such a situation obtains in one county but not in another.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the HSE has undertaken to identify where problems lie and to focus on solutions which will have the maximum impact in the shortest possible time. I welcome the proposal in the ten-point accident and emergency action plan for the development and expansion of minor injury <Col N="758"/>units and chest pain and respiratory clinics, but while these have been put in place in some hospitals, they should be universal. I also welcome the provision of a second MRI scanner in Beaumont Hospital as there is an urgent need for this service and the waiting period is always lengthy. I hope that an MRI scanner will also be provided for Mayo hospital in the future.</P>
    <P>Additional home care packages are needed but, in addition to providing them in urban areas, these services should be available to people living in isolated rural areas. A proper service provided in a familiar environment would greatly benefit patients and would save the State a lot of money. Elderly people are entitled to such a service. However, the home care service in County Mayo is virtually non-existent. The HSE should consider investing money in this useful service.</P>
    <P>Mayo General Hospital is a top class facility and millions of euro have been spent on a new building and services, which is great for the county. Staff in all sections do a tremendous job. Although shortcomings exist, the public could receive a better level of service if management, consultants, doctors and nurses co-operated to bring order to accident and emergency departments. Too much nursing time is taken up on administrative duties.</P>
    <P>Westdoc provides a good out-of-hours service for patients in my area. Within the next few months it will improve dramatically once the new first class treatment centre is opened in Knock and a proper work environment is established for nurses and doctors. The service should end the practice in which patients must present to accident and emergency units in Mayo General Hospital. The centre will act as a base from which patients in the immediate vicinity will be treated and from where the doctor will be driven by the Westdoc driver to satellite centres and to patients&rsquo; homes as required. The ambulance service, also to be based in Knock, will ensure a joined up emergency service for people in my constituency.</P>
    <P>Westdoc has seen 180,000 patients in its three years of service. Some 30% of patients surveyed would have attended an accident and emergency department had that service not been there. It is a worthy service and more should be made of it throughout the country. In Westdoc the average time from making a call to seeing a doctor is 40 minutes, alleviating the need for patients to go to an accident and emergency department. I ask that community diagnostic facilities such as x-ray and ultrasound be provided as this would also reduce the need for people to go to hospital. A young person injured on a football field could have an x-ray at such a service, which could be sent, using new technology, to a hospital where doctors could decide if there was a broken bone. It would save the person having to spend hours at an accident and emergency department. All this should provide a better service for the people.</P><Col N="759"/>
    <P>Some time ago I outlined, during Private Members&rsquo; time, the situation at the Sacred Heart Home in Castlebar where 12 beds are closed in St. Patrick&rsquo;s unit due to subsidence of floors and walls. I also brought the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, to see the situation. I regret that nothing has yet been done to repair the section. Seeing the difference 12 extra beds would make in Mayo, I call on the HSE to provide the funds to remedy this. In Mayo we also need extra bed care for the elderly. As I said, people are in hospitals who have nowhere else to go. A site has been purchased in Ballinrobe and we urgently want a community hospital to be built there to service that part of the county. It is past time this should be done especially since the site has been provided and the money made available. The Department has told me that it is up to the HSE to put the capital funding in place and I urge the Minister to appeal to the HSE, as I have done in the past, to put this in place and to provide this service for the people of Mayo.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to give two minutes of my time to Deputy Healy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. I have raised the issue of Kerry General Hospital in this House on numerous occasions over the past three or four years but with little success. What has been said by Kerry doctors and representatives must have fallen on deaf ears because the situation there has deteriorated. When the hospital was opened in 1984 it had a throughput of 13,500 patients. Now it has a throughput of over 30,000, approximately 100 per day. The staffing level has increased to some extent but the senior medical staff has not increased apart from the appointment of senior house doctors. Kerry General Hospital has five senior house officers, SHOs, but no registrars and only a temporary consultant.</P>
    <P>In 2003 a full-time accident and emergency consultant was appointed to Kerry General Hospital for the first time. In neighbouring County Cork, which has a little over double the population of Kerry, there are five accident and emergency consultants. The one consultant at Kerry General Hospital has left. Although he indicated over a year ago to the HSE that he was leaving, no full-time replacement has been appointed. There is a temporary locum there until May and after that a person will be appointed for six months. That is no way to treat the people of Kerry. The equivalent of approximately 28 nurses look after the accident and emergency department in Kerry. Just four of those are available after 5 p.m. and with no increase for the summer months, when the population of Kerry will more than double, those four nurses will look after an increasing number of patients, including an increasing number of night-time patients.</P><Col N="760"/>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister of State appear to have no function in accident and emergency. They have washed their hands of it. It is disingenuous to blame the doctors, who must also live. An impression is being created through a deliberate campaign that doctors are expected to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which not even politicians do. There are people on this side of the House called &ldquo;shinners&rdquo; but the &ldquo;spinners&rdquo; are on the other side of the House. There is a deliberate campaign against the doctors of this country and it is unfair. After 5 p.m. there is only one senior house doctor in Kerry General Hospital and that doctor may have to make serious decisions. It is only a matter of time before something serious happens and when it does, who will be liable? I have warned the Minister. What has happened in Kerry is a disgrace. I am echoing what other speakers are saying. What is happening in accident and emergency departments is a disgrace and the Government is abdicating responsibility for it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for sharing his time with me. As somebody who has worked at the coalface of the health services for 20 years I was angered by some of today&rsquo;s contributions, particularly that of the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, who blamed everybody &mdash; doctors, nurses, support staff, paramedics, clerical staff &mdash; for the mess the health service is in. The majority, if not all, health service workers go beyond the call of duty on a daily basis throughout the year and without the goodwill of those staff we would be in a worse situation than we are today. Although the Minister said it was not a question of resources it is time to call a spade a spade.</P>
    <P>The crisis in the health service is the responsibility of this Government and the first Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government, which took 2,000 beds out of the system in the mid-1980s to late 1980s. That decision, which we in the health service fought, was the beginning of the crisis in the health service. There is no doubt that the pressure on accident and emergency services began with the withdrawal of those beds and it is important that they are returned to the system immediately. We lost 50 beds in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital in south Tipperary and that created a serious problem there.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago, I was a member of a hospital executive committee that recommended that an acute medical unit be put in place in south Tipperary and that it should be copied throughout the country. Ten years later, there is no unit. We hear talk about such units, but ten years later is too late. Those services should have been put in place long ago.</P>

I have no doubt that the vast majority of doctors will be happy to work towards improving health care services.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows but he does not want to listen to what anyone else knows. The point I want to make is that the number of beds in public acute hospitals has increased by 1,528 since 1997. There was no reduction.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste outlined to the House this morning the wide range of actions which are being taken to address the problems associated with accident and emergency services. This issue will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s priority attention until the problems have been resolved. We will continue to work with the Health Service Executive to tackle the problems that are occurring in some accident and emergency departments through a combination of reform and investment tailored to each individual hospital. Additional resources are being provided, reform is happening, targets are being set and incentives are being put in place.</P>
    <P>While many of the country&rsquo;s accident and emergency departments operate very effectively, we recognise that the difficulties experienced in some accident and emergency departments cause <Col N="762"/>distress for patients and their families as well as for the staff working there. There are 53 acute public hospitals, 35 of which have accident and emergency departments. The majority of those departments do not have difficulties and the difficulties that exist in a minority of departments are a cause of concern to the Government. We have put in place a number of measures to try to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>Accident and emergency departments are not stand-alone services. They are a critical part of a complex health care system. Their ability to function efficiently and effectively is heavily dependent on maximising the use of the beds and facilities in each hospital, well functioning practices and processes within acute hospitals and the availability of integrated primary and community services. The HSE is focusing on reforming the health system to ensure that the right care is delivered in the right place by the right people at the right time.</P>
    <P>Every day approximately 3,300 patients attend accident and emergency departments. On average approximately 25% will require admission to an acute hospital bed. In some accident and emergency departments, these patients will wait for a number of hours, sometimes overnight, to be admitted. This situation is not confined to this country. Such difficulties are being experienced at present by many modern health services in other parts of the world. However, such delays are unacceptable to the Government. There has been much discussion on how to address the difficulties that arise from the delays and the fundamental issues that are causing them to occur in the first place.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste has outlined the many benefits that have accrued and continue to accrue to patients through the measures implemented under the accident and emergency action plan. It is accepted that there is a need to focus on building on the achievements of the plan. The HSE has developed a framework for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of accident and emergency departments that has three key strands, reducing and diverting accident and emergency attendances and admissions, reducing delayed discharges and improving efficiency and throughput across the whole hospital, not just in accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>The HSE is focusing on those hospitals that are seen to be experiencing difficulties in the provision of accident and emergency services and has set individual hospital performance targets to be achieved, maintained and, in due course, surpassed. The short-term priority objectives are that no patient is to wait for longer than 24 hours before being admitted to an acute bed, no accident and emergency department is to have more than ten patients awaiting admission and the privacy and dignity of patients awaiting admission is to be preserved. The long-term objective is to ensure that no patient will wait longer than six <Col N="763"/>hours to be admitted after the clinical decision to admit has been made.</P>
    <P>To assist the identified hospitals to achieve their targets, the HSE has established a dedicated accident and emergency task force. This force will oversee the implementation of the HSE framework and will work closely with the hospitals to establish clear targets for performance improvement and develop tailored solutions aimed at delivering sustained improvement in accident and emergency services. Not all hospitals have problems with accident and emergency services and where hospitals have problems they do not always arise from the same source. The task force will assist each hospital to identify the particular challenges it faces in the delivery of its services and to identify the potential solutions appropriate to their particular circumstances. It will work with the hospitals to introduce a system of &ldquo;whole hospital&rdquo; performance measures to improve the patient&rsquo;s journey not alone through the accident and emergency department but through the entire hospital system from admission to discharge.</P>
    <P>In the immediate term the HSE is facilitating the freeing up of acute hospital beds by making more appropriate facilities available for those patients whose discharge from hospital is being delayed because they cannot, for a variety of reasons, return to their homes. The acute beds being vacated by these patients will be ring-fenced for use by patients who are waiting in accident and emergency departments to be admitted. The HSE is also fast-tracking the introduction of admission beds and other facilities to allow patients to await admission in comfortable surroundings outside the busy accident and emergency environment to ensure their privacy and dignity is preserved. These facilities will also enable the work of the accident and emergency department to flow more freely and the department to operate more effectively.</P>
    <P>The achievement of improvements in accident and emergency services is dependent on fundamental changes in hospitals and in other areas of the health service. It requires improvements in the processes and procedures in hospitals to ensure that they operate in the most efficient and effective way, the introduction of rigorous admission and discharge planning processes, the broadening of access to diagnostic facilities and the enhancement and development of primary and community care services. We must ensure that all the existing beds and facilities in acute hospitals are being utilised fully and appropriately by ensuring that beds are occupied only by those who require acute care. We must also ensure that essential diagnostic facilities are available when required, not just during normal office hours. We need to better integrate primary and community care services to allow people to be treated, where <Col N="764"/>appropriate, outside the acute hospital system and to put in place the necessary supports to avoid unnecessary hospital admission.</P>
    <P>There is no single, simple solution in dealing with problems in accident and emergency. For example, on one day in March there were 411 patients in Dublin hospitals who had been medically discharged but were still occupying beds. We have put in place measures in a number of areas in an attempt to provide step-down facilities so that patients are not occupying beds after being discharged. The increase in the provision of home care packages will assist greatly in that regard. Last year there were 1,100 home care packages and this figure will increase by an extra 2,000 before the year is out.</P>
    <P>Deputy English referred to the experience of a constituent of his. The case he outlined is not one of which we can be proud and it cannot be tolerated. However, to improve the delivery of services in accident and emergency departments we have assigned to each hospital a chief executive officer or other named person whose responsibility it is to deliver an improvement in accident and emergency services.</P>
    <P>A few years ago the health service was judged on the length of time it took people to have an operation, whether they spent six, 12 or 24 months on a waiting list. We established the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which has dealt with that very effectively. Now the health service is judged purely on how accident and emergency services work.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>I have had the pleasure of visiting hospitals around the country, and one that I have visited several times is St. Luke&rsquo;s in Kilkenny, where staff have provided their own medical assessment unit and work very closely with local GPs. They would admit that they do not have the best facilities in the country. It is not all about resources but about teamwork and introducing modern practices to meet challenges that exist today but were unheard of before. While it is very important to have an efficient and effective admissions policy, that on discharges is equally important. We must learn from best practice and what has worked well. Managers of hospitals throughout the country should consider St. Luke&rsquo;s in Kilkenny and see if they can imitate what it has done very successfully.</P>
    <P>We acknowledge that there are difficulties in accident and emergency departments, and many of those who have had a family member waiting on a trolley will realise the difficulties and embarrassment caused to them, patients and staff. However, we have put in place several measures to address the situation, which receives top priority.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution. I compliment Deputy Gilmore on his initiative regarding the Bill. I know he does not like me to acknowledge that we have known each other for a long time. We were colleagues on the old Dublin County Council and I have always been impressed by his work.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister does not support the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore did us a service by initiating this discussion.</P>
    <P>I said to the Minister, Deputy Roche, last night that none of us, particularly Deputies on the Government benches, should claim there is no problem. In fairness to the Minister and Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, they outlined the action being taken to deal with the issues that arise.</P>
    <P>I checked with my office this morning and noted that, in spite of my local authority doing its best, families are still asking why mail is still being posted to their parents who are dead and why the register is not amended. It worries us all that, 400 days before the next general election, the registers, not only those in the Dublin region but those throughout the country clearly present a challenge.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in what the Chief Whip, Deputy Kitt, said last night on his responsibilities in respect of the Central Statistics Office. He stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">I have opened discussions with the CSO about the possibility of census enumerators helping to carry out the vital role of ensuring that the register is maintained and updated on <Col N="770"/>a consistent and continual basis. The personnel in question are well placed to provide a service to the voter and potential voter in this regard. I do not ignore or undervalue the vital role played by the local authorities in this area. I do not intend to rule them out of the process [at all].</P>
    <P FLI="0" Just="Left">There are problems with the register. Colleagues have referred to various problems regarding accommodation units, which problems I have articulated on other occasions. Those who know I represent Dublin South-West with my Tallaght-based colleague, Deputy Crowe, will know I have often commented on recent developments regarding apartment complexes, most of which are locked to the public. Issues arise in this regard, in addition to certain security considerations which must be respected. However, while I will not cry about political activists not being able to gain access to apartments, I draw attention to the serious problem this poses for council officials and those who want to correct the register. Local authorities &mdash; I will not spare South Dublin County Council in this regard &mdash; have a clear responsibility to ensure adequate communication and to remind people of their responsibility to ensure they are included on the register. When I was entitled to vote for the first time I was very enthusiastic about being included on it and ensuring I had my vote. I hope I was no different from anybody else in this regard.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputies referred to the possibility of using different systems. I went to the bother of determining that there are fundamental differences between how the system operates here and in Northern Ireland. I am told the register in Northern Ireland is not the responsibility of individual local authorities, but of a dedicated organisation, the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland, which has a chief electoral officer in headquarters based in Belfast and nine area electoral offices located strategically across Northern Ireland. I am told the organisation employs approximately 40 permanent staff and also uses a much larger number of temporary staff during the annual canvass for electoral registration and during elections. The administration costs are funded by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland through the Northern Ireland Office. Each person eligible to register is obliged by law to do so. The agency then prepares and publishes the register annually and makes changes to the register monthly outside the period of the annual canvass. This process is known as a rolling register.</P>
    <P>We all accept there are difficulties with the register and that we all must take responsibility to ensure the register is right. Other colleagues have listed all sorts of problems and possible abuses that may have taken place over the years. I was glad to hear the Minister express an open view on these issues last night. We should be open to change. I suspect the Minister is correct <Col N="771"/>in saying that change would be particularly difficult with only a year to the next general election.</P>
    <P>I am sure that my county is no worse than elsewhere. However, any cursory look at the register shows difficulties. People are registered who should not be registered. Some people who have gone to their rest remain registered. People who should be registered are not registered. In my constituency, as no doubt throughout the country, new housing developments take place and people move in and back out again just as quickly. It seems to take forever to sort out the register. It is important that we are having this debate. The Minister has responsibility to listen to what has been said and should take action in respect of issues that can be addressed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. Like Deputy O&rsquo;Connor, I thank Deputy Gilmore for introducing the Bill. I agree with the principle but disagree with the commissioner aspect. As I was a first-time candidate when elected in 1997, I can be far more direct than Deputy O&rsquo;Connor was. The registers are a disgrace and an outrage. They are inaccurate and would not be tolerated by any organisation that was serious about what goes on. I have no objection to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which has a role in overseeing elections, and perhaps the local authorities overseeing election procedures on polling day. I am quite convinced that the local authorities should have no role in gathering the names on the electoral register. Local authorities have had the job and failed miserably. They have no interest in the task whatever.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Five weeks ago officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts. I asked for their view on the inaccuracies on the electoral register, estimated at somewhere from 300,000 to 600,000, and what they were doing about it. As quick as lightning, the official produced a report from under the desk and he said that a report done 30 years ago estimated that the register had approximately 200,000 errors. His justification was that this is a long-standing traditional problem in Ireland. That is proof positive that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and its local agents, the local authorities, are fully aware of the issue but have no interest or inclination to do anything about it. They should not be allowed near the task ever again.</P>
    <P>Since I was first elected I have urged every Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give the job of collecting the information to an organisation like An Post. Postal delivery people call to most houses every day and know who are in those houses. I do not mind if the database is retained through the local government function, which has a role in administering elections through the Department of the <Col N="772"/>Environment, Heritage and Local Government. However, local authorities should have nothing to do with collecting the information.</P>
    <P>Over the years I have come across several incidences where in particular district electoral divisions a person was given the job of checking the electoral register, which resulted in phenomenal changes. This might happen in one DED in a constituency every two years. When somebody goes to the effort, the tremendous results can be seen. I do not believe the local authorities should be doing this work. It would be a retrograde step for the D&aacute;il to ask the local authorities to redouble their efforts, make new proposals or provide extra funding. As they have had all the chances in the world and have failed, this responsibility should be taken from them.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government work on this matter on an all-party basis. Details of the running of elections affect the basic elements of democracy and it should not be done on a unilateral basis by a Government or Private Members&rsquo; Bill. It must come through all-party consensus. Without consensus, we would have the same difficulties we had with electronic voting and it would not be viable. Even if it had the support of the majority in the House, I would not be happy pushing through the Labour Party&rsquo;s preferred solution. It must be done by consensus.</P>
    <P>Individuals&rsquo; PPS numbers should be used. It can be confusing that when people move from Dublin to Laois and want to get on the register, they need to supply the name and number of the register on which they were in Dublin. That task can become so difficult that they give up. When transferring from one constituency to another, these complications create considerable difficulties. They do not represent a new entry in the register but a change of constituency. If the PPS number were used, this could be supplied to the local authority or whatever body might do this in future and it could take the voter off the register in the previous constituency.</P>
    <P>Many of the mistakes relate to people moving address. We all know of people on the register in several locations having moved house three or four times. However, bad that might be, it is much worse for people arriving in new estates who may have been removed from the register at their previous address and as they are not on the register in their new area, they find themselves without a vote.</P>
    <P>When officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts, they made a lame excuse on how difficult it is to have the register accurate by citing that within a couple of weeks of the last general election &mdash; it might have been the local and European elections &mdash; up to 60,000 new people were entered on the register. I suggest that they were the most accurate additions to the register because those wanting to register at that stage <Col N="773"/>must have a form signed at the Garda station. Quite a cumbersome process is involved in getting on the register and they were probably the only ones fully verified &mdash; perhaps not by the local authority but by the Garda.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate. I do not agree with the concept of a commission. Without having political influence, I would like to see the people involved having a political interest in ensuring the job is done properly. A commissioner might not have the same kind of drive or determination. Ultimately it should be under the control of the House, because we are the democratically elected Parliament, rather than an individual commissioner.</P>
    <P>I have read the various articles that Deputy Gilmore has written in the newspapers over several months and I agree with all of them. It is a shambles and we should be ashamed of it. It is not just the fault of Fianna F&aacute;il. The report produced by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was 30 years old and it knew of the problem since then. It does not care and is not interested. People with an interest in elections and the democratic process should carry out this function. It is only a question of whether we should use the census enumerators and their network as mentioned last night &mdash; I had not thought about that before &mdash; or an organisation like An Post to do the groundwork. The subsequent processing and maintaining of the database would be another matter and I do not have a hang-up as to who might do that once it is verifiable and accurate.</P>
    <P>I support the principle of the debate but not the commissioner.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>Will the Deputy vote for the Bill?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the principle but not the idea of a commissioner. I would prefer to see it controlled through this House rather than by an independent commissioner. I believe Deputy Gilmore is right. That we should not be tampering with the electoral system by putting one side of the House in opposition to the other is exactly the point I was making.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy can vote for the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be an all-party agreement. I would like the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government, or a similar body, to come up with an all-party agreement. I think such an move would receive the support of both sides of the House. That is how I would like us to proceed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>All right. Enough said.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The most important duty of a citizen to his or her country is to participate in <Col N="774"/>the determination of how and by whom the State is governed. Wars have been fought about the right to vote. It is an enormous regret to me that we take this fundamental right for granted nowadays. It is equally disturbing that we seem to have such a cavalier attitude to the process of preparing for elections. We have been aware of the alarming level of inaccuracies in the electoral register since June 2005, when <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> started to investigate the state of the register. While opinion may differ about the level of inaccuracy, it is more or less agreed that there are at least 400,000 invalid registrations, which represents a huge potential for electoral fraud. I agree with Deputy Fleming that it is nothing short of a disgrace that the register is in such bad order. It is imperative that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should act quickly to ensure confidence in this country&rsquo;s electoral system is not further eroded.</P>
    <P>By presenting this Bill to the House, Deputy Gilmore has highlighted a significant threat to our democracy. He is entitled to ask what the Government intends to do about that threat. It is disappointing that an initiative was not immediately put in place when this information became available last June, as there was still enough time before the next general election to address these obvious problems. I asked my party colleagues who sit at the Cabinet table to press upon the Government the need to act. I understand a sub-committee was formed as a result. I do not know exactly what was achieved by the sub-committee. I applaud Deputy Gilmore for his initiative, which demonstrates his obvious commitment to establishing an accurate register. I have some reservations about the Bill that has been presented to the House, however. Given that the Bill was first published on 20 October 2005, it is a pity the Labour Party chose not to use its Private Members&rsquo; time to introduce it before now. It can hardly be blamed for inaction. As such a short period of time remains before the next general election, there is simply not enough time to put in place a new way of compiling the electoral register. The law states that the draft register must be published and prepared by 1 November next. There is not enough time to pass this Bill, establish the office of an electoral register commissioner and prepare a register by November. I share Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s concern about the state of the register. We need a workable solution that can be put in place before the next election. We need short-term and long-term solutions, but I am not convinced this Bill provides for either.</P>
    <P>I would like to dwell on the aspects of the Bill with which I agree. I am in favour of using the personal public service number system in the compilation of the electoral register. That position was unanimously endorsed by the Progressive Democrats Party at its conference last weekend. The use of PPS numbers, which are unique identifiers, would cut out duplication in the system. When I checked this morning, I found <Col N="775"/>that I am still on the register in two places in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area, even though I have been in communication with the local authority and have been living at my current address for the last three and a half years. That highlights the incompetence &mdash; if that is not too strong a word &mdash; of the local authority&rsquo;s efforts to compile an accurate register. The possibility of duplication is further compounded &mdash; it is doubled in effect &mdash; by the fact that information can be inputted to the register in Irish and English. As a PPS number is a unique identifier, just one individual can be identified by it. Therefore, the use of such numbers constitutes an obvious solution to the problem of duplication.</P>
    <P>I concur with the Minister&rsquo;s comment last night that the indolence of the local authorities characterises their attitude to the compilation of the electoral register. Local authorities are not given any incentive to prioritise this work. They are indifferent to the inaccuracy of what they produce. That there is no uniformity in what is produced is also worrying. Each local authority operates in isolation, without the ability to cross-reference its lists with those of other local authority areas. The current outdated system of compiling the register belongs to an Ireland of the past, in which people knew each other. As that is no longer the case, it is time for the introduction of a new system.</P>
    <P>It is time to take responsibility for the compilation of the register from local authorities. A single new system needs to be designed to manage the task. An independent electoral commission needs to be established to run elections. It would be more appropriate to devolve the task of compiling the register to such a body. I cannot support this Bill for that reason. I do not believe the establishment of the office of commissioner of the electoral register, separate from an electoral commission, would be wise. We need to arrive at a long-term solution by consensus without rushing the process. A stopgap measure, which is what this Bill is, would not be satisfactory as we would go down a cul-de-sac. Deputy Gilmore has indicated that the establishment of an independent electoral commission is the ultimate goal. In the short term, we need to deliver a workable solution for the next general election. I was glad to hear the Minister intends to ask census enumerators to gather this information in the field. It is the Minister&rsquo;s duty to spend money to correct the register. It is probably the single most important task to be undertaken by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the rest of his time in office. He must take action that is stronger than the issuing of a directive. It does not please me to say that previous directives have been ignored. I appreciate that Deputy Gilmore is keen to solve this problem, but I do not think his Bill represents the solution.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="776"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Gilmore and the Labour Party for presenting this Bill and opening a debate on the accuracy of the electoral register. It is welcome that the Labour Party has used its Private Members&rsquo; time to that end. An argument can be made in favour of this Bill because it is possible that this process, like many other processes, needs to be centralised. It should not be forgotten that it is already centralised to a certain extent, however, because the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has an overall responsibility to ensure that each local authority compiles an accurate register. The members of each local authority are responsible for ensuring the authority is doing its job correctly.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate, which underlines that the system is an amateurish and inadequate shambles that allows for the possibility of personation. I am sure everyone in this House and most people involved in local authorities will agree. It has been brought to my attention that a number of voters in my local authority area are listed on the electoral register as living in certain flat complexes, but that information does not correspond with the housing rental records. How can one be on the register of electors if one is not living in the premises in which one is recorded as being resident? If this debate helps to make the entire system, which is antediluvian, more professional I would support that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined in recent days a series of measures which he intends to take to improve the situation. Much greater use should be made of technology in this regard. A proper computer system would immediately notice that a person in a local authority area is registered at two separate addresses. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should monitor that computer system. I agree with the Minister that the establishment of a commission would not achieve much more than the creation of a new body. I am surprised the Labour Party has made such a suggestion because I know many people in that party, like many people in my party, have frequently argued for the decentralisation of powers and for making powers more local, as opposed to more centralised. I do not want to let local authorities off the hook with regard to their obligations. I do not want another semi-State body, non-governmental organisation, quango or whatever to have power and responsibility removed from this House. I want the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to be accountable to this House for the state of the register and I believe he is. When it comes to technology, electronic voting may have been useable. Despite it being used in two elections in 1997 without any problem, the same technology all of a sudden is totally unacceptable for this general election. Members of the D&aacute;il must come into the 21st century and embrace modern technology and not be afraid of <Col N="777"/>it. We must be consistent in bringing technology forward.</P>
    <P>Citizens have an obligation to register. I do not accept the point made by some people that there is no publicity about this. There are always advertisements on television, on the radio stations and in the print media encouraging people to register for the draft and final registers. Citizens must be aware of their obligations. It is their duty to check that they are on the register and if not, to ensure they are registered. Most people I know want to be registered. They want to have a vote. Whether they cast their votes in an election is another matter. However, there is an obligation on the citizen to ensure that he or she is registered and in a position to vote at the next election.</P>
    <P>The other area we need to emphasise is that of personation and identification. It is not compulsory to show identification when one goes to get a ballot paper. Only if challenged is one required to produce identification. It should be compulsory for every person to give some type of identification before he or she votes, a credit card bill, utility bill, passport or driver&rsquo;s licence, for instance. That would go a long way to cutting out personation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I was canvassing recently in a housing estate with my electoral register in hand. I assure constituency colleagues in the House that it is not my normal practice to have the electoral register in hand. I just happened to be very diligent on this particular day and I noticed when I came to No. 5, that ten people were registered at that house. I rang the door bell in great excitement and was greatly disappointed to find that a mere three people in the house should legitimately have been on the register. The anecdotes have been plentiful in this debate in recent days, but it is a problem everywhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to personation. There used to be a correcting mechanism on the electoral register. At every single polling station at election time there used to be a queue of people volunteering to do personation work on behalf of each of the political parties. Unfortunately we just do not have the personnel anymore. Membership of the various political parties has declined over the years. There are other things to do and people join single issue movements.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Or they join smaller parties.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s party did not exist in those times. That was a correcting mechanism and people have gone through various other reasons this has happened. If there are 400,000 people too many, it shows that the real turn-out at elections is much higher than we realise. The turn-out was 63% at the last election. It is probably more than 70% if that fact is taken into account. However, this only would apply in the <Col N="778"/>more developed areas like mine, I suppose, whereas in Deputy Catherine Murphy&rsquo;s area, it probably operates in the other direction, perhaps, with too few people being registered. There is also the interesting consequence that we probably have too many Deputies in certain areas. As we all know there are supposed to be 20,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Especially over there. We will move over if the Government side moves out.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am the only one here, so it is perhaps the other side that has the superfluous numbers. The Constitution provides that there should be 20,000 per Deputy. If there are 400,000 too many people on the register, then it means there are that many Deputies in excess. We need the Government Deputies to bolster the Taoiseach. The rest are oversubscribed, I would say.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Andrews represents one of the few constituencies where the population is falling.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>It would have an interesting knock-on effect. If we corrected the register it might have an impact in that sense. The Democracy Commission produced a report last year. I was involved in its preparation and the main conclusion it came to was that there was much confusion about the electoral register. The statistics showed that 41% of 18 and 19 year olds did not vote and half that cohort had procedural problems with the register. People did not have polling cards or they were away from home or were confused about what was going on. That is a significant number and the same scenario could be applied to people in general in the under-25 age group.</P>
    <P>I had wanted to go through other matters here. My colleagues have rehearsed the problems in trying to set up an electoral registration commission in the next few months. This will not be practicable. I would like to see a wider electoral commission, as recommended by the Democracy Commission. I would like to see not only enumerators and An Post, but also students being invited to work over the summer in correcting the register and providing us with the type of accuracy that is required.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>With the House&rsquo;s permission I would like to share time with Deputies Crowe, Catherine Murphy, Connolly, Cowley and Healy, should they appear. I am sure others will fill the space if necessary.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There appears to be a small but significant group of crocodiles on the far side of the House who are crying their eyes out about the condition of the electoral register. I would remind <Col N="779"/>them that they have been office for the previous nine years and have had ample opportunity to address this issue, which has been discussed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been rapid housing development in recent years. The accentuated problem that exists now was not as pronounced in 1997. I just make that point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There has always been an undercurrent of problems with the register, particularly with the advent of computers some time in the 1960s. The technology certainly existed for some degree of cross-checking as between local authorities.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I was very impressed by Mr. Maurice Coughlan, principal officer in the franchise section of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who said clearly at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government in December that the use of PPS numbers would be of great advantage in managing and administering the electoral register. That was in December, and January, February, March and April have gone by with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government having had little to say on the issue. I would remind him, however, that there is a desk in the Customs House, his name is on it and the buck should stop with him. It is entirely within his remit to come up with a new Bill to address this. It is not overly complicated. I imagine the average parliamentary draftsman could have the heads of a Bill drawn up in a couple of days. I certainly believe there is still time to bring it in by next November or some other date that is suitable.</P>
    <P>Deputy&rsquo;s Gilmore&rsquo;s Bill is excellent. It makes perfect sense to use PPS numbers. We all agreed on that issue in December and nodding consensus, at least, was given to the need for an independent electoral commission. We need look no further than across the Border to see how it works. Up to the not too distant past we saw, across the Border, the problems that resulted from not having a clear and understandable system. Deputy Mulcahy really misunderstood the question. The reason we did not support electronic voting on this side of the House was that there was not a voter verifiable audit trail. That is the issue with electronic voting. I have no problem with using a computer to cross-check the PPS numbers. I still think the local authority can play a valid role in the compilation of the register. The trick is to send the files up to HQ and to make sure that somebody just runs the spreadsheet through a computer who can point out, for example, if five people have the same PPS number so that somebody can knock on their doors to find out what is going on. That would not be overly complicated and I think it can be done.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>There is a clear need to establish the electoral <Col N="780"/>register commission. The use of PPS numbers would eliminate the risk of inclusion of deceased persons and would allow local authorities to cross-check the data to make sure no person is registered more than once. This is probably the first time in my three years in the House that I have agreed with Deputy Mulcahy, and I agree that we should perhaps look at mandatory ID at polling stations, whether it be a bus pass, pension book or credit card statement, as he suggested. In this day and age it makes sense to keep a slightly tighter rein on who is turning up at polling stations. We use ID in every other aspect of our lives and it is no harm to use it in polling stations.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I remind the Government side of the House that we had a full discussion on this matter in the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government last December and we were all agreed on the solution. The Minister, Deputy Roche, stated it is too late to bring about radical change in electoral registration in the lead-in to the next election. He has had responsibility for this matter for the past 18 months and he has done little or nothing to deal with the problem since his appointment. One of two things is going on. Either the Minister is completely and utterly inept in this area or there is a more ominous and darker reason for his inability to come to terms with reforming the electoral register. Although he does not need reminding, I remind him that his predecessor spent over &euro;60 million on the fiasco that was electronic voting. A mere fraction of that would sort out the problems of reform of the electoral roll. With my party colleagues I will be voting for the Labour Party Bill this evening.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to reaffirm Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s support for reform of the electoral register and for the instigation of proactive voter registration drives to ensure all eligible voters are registered and to ensure accuracy of the electoral register. There has been a significant failure to ensure that the register is kept up to date and accurate. The absence of proactive registration drives and voter education initiatives has left many disenfranchised, particularly first-time voters, those who have moved into new housing developments and those living in the private rented sector. As elected representatives, we all regularly encounter significant numbers of people who are not registered and who in many cases are not fully aware of how to go about getting registered.</P>
    <P>The question has been asked whether the process should be about making it easier or more difficult for people to use their franchise. We should be making it easier. The proposed changes to the supplementary register by which those seeking to be added to it would have to go to a Garda station and so on would not encourage people to go down that road but would discourage them. Neither would it encourage young people who feel dissatisfied with the system to <Col N="781"/>add their names to the register. We have all come across cases where young people are not registered and that is a scandal. I have come across young people who were in tears because they wanted to use their vote for the first time but found they were not on the register.</P>
    <P>During last night&rsquo;s debate the Minister attempted to downplay the problem of underfunding and did not appear to accept the extent to which lack of funds and-or personnel impedes the ability of local authorities to carry out their functions in regard to the electoral register. As the Minister stated last night, local authorities utilise a number of different approaches in compiling the register. There needs to be a standardised approach and local authority employees tasked with carrying out this work must be trained and upskilled.</P>
    <P>There also must be increased emphasis on voter education. Voter education campaigns should place particular emphasis on communities with low levels of registration and low voter turnout at elections. It should not be left to groups like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to try to provoke discussion and so on. There is a responsibility on political parties to engage with young people and people from disadvantaged areas to try to get them involved.</P>
    <P>During last night&rsquo;s debate, Deputy Gilmore praised the rolling register in place in the North. Such praise demonstrates a naivety regarding the actual consequences for those in the Six Counties of the system introduced there. After the introduction of the new electoral regulations in Northern Ireland a number of years ago, which abolished household registration and introduced an annual registration requirement, much more than 200,000 people became disenfranchised. Those living in disadvantaged areas were particularly affected. After a long campaign waged by Sinn F&eacute;in and others, the British Government agreed to amend the legislation and our primary concern now is to ensure that the people who are on the current register are carried over on to the permanent register which is currently being legislated for and that adequate resources are provided for the electoral office and the electoral commission to do their jobs effectively.</P>
    <P>Problems in terms of the accessibility of polling stations for those with disability or mobility problems persist. I am aware of a particular case in my constituency where elderly and infirm people had to be carried up steps so that they could vote as there was no ramp. I contacted the school which said it did not have the money to put a ramp in place. I also contacted the Sheriff&rsquo;s office but it did not have the money either. The reality is that at the next election some people will either have to crawl up steps or be carried up them. It is wrong that anybody should have to go through that to cast their vote. People are entitled to vote and it should be made easier for them, not more difficult.</P><Col N="782"/>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this debate is taking place but we should seriously examine ways of making it easier for people to vote and encouraging people to vote. One way of doing that is by putting them on the register.</P>

	<P>I might take a little bit more time given that some of my colleagues are not present. The focus of newspaper headlines has been on the number of additional people on the electoral register. In Kildare and other rapidly developing areas I suggest that there are gaps all over the place in terms of the number of people who have not yet put their names on the electoral register. It is only at election time that one becomes acutely aware of just how many people are in that category. In the past, rate collectors had a role in knocking on everybody&rsquo;s door but that is no longer the case. Nobody slots into that position in local authorities to do that work. As a result we simply do not have good electoral registers because we rely on people to respond to material that is sent to them, which does not work in all cases.</P>
    <P>If one went out to find additional voters next week one would find not only additional voters but new housing estates. It is very difficult to keep on top of these developments given the rate of building. There is a change in housing tenure and an increase in the rented accommodation sector. This results in a more transient population. This is the case right across the country. It is not just a question of getting the register right now, we must accept the changes in society and respond to them by putting different systems in place. It is not atypical for me to find gaps in the register in the town in which I live, in housing estates that are up to ten years old. The register can go from house No. 1 to houses Nos. 5, 6 and 7 and on to house No. 20. Such gaps are par for the course. It is only when it comes to election time that this is noticed. Younger voters are not captured.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Mulcahy refer to taking people off the electoral register. I have been in polling stations, as I am sure have other Members, where voters have been taken off the electoral register. When they turn up looking for their vote having been on a prior electoral register, they are very difficult people for the staff in a polling station to deal with. It is a dangerous way to go about things because decisions become very arbitrary about who is or is not on the register. My name is a very common one which would be replicated a number of times around the constituency and I would take great offence if somebody took my name off the electoral register. This is a wrong way to go about it.</P>
    <P>We need to get it right at the beginning but it also should be reviewed in the future, as should <Col N="783"/>the use of information technology which is very important.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction of this Bill to establish the office of electoral registration commissioner is timely in view of the recent reports of chaos relating to omissions and additions to the existing voters&rsquo; list. Rumours in the media have indicated a level of 20% inaccuracy which represents approximately 800,000 more people registered than are eligible to vote. Such a number of votes would elect many TDs, considering many Members of this House have been elected on very small margins and one Member has been elected on a margin of one vote. This situation cannot be allowed pertain.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has referred to the work of some local authorities in compiling the register as less than satisfactory and this may be an understatement. There is no incentive for those local authorities to do the job any differently or any better than they are doing and neither are there any penalties. It works on a whim. The Northern Ireland electoral register was referred to which was subject to similar attention prior to a major clean up in recent years, which demonstrates that difficulties also existed north of the Border.</P>
    <P>At the 2004 local and European elections, many electors found themselves deleted from the register when they went to vote and these were the interested voters who had turned up to vote. There was no accountability by any person or persons who deleted these names from the register. There are questions to be answered about the mode of operation but safeguards are not in place. Up to now the compilation of the register has been haphazard and patchy with little effort made to ensure the accuracy of lists prior to an election. But for the introduction of the supplement to the electoral register a few years&rsquo; ago, many persons would be forced to wait several years before being able to exercise their vote in an election.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The current electoral register chaos involving errors and large-scale non-registration or over-registration, increases the risk of election fraud at subsequent elections. Frequently the final seven or eight seats in an election are usually settled by a total margin of a few hundred votes. With the anticipated tight situation in the D&aacute;il, this small margin could decide the make-up of the next Government. Hence, the 800,000 inaccuracies in the current register could, if misappropriated, pervert the true wishes of the electorate. Governments have been toppled on less. Hence, the extreme urgency in correcting the register within the coming year.</P>
    <P>A golden opportunity was missed recently by not using the 4,500 census enumerators to distribute electoral registration forms to householders along with the census forms. I cannot understand the reason this opportunity was missed. There is no point in crying over spilled milk at this stage. <Col N="784"/>I fully support the timely proposal by the Labour Party Private Members&rsquo; Bill to establish the office of the electoral registration commissioner to supervise the work of local authorities in their duty of register compilation.</P>
    <P>A system of checks and balances prevailed in the past when the political parties scrutinised everyone entering a polling station. This was at a time, especially in rural Ireland, when everybody knew who was coming into the polling station There was no need to ask for photographic identity. They could identify the person as they walked into the station. Those times are gone and even those of us living in rural areas in many cases no longer know our next door neighbour. When they ticked off the people, they also knew which box they would be ticking as their number one. These boys could do entry polls and tell the type of turnout and the political affiliations that were coming in. Other parties could use the situation to their advantage. They could spot who was not coming to vote and make telephone calls and send cars to ensure those people came to the polling station. The safeguard of the personation agent does not exist any longer and a new system will need to be put in their place.</P>
    <P>The proposal to use the PPS number is entirely logical and is the way forward. Anyone using a PPS number twice should be forced to answer for their actions. I spoke to an individual who successfully tested the system during an abortion referendum by going to vote at two polling stations as a dry run for a general election. I met another individual who informed me that in a previous general election he had voted three times. The striking feature of both feats was that neither individual was yet 18 years old. Some people see the opportunity to test the system.</P>
    <P>Many people are apathetic about elections and there is public apathy about politics and politicians in general. We should encourage people to vote and in particular encourage students to vote. I regard the notion of polling booths in colleges as being a good idea.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the Bill proposed by Deputy Gilmore to deal with a problem which has been ongoing for many years. Unless it is decided that this situation is not acceptable to any party in this House, it will be taken that the Minister agrees with the current mix and with leaving it in place for the next general election.</P>
    <P>This is the first occasion since I came to this House that I have seen such unanimous support for a proposal but it is clear that the Government parties will vote against it. No speaker during this debate spoke against action being taken. The Minister stated in the House that the electoral register is inaccurate by 25%. It is very difficult to understand how a Minister could say that 25% of the population of the country cannot vote <Col N="785"/>when he should be acting on behalf of the people. His efforts to rectify the problem are pathetic.</P>
    <P>He spoke about the local authorities making a difference. In fairness to Kildare County Council it tried to make a difference. A number of clinics were held during the daytime but the numbers attending were minimal. Everyone was out at work during the day and they were not in a position to take a day&rsquo;s leave to register. The problem was highlighted for all of us in the last by-elections in Meath and Kildare. When we went to the houses we realised the impossibility of working from the electoral register. I went into a housing estate in Celbridge which had 59 houses but only four people in the whole estate were registered voters. Despite this, tonight we heard the Minister state that he will give a small sum of money to the local authorities when, in fact, this mechanism has been tried in Kildare and has failed dismally to address the major problem confronting us. I spoke to the officials who went to the clinics. They said it was a waste of time and money because they went around to the different areas in the county and so few people came through the doors.</P>
    <P>There is another major problem, especially for young people. No one who has come into my office seeking to be put on the register will go to the Garda station to sign any papers. They just will not do so.</P>
    <P>If we are really sincere about this matter, something must be done. Having listened to everyone, no doubt everyone wants to do it but the will is not there because the Minister does not have the drive to do it. It seems difficult to understand that the Minister, who is the representative of the people in this matter, is not willing to do it. He is willing to see so many citizens not entitled to vote and he is willing to merely give a pittance towards the financial implications involved for a local authority.</P>
    <P>If a Deputy tables a parliamentary question or telephones the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the first item they will be asked for is the PPS number for the individual. Within seconds, irrespective of when that person worked last, which may have been 40 or 50 years ago, the Department official has that name on a screen in front of him or her, and yet this is rejected as a means of trying to take some action to give everyone the right to vote.</P>
    <P>Last week we saw a great parade. The honour of 1916 was reflected greatly in O&rsquo;Connell Street. Everyone was there, and yet the people who were there on behalf of the Government know in their hearts and souls, because Deputy Gilmore, my party&rsquo;s spokesman on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has continually stated it in this House, along with Deputy Quinn and others, that the rights of the people are being deprived. We had the honour and glory of last week and yet we know that 25% of the people are not being given the opportunity, which was <Col N="786"/>fought for in 1916 and to which they are entitled, to vote.</P>
    <P>The mechanism being used is a total joke. Unless the Minister is willing to call a halt and state this must be addressed, it will not happen. I listened to the Government and other speakers this evening. I listened to Deputy Fleming and his colleagues. Every one of them, typical of Fianna F&aacute;il, spoke against the Government but will vote with it. That is the mechanism that has been used previously and it was used tonight. Their attitude is that if they get this out of the way tonight and move on, there will not be anything about it until the next election.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly welcome the Electoral Registration Commissioner Bill 2005 and congratulate my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, for introducing it in the House. I cannot see any good reason the Government should not simply adopt it, move it to Committee Stage as soon as possible and bring it through the House. By this time next year the general election may well be over. There may be many citizens who would dearly like to have a say, perhaps in removing the Government in particular, and who will not get the opportunity given the shambolic nature of the current electoral register. I commend Deputy Gilmore for the attention he has drawn to this, in particular over the past year.</P>
    <P>I recall two discussions on Dublin City Council in which all local politicians expressed a strong viewpoint, the first on the issue of dogs and the second on the electoral register. Every one of us was an expert on both issues and virtually everybody contributed. Even ten or 12 years ago there were grave and growing concerns about alleged corruption of the register in high density estates in Dublin. I remember one colleague in particular, Councillor Eamonn O&rsquo;Brien, who continuously raised this problem which, he believed, was partly based on the fact that often the registrars were fearful at times of entering certain areas such as tower blocks to invigilate the existing electoral roll. It is no wonder that at different elections there were serious allegations that some individuals had been prepared to vote early and often, and took advantage of the failure of the local authority to maintain a decent electoral roll.</P>
    <P>We politicians, probably more than most other groups, deeply need that register to function. Most of us who have been in this House for a while tend to want to keep in touch with electors. We are given some facility to do so. One of our most valuable roles is that we constantly report, <Col N="787"/>as we probably all have done today, to different estates and areas of our constituencies.</P>
    <P>It is a great handicap that the register, even of long-standing settled estates, contains the names of people who are dead. Today I heard somebody state the name of a person who has been dead for 15 years who is still clearly named in the register, which is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Even if the huge figures concerning the corruption of the current register are an exaggeration and one accepts the minimum figure of 200,000 for the forthcoming general election, I was once elected by managing to get ahead of another candidate by 19 votes, so it is clear that 200,000 votes across 42 constituencies will prove important.</P>
    <P>Many colleagues have drawn attention to the particular problem we encounter with new estates. My constituency is a vast urban district of 20,000 or 25,000. Nearly all of the residents live in high-density apartments. Although there was a good turnout in the local elections, I noted that the newer estates and the high-density estates were very difficult to reach, not least of course, as other colleagues like Deputies Burton and Gilmore mentioned, because these are gated communities. It is difficult, if not impossible, for a hard-working politician to maintain a relationship with a gated community. Given that many of the apartments in such gated communities are rented, it is virtually impossible to keep a database of one&rsquo;s constituents in order to serve them. There is a special necessity, particularly in the case of these urban areas. Whereas a rural colleague mentioned that it is so much more difficult in modern life to be as aware of one&rsquo;s neighbours as one would have been in years gone by, the nature of modern urban development makes it virtually impossible.</P>
    <P>In my view there will be a good turnout at the next election. It will be like the local elections. Many people are in the long grass and will come out to remove the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, and the rest of the Government. They did so in the local elections and they are sharpening the pencils and getting ready.</P>
    <P Just="Left">One of the issues last year was that there were many young people telling us in the last two or three weeks before the local elections that they were not on the register and, as Deputy Catherine Murphy stated, were devastated because they could not vote for the first time. They were really upset and their parents came to us, but we could not get them on the supplementary roll because the time limit had passed. The information campaign had not been strong enough either.</P>
    <P>For those who genuinely wish to turn out, it is distressing that we will let them down by having a bad register. It may well suit the Minister of State to have a corrupt register because it may reduce severely the number of people who might be voting for the first time and who might have a strong mind to vote against the Government.</P><Col N="788"/>
    <P>I commend my colleague, Deputy Quinn, who has raised this issue repeatedly in the context of the census. Approximately 2,000 enumerators visited houses and apartments recently, as per their statutory duty, to deliver census forms. That would have provided a useful opportunity to reform the register, perhaps by adopting Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s legislation. I also commend Deputy Gilmore for proposing a strong role for the commissioner and a strengthened invigilation role for local authorities so that they will do their job, given it is clear many of them have not done so.</P>
    <P>Australia has had an electoral commissioner for more than 20 years, although voting is compulsory there. Voting should be compulsory everywhere. Over the past two decades the electoral commission in Australia has worked well and the country has experienced high turnouts. The UK has also taken a serious look at that.</P>
    <P>The electoral register should be co-ordinated with various other databases such as the post office database which is 100% accurate, and the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is networks. Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s proposal would enable us to do that and that is why it is valuable.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the legislation and I congratulate Deputy Gilmore on having the foresight to introduce it, although he has been discussing it for a considerable time. The rest of us are also concerned about the register.</P>
    <P>I received a query from a person who could not obtain a permit to park outside his house. Disc parking was recently introduced in the area and he contacted my office because he did not want to ask his landlord to sign the permit application, given he is a little stroppy about such formalities. Six other people live in the house and he did not want to endure the expense of going to a doctor to ask him to sign a letter. I asked whether he was on the electoral register because I told him that if he was, it proved he lived on the street and, therefore, he would be entitled to a parking permit. However, he is not on the register and I asked him why. He replied that he did not know and that no one had ever called to ask him whether he had registered. He lives in a house on a busy street with six other people and no one ever called.</P>
    <P>The electoral register should not only give an individual the ability to vote but it should provide local authorities with information about him or her. The legislation will ensure the information contained in the register will not be abused, which is important. Increasingly, the principal occupants of a house, usually a mother and father, or the principal tenants will not register anybody else at the address because of the implications that has for service charges, which they cannot afford. The information on the register should only be used for voting and identification purposes. Recently I did a mail shot in a small area in my constituency. A total of 64 letters were returned from houses on one street with the <Col N="789"/>message, &ldquo;Not known at this address&rdquo;. However, I used the electoral register to issue the mail shot. Nobody had bothered to update the register or to find out where the people had moved. It is incredible that this should happen but it is the reality.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that voting should be compulsory, even though, as politicians, it could mean Valhalla or Utopia for us, but it should be compulsory to register to vote, regardless of whether one exercises the option. As other Members said, how many of us have stood outside polling stations on election day and met people who were distraught as they left because they were not registered to vote? They were registered for the previous election but their names had been removed. This is occurring more frequently because local authorities do not have the wherewithal, financially or physically, to maintain the register.</P>
    <P>The commissioner should not only have the power to maintain the register, he or she should also have the power to determine the location of polling stations. I am sick and tired of being approached by elderly people complaining about polling stations being moved to inaccessible locations resulting in them not voting for the first time in their lives. That carry on is very political and I have witnessed it too often in Cork to believe otherwise.</P>
    <P>By ensuring the electoral register is maintained, the State is ensuring our democracy is healthy. A number of politicians, such as the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency colleague, do not have to worry about being re-elected because they had surpluses of 5,000 last time out. When I was first elected to the local authority in 1985, following the 16th count I was two votes ahead of my nearest challenger. Such margins will be repeated more often. The last seat in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency in 2002 was taken by less than ten votes. One can imagine the effect of an inaccurate register in such circumstances. That was not the only seat determined by a few votes and more seats will won by similar margins in future elections. If we are not careful, we will be to blame for people not voting and we will no longer be able to use the excuse that they are not interested. We will not know if they are not interested because they will not be registered.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had a good and positive discussion and it is heartening that there is general consensus among the parties on the need for short-term action to make the electoral register more accurate and comprehensive. Many members have acknowledged the value and immediacy of the programme of action being put in place by Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Deputy Gilmore, while promoting the Bill, accepts the importance of action in the context of the next election while <Col N="790"/>Deputy Costello, Deputy McCormack and others also shared this view.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s approach is to focus on what needs to be done in the period immediately ahead. As the Minister said last night, we have until 1 November next to take effective action. The proposals in the Labour Party&rsquo;s Bill could not achieve the necessary changes in the time available. However, practical steps will be taken to improve the register. First, we are providing updated and consolidated guidance so that all local authorities work to the same template. The specific details of the guidance were set out by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Roche. The guidance is a real and practical contribution to improving the quality of the register. My Department is finalising the guidance in light of the comments received in the consultation process. In the final version, the importance of local authorities cross-checking the register with other databases available to them will be highlighted and opportunities for local authorities to use other databases will also be explored.</P>
    <P>The use of census enumerators and others to assist local authorities in preparing the next register as part of an intensive registration campaign will be conducted this summer. The Government is also prepared to provide additional financial resources to local authorities to support intensified action on the register. These resources can be made available this year to ensure that a comprehensive once-off check is effectively undertaken.</P>
    <P>An early start will be made for the register campaign in 2007-08 with the issuing of the relevant registration form shortly from my Department. Approximately 30,000 deaths occur each year. New arrangements to delete deceased persons from the register are now also in place and the new system allows for the efficient and timely deletion of the names of deceased persons from the register. National awareness campaigns and related local campaigns associated with the preparation of the register were undertaken last November and it is intended that intensified campaigns will take place again this year.</P>
    <P>In his contribution last night, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, stressed the importance of using fully the potential of the Internet in the registration process. An on-line search facility is now available for people to check if they are on the register. To give more help to people, my Department will provide a better linkage between our own website and the local authority search facilities.</P>
    <P>We must be conscious of what happens at polling stations. Strong legislation has been introduced in recent years to prevent abuses of the system. However, this must be mirrored on the ground by vigilance on the part of polling staff and personation agents to ensure that only those eligible are permitted to vote. In advance of the next general election, my Department will stress to returning officers and presiding officers their <Col N="791"/>role and their duties in the prevention of voter fraud. There will be a strengthening of controls at all polling stations and new guidelines will be issued in this area.</P>
    <P>Debates on electoral matters in the House and elsewhere can often be quite animated, to say the least. It is good that we can agree in the way that we have on the immediate issues before us. However, for the reasons already set out, it is not possible for the Government to support the fundamentals of this Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Our system of government is based on the concept of representative democracy. The electoral register is the foundation stone of a representative democratic system. It is the fundamental linchpin and without it, our system is not democratic or representative. The accuracy of the electoral register is of vital importance if we are to continue to pretend that we are representative of all the people. Since this debate started last night, there has been agreement among almost all speakers that the current register, that linchpin of our system, is grossly inaccurate and, if that is so, we have an overwhelming responsibility to make it accurate. Inaction is not an option.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore has presented a well thought-out solution to this problem. It is not an invented solution, but a carving up of solutions that are in existence elsewhere, particularly in Australia, which has a system analogous to our own. It is a robust, clear and logical set of proposals. It is an honest effort at addressing a real and identifiable issue that we all agree must be addressed in the short and long term.</P>
    <P>This is the Labour Party&rsquo;s second attempt at introducing reform. Deputy Quinn pointed out that the recently completed census was the ideal opportunity for enumerators to gather accurate and reliable information. That plea was ignored, but this second attempt should be seized by the Government. However, the response of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been enormously disappointing. He dismissed Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s proposal as a new quango. He called it all-powerful and unaccountable. What about the electoral boundary commission? We rely on that very powerful commission to set the boundaries for an election. It is never altered and the Bill establishing the commission goes through these Houses without amendment. We trust and rely on it and it is all-powerful in the decisions that it makes.</P>
    <P>I have the privilege of working internationally with a group in Africa called AWEPA. We have a remit to export and build the capacity for democracy across Africa. The first and most important task is to ensure a fair, comprehensive and accurate voters&rsquo; list. That is the first issue to correct if we are to have a fair democratic system. The Minister casually dismissed Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s approach, but what is his solution? <Col N="792"/>What did he offer last night as an alternative? He acknowledged that there is a difficulty and a problem that must be addressed. However, as a solution, he suggests that his Department will provide &ldquo;consolidated guidance&rdquo; to local authorities. That is like praying to the Holy Spirit. It will descend upon local authorities in a consolidated fashion and we will get it right the next time. He also suggests better procedures for deleting people who are dead and possibly more money &mdash; nothing specific &mdash; as well as prominent websites.</P>
    <P>That is the sum total of the Minister&rsquo;s response to a democratic deficit that demands a serious response. The system is not working by common agreement, yet the Minister is determined that it is to remain unaltered. He dismisses two sensible, logical and well thought-out solutions put forward by the Labour Party as simply not good enough. I say to the Minister that his solution is not good enough.</P>
    <P>We know that democracy in this country is extremely fragile. We know from experience that voter fraud is not unknown so every vote is critical. In the next general election, there will be two platforms for the people to decide which will shape the destiny of this country for the following five years. It is critically important that the view of every citizen with an entitlement to vote is represented. The voting register we currently have will not allow that to happen. My constituency of Wexford, becoming more competitive by the day, deserves to be sure that every voter is heard and that a fair and accurate count of all the people is achieved. I urge the Department, the Minister and the Minister of State present to listen to the wise counsel of Deputy Gilmore and the Labour Party benches. Otherwise, we will rue the day.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party I thank all Members who contributed to this debate. The electoral register is the spinal cord of our democratic life. If it is damaged, the body politic is disabled. An accurate electoral register is essential for the accuracy and integrity of our elections. For some time now the Labour Party has been drawing attention to the unprecedented inaccuracy of the current electoral register. Last night, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government acknowledged that the electoral register could be inaccurate by up to 860,000 entries, or 25% of the eligible electorate. It was the first time the Government formally accepted the full scale of the problem.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I was not surprised the Minister refused to accept this Labour Party Private Members&rsquo; Bill but I had expected that in rejecting it, the Minister would set out in detail the steps the Government will take to correct the register of voters, for which it has ultimate responsibility. Instead, we were treated to one of the most pathetic responses to come from a Minister on Private Members&rsquo; business. The Minister patronisingly denigrated the Labour Party Bill by claiming it <Col N="793"/>would foster quangos. Coming from a Government which has given the health service to the Health Service Executive and road building to the National Roads Authority and from Ministers who are tripping over each other to divest themselves of their executive powers, that is a bit rich. He blamed local authorities instead of himself for failing to keep the electoral register accurate, clapped himself on the back for sending out a few circulars to the county councils and made a few unspecified, uncosted and unreliable promises about the 2007-2008 register. Nowhere in his reply did he take responsibility for the shambolic state of the electoral register. There was no explanation as to why he or his two predecessors in Government have failed in their duty to ensure the accuracy of the voting register and there was no real commitment to putting it right. I am becoming weary of the way in which the Minister blames local authorities for everything that goes wrong on his watch. He seems to believe that the buck stops with a grade V officer in the county hall and not at the Minister&rsquo;s desk in the Custom House.</P>
    <P>He is correct that the House should not have to divide on the issue of the electoral register. However, the Government has had plenty of advance notice that urgent action is needed on the matter but has failed thus far to act. In every debate I remember in this House on electoral legislation &mdash; we have had many such debates over the past five years &mdash; Members from every party and none have drawn attention to the inaccuracies in the electoral register. The Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Local Government held hearings on the issue. During the many exchanges on electronic voting, the Labour Party argued that the &euro;60 million would have been better spent on correcting the register than on purchasing electoral play stations for the former Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputies Cullen and Noel Dempsey.</P>
    <P>Over the past year, Labour Party Deputies, including Deputy Quinn, have brought practical suggestions to the Government on how an accurate electoral register could be compiled in time for the next general election but none of those proposals has been acted upon. The result is we still have an electoral register in which one in every five entries is wrong. This inaccurate and unreliable electoral register is due to the negligence, inactivity and incompetence of this Government.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is interested in resolving this issue because our people and democracy deserve no less. It could have been resolved with the money misspent on electronic voting. The register could have been updated in parallel with the census process and it will be corrected if this Labour Party Bill is enacted and implemented. However, the best the Minister could do last night was list a number of routine administrative tasks which he portrayed as original political initiatives. He <Col N="794"/>told us all about the wordy circulars and guidelines he plans to issue to local authorities, down to a description of the appendices, none of which tell local authorities anything further to the rules and practices they should already know.</P>
    <P>The big idea in the Minister&rsquo;s speech was a new link to the electronic database for the 30,000 deaths recorded in Ireland each year. After nine years in government, the Minister thinks it is a major initiative to remove the names of the deceased from the electoral register. Dare one suggest that they should have been doing this all along? He offered some slight hope that action will be taken to improve the 2007-08 register, on which it is expected the conduct of the next general election will be based. He says the process will start early but does not tell us what that means. He says that local authorities could engage experienced census enumerators to complement local authority staff in the collection of register data. That is a far cry from the kite which the Minister successfully flew at the weekend that the census enumerators would be sent out for a second time to compile a new register. What happened to that idea? Was it just another example of Government by public relations in which a good yarn is spun to a journalist but nothing is done about the problem?</P>
    <P>He says he will provide some money &mdash; unspecified and uncosted amounts &mdash; to local authorities for the compilation of the 2007-08 register. That, at least, is an advance on his attitude of a few short months ago, when he turned down a request for financial assistance from Kildare County Council, which explained to him the difficulties it faced in annually updating the register in an area of rapid development. The Minister has made it very clear that this unqualified extra money for the register will only be available on a once off basis. He appears to imply there will be some extra money available to councils for one year only in order to update the electoral register, whereas there will be money available every year to store the useless electronic voting machines purchased by his predecessor. Is it any wonder that, in a country of unprecedented wealth, the elderly cannot get a proper bed in a hospital when they are ill or find a garda when they are at risk from crime? A Government which, in the computer age, cannot even compile an accurate list of the names and addresses of those over 18 years in a country of only 4 million people, cannot be trusted to run hospitals, the schools and the public services.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>If the Minister had given a realistic response to the proposals of the Labour Party, we would not press this Bill to a vote but he has offered nothing. Members from all sides of this House have reiterated that the electoral register on which the conduct of our democracy is based is a shambles and needs urgent correction. However, the Minister has rebuffed every proposal made from these benches with regard to resolving the matter while <Col N="795"/>offering only uncosted and unspecified administrative measures in response. It is simply not good enough. The Labour Party wants Second Stage of the Bill to be put to a vote and asks Members <Col N="796"/>with concerns about the state of the electoral register to vote in favour of it.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office for allowing me to raise this important but sad issue and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, for taking the matter. The <i>Maggie B</i> sank 8.6 kilometres off Hook Head off the coast of Wexford on Wednesday, 29 March 2006. Two crew were lost, the skipper, Glen Cott, a native of Ballycotton, who was a former student of mine, and a Polish national, Jan Sankowski, who I am told was a 45 year old, experienced seafarer. Thankfully, one survivor was picked up shortly after the accident.</P>
    <P>At least one dive has been made on the site. The family of Mr. Cott have approached me and I spoke with the owners of the boat who asked me to request the Minister of State to put in place measures to raise the boat, if possible. An issue also arose with regard to the Naval Service not being allowed to dive on the boat.</P>
    <P>This is an important issue. The family want to know what happened. I am told the trawler passed a survey shortly before it was purchased by the present owners. It sank very quickly and it is possible that one or both bodies are still on the boat. The family and the owners are anxious to have closure on this matter. The one way that can be achieved is for the boat to be raised. I ask the Minister to explore every avenue to ascertain whether this is possible. If not, I ask that the Naval Service, with its expertise, knowledge and back-up, would be allowed to dive on the boat to discover what happened. I am told that the norm in other countries is, if at all possible, to raise such boats to discover what happened.</P>
    <P>I express my sympathy to the families of both victims of this awful tragedy. I implore the Minister of State to use his good offices to accede to the request of the families, which has also been agreed to by the owners.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. N. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Stanton for allowing me time and thank the Minister of State for agreeing to that. I visited the Cott family, whom I know personally because the father of the family comes from north Cork, which is my area. I spoke with Mrs. Cott today. All the family wants is for the Naval Service to dive to search the boat, and to have it raised, to find out what happened to it.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a compassionate situation which is hard on the family given that their son <Col N="798"/>has not been found. They would like to have him taken from the sea to be given a Christian burial and be back with his family in Ballycotton. The family have always been loyal to and supported the State. The least we could have from the Government and the Minister of State is an assurance that the Naval Service would do what is necessary. The Naval Service has carried out such tasks in the past and has the necessary equipment. Whether an attempt is successful, to have tried would alleviate the fears of the family.</P>
    <P>As a Government Deputy, I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to do all he can on compassionate grounds to alleviate the hardship for the family. It is a sad and difficult time for them. I thank Deputy Stanton, with whom I often co-operate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this issue. I also thank Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe, who has just spoken, and Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, who contacted me in this regard. I take this opportunity to offer my sincere condolences to the families of Glen Cott and Jan Sankowski who tragically drowned with the sinking of the fishing vessel <i>Maggie B</i> off Hook Head on 29 March of this year.</P>
    <P Just="Left"><?oasys _ic14- ?>The Coast Guard, on being alerted, immediately tasked resources to the scene of this incident, and the third crew member, Kristoph Pawtowski, was rescued from the water, clinging to the upturned life-raft. Based on information received and with the assistance of its search computer, the Coast Guard carried out a thorough search of the area, both at sea and on the shoreline for 21 days using helicopters, lifeboats, local fishing vessels, Coast Guard shore units and members of the public. I take this opportunity to thank all those involved, especially the volunteers, of whom many were involved. They gave of their time freely to search for the missing men.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
    <P>No two incidents regarding the sinking of fishing vessels are the same. In the case of the <i>Maggie B</i> a distress call was made to the Coast Guard giving the vessel&rsquo;s position.</P>
    <P>In addition, the emergency position indication radio beacon, EPIRB, was activated, and the life raft launched and inflated. Parallels are being drawn between this tragic case and the recent loss of the fishing vessel, the <i>Rising Sun</i>, in which I was involved. However, in the case of the <i>Rising Sun</i> no distress call was made and no EPIRB was activated. That meant there was a possibility that the skipper of the <i>Rising Sun</i> had re-entered the wheelhouse to activate the EPIRB. Therefore, I took the decision to raise the vessel. The owner of the vessel the <i>Maggie B</i> engaged several divers to dive to the vessel and search for the missing men. That was done, and it confirmed the Coast Guard&rsquo;s view that the two bodies were not on or <Col N="799"/>around the vessel. I am advised it would be unnecessary to raise the <i>Maggie B</i> for that reason.</P>
    <P>Sadly, it is now well established that the bodies of those who drown in the area tend to be carried by underwater currents in an easterly direction, and some have even been located on the Welsh coastline. As is its usual practice, the Irish Coast Guard has informed its colleagues in the Maritime and Coastguard Agency in the UK. They are therefore aware of the possibility that the bodies may be found on their coast.</P>
    <P>The Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB, was established in 2002 to carry out investigations into marine casualties. The MCIB is charged with investigating marine accidents involving all types of craft in Ireland. The main purpose of the board&rsquo;s investigation is to establish the cause or causes of a marine casualty with a view to making recommendations to me to avoid similar incidents. Investigations carried out by the board do not attribute blame or fault, and I understand the MCIB is carrying out an investigation into the sinking of the <i>Maggie B</i>. It is most important that the facts of this tragic incident be established. Members will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any aspect of this case while it is still under investigation by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As the next three matters are being taken together, each Deputy has five minutes, and the Minister 15 minutes to reply.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for calling this matter. Yesterday and this morning I raised questions with the Taoiseach about the collapse of the case against Dermot Laide in the Circuit Criminal Court and the responsibility of Government for the State pathology service. The Taoiseach&rsquo;s replies were his characteristic mixture of evasion and obfuscation. He pleaded that he had not been briefed, that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was scheduled to deal with the matters &mdash; at a time when he patently was not &mdash; and finally that no one could answer the questions because they were solely for the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>However, it is not the case that the Government or the Minister can hide behind the independence of the DPP. The State pathology service is provided by medical experts directly recruited and contracted to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There is no doubt that the former State pathologist, Dr. John Harbison, provided the State with many years of dedicated and expert service. However, Dr. Harbison is now ill and is unlikely to give evidence in court again. That gives rise to one question: how to substitute for Dr. Harbison&rsquo;s <Col N="800"/>inability to give evidence in future cases about post mortems conducted years ago and about the reports that he wrote years ago on those post mortems.</P>
    <P>At one stage, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, was giving the impression he could re-jig the preliminary deposition procedure to preserve the evidence in such cases. However, when the real and obvious difficulties were put to him, his resolve immediately collapsed and he conceded that an accused person&rsquo;s right to test in court the evidence against him or her would always have to take precedence.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Minister was dismissing the idea of having two State pathologists in future. However, by this morning he had become converted to the proposal and was committed to its introduction. The Taoiseach has repeatedly dodged the other question, which is as important &mdash; is there any issue as to Dr. Harbison&rsquo;s capacity to have conducted post mortems, to have formed opinions and written reports and to have given evidence in cases that have already been heard and decided?</P>
    <P>I ask this because Dr. Marie Cassidy&rsquo;s expert opinion in the Laide case flatly contradicted that of Dr. Harbison. It was not a difference in emphasis or detail within the normal range of variety that one would expect between experts. It was not a difference of opinion that might have led to a manslaughter conviction rather than one for murder. It was much more serious. Dr. Cassidy said in so many words that she could find no cause and effect at all, that there was no evidence that the injuries suffered by Brian Murphy had resulted in his death in the first place. Dr. Cassidy&rsquo;s evidence was never tested in court and now never will be, but if she is correct, it means that Dr. Harbison&rsquo;s opinion and evidence at the first trial was wrong.</P>
    <P>Despite the presentation to the media over the weekend, it is now clear that the central problem was not so much that Dr. Harbison could not give evidence but that the prosecution could no longer credibly stand over his evidence. In those circumstances, the DPP&rsquo;s decision to collapse the re-trial was inevitable. Even if Dr. Harbison had been available to give evidence, it is impossible to see how the DPP could have proceeded with that evidence so fatally undermined.</P>
    <P>We must face the appalling prospect that the possible or even probable explanation for the disagreement between these two professionals was that Dr. Harbison&rsquo;s health was already in decline when he formed his opinion on Brian Murphy&rsquo;s cause of death. If so, we need to know who knew about that, when they knew and what they did about it. How many post mortems, more than 100 of which he was expected to perform each year, and how many cases, if any, where he gave evidence may have to be reviewed as a result?</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McDowell, now says that he was told some months ago &mdash; I hope he will state how many months ago &mdash; that Dr. <Col N="801"/>Harbison&rsquo;s ill health would affect his future ability to give evidence. Was he told what that ill health was, when it was first identified, or when it might first have impacted on the performance of professional duties? Was he told that not just Dr Harbison&rsquo;s future availability but his previous competence might fall under scrutiny? Given the extensive disclosure obligations that the DPP must discharge to the defence before and during a trial, when did the Department first inform the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions of potential problems with Dr. Harbison&rsquo;s evidence?</P>
    <P>I repeat, despite the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attempts to muddy the waters, that this is the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy McDowell, not that of the DPP. The DPP can only be accountable for what he does with information once he receives it. The accuracy and integrity of the information provided by the State pathology service is the direct responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Last night a spokesperson reassured the public that no other cases would collapse like the Dermot Laide one because of the infirmity of Dr. Harbison. However, this morning the Taoiseach intervened to make clear that no such statements had been issued on his behalf. He has left the Minister, Deputy McDowell, standing alone on this issue.</P>
    <P>I cannot remember any issue on which Government members have become so clearly, rapidly and chaotically at sixes and sevens, both between themselves and, in Minister McDowell&rsquo;s, case, between his views one minute and a minute later. However, the question is basic and it is within the Minister&rsquo;s competence to answer. Did the issues about either Dr. Harbison&rsquo;s availability to give evidence or about the reliability of that evidence arise for the first time in the context of the Dermot Laide case? If we can finally have a clear and comprehensive answer to that single question, two days of repeating it will have resulted in progress.</P>
    <P>It might have been more appropriate, although time-consuming, to have a question-and-answer session under a Private Notice Question to convey some of the questions that professionals have raised with my office and the undoubted concern in the public sphere. I am sure the Minister, who attended a committee meeting rather than the House, is quite well briefed on the questions, and I hope, given the unusual arrangement of a three-person Adjournment debate, that he will have time to deal with the answers and reassure the public.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter and the Minister for being here. I look forward to hearing his contribution on this important matter, as Deputy Rabbitte said. I put on record my acknowledgement of the great service Dr. Harbison rendered to this State in his position as Chief State Pathologist for almost 30 years. I also extend my sympathy to the family and friends of <Col N="802"/>Brian Murphy who died in such tragic and violent circumstances.</P>
    <P>By raising this matter, it is not my intention to intrude into the private life of Dr. Harbison or to cause any upset to him or his family. This State owes the doctor a debt of gratitude and respect for his many years of dedicated and professional service. His profession is indeed a grim one dealing as it does with the death of a human being often as a result of violence. Nevertheless, it is a vital service which not only requires a great depth of professional skill and knowledge but also to be carried out in a dignified and sensitive manner. Our State pathology service is a vital cog in the wheel of our criminal justice system and, therefore, it is important it operates in a professional manner.</P>
    <P>This morning I listened to the Taoiseach on Leaders&rsquo; Questions outline the facts surrounding the retirement of Dr. Harbison. The reasonable concerns expressed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2003 in regard to Dr. Harbison performing further autopsies was understandable taking into account his age at that time and that some murder investigations can take a long time before going to trial. I commend the Minister and his officials for the prudent and immediate steps they took in retiring Dr. Harbison from undertaking further autopsies as a result of these concerns.</P>
    <P>All Deputies will be aware that Ministers have no role in the investigation or prosecution of cases. It is the role of the Garda to investigate alleged offences, to gather whatever evidence may be available and to submit a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. As the Taoiseach stated in this House, the question of whether a person should be prosecuted and for what criminal offence is the responsibility of the DPP. Nor is it right to expect that the Taoiseach or the Minister should know if there are other cases that could be affected in which Dr. Harbison was involved. This is a matter entirely for the DPP.</P>
    <P>My motivation for raising this matter on the Adjournment is the lessons, if any, we can learn from what has happened and if there is anything else we, as public representatives and legislators, can do to ensure inasmuch as is possible this does not happen again. It would be a good idea if the Minister or the Attorney General, on his behalf, contacted the Director of Public Prosecutions to explore whether there are legislative provisions which should, or could, be made to deal with a situation such as this one. I accept the procedures in place to conduct a criminal prosecution are there for a good reason but I also believe it would be remiss of us not to look at these procedures again in the light of the reason for the DPPs decision in the Laide case.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister or his officials looked at the state pathology services in other jurisdictions and at how they operate? I understand that in Scotland, for example, it is general practice for two state pathologists to carry out an autopsy. This means that if one of the pathologists is unable to <Col N="803"/>attend before the court, for whatever reason, for cross-examination, the other pathologist can take his or her place. Surely it would be a good idea for us to consider introducing the same practice.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The criminal justice system has served this country well over the years. It is important the public keeps faith in our justice system. I urge the Government to carefully examine what lessons can be learned from the DPP's decision not to go ahead with the prosecution of Mr. Laide due to the ill-health of Dr. Harbison. I ask the Minister and his officials to examine the state pathology services in other common law countries to see if there are lessons we can learn. I ask the Minister to ensure procedures are put in place by the State pathology service to ensure, in as far as is possible, this does not happen again.</P>
    <P>My motivation in raising this important matter is to ensure we have the best possible State pathology service available to our criminal justice system. As a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I am proud of the massive additional resources, both financial and legislative, this Government has made available across the criminal justice system since 1997. I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s contribution, particularly any ideas he has in regard to dealing with the issues raised by the DPPs decision of this week.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to speak on this important issue. I record my appreciation of the public service of Deputy Rabbitte who has consistently raised this issue since it came into the public domain and who insisted on having the serious aspects clarified fully, which is what we are trying to do this evening. I fully support his efforts in that regard. We had the usual off-the-cuff comments from the Minister when the issue first broke. He talked about using depositions in the course of a trial. He knows full well the issue will not be resolved by such an approach. A trial is <i>de novo</i> and anybody accused of a serious charge must be entitled to cross-examine the evidence in front of him or her.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to comment on the Dermot Laide case arising out of the unfortunate death of Brian Murphy. There is misfortune and sadness on all sides there. However, I wish to touch on a number of general issues. It is quite clear that Dr. Harbison will no longer be available to give evidence in court and that calls for two responses. I pay tribute to him for his service to the nation over many years and we must consider the consequences of his unavailability. There was clearly a conflict between the conclusions he drew in regard to the Laide case and those of the current State pathologist, Dr. Marie Cassidy. Again, we must consider if there are any consequences to be drawn from that.</P>
    <P>The first issue touched on by Deputy Rabbitte is how exposed is the criminal justice system as a result of the situation which has arisen. How <Col N="804"/>many cases are outstanding? A number of spokesmen &mdash; anonymous people &mdash; have commented but do we have an idea as to whether cases will be affected due to the fact that Dr. Harbison&rsquo;s evidence will no longer be available? Could charges or convictions be affected? Are there appeals before the courts? Is there a possibility of retrials arising, particularly in cases where Dr. Harbison&rsquo;s evidence was crucial to a conviction? The public is keen to be given some indication as to the consequences arising from the recent developments.</P>
    <P>The second issue which arises is that it is quite clear we have been operating a State pathology system on a shoestring. That has been the case for many years. Dr. Harbison was appointed State pathologist in 1974. At that stage, he was under contract to the Attorney General. He was then transferred to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and, ultimately, he was transferred to the Department of Justice in 1996. We tend to associate him with murders or manslaughters, but we must bear in mind that the State pathology service must be at the scene of a suspicious death as quickly as possible to be able to tell the Garda that it should follow a certain line of action and that it must treat it as having criminal dimensions or to be able to tell it the death was as a result of natural causes. Every suspicious case must be looked at by the State pathology service, not only the 50 murders or manslaughters each year. We are talking about hundreds of cases each year. From that point of view, it is clear the office has been under-resourced over the years.</P>
    <P Just="Left">By coincidence, I tabled a parliamentary question this time last year asking about the organisational structure and resourcing of the office. At that stage, the office comprised one State pathologist, one deputy State pathologist, one senior scientist and three clerical officers. It had a budget of approximately &euro;500,000. Around that time another issue arose, namely, the withdrawal of transport facilities to enable the State pathologist to get to the scene of a crime quickly. I was, and still am, very much affected by the horrific murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier in my constituency approximately ten years ago. Dr. Harbison was not able to get to the scene of that crime for 24 hours and, as a result, vital evidence was lost. Have we learned anything from that over the years? While some progress has been made, we have not fully learnt the lessons we could have learned.</P>
    <P>This is not a party issue. As a Legislature, let us understand the services given to the State and the need for a fully equipped and resourced State pathology service to ensure an effective criminal justice system and to ensure the kinds of events that have occurred will not recur. As Deputy Carey stated, let us examine practice in other countries. In England and Wales, the Home Office has approximately 40 pathologists. In Scotland there are enough to have two involved in <Col N="805"/>every case where possible criminal charges may arise. Carol Coulter summed up the matter in <i>The Irish Times</i> some days ago when she said there was no excuse for scrimping on a pathology service. We all accept this and it does not involve enormous sums of money. There is a job to be done and it should be done properly and decently. Doing this is possibly the best tribute we could pay to Professor Harbison.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for the opportunity to clarify some of the questions raised in this House and elsewhere on this subject in recent days.</P>
    <P>Brian Murphy&rsquo;s death on 31 August 2000, which date must be remembered, was a tragic loss of a young man. I know we all sympathise with his family, not only in their obvious grief on his death but also in their perception that the criminal justice system has somehow let them down. It is also fair to say there is understandable frustration in the public mind that it has not been possible to identify and hold someone to account in criminal law directly for the young man&rsquo;s death. It should be remembered that two of the accused were convicted of violent disorder arising from the incident in question. Dermot Laide, in fairness to him, has accepted the correctness of his own conviction for violent disorder.</P>
    <P>Acknowledging the family&rsquo;s frustration should not prompt us, as politicians, to gloss over the complexity of the matter or lash out at convenient scapegoats. It is evident that the elaborate investigation into Brian Murphy&rsquo;s death presented very real challenges for the Garda. The circumstances of the incident, the number of persons involved and the impact of the extraordinary amount of alcohol apparently consumed all gave rise to significant difficulties in securing satisfactory evidence and reliably establishing causation and criminal liability to a level that would stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that very considerable efforts were made to bring prosecutions successfully. However, that the end result disappoints does not necessarily impugn the entire process or imply negligence or failure on the part of any of those involved. I will not labour the point but, as everybody in this House will recognise, there are good reasons our system requires that the burden of establishing guilt in criminal matters be a heavy one. It involves establishing proof beyond reasonable doubt. It might be tempting to some to attribute criminal responsibility at lower levels of probability or with less evidence but the end result would undoubtedly give rise to injustice.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned at the attempt to direct whatever frustration exists surrounding these events into a critique of the arrangements made for Professor Harbison&rsquo;s retirement. I prosecuted and defended in many cases in which Professor Harbison appeared as a witness and noted that he was totally professional in the way he carried <Col N="806"/>out his functions. He was, almost to a fault, prepared to concede that his own view might be wrong and to explore, with the counsel in cross-examination, alternative hypotheses. He was humble in this respect and did not state he would not budge from his point of view on the cause of death. He was prepared to deal fairly with the questions put to him by advocates on behalf of the accused where they disagreed with the view he took.</P>
    <P>To clarify matters, in January 2003 garda&iacute; suggested to a senior official of the Department that Professor Harbison should no longer take on new cases given that he was advancing in years, being then about 68 years of age. The role of State Pathologist is obviously a very onerous one, bearing in mind that murder cases take considerable time from the time of arrest to reach trial. This frequently took two years. I am about to publish, in the near future, a report dealing with the question of delay between arrest and trial in the justice system in respect of serious cases of rape and murder.</P>
    <P>In the aforementioned circumstances, the decision of the Garda to draw the Department&rsquo;s attention to the fact that a 68-year old man was in the breach in the gap dealing with these matters was prudent and reasonable. This leaves out entirely the question of cases in which no person was suspected, arrested or under charge, and in which his evidence might become relevant in three, five or eight years. Quite clearly, there was a legitimate cause for concern.</P>
    <P>Professor Harbison subsequently retired as State Pathologist and performed no new State autopsies since January 2003. The offence in question occurred in August 2000. As part of the arrangements made for his retirement, it was agreed that Professor Harbison be retained on a consultancy basis to conclude the cases in which he had been involved prior to January 2003. This was necessarily a finite number and represented a sensible means of phasing out his involvement as a witness in the backlog of cases that would arise from the autopsy and pathology work he had done on behalf of the State. On examining the matter, it is very hard to determine what alternative course of action could have been followed by the State. I believe there was none.</P>
    <P>Since January 2003, Professor Harbison has continued to give expert evidence in these cases. He has testified in the courts, has been subject to cross-examination, re-examination and examination in chief. The first suggestion I received that illness might prevent him testifying in further cases was made within the past two months when a journalist made inquiries of my press officer on the subject. On receipt of these inquiries, I was informed that Professor Harbison had indeed become unwell and might not be able to testify. My understanding is that he recently withdrew from the Brian Murphy case on the advice of his doctor.</P><Col N="807"/>
    <P>My Department has no way of determining how many cases may be outstanding as the bringing of prosecutions, retrials, etc., is entirely within the remit of the Director of Public Prosecutions. However, given that Professor Harbison has not performed any new post mortems for more than three years, it seems reasonable to infer that there is no significant number of current cases still awaiting trial. Out of deference to his privacy and in acknowledgement of his immense contribution to the State over his 28-year career, it is preferable that we consider future issues &mdash; I believe there are such issues &mdash; in general rather than in the particular context of what he has done for us.</P>
    <P>The question of the impact of non-availability of an expert or other witness on a trial gives rise to a broad range of issues of very general application. However, it should be remembered that vital witnesses become unavailable because of illness or infirmity or death. This always has a consequence for pending trials. Equally, we should recall that a violent attempt was made to take out Dr. James Donovan, who was the State&rsquo;s chief forensic scientist, by way of assassination to pervert the course of justice.</P>
    <P>Our system places significant emphasis on the provision of direct evidence which can be cross-examined and challenged. The criminal law already makes provision, in sections 14 or 15 of the 1967 Act &mdash; I may be incorrect about this &mdash; to a somewhat limited extent in respect of cases which have been returned for trial, for the taking of depositions from witnesses who may not be expected to be available when the case comes to trial. However, this does not deal with a witness with many cases on hand, in which, due to some totally unpredictable circumstance, such as accidental death or a cerebral haemorrhage, he or she would become incapable of testifying. I intend to study extending the scope of the law to a more general provision for taking account of circumstances where a witness is no longer available for certain extraordinary reasons. However, as Deputy Rabbitte noted, I will have to approach this with caution. Should we allow an exception to the hearsay rule which would, for instance, allow expert evidence in murder trials to be given on the basis of notes and reports of pathologists who are unavailable because of illness or death? There are obvious risks associated with reducing the protections available to the accused, especially where particular reliance is to be made on expert evidence. On the other hand it is reasonable to ask the question, especially in an old case. There have been cases where a person was strangled and 20 years later, somebody becomes available as an accused person either through another person&rsquo;s testimony, forensic evidence or a confession. In those cases we must ask whether it is reasonable to expect that the original pathologist who carried out the post mortem <Col N="808"/>would still be available to give oral evidence to a jury.</P>
    <P>Deputies Rabbitte and Carey referred to the suggestion that the State pathologists could operate in pairs to allow for a fallback witness in the event of one not being available to testify. This approach, which I understand is that applied in Scotland, is certainly worth considering. However, I understand Scotland has a different system from that which applies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It does not have a state pathologist of the kind that we have. It delegates and contracts out to four universities the holding of autopsies and the provision of pathological reports in respect of those offences.</P>
    <P>While it may well be prudent to provide for two people to preside at every autopsy, that would not solve every problem. To get two people to the scene of every crime as well as to the autopsy would not in every case be guaranteed. There are significant logistical and efficiency considerations which would need to be reviewed if we were routinely to double up in the assignment of expert witnesses across the board. In the du Plantier case, to which Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe referred, it was hard enough to get one person to that neck of the woods in a hurry. To get two people there at the wrong time of the year could be very difficult.</P>
    <P>We would also need to consider the possibility that such an approach might give rise to complications in the event of divergence on the part of the experts concerned. I am not too concerned about this aspect because if we have two opinions from people reviewing the same evidence, the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt, provided that both are reasonably expert. Nevertheless I am disposed to give active consideration to this option.</P>
    <P>I intend to raise these issues with Professor Marie Cassidy in the coming days and to explore carefully the various options which might be open to us. My Department is fully supportive of her work and has increased the resources available to her office in recent years. Arrangements are also under way to improve her office and laboratory facilities and to make available a driver service for when the pathologists are on call. If there are other ways in which the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform can work with her to ensure that the State pathology service continues to make an effective contribution, we will certainly pursue them.</P>
    <P>There are a number of serious problems with Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s remarks. First, no one has suggested that Professor Harbison was in any way unfit or unwell at the time he carried out the post mortem or made his findings in this case in early September 2000. Presumably his testimony in the court case accorded with his findings at that time. The report of Professor Cassidy, as she makes clear, was not done on the basis of a physical examination of the body of the late Brian Murphy or on the basis of access to Professor Harbison&rsquo;s <Col N="809"/>report on the issue. It would be wrong to infer, as Deputy Rabbitte seems to have done, that Professor Harbison&rsquo;s evidence was wrong or that he would, if in good health, have been unable to defend and validate his original findings. I assume that Professor Harbison prepared a report on Brian Murphy&rsquo;s post mortem in 2000 and that he was extensively and rigorously examined and cross-examined by counsel for all the accused about that report at the trial in February 2004. Nobody has suggested to me that in some way he ducked out of cross-examination or that the jury did not hear him put to the test on his testimony.</P>
    <P>Equally it is wrong to suggest that the Department was aware of any problem with Professor Harbison&rsquo;s health before such problems became known to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. That office is intimately acquainted with criminal investigations and is in direct communications and privity with the Garda regarding witnesses, evidence and the quality of evidence. These matters are not discussed generally in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>In answer to one of Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s questions, I have never been given any information that would lead me to believe that any testimony in any other case given by Professor Harbison was suspect or unreliable. I presume in all those cases counsel was available to cross-examine and challenge anything that seemed unlikely or untrue.</P>
    <P>It is wholly wrong to suggest that the Government is at sixes and sevens on the outcome of this case. The case is one in which the Director of Public Prosecutions has charge and responsibility. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not involved in cases of this type and is not in a position to answer detailed questions about the case or its progress. It follows that the Taoiseach of the day is not in a position to answer in detail on these matters. We have an independent system and the Taoiseach is not in a position at Leaders&rsquo; Questions to give the House authoritative or clear indications of factors which did or did not come into play in any particular prosecution. Long may that be the case.</P>

    <P Just="Left">I will finish by making a very simple point. I reiterate my sympathy to the parents of Brian Murphy. I pass on my best wishes to a loyal servant of the State, Professor John Harbison, for all he has done for it. In this case, there is no conspiracy, there is no smoking gun and there is no appalling suppression of the truth or anything <Col N="811"/>else. All Professor Harbison&rsquo;s testimony has always been generous. As I said, those who witnessed him testifying said that his testimony is characterised by an overweening willingness to concede the possibility that he is wrong. His testimony has been tested by skilled advocates in courts of law established under the Constitution. Therefore, I assure the House that this is not a case in which there is some concealment or disguising of what happened. We can learn lessons from this straightforward set of circumstances.</P>

     <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
     <Quest>her views on the &euro;160 million bill to settle the 1,300 claims for alleged medical negligence lodged with the State Claims Agency; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The estimated cost of settling the 1,300 claims notified to the State Claims Agency since the establishment of the clinical indemnity scheme in July 2002 is based on advice received from consulting actuaries appointed by the State Claims Agency and my Department. The estimate of &euro;160 million is the projected cost of settling these claims over the ten years or so that it will take to dispose of them. There is now some evidence to suggest that we are witnessing a decline in the number of claims arising from medical malpractice. This trend has been observed in Ireland and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The sum of &euro;160 million is still a considerable sum of money and several other uses could be found for it within the health services. However this only represents the projected financial cost of compensating patients who have suffered injury as a result of medical error. It does not include the other costs which medical error imposes on the health service such as increased lengths of stay and additional treatment required to deal with the clinical consequences of error. It does not, and cannot, measure the additional pain and suffering endured by the victims of medial error and their families.</P>
    <P>We know from international research studies that most medical error is avoidable. In order to understand the nature and causes of the mistakes which occur in hospitals and elsewhere we need to collect and analyse whatever data we can generate on claims and the adverse events which give rise to claims. In establishing the clinical indemnity scheme the Department decided that each health agency covered by the scheme would be provided with access to an IT system for notifying its claims to the State Claims Agency and for recording and analysing its own adverse events. <Col N="814"/>Ireland is one of the first countries in the world to establish such an electronic network for this purpose. It has the potential to make a major contribution to patient safety and thereby reduce the future financial and human cost of medical error.</P>
    <P>Another of the initiatives taken in this area is the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority. It will have overall responsibility for the promotion of safety and quality in the health service. It will take over responsibility for health service accreditation and for the establishment of standards and promulgation of best practice. We also have approximately 200 clinical risk managers working on improving patient safety in agencies funded by the Health Service Executive.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for the collection and reporting of waiting lists and waiting times for inpatient hospital treatment falls within the remit of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF. Based on the latest information provided to the NTPF by Beaumont Hospital there were 351 patients waiting for elective neurosurgical procedures in mid-April 2006. This represents a decrease of approximately 18% on the number reported in September 2005 of 426. The decrease in the number waiting more than 12 months is even greater at 40%. The NTPF is continuing to work with Beaumont Hospital to refer eligible and suitable patients for treatment. However, there is limited capacity in the private sector for neurosurgery especially for specialised cases and complex patients.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a media report some time back referring to a meeting last September between the Secretary General of my Department and the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive about <Col N="815"/>my initiative to free up public hospital beds for public patients.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that there is no question of a lack of accountability by or within my Department or the HSE. Both organisations operate under intense parliamentary and media scrutiny.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note a relevant comment in the Travers report to the effect that &ldquo;any over emphasis on note-taking and recording of the minutae... would undermine the establishment of the mutual confidence essential to a productive working relationship&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is an open and business-like working relationship between my Department and the HSE with frequent written and oral contacts. While there must be appropriate written communication, an over-reliance on the transmission of formal letters from one organisation to the other is not the way to develop the mutual understanding, trust and confidence essential to a productive working relationship. Such a relationship is essential if the Department and the HSE are to work together with the single aim of delivering the best possible health and personal social services within the resources made available by the Government.</P>

     <Quest>the steps she intends to take to strengthen tuberculosis control measures in order to meet a World Health Organisation target to eliminate the disease by 2050; the plans she has in place to ensure thorough tracing of patients who have been in contact with a tuberculosis patient to prevent spread of the disease; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>In January 2006, the WHO Stop TB Partnership launched the Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015. This plan sets out actions towards a world free of tuberculosis. The plan outlines what needs to be done to make an impact on the global burden of TB and to achieve the partnership&rsquo;s goal of reducing TB deaths and disease by 50% by 2015. The WHO goal for 2050 is the elimination of TB as a public health problem.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, there has been an overall downward trend in notification of tuberculosis. The combination of better living conditions, antibiotics against TB and the BCG vaccine has dramatically reduced the number of cases of TB in Ireland. In 2003 the total number of cases notified nationally was 407.</P>
    <P>The National TB Advisory Committee and the National Immunisation Advisory Committee keep policy under review. The National TB Advisory Committee advises that there are four components to a successful TB control prog<Col N="816"/>ramme: BCG vaccination; early detection; early treatment; and early contact tracing. The committee also recommends that the universal neonatal BCG vaccination programme should be continued in Ireland for the immediate future with the aim of moving later to a selective BCG vaccination programme which targets high risk groups. The National Immunisation Advisory Committee recommends BCG vaccine for all newborn babies. There is currently a national screening programme for TB in respect of asylum seekers, as these individuals may come from countries with a higher incidence of TB.</P>
    <P>The International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease has stipulated that a well functioning TB programme is one of the criteria for countries &mdash; with low prevalence of TB &mdash; to have attained prior to discontinuing a universal neonatal BCG programme. A well functioning TB programme must have the structures and processes in place to ensure early detection of cases, institution of appropriate treatment in a timely manner, early identification of non-compliers and the capacity and facilities to institute supervised therapy where appropriate. In light of this a subgroup of the National TB Advisory Committee has been established to propose a model for ensuring an effective TB control programme in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The objectives of contact tracing are to identify contacts who are likely to have been infected recently and may require preventive therapy, to identify contacts with active disease who require curative therapy, and to identify and treat the original source of the infection. Contact tracing of one case may often involve screening of a large number of people, including household, school and workplace contacts. The minimisation of risk to contacts is dependent on close co-operation between clinicians who must notify cases promptly and public health staff who ensure that thorough contact tracing is carried out.</P>

I also visited Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda in 2005. I look forward to visiting Cavan and Monaghan General Hospitals as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, management of acute hospital services in the north eastern region is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, HSE. The HSE has an obligation to provide safe systems of health care and related services for patients and clients to the highest possible quality. It also has responsibility for providing a safe working environment for all staff.</P>
    <P>The HSE has advised my Department that it is working to consolidate and strengthen management structures at the acute hospital sites referred to by the Deputy. In this regard, the Health Service Executive has procured a consultancy to examine acute hospital services in the north east, to include an evaluation of the risks associated with the provision of acute services on five sites serving a population of approximately 350,000. This review is due to be completed next month.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the clinical, nursing and management staff in the north east are working together to achieve our shared goal of a quality health care system for all. The Government is committed to supporting them in the provision of high quality, cost effective and responsive services across the health system.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for improvements in specialist health services in the former Midland Health Board region rests with the Health Service Executive, HSE. The executive has <Col N="818"/>advised that a number of capital and service developments have been progressed in the area in recent years to facilitate the improvement of specialist health services in the region. Principal among the capital developments that have been progressed are: building work on a new hospital on the campus of the Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore is almost complete; a major capital development at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise is near completion. A new 50-bed acute psychiatric unit and a new 25-bed paediatric unit were commissioned in May 2004 as part of this development and work on a new accident and emergency unit commenced in March this year. A 12-bed assessment unit at the Midland Regional Hospital at Mullingar has been commissioned.</P>
    <P>In addition to these capital developments, a number of service developments have also been progressed in the area in recent years including: the development of a consultant-led oncology service based at Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore; cardiology services and consultant-led accident and emergency services at the three Midland Regional Hospital sites; the appointment of consultant paediatricians at Mullingar and Portlaoise; the commissioning of a renal dialysis unit at Tullamore; and the provision of special care baby units at Mullingar and Portlaoise which are facilitating the earlier return of premature babies to the area from the Dublin maternity hospitals. I am satisfied that the above capital and service developments will significantly expand and improve the range of specialist services available to residents in the area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 76 together.</P>
    <P>On 3 February last, the Health Service Executive published a report which was prepared by McKinsey &amp; Co., on the delivery of tertiary paediatric services in this country. This report was commissioned by the HSE following my request to it to arrange a review of those services.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that best outcomes for children would be obtained by developing one national tertiary paediatric centre, which would <Col N="819"/>also provide all secondary paediatric services for the greater Dublin area. The report also recommends that ideally the new facility should be located on the site of, or adjacent to, a major adult teaching hospital in order to achieve the maximum service benefit for children.</P>
    <P>Arising from the report&rsquo;s recommendations, a joint HSE-Department of Health and Children task group was established to progress matters and to advise on the optimal location for the new facility. The task group has worked intensively over the past six weeks and, in the course of its deliberations, a number of important issues arose that were not included in the group&rsquo;s original remit. In particular, the importance of co-location with a maternity unit has been identified as an issue of significance. In addition, a number of proposals have been received from the private sector in relation to the building of the new facility. The task group&rsquo;s remit has, accordingly, been extended to allow the group to examine the issues which have arisen, as a consequence of which the group is now expected to report around the end of May.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Prior to the establishment of the Health Service Executive, parliamentary questions concerning access to services, by individuals or in specific geographic areas, were referred to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board-ERHA for direct reply. The establishment of the HSE brought into being a new unitary system for the delivery and management of health services at local, regional and national level.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary questions can differ very substantially in the complexity of the subject matter or the extent of the detail sought. Where a question relates to the provision of a service provided by the HSE on a national basis or requests statistical information in relation to a service covering a period of years, it may require the collation of information from a number of different sources. The collation of such information is co-ordinated and monitored by the parliamentary affairs division of the HSE to ensure that a complete and comprehensive reply is compiled and issued in response to these questions.</P>
    <P>My Department has been informed that where a parliamentary question relates to the execu<Col N="820"/>tive&rsquo;s responsibility for the provision of services on a national basis, a single response will issue from the appropriate HSE directorate. It is not intended that separate responses would issue from the former health board areas.</P>
    <P Just="Left">If the Deputy has specific concerns on the operation of the HSE in this regard, I would encourage her to contact the HSE parliamentary affairs division. The chief executive officer of the HSE wrote to Members on 1 March 2006 setting out initiatives being taken by the executive to handle inquiries from Members. The letter provided details of a dedicated e-mail address through which Members may submit inquiries to the HSE, and of two dedicated telephone numbers in the HSE&rsquo;s central parliamentary affairs office to enable Members to obtain assistance with inquiries.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 67, 101, 111, 139 and 144 together.</P>
    <P>Tackling the current difficulties with accident and emergency departments is the Government&rsquo;s top priority in health. The service being provided to some patients in accident and emergency departments is unacceptable and must be improved. Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in accident and emergency departments and do not require admission.</P>
    <P>The HSE is continuing to implement my ten point action plan. In addition, it has been agreed with the HSE that a number of additional measures will be implemented by the executive. These include in particular the setting of performance targets for individual hospitals. In terms of implementation, the HSE is taking the following approach: tackling the issue on a hospital-by-hospital basis; developing hospital-specific time-based targets in relation to accident and emergency departments and delayed discharges; development of financial incentives linked to performance in these areas; and development of additional targeted initiatives aimed at delivering an immediate and sustained impact.</P>
    <P>In the immediate term, the HSE is introducing a series of measures to improve facilities for patients and staff in accident and emergency departments. Long-term care beds are being secured from within the private sector to facilitate the discharge of patients who have completed the acute phase of their care. The acute beds that become available as a result of this initiative will be ring-fenced for those patients awaiting admission in accident and emergency departments. Funding is being made available within the capital programme to develop admissions lounges to ensure that patient privacy, dignity and comfort are preserved while awaiting admission to an acute bed.</P>
    <P>Funding has been provided for an additional 900 acute beds-day places since the publication of the Review of Acute Hospital Bed Capacity in 2002. More than 800 of these are in place, and the HSE has advised that the remainder will come on-stream over the coming months. A further 450 acute beds-day places are in various stages of planning and development under the capital investment framework.</P><Col N="822"/>
    <P>I share Professor Drumm&rsquo;s views that the achievement of improvements in accident and emergency services is dependent on fundamental changes both in hospitals and in other areas of the health service. It is not just a question of putting extra acute beds in place. In this regard, measures being examined by the HSE include: improvements in the processes and procedures in hospitals to ensure that they operate in the most efficient and effective way; the introduction of rigorous admission and discharge planning processes; the broadening of access to diagnostic facilities; and the enhancement and development of primary and community care services.</P>
    <P>The HSE has established a dedicated task force to oversee the implementation of the framework for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of services in our accident and emergency departments. The task force will support individual hospitals in identifying specific problems and addressing them. It will work with hospitals to introduce a system of &ldquo;whole hospital&rdquo; performance measures to improve the patient&rsquo;s journey not alone through the accident and emergency department but through the hospital system from admission to discharge.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently in discussions with the Department of Finance and the Health Service Executive to agree increases in the employment ceiling for the health sector. My Department is advised by the executive that a significant number of staff have been recruited under the accident and emergency action plan.</P>
    <P>I am confident that by improving hospital processes and procedures, by providing additional step-down beds for those patients who do not require acute hospital care, and by expanding and enhancing primary and community care services we can achieve a sustained improvement in our accident and emergency services.</P>

	<P>Section 24 of the Health Act 2004 empowers the HSE to engage such advisers as it considers necessary for the performance of its functions. Any fees due to an adviser so engaged are payable by the HSE out of funds at its disposal.</P>
    <P>As part of the arrangements for the appointment of Professor Brendan Drumm as chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive, the board of the HSE agreed that support and advisory resources would be provided for the implementation of the health service reform programme.

I am advised that the HSE has reserved the right to renegotiate the <i>per diem </i>rate if additional days in excess of 20% are required.

	<P>The best health for children programme provides a core surveillance programme for all children in the 0-12 age group and covers both pre-school developmental examinations as well as the school health service. The best health for children programme first introduced national recommendations on child health screening and <Col N="824"/>surveillance in 1999 and these were further revised in 2004.</P>
    <P>The recommended programme of pre-school developmental examinations for children includes a number of health checks from birth: metabolic screening; developmental assessments; hearing assessments; vision screening; medical examinations; growth monitoring; and oral and dental examinations.</P>
    <P>Current recommendations for child health screening that should be offered to children attending primary schools are as follows: health assessment at school entry with follow up selective medical examination, where necessary; hearing screening at school entry; and vision screening at school entry and school exit.</P>
    <P>There are no other schemes to provide annual health checks for persons under 16 years of age or under 18 years of age and I have no plans at present to introduce such a scheme. The cost of providing this service would be dependent on the fee charged by the provider, the nature and extent of the health check and whether any consequential treatment would be included in such a scheme.</P>

	<P>In November 2005, a sub-committee of the HSE&rsquo;s National Primary and Community Care Reform Working Group was established to review the current status of GP access to diagnostics; to explore current and potential capacity; and make short, medium and long-term recommendations.</P>
    <P>I am advised that work is being undertaken at present to progress two specific initiatives. One is the development of a service to facilitate the transportation of diagnostic specimens from GP surgeries to laboratories. The key objective of this initiative is to increase the current national provision of such a service from 36% to 60% of the population in 2006. Implementing this initiative requires examination of existing and development capacity of transportation and laboratory services, together with the development of joint protocols to encompass delivery of the service. The HSE has indicated that this work is in progress.</P>
    <P>The other initiative is the development of a radiology-ultrasound initiative. The key objective of this initiative is to reduce waiting times for GP referrals nationally to a maximum of four weeks for plain film X-rays and eight weeks for ultrasound tests. There are a number of complex factors to be considered in order to meet this objective. These relate to capacity of the current <Col N="825"/>services, the use of both public and private providers, infrastructure, hours of service and engagement arrangements.</P>
    <P>The HSE has established a governance group to oversee the implementation of these initiatives. In addition to these specific initiatives, the group will also be progressing other medium and longer-term recommendations in relation to referral guidelines; and developing diagnostic capacity at primary and community service level to reduce the reliance on the acute sector and to enhance clients&rsquo; experiences of diagnostic services and their outcomes.</P>

It will also have the power to investigate, at the request of the Minister or the HSE, the safety, quality and standards of any service and make whatever recommendations it deems necessary.

	<P>Last July I announced the Government&rsquo;s plan for a national network of radiation oncology services to be put in place by 2011, commencing in 2008. The network will consist of four large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital. The Health Service Executive in association with the National Development Finance Agency and my Department is currently developing the output specifications for the delivery of substantial additional capacity through a public private partnership.</P>
    <P>I am determined to continue to build on the substantial developments and increased capacity <Col N="826"/>in cancer care so that we have a world class service available and accessible to patients in each region in the country. I have received a Strategy for Cancer Control in Ireland from the National Cancer Forum. The strategy makes recommendations in relation to organisation, governance, quality assurance and accreditation across the continuum of cancer care from prevention and health promotion through to treatment services, palliative care and research. There is a strong emphasis in the strategy on health promotion, addressing inequalities and quality assurance. My Department is currently examining the strategy with a view to bringing proposals to Government shortly. I will publish the strategy shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>The issue of the establishment of oncology wards relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

	<P>As part of budget 2006, &euro;150 million was allocated to services for older people and palliative care. This is the largest ever increase in funding for services for older people. At the heart of this funding package is a determination to improve home and community-based supports with almost three quarters, &euro;109 million of the 2006 full year costs, being committed to the support of care in the community. Among other things this package includes additional funding for home support packages, day and respite care and sheltered housing for older people. All the measures contained in the package are targeted at older people, including those with dementia.</P>
    <P>Among the areas where funding has been provided are day care and respite care which are an integral part of delivering a comprehensive community service for older people. Day care and respite care offer respite for family members and-or carers and provide social stimulation in a safe environment for older people with mild forms of dementia. The provision of an additional &euro;9 million in a full year will allow for 1,325 additional places per week in these centres together with additional programmes for specific needs such as activity therapy. It also means that many day care centres can increase the number of days per week they open.</P><Col N="827"/>
    <P>The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including services for older people, were considered in the context of the work of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, which published its report entitled A Vision for Change on 24 January 2006. The Government accepted the expert group&rsquo;s report as the basis for the future development of the mental health services and in 2006 made an additional &euro;25 million available to the Health Service Executive to develop the service.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Executive advised that following the publication in 1999 of the National Council for Ageing and Older People&rsquo;s report entitled Action Plan for Dementia, each of the former health boards incorporated the report&rsquo;s 33 recommendations in their action plans and annual service plans as part of the development of services for older people. Progress has been made in implementing the recommendations in each health service area. The Health Service Executive also advised that as the implementation of the recommendations will have varied across the former boards, it established a working group to draw together a co-ordinated approach to the implementation, which is due to report its findings in the second half of 2006.</P>

	<P>Staff in the official agencies contracted by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, carry out checks on traceability and labelling on a routine basis or as required; however, during the period in question no such checks were carried out. In 2006, the authority proposes to conduct a series of such checks on various sectors of the food industry in conjunction with its official agencies. The results of these audits will be published and where a deliberate intention to mislead the consumer is identified, <Col N="828"/>enforcement action will be taken against the food businesses concerned.</P>
    <P>The official agencies contracted by the FSAI for the purposes of labelling and traceability are the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Health Service Executive and the local authorities. Approximately 880 whole time equivalent staff are available to those agencies for food control purposes and the FSAI has allocated approximately &euro;600,000 for control inspections in 2006.</P>
    <P>The audit of the 90 food premises in question was conducted by the authority&rsquo;s chief audit manager and three audit managers. In addition to the salary costs of these personnel, travelling and subsistence costs for the purposes of the audit amounted to approximately &euro;16,000. There were also some testing costs for which a separate figure is not available, as these costs are included in the general costs of testing.</P>
    <P>Following this audit, the FSAI provided each of the official agencies with a copy of the report on those premises under their supervision which were inspected. The authority has confirmed that follow up action was taken by way of additional visits and inspections and that the matters which required attention have now been rectified.</P>
    <P>The audit identified a training need in the areas of recall and traceability and labelling. Consequently, the FSAI devised and delivered training sessions to more than 500 field staff in its official agencies. The training was designed to allow enforcement officers to gain an understanding of the type of audit carried out, the issues which arose and to enable the enforcement officers to carry out similar labelling, traceability and recall audits on an ongoing basis. It was also evident that there was a need to remind industry of its responsibilities regarding traceability and recall and as a result the FSAI participated in a number of industry seminars dealing specifically with these issues.</P>

	<P>The primary care strategy is the roadmap for the future development of primary care services in Ireland over a period of some ten years, both as the appropriate service for the delivery of the majority of people&rsquo;s health and social care needs and to complement the services provided by acute hospitals. At the heart of the strategy is the aim of developing services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, home helps, occupational therapists and others.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Executive has informed me that all GPs have by now received a letter from their local health manager inviting expressions of interest in becoming involved with the HSE in the further development of primary care services, and in particular in the formation of primary care teams either this year or in coming years. I am encouraged to learn that in excess of 1,000 general practitioners have responded positively to this invitation.</P>
    <P>Following the identification by the HSE of the GPs to be involved in the development of primary care teams in 2006, a considerable amount of work will be required to realign HSE services to give best efficiencies for team-working and to determine ideal team compositions to meet the needs of identified areas.

	<P>The new contract will set out in detail formal employment arrangements for consultants practising exclusively in the public sector. Its key features can be summarised as follows. It provides for a consultant-provided service &mdash; a service delivered by teams of consultants, where the consultants have a substantial and direct involvement in the diagnosis, delivery of care and overall management of patients. As part of a consultant-provided service, consultants will treat all patients and will be remunerated exclusively on a salaried basis, that is, they will not receive additional remuneration for treatment delivered to insured patients. A commitment to public sector service alone will mean that consultants will treat patients only within the public hospital or <Col N="831"/>public community facility. Each consultant&rsquo;s commitments will be set out in an annual work plan, supported by a series of performance indicators and review mechanisms. Work plans will be in line with clinical need, the nature and volume of clinical workload and the 24-seven nature of health services. Consultants will work a 39-hour commitment over the 24-seven period agreed and detailed in the work plan, varying by specialty and location. Work plans will follow a framework developed at national level and will be agreed- reviewed annually by consultants, clinical managers and management. Each work plan will detail specific duties, for example, emergency commitments, operating time, ward rounds, outpatient clinics and diagnostic work; regular on-call commitments and involvement in supporting professional activities, audit and competence assurance.</P>
    <P>Each consultant will work as an integral part of a multidisciplinary team, which is led and managed by a clinical director. As a member of the team, consultants will make decisions regarding the care, treatment and discharge of patients during the absence of a consultant colleague who has lead responsibility for such patients. As a member of a team, each consultant will be incentivised to increase productivity through a performance-related awards scheme. The primary role of a clinical director will be to manage and plan how services are delivered. Clinical directors will be appointed by the employing authority; they will develop and implement protocols for service delivery; they will have significant responsibility for how services are delivered; and they will be accountable for the use of resources. In regard to medical education and training, contracts can be constructed for certain consultants that will allow for a defined and measurable commitment to medical education and training and research.</P>
    <P>A position paper outlining these proposals on a new employment contract for consultants working in the public health system was tabled by management at a plenary meeting on 26 January 2006. However, at a further meeting on 9 February, the medical organisations refused to engage in substantive discussions on these proposals and talks were adjourned. While the next meeting between management and the consultant representative bodies has not yet been arranged, the independent chairman is maintaining contact with both sides with a view to arranging the resumption of substantive and intensive negotiations at an early date.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 163 to 167, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>The Strategic Task Force on Alcohol was established in January 2002 and was given a remit to recommend specific evidence based measures to Government to prevent and reduce alcohol related harm. It has published two reports which together provide approximately 100 recommendations across a wide range of sectors. Significant progress has already been made across Departments in implementing the task force&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
    <P>Legislative measures which have been adopted include the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 which assists in regulating availability. &ldquo;Happy hours&rdquo; have been abolished and restrictions on the access of children to licensed premises have been introduced. The Road Traffic Act 2003 extended the grounds for requesting a breath test to detect alcohol and the Minister for Transport has indicated his commitment to the introduction of random breath testing.</P>
    <P>A Voluntary Code of Practice on Alcohol Advertising has been agreed between the Department of Health and Children and the drinks, media and advertising industries. This addresses many of the concerns in relation to alcohol advertising. The T&aacute;naiste indicated her intention to introduce legislation if there is insufficient adherence to the voluntary code.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has also been made in terms of research projects, the delivery of responsible server training, awareness-raising campaigns etc. Community mobilisation projects have been identified internationally as one of the most effective measures at reducing alcohol related harm. have been allocated to the Health Service Executive to support such projects here.</P><Col N="834"/>
    <P>The recommendations of the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol, together with those of the Working Group on Alcohol Misuse established under Sustaining Progress, constitute my Department&rsquo;s policy on alcohol and there are currently no plans to produce a further written policy.</P>
    <P>The executive functions of this Department have transferred to the Health Service Executive which will now have responsibility for progressing many of the recommendations outlined in these reports. It is a matter for the HSE to decide on the structural requirements and levels of expertise needed in this regard. Currently there are no plans to establish an office of alcohol control or to appoint a national adviser on alcohol policy in this Department. I am confident that the implementation of the recommendations will lead to a reduction in alcohol related harm and its associated cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The issue of the information contained on labels on alcoholic beverages was considered by the working group on alcohol, which was established to help mobilise the stakeholders through social partnership to achieve a targeted and measurable reduction in alcohol misuse. The report recommended that a group, representative of all relevant stakeholders, would be established to consider what useful information could be included on non-draught alcohol products, taking account of international evidence. Any future action on the recommendations contained in that report, including the issue of the information on labels, will involve consultation with all the appropriate stakeholders including experts on foetal alcohol syndrome.</P>
    <P>The views of the working group on alcohol in relation to below cost selling of alcohol and the abolition of the groceries order were conveyed to the T&aacute;naiste for discussion at Cabinet.</P>

     <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
     <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the latest studies from the United States which indicate that fluoride should not be added to water for a variety of health reasons; the reason she does not accept the findings of this report; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Fluoridation of public water supplies as a public health measure is accepted as being one of the most effective methods of ensuring against tooth decay. The World Health Organisation, WHO, recommends fluoridation of public water supplies and has stated that &ldquo;fluoridation of water supplies, where possible, is the most effective public health measure for the prevention of dental decay&rdquo;. The WHO has also stated that &ldquo;people of all ages, including the elderly, benefit from community water fluoridation&rdquo;.</P><Col N="835"/>
    <P>The recently completed survey of oral health, covering the whole island of Ireland, shows that fluoridation of public water supplies continues to be a highly effective public health measure. It has contributed significantly to a major reduction in the incidence of dental decay in the Republic of Ireland. This compares favourably with the incidence of dental decay in Northern Ireland, which has significantly higher rates of dental decay and which does not have fluoridated water supplies.</P>
    <P>The research carried out shows that, at the levels of usage of fluoride in the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s public water supply, there is no risk to health. Fluoridation of the water supply in Ireland is limited to a maximum of one part per million. In this regard, the WHO and the European Union have identified that fluoridation levels below 1.5 parts per million are acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health was established in 2004. The terms of reference for the expert body are: to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the Forum on Fluoridation; to advise the Minister and evaluate ongoing research &mdash; including new emerging issues &mdash; on all aspects of fluoride and its delivery methods as an established health technology and as required; and to report to the Minister on matters of concern at his or her request or on its own initiative. The expert body is currently examining the reports referred to by the Deputy and will report on its findings to me when its deliberations have been completed.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive has informed my Department that all acute hospitals were notified that the second national hygiene audit was being carried out between February and April 2006. Visits to hospitals were again random and unannounced with hospitals unaware of their audit date.</P>
    <P>The audit tool being used for both audits is the Infection Control Nurses Association Audit Tool. This audit tool includes a number of questions which the auditors pose to different staff members during the audit. Best practice by all hospitals in preparing for the audits should be to ensure that staff are familiar with the audit tool and that they are capable of responding to questions posed by the auditors. I am satisfied that the <Col N="836"/>audits are resulting in an increased awareness and resolve in all hospitals to attain the necessary high standards in cleaning and hygiene.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 186 together.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, talks on a new consultant contract commenced on 24 November 2005 under the independent chairmanship of Mr. Mark Connaughton SC. At that meeting, and a further plenary meeting in December, both the IHCA and the IMO indicated that they required a number of issues to be addressed before they could engage in substantive negotiations on a new contract.</P>
    <P>While some of these issues remain unresolved, a position paper outlining proposals on a new employment contract for consultants working in the public health system was tabled by management at a plenary meeting on 26 January 2006. The medical organisations have not so far engaged in substantive discussions on these proposals. At a further meeting on 9 February the talks were adjourned.</P>
    <P>While a further meeting between management and the consultant representative bodies has not been arranged, the independent chairman is maintaining contact with both sides with a view to arranging a formula to effect the resumption of substantive and intensive negotiations at an early date. I am anxious for the negotiations to be concluded within a reasonable timeframe and I have the utmost confidence in the chairman&rsquo;s efforts to achieve that.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 142 and 149 together.</P>
    <P>The practice of pharmacy is governed by the Pharmacy Acts 1875 to 1962. The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland is the regulatory body for the pharmacy profession. It works closely with pharmacists and other relevant authorities, such as the Health Service Executive, to ensure the safeguards under pharmacy and medicines legislation covering the sale and provision of medicines to the public are complied with.</P>
    <P>The Pharmacy Acts are in need of updating and modernisation to reflect the current environment in which pharmacy services are provided. On foot of the recommendations of the pharmacy review group, the Government approved in June 2005 to commence the process of drafting new pharmacy legislation. The purpose of the planned legislation is to ensure the highest standards from pharmacists and the safe and effective delivery of pharmaceutical services.</P>
    <P>The heads and general scheme of the first of two planned pharmacy Bills have now been drawn up. The first Bill will provide a modern statutory framework for the governance of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the profession. It will introduce fitness to practice regulations for pharmacists and, as a consequence, allow for the removal of the restriction on pharmacists educated in other EU or EEA countries from owning, managing or supervising a pharmacy in Ireland that is less than three years old. It will also update the registration process for the profession.</P>
    <P>The second Bill will deal with pharmacy practice and the delivery of pharmaceutical services. It will address the regulation of pharmacy and pharmacy services, general provisions on community pharmacy contracts for services, and any remaining recommendations of the pharmacy review group. Work will commence on this second Bill as soon as the first Bill has been completed.</P>

	<P>In line with information and evidence available internationally, the Department of Health and Children has consistently stated that a human influenza pandemic would have serious consequences. A global pandemic will affect all countries and will cause widespread disease, death and disruption to the health services and to society.</P>
    <P>Pandemic preparedness planning is, therefore, a high priority for the Department of Health and Children and for the Health Service Executive. The overall aims of influenza pandemic planning are to reduce mortality and morbidity, and to <Col N="840"/>minimise the resulting disruption to society in so far as possible.</P>
    <P>This work has been ongoing for some time. A model plan for influenza pandemic preparedness was finalised in 2002. A generic public health emergency plan for the health system was prepared in 2004. This included disease-specific operational response plans for SARS, pandemic influenza and smallpox. The Deputy may be aware of the report, How Prepared is Europe for Pandemic Influenza? &mdash; Analysis of National Plans, issued by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and published in the on-line edition of <i>The Lancet</i> last week.</P>
    <P>The completeness and quality of national preparedness plans were assessed based on the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s preparedness checklist addressing levels of planning and co-ordination; surveillance; public health interventions such as public health control measures, vaccines and antivirals; health system response; maintenance of essential services; communication; and putting plans into action.</P>
    <P>The researchers acknowledge that only those plans available for analysis at the time of research, November 2005, were included in the analysis. As such, the report reflects a snapshot of the position as reflected in published documents at that time. Nevertheless, Ireland scores well in completeness of preparedness plans and is generally above the EU average in the thematic areas listed.</P>
    <P>Pandemic planning is, however, a dynamic process and work is ongoing on several fronts. The influenza pandemic expert group is updating expert guidance. The pandemic influenza operational response plan is being updated in line with the expert advice. The Department of Health and Children has established a standing interdepartmental committee to consider issues which go beyond the health aspects of an influenza pandemic. Arrangements have been made to procure a stockpile of H5N1 vaccine for key health care workers and other essential workers. The Department of Health and Children is also actively pursuing an advanced purchase order for a pandemic strain vaccine. We are stockpiling 1 million treatment packs of the antiviral drug, Tamiflu. Arrangements have also been made to purchase a supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient to treat children aged between one to five years of age. Contractual arrangements are being finalised for the stockpiling of additional supplies of the other suitable antiviral drug, Relenza.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The early child care supplement, ECS, was introduced in the 2006 budget. The scheme is under the remit of the Office of the Minister for Children. The administration of the scheme is being undertaken by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, on an agency basis.</P>
    <P>The scheme is a universal one and all parents or guardians of children up to six years of age are eligible. It is expected that a total of 260,000 families will qualify for the supplement in 2006, in respect of a total of some 350,000 children. The budget for the ECS in 2006 is &euro;265 million, and in a full year it is estimated at &euro;350 million.</P>
    <P>Eligibility for the ECS is identical to that for the child benefit scheme, in that parents who receive child benefit in respect of children under the age of six years will also receive the supplement. Both schemes fall within the definition of a family benefit under EU Regulation 1408/71. One practical effect is that where a national of an EU state is working in Ireland, the worker is entitled, if she or he has a family resident in the EU, to payment of this benefit.</P>
    <P>The situation is the same as for the child benefit scheme. The Department of Social and Family Affairs is making child benefit payments to 700 families, in respect of approximately 1,400 children, where the children are resident in another state covered by EU regulations. <Col N="842"/>Approximately 490 of these children are aged under six years and will be eligible for payment of the ECS. The majority of these children are resident in the United Kingdom, most of which are in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In addition to this stock of cases, the weekly intake of child benefit claims in respect of non-resident families is 320. It is estimated that these families will have a total of 200 children under the age of six years. It is likely that many claims are from workers who have been present in Ireland for some time, but who were unaware of their entitlement to child benefit prior to recent media attention, and if so, this rate of new claims would most likely decline over the course of the year.</P>
    <P>If, however, the rate remained constant, ECS payments of &euro;10.8 million would have accrued by the end of 2006, which would be 4% of the total projected cost of the supplement this year. It is likely, however, that only &euro;1 million of this would be paid by the end of 2006 equalling 0.3% of projected expenditure. This is due to the protracted nature of the claim decision process which involves communication with the authorities in the state in which the family resides.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs operates a strict verification process for child benefit claims and this will also apply to the ECS. The work status in Ireland is checked and birth certificates for the children obtained. It is necessary to correspond with the relevant authorities in the state where the family reside to see what entitlements may be in place there and what effect the supplement will have on payments in both states. In the course of this correspondence, particulars of the children in the family are rechecked and verified. Officials are reviewing these verification and other control measures operated for the child benefit scheme with a view to adapting and expanding them as appropriate for the ECS.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to forecast with total accuracy the future number of non-resident children qualified for this payment. This will depend on future immigration flows, the numbers of immigrants who bring their children with them, the number of immigrants who decide to return home, the number of Irish workers with children living outside the State, for example in Northern Ireland, and future birth rates. Based on current figures the expenditure in respect of non-resident children is unlikely to be significant in the context of the overall spending on the scheme.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for improvements in specialist health services in the former south-eastern Health Board area now rests with the Health Service Executive. The executive has advised that several capital developments have been progressed in recent years to facilitate the improvement of health services in the area. Principal among these are the major capital developments at South Tipperary General Hospitals in Clonmel and Cashel and the construction of an additional 19 acute beds at Wexford General Hospital. Work is also being carried out at Wexford General Hospital on the accident and emergency and outpatient departments. Plans are advancing for the provision of a new outpatient department at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>In addition, several service developments are also been progressed which will significantly improve the range of services available within the area. These include the joint appointment of a consultant radiation oncologist between Waterford Regional Hospital and Cork University Hospital, the development of a regional neurology service linking both sites, expansion of the regional haematology and nephrology services and the development of a stroke unit at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital. Plans are being developed within a national framework for the provision of radiotherapy services for the area based in Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the above capital and service developments will expand the range hospital services available to residents in the area.</P>

	<P>In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of births by caesarean section. Approximately one in five births are now performed through this procedure.</P>
    <P>The decision to perform a caesarean section is a clinical one that is taken by qualified medical practitioners. Reasons suggested for the increasing caesarean rates include more widespread availability of foetal monitoring with subsequent earlier surgical intervention and greater patient awareness and demand.</P>
    <P>At the request of the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children, the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists considered the increase in rates. In its view, there is unlikely to be a single cause responsible. However, it is suggested that better and more <Col N="844"/>comprehensive data would allow the issue to be considered in greater depth.</P>
    <P>In March 2006, I announced the establishment of a new national perinatal epidemiology centre in Cork University Hospital that will be up and running in the autumn of 2006, with annual funding of &euro;630,000. Every time a mother gives birth, the important interventions, including caesarean sections, the good outcomes and the complications will be recorded and analysed at the centre.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive has responsibility for administering the repayment scheme including the recruitment of an outside company with experience in handling mass claims to manage the scheme within the parameters agreed by the Government. The company will provide an independent assessment of the amount of repayment due to each applicant under the scheme. It will also help to reassure the public that the scheme is being operated in the most equitable and effective way possible.</P>
    <P>The executive is undertaking a procurement process to select the outside company. The timescale determined by the executive for the selection process, including the appointment of the successful company, is mid-May 2006, with repay<Col N="845"/>ments to claimants likely to commence shortly after. As the selection process is by negotiated procedure, it is not possible at this stage to indicate the expected cost of such a company administering the scheme.</P>
    <P>Consideration was given by the executive to the involvement of public sector staff to assist in administering the repayments scheme. However, the executive informed the Department of Health and Children that the time constraints of the procurement process and the potential for significant logistical difficulties and protracted delays, with consequent implications for the commencement of the repayment scheme, did not allow for this option to be implemented. The executive has also informed the Department of Health and Children that it would not be in a position to administer a repayment scheme of this magnitude with existing resources without having to divert staff from their normal functions in the delivery of health services.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the importance of progressing repayments, I have asked the executive to identify all those living patients who were wrongfully charged and to calculate the details of the repayment due to them in as many cases as possible during the period prior to the selection of the outside company. This will ensure a significant proportion of patients should receive their repayments within a short period of the company becoming operational. The executive has informed the Department of Health and Children that approximately 10,000 repayments have been calculated by the executive to date, approximately half of which relate to those who are alive.</P>

	<P>Tackling the current difficulties with accident and emergency services is the Government&rsquo;s top priority in health. The service being provided to some patients in accident and emergency departments is unacceptable and must be improved. Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in an accident and emergency ward and do not require admission. There is a need to build on the accident and emergency action plan and arising from discussions with the Health Service Executive, several proposals have been agreed, including the setting of performance targets for individual hospitals.</P><Col N="846"/>
    <P>The executive has developed and circulated a framework for improving accident and emergency services, setting out clearly the proposed approach. The recently established dedicated task force is overseeing the implementation of this framework. The task force includes accident and emergency consultants, a consultant geriatrician, a respiratory physician, a director of nursing, and a hospital chief executive, as well as full-time representatives from the National Hospitals Office and primary, community and continuing care services. The task force is supporting individual hospitals in identifying specific problems and addressing them, and working with hospitals to introduce a system of whole hospital performance measures to improve the patient&rsquo;s journey not alone through the accident and emergency department but through the hospital system from admission to discharge.</P>
    <P>I share the view expressed by the Health Service Executive chief executive that the achievement of improvements in accident and emergency services is dependent on fundamental changes both in hospitals and in other areas of the health service. I am confident that by improving hospital processes and procedures, by providing additional step-down beds for those patients who do not require acute hospital care, and by expanding and enhancing primary and community care services we can achieve a sustained improvement in our accident and emergency services.</P>

    <P>A consultant-provided service is dependent on consultants assuming a new role.

	<P>I fully appreciate the valuable role played by the home help service in enabling people who might otherwise need institutional care to remain in their own homes. I do not deny that home helps were poorly paid in the past and that this was not acceptable. However, the rate of pay and the conditions of employment for home helps have significantly improved since 2000. Home helps are paid in accordance with the agreed pay scale, &euro;25,590 to &euro;28,451 per annum, or <i>pro rata</i> thereof for part-time staff. The Health Service Executive acknowledges that prior to 2000, small contributions were made due to the low level of pay. However, since improved and standardised pay has been introduced this is no longer a factor. I understand from the Health Service Executive that there has been no recent issue or evidence to support the statement by the Deputy that there is a dependence on voluntary contributions.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the appropriate hours of care for clients requiring home help services are determined following a clinical assessment. I have ensured that significant additional funding has been provided to the HSE for home help services this year. An additional &euro;33 million full year cost was allocated to the home help programme in budget 2006, &euro;30 million of which will be for 2006 with the remaining &euro;3 million in 2007, which will enable the Health Service Executive to provide an additional 1.75 million hours nationally in 2006. The additional resource will further enhance the service and facilitate the expressed wish of many more older people to continue to live in their own homes for as long as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 187 together.</P>
    <P>The annual organ donor awareness campaign, organised by the Irish Donor Network and administered by the Irish Kidney Association, highlights the necessity for organ donation generally. The campaign, which my Department supports, highlights the need for organ donors by promoting the carrying of an organ donor card. My Department has provided financial support to the donor awareness campaign for a number of years. The grant in 2006 amounted to &euro;550,000. I launched the 2006 campaign on 28 March last.</P>
    <P>In a further measure designed to highlight the issue of organ donor awareness, arrangements were put in place recently to facilitate the distribution of organ donor cards through the community pharmacy network. The Irish Pharmaceutical Union has arranged with the Irish Kidney Association, acting on behalf of the Irish Donor Network, for pharmacies to stock organ donor cards.</P>
    <P>There are no plans to introduce a national organ donor register. Two systems, opt-in and opt-out, can be used to register an individual&rsquo;s wishes on organ donation. The former system, which operates in this country, requires that the specific consent to donation of each person, or their next-of-kin, be obtained before organs or tissues are removed. The opt-out system presumes that all citizens consent to donation unless they have specifically registered a wish to the contrary.</P>
    <P>The practice in this country is that, even when a person has indicated his or her willingness to donate organs by way of carrying an organ donor card, or a driving licence noted accordingly, the consent of the next-of-kin is always sought. Even where opt-out systems are in operation, the relatives of the deceased are approached as part of the donor screening process to seek a medical history of any high-risk behaviour. Thus, the relatives will always be aware that a donation is being considered and can register an objection to the donation if they wish.</P>
    <P>Ireland does not have legislation governing transplant issues, but the need for such legislation is being considered, particularly in the context of the living kidney donor programme being developed at Beaumont Hospital, where the issue of consent is particularly important. The EU <Col N="851"/>directive setting quality and safety standards for tissues and cells for human application has been transposed, and provides a legal basis for the practice of donating specific tissues and cells. The position is not as straightforward for organs because they are more scarce, are almost invariably a life-saving therapy and because the timeframe within which they must be used is extremely limited. Nevertheless, the European Commission is considering a directive in respect of organ transplantation, including the issue of consent, and proposes to conduct a thorough scientific evaluation of the situation. It will present a report on its analysis to the Council of the European Union and it is expected that this report will inform decisions regarding the development of a legislative framework in this area.</P>
    <P>In the context of increasing the number of donor organs available for transplant, my Department asked the Health Service Executive early last year to undertake a review and analysis of the factors that impact on organ procurement and retrieval rates in hospitals around the country. This review has recently commenced. One of the issues that will be examined is the relatively low level of donor organ retrieval in hospitals where higher levels might be expected.</P>

At the heart of this funding package is a determination to improve home and community-based support with almost three quarters, &euro;109 million of the full year costs, being committed to the support of care in the community. It includes extra funding for home support packages, day and respite care and sheltered housing.</P>
    <P>A working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs was established last year to examine issues relating to the financing of long-term care. The objective of this group was to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, including improvements in community care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation undertaken on that report and the <Col N="852"/>review of the nursing home subvention scheme by Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea. This group presented its report to Government, where it is under consideration.</P>

	<P>All medical practitioners have a responsibility to ensure their practices are safe and their skills are up to date. In this regard, I have pursued a number of important policies and actions, in particular the introduction of a new contract for hospital consultants, which is intended to include provisions for clinical audit and competence assurance and the introduction of a new medical practitioners Bill, which I hope to bring to the House later this year.</P>
    <P>The medical practitioners Bill will provide for a statutory basis for an appropriate scheme of competence assurance for medical practitioners. The Medical Council will be the body responsible for the co-ordination and administration of the scheme. Pending the introduction of the legislation, the Medical Council has actively worked on addressing the gaps in this area. Recently, it announced a scheme of voluntary random performance assessments for doctors. The audits will complement existing schemes of continuing professional development which many medical practitioners participate in at present. The scheme is a welcome development in this area. Furthermore, I have asked my Department to develop mechanisms in conjunction with the HSE to ensure that clinical governance arrangements are strengthened throughout the health system.</P>

	<P>I am fully committed to the national roll-out of a cervical screening programme in line with international best practice. My Department has requested the Health Service Executive to prepare a detailed implementation plan for a national programme. The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call and recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, account<Col N="853"/>ability and value for money. All elements of the programme, call and recall, smear taking, laboratories and treatment services must be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service.</P>
    <P>Significant preparatory work is well under way involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register. An additional &euro;9 million is available to the executive for cancer services development in 2006, including the continuation of preparations for the roll-out. The programme would be best rolled-out in the primary care setting, subject to affordable and acceptable arrangements being agreed. A review of the contractual arrangements for the provision by general practitioners of publicly-funded primary care services is being conducted at present, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. I have requested that the general practitioner elements of a national cervical screening programme be tabled at these discussions. Any remuneration arrangements agreed must be capable of delivering a high uptake among women. Payments must be primarily based on reaching acceptable targets.</P>
    <P>We must also have in place tailored initiatives to encourage take up among disadvantaged and difficult to reach groups. I wish to see the programme rolled-out as quickly as possible but only when the essential infrastructure, organisation and services are in place that are quality assured and meet international standards.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding an insurance-based funding model, the issue of what is an appropriate method of funding the health services was discussed in the health strategy of 2001, which remains Government policy. The conclusion in the strategy was that the present system should remain as &ldquo;there is no compelling evidence that any alternative approach to the tax-based system would deliver significant improvements&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My view of an extension of full eligibility to everyone, which the health strategy did not propose, is that it is reasonable to expect those who can afford to pay for services to do so. Many supports are already available to those without full eligibility. Treatment in a public ward of an acute hospital is free other than a modest hospital charge for non-medical card holders, and the drugs payment scheme contributes significantly towards the cost of pharmaceuticals. In addition, reliefs are available in respect of medical costs under taxation provisions.</P><Col N="854"/>
    <P>The largest element of cost in extending full eligibility to the entire population would arise under the general medical services scheme. If this were extended to the whole population, the estimated cost would be in excess of &euro;3 billion, based on current fees to participating contractors, such as pharmacists and GPs in the GMS scheme. This estimate takes no account of adjustments to fees to the contractors which might result from negotiations that would be required with the representative bodies of the contractors involved. The additional costs that might arise under other schemes, such as the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, and other community services, have not been taken into account. It is therefore likely that the ultimate cost of extending full eligibility to the entire population would substantially exceed this estimate.</P>

	<P>The national health promotion strategy clearly sets out the rationale for and objectives of health promotion in schools in Ireland. The strategy contends that &ldquo;a health promoting school can be characterised as a school constantly strengthening its capacity as a healthy setting for living, learning and working&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The social, personal and health education, SPHE, support service is a partnership between the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science and the Health Service Executive. It provides the cornerstone for health promotion work in the school setting. The partnership has been formally in operation since September 2000 and ongoing support is provided to all schools to enhance the implementation of the programme.</P>
    <P>Social, personal and health education, SPHE, is a broad based health education programme which aims to enhance the self-esteem and decision making skills of young people across a range of topics including relationships and sexuality and substance use using experiential learning methodologies. Evaluation of several of these programmes to date has shown that effective knowledge gains can be achieved, that skills can be developed and curriculum development can be supported.</P>

	<P>Prior to the establishment of the Health Service Executive, parliamentary questions concerning access to services, by individuals or in specific geographic areas, were referred to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board or ERHA for direct reply. The parliamentary affairs division of the HSE, which was established in April 2005, provides a central contact for all Oireachtas requests for information relating to matters within the statutory remit of the executive.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary questions can differ substantially in the complexity of the subject matter or the extent of the detail sought. Where a question, such as that referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, relates to the provision of a service provided by the HSE on a national basis, or requests statistical information on a service covering a period of years, it requires the collation of information from a number of different sources. The collation of such information is co-ordinated and monitored by the parliamentary affairs division to ensure a complete and comprehensive reply is compiled and issued in response to these questions. I am satisfied that the HSE continues to develop its structures and capacity for dealing with parliamentary affairs, as a matter of priority, and that it is fully committed to enhancing performance in providing timely replies to Oireachtas Members.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary care strategy sets out the Government&rsquo;s vision for the development of primary care as the central focus for the delivery of health and personal social care services in a modern health system. The strategy aims to shift the emphasis from an over-reliance on acute hospital services to one where patients will be able to access an integrated multidisciplinary service provided by a primary care team in their local community.</P>
    <P>The HSE is adopting a wide ranging approach in order to address the current difficulties in accident and emergency services, including the enhancement and development of primary and <Col N="860"/>community care services. The HSE has emphasised the importance of developing primary care services, both as the appropriate service for the delivery of the majority of people&rsquo;s health and social care needs, and to complement the services provided by acute hospitals. This is an important priority for the executive, which has my full endorsement. Well-developed, integrated and accessible primary and community services are essential for improving the efficiency of hospital services, particularly accident and emergency services.</P>
    <P>The strategy is also about the re-orientation of existing resources to develop new ways for medical professionals to work together for the benefit of people accessing primary care services in their own communities. With regard to implementation, an initial ten primary care teams have been established nationally, with funding to enable existing staff resources within the public system to be augmented. These teams enable the primary care model to be demonstrated in action and have allowed practical experience to be gained of the process involved in developing a primary care team and providing expanded services in the community. The HSE will be building on the experience gained in these ten projects as it develops team-based primary care services on a wider scale.</P>
    <P>Significant resources are invested by the HSE in primary, community and continuing care services. In 2006 over &euro;7 billion will be spent on those services, with almost half of this specifically designated for primary care and community health services. Additionally, the 2006 Estimate for the Health Service Executive includes an extra &euro;16 million in revenue funding to enable the establishment of up to 100 new primary care teams to allow the further development of GP co-operatives and to continue a phased increase in the number of GP training places from 84 to 150.</P>
    <P>The wider implementation of the primary care strategy will focus on developing new ways of working and of reorganising the resources already available to the health service in line with the service model described in the strategy. This whole-system approach to implementation means change will be required in many sectors in the health service, and not solely within primary care itself. It is in this context that additional resources can be deployed to best effect.</P>

	<P>As part of the reform of the health services the responsibility for implementing relevant recommendations from the report of the National Task Force on Obesity has transferred from the Department of Health and Children to the population health directorate of the Health Service Executive. Revenue funding of &euro;3 million has been allocated to the Health Service Executive to progress the implementation of relevant recommendations of the National Task Force on Obesity.</P>
    <P>Projects approved to take place during 2006 include: expanding the Healthy Food Made Easy programme; recruiting four physical activity <Col N="862"/>officers to target obesity in all settings; providing four specialist community dietician posts for obesity and weight management to support all initiatives; purchasing equipment for growth monitoring; and further progressing work with the food service sector on healthy food provision.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Executive plans to: consolidate the one existing obesity service that operates from St. Colmcille&rsquo;s Hospital in Loughlinstown and support the development of additional centres based in Cork, Galway and north Dublin; and commence the development of a service for children based at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. Some &euro;400,000 has been allocated to develop the service in St. Colmcille&rsquo;s Hospital in 2006. This will allow for the appointment of additional relevant staff and improvements to the physical infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The Food Dude programme positively alters children&rsquo;s behaviour regarding consumption of fruit and vegetables. Bord Bia has received EU funding to extend this programme to 150 primary schools over three years. This funding is matched by an equal contribution from Government and the fresh produce industry. The roll-out of the programme commenced in October 2005 and will reach over 30,000 children in the three-year period. The programme is fully endorsed by the Department of Education and Science, which is facilitating its implementation in the selected schools and the in-service training of the in-school co-ordinators.</P>
    <P>There is a need to focus on the underlying causes of obesity and this requires collective action across Departments, with the private sector and other statutory and non-statutory agencies. The Department of Health and Children is currently developing a proposal for the establishment of a Health improvement forum, which will have the capacity to co-ordinate health promotion and population health approaches across ministries and to provide a support structure for the implementation of the multi-sectoral recommendations of the report of the national task force on obesity.</P>

	<P>The vast majority of women having babies in this country do so in public hospitals. Over half of the female population has private health insurance and a significant proportion of these women avail of maternity services in public hospitals. I am advised by the Health Service Executive that with regard to obstetric activity at the National Maternity Hospital, the public to private split has remained consistently at 56% public, 44% private over the past five to six years.</P>
    <P>The cost of a private bed in most public hospitals has increased by 130% since 2001 and this would be a significant factor in the increase in costs to private health insurers. However, in the interests of equity, it is Government policy to gradually eliminate the effective subsidy for private stays in public hospital beds and relieve the taxpayer of the burden of carrying these costs. Even with these increases, the cost of providing services to private patients in the main hospitals continues to exceed the income arising from the charges.</P>

	<P>The national task force on medical staffing was set up to: devise a strategy for reducing the average working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, so as to achieve the requirements of the European working time directive; address the consequent medical staffing needs of Irish hospitals; analyse the practical implications of moving to a consultant-provided hospital system; and consider the requirements for medical education and training arising from any changes to the current model of delivering services.</P>
    <P>The report of the national task force, the Hanly report, made a series of important recommendations. These covered issues such as: the changes needed in NCHD work patterns; the need for a significantly revised contract for medical consultants; the need for a significant increase in the number of consultants; reform of medical <Col N="864"/>education and training; and the reorganisation of acute hospital services.</P>
    <P>My Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive to build on, and progress, these recommendations. Negotiations on NCHD work patterns and on a new contract for consultants have begun. The Government also announced details of a &euro;200 million initiative for a major reform of medical education and training including an increase in the number of medical training places. These measures, combined with ongoing investment in acute hospital facilities, extra consultant posts and the organisation of services around hospital networks, are designed to provide patients with faster access to high-quality consultant provided services.</P>
    <P>The issues that led to the setting up of the national task force remain to be resolved, including the full implementation of the European working time directive and the introduction of a consultant provided service. Addressing these issues requires negotiation and agreement with the medical representative bodies. This process is ongoing.</P>

This is set out in paragraphs 7.1 to 7.3 inclusive in the regulations. Also, the code of practice for nursing homes published by the Department of Health and Children sets out the specific requirements in regard to a contract of care.</P>
    <P>The HSE, when referring clients to private nursing homes for the provision of care, enters into an agreement with the nursing home with regard to all aspects of care and welfare of the client. The provider must undertake, during the term of the agreement with the HSE, that it will <Col N="866"/>at all times provide care and welfare for each of the patients or clients referred by the HSE, in proper accordance with their individual needs and requirements and, more particularly, strictly in accordance at all times with the terms, conditions and obligations contained in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993, as amended.</P>
    <P>Generally, prior to admission, a care plan, which will specify the extent of the services required by the patient or client must be developed by the provider in conjunction with the hospital and medical personnel referring each patient or client and the provider undertakes to implement same.

	<P>The Government is fully committed to the implementation of the principles contained in the primary care strategy, which provides a template for the reform and development of primary care services. The implementation process at operational level is a function of the Health Service Executive, whose chief executive officer has identified as a priority the development of multidisciplinary primary care services, both as the appropriate service to meet people&rsquo;s health and social care needs and to complement the services provided by acute hospitals. This is an important priority of the executive and has my full endorsement.</P>
    <P>The 2006 Estimate for the HSE includes an additional &euro;10 million in revenue funding to enable the establishment of up to 100 new primary care teams. This will enable the provision of some 300 additional frontline personnel to work alongside GPs in order to provide integrated and accessible services in the community. Work by the HSE to establish these teams is under way. In addition, &euro;2 million has been allocated to allow the further development of GP co-operatives and &euro;4 million has been provided to continue a phased increase in the number of GP training places from 84 to 150.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the primary care strategy will focus on the reorganisation of the resources already available to the health service and on developing new ways of working in line with the service model described in the strategy. Over &euro;7 billion will be spent by the HSE on primary, community and continual care services in 2006, and almost half of this is already specifically designated for primary care and community health services. This whole-system approach to imple<Col N="867"/>mentation means change will be required in many sectors in the health service, and not solely within primary care. It is within this context that additional resources can be deployed to best effect.</P>

	<P>I am advised that clinical therapies can make a significant contribution to children with developmental delay, including children on the autistic spectrum disorder. Commitment to developing therapy services has been demonstrated in the growth in staff numbers in occupational therapy and speech and language therapy over the last five years. The current total of 759 in occupational therapy and 548 in speech and language therapy, according to the employment census of September 2005, represents a 44% and 37% growth rate in the two services respectively since 2001.</P>
    <P>In 2001, the Government significantly increased the number of training places for occupational therapy and speech and language therapy from 40 and 30 respectively to 115 and 105. I understand that arising from this increase there will be a substantial increase in the number of graduate therapists from 2007 onwards. As part of the investment package for disability services for 2006, a sum of &euro;12.5 million was made available to the Health Service Executive to enhance the multidisciplinary support services for people with disabilities. This will facilitate the recruitment of a substantial number of additional speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. Furthermore, I understand that the Health Service Executive has embarked on an international recruitment drive to meet current vacancies in addition to the extra posts created in 2006 arising from the investment package.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Health and Social Care Professions Act 2005, provision is made for the establishment of registration boards for each of the professions covered by the Act, in order to provide guidance on ethical conduct and support to those registered with the boards in the practice of their profession. This is in line with existing provisions for other health care professionals. The Medical Council has a guide to ethical conduct and behaviour which deals with matters of confidentiality and consent, including circumstances where there are exceptions to the rules on confidentiality and where doctors should report on the behaviour or competence of other doctors. An Bord Altranais has a code of professional conduct for nurses and midwives which provides that any circumstances which could place patients or clients in jeopardy or militate against safe standards of practice should be made known to the appropriate persons or authorities.</P>
    <P>At present, there are statutory provisions in respect of governance in the health services. Under section 35 of the Health Act 2004, there is an obligation on the Health Service Executive to draw up a code of governance which will include guiding principles applicable to the executive as a public body. My Department has issued a framework document for corporate and financial governance for the Health Service Executive and requested the executive to draw up a code of governance in line with the framework. Under the section dealing with codes of conduct and quality customer services, the framework document specifically highlights that the Government in 2001 approved a code of practice for the governance of state bodies, under which such bodies need to set out objectives on maintaining proper standards of integrity and disclosure of confidential information. Under the 2004 Act, the executive is obliged in its annual report to indicate its arrangements for implementing and maintaining adherence to the code. In December, the <Col N="872"/>executive submitted to me an update on progress in its code of governance. The executive is still working on the contents of the code and my Department is in communication with it in this respect.</P>
    <P>In addition, section 25 of the Health Act 2004 provides that members of the board of the Health Service Executive, members of any committees of the board, employees of the executive or any person engaged by the executive as an adviser shall maintain proper standards of integrity, conduct and concern for the public interest. In order to ensure the implementation of such standards, the executive is obliged to draw up a code of conduct for the employees not covered by standards applied by the Ethics in Public Office Act, 2001 and advisers and their employees. The code must indicate the standards of integrity and conduct to be maintained by them in performing their functions. Such a code should more than adequately cover the rights and obligations of employees, advisers and consultants in disclosing confidential information in appropriate circumstances to the appropriate authorities.</P>
    <P>I am, however, conscious of public concern and the concerns expressed in this House regarding the level of protection provided to employees in the health service who raise issues pertaining to the safety and welfare of patients. These concerns are often expressed in the light of the findings of the inquiry into the Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which noted that concerns about Dr. Neary&rsquo;s practice were raised by nurses working in the hospital. In view of the concerns, I am examining the issue of introducing specific provisions regarding the authorised disclosure of information in the context of a number of pieces of legislation currently being drafted by my Department.</P>

	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the inclusion of the pneumococcal vaccine in the primary childhood immunisation programme to immunise against pneumococcal meningitis. Ireland&rsquo;s recommended immunisation programme is based on the guidelines of the national immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. These guidelines are prepared with the assistance of an active committee composed of members from associated disciplines in paediatrics, infectious diseases, general practice and public health. Vaccines are continually evolving and guidelines change according to the nature of these developments. The inclusion of the pneumococcal vaccine in the primary childhood immunisation programme is being considered by the national immunisation advisory committee as part of its review of the immunisation guidelines. No decision has yet been reached. My Department and the Health <Col N="874"/>Service Executive will be guided by expert advice from the NIAC in this regard.</P>
    <P>The immunisation guidelines for Ireland recommend vaccination against pneumococcal disease for persons who are at increased risk of the disease and its complications, particularly for those with: asplenia or severe dysfunction of the spleen, including surgical splenectomy; chronic renal disease or nephrotic syndrome; chronic heart, lung or liver disease illness including cirrhosis; diabetes mellitus; sickle cell disease; immunodeficiency or immunosuppression due to disease or treatment, including HIV infection at all stages; patients with CSF leaks, either congenital or complicating skull fracture or neurosurgery; and persons aged 65 years or older. A vaccine is licensed for use on at risk children under two years of age.</P>

	<P>The draft general scheme and heads of the Health Bill 2006 provide <Col N="875"/>for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, incorporating the office of the chief inspector of social services on a statutory basis. It is intended that under the provisions of the Bill, HIQA will set standards on safety and quality of services provided by or on behalf of the HSE. It will monitor and advise the Minister and the HSE on the level of compliance with those standards. It will also have the power to investigate, at the request of the Minister or the HSE, the safety, quality and standards of any service and make any recommendations it deems necessary.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that the Dublin-mid-Leinster area is currently finalising documentation prior to inviting tenders from private and voluntary sector organisations for inclusion on a panel of preferred providers to provide high quality home support and personal care services for older people. At three and six-month intervals the Health Service Executive will review contractors&rsquo; performance using the criteria included for awarding contracts and determine whether the contractor should remain on the panel of preferred providers or be removed. This tender will ensure that home care services contracted in by the Health Service Executive will reach the highest standards and, by regular review and audit in line with the tender provisions, that these standards will be carefully monitored. Persons who make private arrangements with contractors included in the list of preferred providers can be assured that the organisations they deal with have reached the standards outlined above and that evidence of maintaining those standards will be regularly monitored.</P>
    <P>Home care packages consist of a mixture of grants, contracted care services, therapeutic input, equipment and other such community services as determined by a needs assessment to facilitate an older person to remain living in his or her own home. Home care packages are targeted at those people who have maximised their usage of existing core community services. I understand the tax and VAT issues raised by the Deputy in his question will be addressed by the Minister for Finance in a separate response to a parliamentary question.</P>

	<P>On 3 February last, the Health Service Executive published a report which was prepared by McKinsey &amp; Co., on the delivery of tertiary paediatric services in this country. This report was commissioned by the HSE following my request to it to arrange a review of those services. The report recommends that best outcomes for children would be obtained by developing one national tertiary paediatric centre, which would also provide all secondary paediatric services for the greater Dublin area. The report also recommends that ideally the new facility should be located on the site of, or adjacent to, a major adult teaching hospital in order to achieve the maximum service benefit for children.</P>
    <P>Arising from the report&rsquo;s recommendations, a joint HSE-Department of Health and Children task group was established to progress matters and to advise on the optimal location for the new facility. The task group has worked intensively over the past six weeks and, in the course of its deliberations, a number of important issues arose that were not included in the group&rsquo;s original remit.</P>
    <P>In particular, the importance of co-location with a maternity unit has been identified as an issue of significance. In addition, a number of proposals have been received from the private sector on the building of the new facility. The task group&rsquo;s remit has, accordingly, been extended to allow the group to examine the issues which have arisen, as a consequence of which the group is now expected to report in or around the end of May.</P>

	<P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in 2000 with the programme covering the former Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board regions. In 2003 the extension of the programme to counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford and the national expansion of the programme to the rest of the country was announced. Screening commenced in Wexford in March 2004, in Carlow in April 2005 and in Kilkenny in March this year. I informed the House last month of my meeting with representatives of BreastCheck and of my wish to have the programme rolled out to the remaining regions of the country as quickly as possible. Some &euro;2.3 million was made available to BreastCheck this year to provide among other things for the early recruitment and training of staff. The interview process for the posts of clinical directors is now completed and BreastCheck has also commenced the recruitment process for other essential staff. The notice for the procurement of the construction company for the new clinical units in Cork and Galway has been published in the <i>EU Journal</i> and the design team is now in the process of short listing applicants. Following the selection of the contractor, construc<Col N="878"/>tion of the units can commence. BreastCheck is confident that the target date of next year for the commencement of the national roll-out will be met. On full roll-out, all women in the target age group in every county will have access to breast screening and follow up treatment where appropriate.</P>
    <P>As I previously informed the House, any proposal received by BreastCheck to support the roll-out of its screening programme is carefully examined to assess the extent to which it complies with existing standards. BreastCheck has advised my Department that it has engaged in extensive discussions with the clinic referred to by the Deputy. BreastCheck has conducted an evaluation of this proposal and has concluded that the clinic in question would not be in a position to provide a population-based screening programme in line with BreastCheck&rsquo;s requirements.</P>

	<P>Thalidomide preparations were marketed in Ireland from May 1959 to January 1962, when they were withdrawn from sale by the manufacturers. In May 1970, following confirmation by the Department of External Affairs that an offer of compensation by the German manufacturers of thalidomide applied to Irish-born children with conditions attributed to thalidomide, the Department of Health issued advertisements inviting parents and others involved in the care of such children to furnish particulars, which were forwarded to representatives of the manufacturers.</P>
    <P>In May 1973, the Government decided in principle that it should provide financial assistance in addition to that paid by the German foundation. The then Minister for Health established the Irish Thalidomide Medical Board to identify the number of Irish children affected and report on each individual case. The board concluded that 34 Irish children were affected by the drug, one <Col N="880"/>of whom was a beneficiary of the British compensation scheme, as the mother was prescribed the drug while living in the UK. In December 1974 the Government granted each of the remaining 33 children further financial assistance by way of a lump sum and a monthly allowance for life.</P>

     <Quest>the average number of patients on hospital trolleys on a daily basis over the past 12 months as determined by her Department or the Health Service Executive; the numbers as determined by the Irish Medical Organisation; the reason for the disparity; her plans to deal with the issue by way of extra beds <Col N="883"/>or otherwise; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Information on daily activity levels in accident and emergency departments since April 2005 is available on the HSE website at <i>www.hse.ie</i>. In relation to the data collected other than by the HSE, I presume the Deputy is referring to the accident and emergency data collected by the Irish Nurses Organisation.</P>
    <P>My Department is advised by the HSE that the reason for the discrepancy between the INO figures and the HSE figures is that the figures are compiled at different times of the day. The INO figures are collected at 8 a.m. each day while the HSE figures are collected at 2 p.m. I am of the opinion that media debates about the differences in numbers between the trolley count taken by the HSE and that taken by the INO add no value. Accordingly, the HSE has agreed that its trolley count will in future be undertaken at the same time as the INO count as well as at the normal time of 2 p.m.</P>
    <P>Tackling the current difficulties with accident and emergency is the Government&rsquo;s top priority in health. The service being provided to some patients in accident and emergency departments is unacceptable and must be improved. Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in accident and emergency and do not require admission.</P>
    <P>The HSE is continuing to implement the ten point action plan. In addition, it has been agreed with the HSE that a number of additional measures will be implemented by the executive. These include in particular the setting of performance targets for individual hospitals.</P>
    <P>The HSE has established a dedicated task force to oversee the implementation of the framework for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of services in our accident and emergency departments. The task force will support individual hospitals in identifying specific problems and addressing them. It will work with hospitals to introduce a system of &ldquo;whole hospital&rdquo; performance measures to improve the patient&rsquo;s journey not alone through the accident and emergency department but through the hospital system from admission to discharge.</P>
    <P>I share the view that has been expressed by the chief executive of the HSE that the achievement of improvements in accident and emergency services is dependent on fundamental changes both in hospitals and in other areas of the health service. I am confident that by improving hospital processes and procedures, by providing additional step-down beds for those patients who do not require acute hospital care, and by expanding and enhancing primary and com<Col N="884"/>munity care services we can achieve a sustained improvement in our accident and emergency services.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Cancer Registry has routinely collected data on county of residence for all incidences of cancer since 1994. The data have been published in a number of reports, including Cancer in Ireland 1994-2000 and two all-Ireland cancer reports, All-Ireland Cancer Statistics for 1994-1996 and 1998 -2000. Up to date tables describing cancer incidence by site, sex and county of residence are also available to the public on the registry website <i>www. ncri.ie</i>. In addition to this routine analysis, the registry has carried out a number of analyses of cancer incidence for single counties in response to specific local issues.</P>
    <P>The most recent detailed analysis of the relationship between cancer incidence and county of residence was carried out for the second all-Ireland cancer report, 1998-2000, which was published in 2004. While this report showed some relationship between region of residence and cancer incidence, there were few instances where this relationship could be shown at county level. In general, the number of cancer cases diagnosed at county level were too few, and the variation in incidence between counties too small, for any meaningful conclusions to be drawn. The only clear exception to this was for lung cancer, where incidences and mortality was significantly higher in Dublin than elsewhere. This variation in lung cancer incidence between urban and rural setting was also found in Belfast and Derry and is consistent with the pattern of incidence of lung cancer in other countries.</P>

    <P>Employment information collected by my Department refers to numbers employed rather than to vacancies.

    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that my Department&rsquo;s health service employment census, which encompasses staff employed by the Health Service Executive, the voluntary hospitals and some intellectual disability agencies, shows a total of 101,978 whole-time equivalent staff, excluding home helps, at end December 2005. This compares with a total of 67,814 at end December 1997 and represents an increase of 34,137 or 50.32%. There has been an increase of 2,290 or 46.06% in medical and dental personnel, an increase of 7,902 or 28.9% in nursing personnel and an increase of 8,014 or 134.98% in health and social care professional, including psychology, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy, personnel over end 1997 figures.</P>

	<P>Tackling the current difficulties with accident and emergency units is the Government&rsquo;s top priority in health. Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated there and then and do not require admission. I believe that there is a need to build on the accident and emergency action plan and, arising from discussions with the Health Service Executive, a number of proposals have been agreed, including the setting of performance targets for individual hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Executive has developed and circulated a framework for improving accident and emergency services, setting out clearly the proposed approach. The recently-established dedicated task force is overseeing the implementation of this framework. The task force includes accident and emergency consultants, a consultant geriatrician, a respiratory physician, a director of nursing, and a hospital chief executive, as well as full-time representatives from the national hospitals office and primary, community and continuing care services. The task force is supporting individual hospitals in identifying specific problems and addressing them, and working with hospitals to introduce a system of &ldquo;whole hospital&rdquo; performance measures to improve the patient&rsquo;s journey not alone through the accident and emergency department but through the hospital system from admission to discharge.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In the case of persons suffering from disability, a special provision for relief is available under the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax)(No. 15) Order 1981. This allows the refund of VAT paid on certain aids, appliances and medical devices which are purchased for the exclusive use of disabled persons suffering a specified degree of disablement. In order to determine whether a particular purchase qualifies for a refund of VAT, applicants should contact the Revenue Commissioners, VAT Repayments (Unregistered Section), Kilrush Road, Ennis, County Clare.</P>
    <P>For utility charges, the social welfare household benefits package is provided, subject to household and income conditions, to people in receipt of a social welfare disability income payment. The package comprises an electricity or gas allowance, a telephone allowance and a free lifetime TV licence. Up to 1,800 units of electricity per annum and normal standing charges are covered by the electricity allowance. The annual value of the electricity allowance is &euro;260, inclusive of VAT at 13.5%. The gas allowance is an alternative to the electricity allowance if a customer&rsquo;s home is connected to a natural gas supply. Here, the customer is entitled to the supply charge and up to 1,674 kW hours of gas per year. The annual value of the gas allowance is &euro;313, inclusive of VAT at 13.5%. The telephone allowance is applied to a customer&rsquo;s account as a fixed credit which amounts to &euro;296.35 per annum, inclusive of VAT at 21%.</P>
    <P>Relief also exists within the income tax code in respect of qualifying health expenses incurred in the provision of health care for an individual and-or his or her dependants. The relief consists of a deduction from total income for the tax year in which the expenses are incurred in respect of qualifying health expenses in excess of &euro;125 in the case of one individual, or in excess of &euro;250 in the case where the expenses are incurred for two <Col N="891"/>or more individuals. Qualifying health expenses include expenses representing the services of doctors and dentists, diagnostic procedures carried out on the advice of a doctor, maintenance or treatment in a hospital, drugs or medicines prescribed on the advice of a doctor and the supply, maintenance or repair of any medical, surgical, dental or nursing appliance used on the advice of a doctor or dentist.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to section 125 of the Finance Act 2006, which contains an enabling provision which will allow the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations, with my consent, requiring financial institutions and State bodies to make an annual return of names and addresses of customers and others resident in the State to whom interest or other profit payments are made and the details of those payments. The enabling provision will facilitate the phasing in of reporting requirements for financial institutions. There will be detailed consultation with the financial institutions and other parties on the logistics of implementing a reporting system in the different sectors before the provision is enacted. Automatic reporting is primarily about closing off safe havens for large untaxed lump sums. Taxpayers whose deposits were made with fully taxed funds have absolutely nothing to fear, as the deduction of deposit interest retention tax by the financial institution from any interest paid will fully discharge any tax liability they may have. This measure is designed to combat tax evaders who have hidden large untaxed sums in bank accounts without disclosing the existence of the accounts on their tax returns.</P>

The Office of the Revenue Commissioners is a registered data controller &mdash; registration No. 0720/A &mdash; in accordance with the Acts. Personal information is disclosed to agencies, institutions or other parties. Section 5 of Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; annual data protection registration sets out the current list of disclosees. The registration is reviewed and submitted annually to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, in accordance with the data protection legislation and full details are published on the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s website, <i>www.dataprotection.ie</i>.

   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>A special interdepartmental review group reviewed the operation of the disabled drivers&rsquo; scheme. The terms of reference of the group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme. The group&rsquo;s report, published on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme. It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, the relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries. The report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, encompassing the operation of the appeals process and options for the possible future development of the scheme. The short-term recommendations in respect of the appeals process have been implemented. In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration. For this reason, the Government decided in June 2004 that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the <Col N="893"/>group&rsquo;s report in the context of the annual budgetary process with regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The best way of addressing the transport needs of people with disabilities of whatever kind and the effectiveness, suitability or otherwise of the disabled drivers&rsquo; scheme in that regard will be considered and progressed in consultation with the other Departments which have responsibility in this area. A car tax concession scheme can obviously only play a partial role in dealing with this serious issue. The examination of the scheme is taking place in that context. Any changes to this scheme will be considered in the context of the overall development of policy in this area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 199, 201 and 203 together.</P>
    <P>South Tipperary County Council has located outfall pipes, with diffusers, for the new Carrick-on-Suir waste water treatment plant in the River Suir. Representatives of snap net fishermen who <Col N="894"/>operate on the River Suir expressed the view to the Department that the location of the outfall diffusers is likely to disrupt their operations by creating a snagging or fouling hazard for their nets. In light of these concerns, a report on the matter was obtained from the engineering division of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The report advised that the outfall diffusers and the associated navigation buoy would have a minor effect on snap net fishing. Specifically, the report was of the view that any effect would be limited to a comparatively small area in the vicinity of the diffusers. The Department asked South Tipperary County Council whether it had any proposals to reconsider the location of the outfall pipes and diffusers. The council indicated that it had no such proposals. In view of the council&rsquo;s position on the matter, and as I am advised that any effects of the diffusers and the associated navigation buoy on fishing are localised and minor, I do not consider that action relating to their relocation is warranted. The Marine Survey Office of the Department of Transport, which acts as an expert adviser to the Department on navigational issues, has advised that a buoy should be put in place to mark the location of the diffusers. This advice was conveyed to South Tipperary County Council by the Department. The outfall pipes and diffusers were installed by the council before the application for a foreshore licence had been determined. The formal granting of a licence is now being finalised. In the time available, it has not been possible to assemble the information on foreshore cases requested by the Deputy. The data is being compiled and will be forwarded as soon as possible.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Fishing for razor clams in the area referred to is not prohibited by the habitats directive of 1992, as transposed into Irish law, but is managed as a living aquatic resource under the Common Fisheries Policy. As I have previously advised the House, the harvesting of razor shells is subject to legislative controls and the areas in which such harvesting can take place is classified by ministerial regulations every six months following consideration of the results of an ongoing sampling programme. A system of gatherers&rsquo; dockets is implemented whereby important information is collected on the fishery in such aspects as the precise location and date of harvesting, the quantities involved and the destination of the harvested razor shells. The staff of the Department&rsquo;s <Col N="895"/>inspectorate carry out periodic inspections of fishing activity to ensure that harvesting activities are undertaken in accordance with the prevailing regulations. As part of the work of the molluscan species advisory group, established under the shellfish management framework and which includes a representative of the razor clam fishermen, a razor clam local advisory committee has been established and held its first meeting earlier this month. The committee will be facilitated by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and will seek to develop a sustainable management framework for the fishery.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the fundamental aim of the decommissioning scheme is to secure the permanent withdrawal of excess capacity in both the whitefish and shellfish sectors to bring these fleets into balance with available fishing opportunities. The withdrawal premiums payable under the scheme for whitefish vessels are the maximum permitted by EU regulations and are related specifically to the permanent removal of the fishing vessels concerned from the <Col N="896"/>EU register of sea fishing vessels. The premium for scallop vessels is 20% below the maximum allowed. The scheme implements the recommendations of the White report, Decommissioning Requirements for Ireland&rsquo;s Demersal and Shellfish Fleets, which was accepted by the Government last July.</P>
    <P>The report does not provide for direct payment to the crews of the vessels concerned, however, the owners of vessels receiving decommissioning aid have been asked to acknowledge the contribution made by crew members, particularly those of long service and make an appropriate contribution to them from the aid. While the decommissioning scheme will remove some of the older and less economically viable vessels from the fleet right around the coast, the majority of the fleet will continue fishing and will continue to need crew. I understand that at present many skippers are experiencing great difficulty securing crew, as there is an overall shortage reflecting the strong performance of the economy generally. In this situation there remain good opportunities for crew members whose current boats are leaving the fleet.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 205 to 207, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>The meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, which I attended in Luxembourg on 10 April reviewed developments in the Middle East peace process in the light of the approval of a new Government by the Palestinian Legislative Council and the outcome of the Israeli general elections. There was consensus in GAERC that the EU would review its assistance to the Palestinians against the new Government&rsquo;s commitment to the principles set out by the Council and by the International Quar<Col N="897"/>tet on 30 January. These entail renunciation of violence, recognition of Israel&rsquo;s right to exist, and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including those of the roadmap for a lasting and peaceful settlement based on the co-existence of two viable states.</P>
    <P>The Council noted that the absence of commitment to the principles set out clearly by the international community will inevitably have an effect on direct assistance to the Government. However, it stressed that the EU will continue to provide necessary assistance to meet the basic needs of the Palestinian population. In the review process now under way, Ireland will press for a generous and wide-ranging interpretation of what constitutes this necessary assistance. At the same time, I would emphasise that positive movement from Hamas would greatly facilitate such an approach, and would serve the interests of the Palestinian people. The Council also urged Israel to take steps to improve the humanitarian and economic situation of the Palestinians including resumption of transfers of withheld Palestinian tax and customs revenues.</P>
    <P>The Government is strongly committed to continuing Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral assistance to the Palestinian people, with particular emphasis on meeting humanitarian needs. It is strongly committed to continuing Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral assistance to the Palestinian people, with particular emphasis on meeting humanitarian needs. We have already made clear that we are determined to maintain the overall volume of our assistance, which amounted to over &euro;4 million in 2005. I can assure the Deputy that, both nationally and in co-operation with our EU partners, the Government will continue to promote a lasting, just and peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We will also do all that is within our capacity to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people, while taking full account of the wider political realities.</P>

    <P>As regards possible repatriation, I am informed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="898"/>Reform that his Department received the formal application for transfer of the person concerned from the United Kingdom authorities in September, 2005.

   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated in my reply to similar parliamentary questions on 29 March last, the swimming pool in question was built, I understand, by a religious order and while privately owned and operated, has been open to the public. I also understand that the pool receives some financial support from Dublin City Council. Under the local authority swimming pool programme, my Department provides grant aid to local authorities towards the capital costs of a new or replacement public swimming pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool. The programme provides for a maximum grant level of 80% of eligible costs &mdash; 90% in the case of disadvantaged areas &mdash; subject to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million. Where a project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the proposal must be considered, supported and submitted by the relevant local authority. Before supporting a project, the local authority must be satisfied that the proposal is viable, that the balance of funding required to complete the project is available and that the project, when completed, will have a suitable level of public access. Consequently, again as I indicated in March, questions relating to the location or operation of a public swimming pool should be directed towards the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>The priority under the current round of the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department and where the deadline for submission of applications was 31 July 2000, is to continue to support those projects <Col N="899"/>remaining to be completed. Of the 57 projects being dealt with, 32 have been grant aided, of which 18 have been completed, leaving 14 under construction or about to begin construction. The remaining 25 projects are at various stages in the programme &mdash; six are at tender stage, 11 at contract document stage and eight at preliminary report stage. I am pleased that activity under the programme has increased considerably as evidenced by the results for 2005 and 2006 to date where I approved: grant aid for eight projects which permits the developers to proceed with placing the contracts and having the work commence; contract documents for 12 projects allowing them to invite tenders for the projects; and preliminary reports for nine projects which permit the preparation of contract documents.</P>
    <P>My Department is carrying out an expenditure review which is examining, among other things, the number and nature of projects supported and what amendments, if any, are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme. On the completion of this review, which I expect will be available by mid-year, the question of re-opening the programme to new applications by local authorities will be considered.</P>
    <P>Under the current round of the local authority swimming pool programme the following projects have been or are being dealt in the Dublin area as of end March 2006: Skerries &mdash; contract document stage; Finglas &mdash; replacement pool &mdash; completed; Ballymun &mdash; replacement pool &mdash; completed; Ballyfermot &mdash; replacement pool &mdash; construction stage; St Michael&rsquo;s House &mdash; new &mdash; tender stage; St Joseph&rsquo;s House &mdash; refurbishment <Col N="900"/>&mdash; preliminary report stage; Jobstown &mdash; new &mdash; construction stage; Clondalkin &mdash; replacement &mdash; construction stage; Glenalbyn &mdash; refurbishment &mdash; contract document stage; and Dundrum &mdash; replacement &mdash; preliminary report stage.</P>

	<P>The setting of waste management charges and the introduction of waivers in respect of waste charges is, as stated by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, a matter for each local authority.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a national social welfare scheme to address the issue would be complex, given the wide range of charging regimes and cost structures that exist in respect of waste management throughout the State. Any system put in place to assist people who rely on private domestic waste collection would have to be sensitive to the different local arrangements. Because of the complexity involved, the cost of such a system is not readily available. I intend to keep the matter under review and to monitor the experience of welfare customers under various charging systems and cost structures.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
     <Quest>if, in view of the fact that rents in the private sector are continuing to rise he will consider revising the thresholds allowed in regard to rent assistance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a rent supplement to assist eligible people who are unable to provide for their <Col N="902"/>immediate accommodation needs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
    <P>Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur. Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the Health Service Executive may, in certain circumstances, breach the rent levels as an exceptional measure, including: Where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances, in particular, for example, disabled persons in specially adapted accommodation or homeless persons whose housing needs cannot be met within the standard terms of the rent supplement scheme etc; where the person concerned is entitled to an income disregard and has sufficient income to meet his or her basic needs after paying rent, and; where the tenant will be in a position to resume responsibility for his or her rent within a short period. This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme.</P>
    <P>Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels and in landlord income. This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes.</P>
    <P>On 26 July 2005 regulations were introduced providing for new rent limits for the period 26 July 2005 to 31 December 2006. These new regulations provided for moderate increases in certain rent limits with no change in others &mdash; no rent limit was reduced. Later this year, my officials will be reviewing the current levels of rent limits in order in determine if any amendments, either upwards or downwards, to the current limits are required. The review will take account of the prevailing rent levels in the private rental sector generally, based on indices from the Central Statistics Office, together with detailed input from the Health Service Executive on the market situation <Col N="903"/>according to patterns of rent supplement applications within each of its operational areas.</P>
    <P>The review will also include consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Private Residential Tenancies Board. My Department will also welcome submissions in regard to this matter from the various voluntary agencies working in this area.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I would point out that while rent levels have risen by some 3% since the current rent limits were set, it is too early to determine whether that trend will be maintained in the medium term. Rent levels also fall in response to market conditions and, for example, rent levels are currently at or below the levels reached in May 2001 and again in August 2003. The planned review later this year will ensure that the rent limits will reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country, and that these limits will continue to enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs.</P>

	<P>This is a day-to-day operational matter for the Great Southern Hotel, GSH, Group and the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA. However, I am informed by the DAA that the group has retained advisers to advise on all aspects of the disposal process for the hotels, including the two referred to by the Deputy. At this stage none of the hotels have been sold.</P>
    <P>GSH is a wholly owned subsidiary of the DAA and I understand that any proceeds of the sale, net of all applicable liabilities and costs and after repayment of capital invested by the DAA, will accrue to the company and not to the State. The application or re-investment of any such proceeds will be a matter for the board of the DAA to determine in the context of its commercial mandate under the State Airports Act 2004.</P>

	<P>Transport 21 sets out the Government&rsquo;s transport capital investment priorities for the ten-year period 2006 to 2015. In developing Transport 21, my Department took account of the national spatial strategy, regional planning guidelines, the Dublin Transportation Office strategy document, A Platform for Change, the strategic rail review and the national road needs study. My Department also engaged with relevant State agencies in order to identify the transport investment priorities.</P>
    <P>Transport 21 provides the basis for addressing the transport requirements of all known development areas around the country and there is active engagement between the relevant local authorities and transport agencies in this regard. Transport 21 has identified the most urgent investment priorities and, I believe, has struck the correct balance between the transport investment needs of the greater Dublin area and those of other cities and regions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 and 217 together.</P>
    <P>The scheme of community support for older people, CSOP, encourages and assists the community&rsquo;s support for qualifying older people, aged 65 years and older, by means of a community based grant scheme, which provides funding for door locks, window locks, door chains, security lighting, smoke alarms and towards the once-off cost of installing socially monitored alarm systems. I have no plans at present to extend the scheme to provide house alarms for pensioners.</P>
    <P>Any local voluntary or community based organisation involved in supporting older people in their community can apply to my Department for funding under the scheme. My Department has been engaged in an extensive review of the CSOP scheme, including consultation with a range of CSOP applicant groups. l will formally announce details of the 2006 scheme shortly, including a number of changes intended to make the scheme more accessible to applicant organisations and older people in their communities over the course of the year, and to facilitate participation by a wider range of groups. The 2006 scheme will be advertised in the national and provincial press.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who has made regulations last December giving legal effect to the provisions of Ireland&rsquo;s action programme.</P>
    <P>The regulations, which came into legal effect on 1 February 2006, specify the minimum storage capacities for livestock manure required on farm holdings and provides for reduced storage capacities in certain, clearly defined circumstances. Aspects of the regulations are currently being reviewed following a short <i>de facto</i> deferral of Part 3 of the regulations which covers nutrient management and the submission of new scientific advice from Teagasc. Any changes to the regulations will, however, have to be agreed with the European Commission.</P>
    <P>I have announced a number of measures, including a revised and significantly improved farm waste management scheme, to assist farmers in meeting their obligations under the regulations. It remains the responsibility of the occupier of any holding to ensure that he or she has adequate storage.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that my Department received the formal application for transfer of the person concerned from the United <Col N="910"/>Kingdom authorities in September 2005. Various reports were then sought and received by my Department from bodies in this jurisdiction. The application was reviewed by the State&rsquo;s legal officers in order to ensure that the requirements of the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts 1995 and 1997 were satisfied. Having received their advices in the matter, my Department has requested and is awaiting further supporting documentation from the UK authorities on this application.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered. A three-way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, that is, from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. On receipt of those consents, assuming they are forthcoming, an application must be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his or her continued detention here.</P>
    <P>These procedures are required under the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts and must be adhered to in processing each application. Upon receipt of the documentation from the UK authorities and a review of same by the State&rsquo;s legal officers, I would expect to be in a position to make a decision on this application. I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to complete this process as quickly as possible.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Measures to combat illegal materials and activities on the Internet are hampered by a multiplicity of jurisdictions, differing legal systems, and differing societal norms. Combatting illegal, harmful and predatory use of the Internet, therefore, requires a combination of responses at national, EU and international levels. Ireland is fully committed to continuing to play its part, at home and internationally, to both detect and prevent child pornography. Ireland&rsquo;s Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 is acknowledged as one of the most robust pieces of legislation anywhere.</P>
    <P>With regard to enforcement, in Ireland, as well as in most jurisdictions, what is illegal off-line is considered illegal on-line. The Garda is committed to the investigation of all cases of child pornography and the importance of investigating the child protection issues involved in such cases. The paedophile investigation unit, which is located within the domestic violence and sexual assault unit of the national bureau of criminal investigation, is in existence since November 2002. This unit is tasked with the investigation and co-ordination of cases relating to the possession, production and distribution of child pornography and any alleged sexual abuse pertaining to it.</P>
    <P>On the structural side, a system of self-regulation by the Internet service provider industry is in place, the components of which include an Internet Advisory Board, IAB, which promotes awareness of Internet downside issues and monitors the progress of self regulation by the Internet service provider industry and a public hotline for reporting child pornography; an industry code of practice and ethics setting out the duties and responsibilities of each Internet service provider.</P>
    <P>The Internet Advisory Board was established in February 2000. As well as overseeing a self-regulatory regime for Irish Internet service providers, it encourages best practice procedures, provides advice and facilitates research in internet-related issues including child safety. My Department provides secretarial and other supports for the board&rsquo;s work. The hotline, <i>www.hotline.ie</i>, funded by the Internet Service Providers&rsquo; Association of Ireland with support from the EU <Col N="912"/>safer Internet action plan, was launched in November 1999. It accepts and investigates reports from the public in relation to child pornography and other illegal material on the Internet. Special protocols operate between the Garda and the hotline, which maximise co-operation on law enforcement issues so that offences in the area of child pornography can be detected and prosecuted. The hotline&rsquo;s recently published third report, covering the period July 2003 to December 2005, showed increasing levels of reporting of potentially illegal material by the public but no case where the material was confirmed as referring to illegal child pornography was traced as either hosted in, or distributed from, Ireland. The hotline works closely with, and is a founding member of the international INHOPE Association, <i>www.inhope.org</i>, a network of European hotlines which is expanding to all parts of the world. The INHOPE Association develops procedures and shares information on the best practices for the tracing and tracking of illegal child pornography.</P>
    <P>The self-regulatory approach to Internet regulation is the norm at EU level and indeed world-wide. The Internet Advisory Board helps and supports the Irish Internet service provider industry to deliver an effective self-regulation environment, in accordance with a code of practice and ethics for the industry, agreed with the board in February 2002. The Irish code of practice and ethics is recognised throughout Europe as a model of its type.</P>
    <P>The European Union has taken a strong line on combating child pornography and other illegal and harmful uses of the Internet. Since 1999, under the safer Internet action plan, the EU has provided financial and other supports for measures in the member states to combat illegal and harmful uses of the Internet, with particular emphasis on protecting children. A new EU action plan, safer Internet plus, covering the period 2005 to 2008, and with a budget of &euro;45 million, was agreed under the Irish presidency in June 2004 and is now in operation. My Department is represented on the management committee for the programme.</P>
    <P>The EU Council adopted a Framework Decision on Combating the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornography on 22 December 2003. While Ireland&rsquo;s Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 is a particularly robust legislative measure, my Department is preparing additional legislative provisions to ensure compliance with this Framework Decision. Ireland signed up to the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Convention on Cybercrime in June 2002. The main objective of the convention is to foster international co-operation in protecting society against cybercrime. The convention deals specifically with the distribution of child pornography on the Internet, infringements of copyright, com<Col N="913"/>puter related fraud and violations of network security.</P>

	<P>My Department provides a range of supports to second level school management to enable schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs. The supports in question include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment. With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, took over key functions from my Department in special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on 1 October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities-special needs. The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities-special needs.</P>
    <P>The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following: deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; deciding on applications for special needs assistant, SNA, hours; and processing applications for school placement in respect of chil<Col N="914"/>dren with disabilities with special education needs. The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and-or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratios. Pupils attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. In the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made. My Department has been informed by the NCSE that the case referred to by the Deputy is under review by the SENO.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The school has not been removed from the school support programme. It was not selected for inclusion in this new programme which is aimed at providing extra supports for the most disadvantaged schools in the country. Schools not included in the new programme have no reason to worry, as they have not been told that they will lose resources as a result of DEIS, rather they have been assured that they will continue to receive support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils. DEIS is designed to ensure that schools serving the most disadvantaged communities benefit from the maximum level of support available. Over the years, no less than eight separate schemes for disadvantaged primary schools have been put in place. Some schools were benefiting from just one or two of these and others were benefiting from more. The DEIS initiative is designed to ensure the most disadvantaged schools benefit from a comprehensive package of supports, while ensuring that others continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</P>
    <P>Four urban-town primary schools, 59 rural primary schools and six second level schools in Mayo have been invited to participate in the new <Col N="915"/>programme and almost 20% of all the rural schools invited to benefit from the new programme nationally are in Mayo. The new DEIS programme will be of huge benefit to schools in Mayo. The Deputy will agree it is important to make sure schools serving the most disadvantaged communities get all the additional support possible and he will welcome the extra resources that DEIS will provide for Mayo schools. I assure the Deputy that there is no reason for schools that have not been identified for the new programme to worry, as they will continue to receive support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils. None of these schools has been told that it will lose supports as a result of DEIS.</P>
    <P>A review process has been put in place for primary and second level schools that did not qualify for participation in the new school support programme and that regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The closing date for receipt of review applications was Friday, 31 March 2006.</P>
    <P>The school to which the Deputy refers has submitted an application for review and a formal acknowledgement has issued to the school. It is anticipated the review process will be completed before the end of the current school year. The Deputy will agree that the additional supports being made available will be of great value to those schools in Mayo which, based on the information submitted by their principals, have been selected to benefit from the new programme.</P>
    <P>While the rationale behind the new programme is to ensure the most disadvantaged schools benefit from all the available supports, schools that are benefiting from existing schemes will keep the additional resources &mdash; financial and human &mdash; that they are getting under these initiatives for the 2006-07 school year. After that they will continue to get support in line with the level of socioeconomic disadvantage among their pupils.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year. According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management of the school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2005 was 232 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule, circular 0023/2006, which has issued to all primary schools and is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006-07 school year will be a principal and eight mainstream class teachers. To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeal board is in place to decide on appeals. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are <Col N="917"/>set out in Department primary circular 24/06. The board of management of the school in question has submitted an appeal to the staffing appeal board. The appeal will be considered by the board at a meeting which is scheduled to take place in May. The board of management will be notified of the outcome of the appeal as soon as possible thereafter. The appeal board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate to intervene in the operation of the independent appeal board.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>if, in the event that the schools in a town (details supplied) in County Kildare establish a mutually acceptable enrolment policy she will allow a school to open up its enrolment to include classes other than junior infants; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The school to which the Deputy refers is a new school, which opened in September 2005. It accommodates two junior infant classes. When fully occupied, the school will operate as a two-stream 16-classroom school. To enable it develop in this manner, it can only enrol two junior infant classes annually. This incremental development is common to all newly established schools to ensure a shortage of accommodation at the school is avoided by an over enrolment in the early stages and crucially, to ensure that the enrolments and staffing levels in other schools in the area, where older pupils would inevitably be drawn, are not adversely affected. Notwithstanding this position and as an exceptional matter, the school has been given approval to enrol three junior infant classes for the next school year on the grounds that this will not impact negatively on the other schools in question.</P>
    <P>Typically, a new school commences in temporary accommodation. Accommodation is provided incrementally, thereafter, to meet the schools junior infant intake level each year in the context of junior infant accommodation available in other schools in the area. A new school would have achieved a certain sustainable growth level without affecting other schools before transferring to its permanent accommodation. Its developmental curve would continue on this basis until all its accommodation is in use. Because a building is available for the school in question at inception does not mean that an orderly growth can be abandoned, given the effect that excessive enrolments will have on other schools in the area that have also been funded by the taxpayer. While enrolment policies are a matter for school authorities, the Department expects the enrolment polices of individual schools to complement the <Col N="918"/>demand for pupil places in an area and, as in this case, to assist the growth of the new school in an orderly fashion. This is in the best interests of the schools, pupils and wider community alike.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, the existing schools, which have served the community well, particularly by obliging with extra pupil places when there was severe pressure for such places in recent years, have a level of accommodation and teaching allocations in place. This cannot be ignored because a new school and a new building have come on stream which will, in their own right, cater for the continuing needs of the area as time goes by as was always my Department&rsquo;s intention. The question is how to support the new school until it is in a position to operate within the confines of its own current funding resources which will grow year on year. This is under discussion with the board of management.</P>

    <P>An application for capital funding towards the provision of a new school building has been received from the school referred to by the Deputy. An assessment of the school&rsquo;s current and projected accommodation needs is under way in conjunction with the school authority. The building project required to deliver suitable accommodation for the school&rsquo;s needs will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2006 to 2010. In the meantime, my Department continues to fully fund the cost of rental of temporary accommodation for the school in question.</P>

	<P>The Killybegs sewerage scheme has been approved for construction under my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2005-07 at an estimated cost of &euro;17.5 million. The wastewater treatment plants for both Killybegs and Bundoran will be procured under a single design/build/operate contract. Donegal County Council&rsquo;s preliminary reports for both the Killybegs and Bundoran sewerage schemes are under examination in my Department in conjunction with more recently submitted water services pricing policy reports for both schemes. I expect my Department to be in a position to convey a decision to the council within a matter of weeks. When the preliminary reports are approved, the council will be in a position to proceed with the preparation of tender documents.</P>

	<P>A reasoned opinion was received from the European Commission on 5 January 2005 on planning enforcement procedures for unauthorised developments in which environmental impact assessments are required. A formal response issued to the Commission on 8 March 2005. My Department has not received any further formal communication from the Commission or from the European Court of Justice and no guidelines have been issued to local authorities. The issue raised about retention does not relate to the generality of this provision which has been part of the planning code since 1963.</P>
    <P>Environment Commissioner Dimas visited Ireland on 2 and 3 March and I had very useful and informal discussions with him on a wide range of issues, including that referred to in the question. It would not be appropriate for me to disclose the detail of these discussions, which were of course without prejudice to any legal proceedings which may continue between Ireland the European Commission.</P>

     <Quest>if he will remove the requirement for non-party independent candidates in elections to have 15 assentors for local elections and 30 assentors for general elections, such practice being undemocratic in requiring members of the public to publicly identify with a candidate at election time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2002 provides that non-party candidates at European, D&aacute;il and local elections must have their nomination paper assented to by 60, 30 and 15 persons respectively who are registered in the register of electors in the constituency or local electoral area to which the candidate is seeking election. The form is left in a local authority office for the assentors to sign and they must produce a specified photographic identification document. Details of the procedures for assenting are included in the notes to the nomination papers. The assentors requirement was introduced following a High Court judgment in 2001 which held that the deposits system was unconstitutional. Many other countries have some requirements, whether signatures, deposits or both, for candidates standing at elections in order to ensure that candidates have a serious intent. While electoral law is subject to ongoing review, there are no proposals to alter the existing arrangements.</P>
