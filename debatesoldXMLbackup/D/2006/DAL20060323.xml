    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with several notices raised under Standing Order 31. I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of national importance and concern, namely, the urgent need to assist the families of victims of the Stardust fire tragedy in Artane on St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day 1981, to hold a fresh inquiry into that terrible fire and for all Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad actively to support the families in their efforts to secure truth and justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose the adjournment of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public and national concern, namely, given the threat to inland coarse fishery resources in lakes and watercourses from illegal fishing activity and stock depletion and the urgent necessity to ensure the future sustainability of quality coarse fish stocks for domestic and tourist anglers, to call for the enactment of a national by-law prohibiting the killing of coarse fish, including pike, the revision of the relevant Fisheries Acts and statutory instruments to provide additional deterrents and adequate means of prosecution, and the adoption of a national policy geared towards education, increased awareness and partnership-based fisheries enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Under Standing Order 31, I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely, the slow decline and gradual shutdown of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s freight business, and in particular the announcement by Diageo that Guinness will be distributed by road rather than rail which will significantly increase accidents, oil use and climate change <Col N="2018"/>emissions. Perhaps I might also mention the affect that it might have on the pint of plain, which requires smooth transport as well as pouring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have considered the matters raised, which are not in order under Standing Order 31.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is proposed to take No. 14, Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Order for Report, Report and Final Stages; No. 12, National Sports Campus Development Authority Bill 2006 &mdash; Second Stage, resumed; and No. 15, statements on care for the elderly, to be taken at 1.30 p.m., and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 15 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m., and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, to be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; (ii) the statements of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply that shall not exceed five minutes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I turn to the Order of Business, I would like to take up something very briefly. On Tuesday the Taoiseach sought to misrepresent the basis on which I had made a statement regarding Garda numbers and falling detection rates, suggesting that I knew that there had been a cull of Dublin Garda stations to strengthen the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation. I had no such knowledge, and last night the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform embellished that by suggesting that I had tabled a narrow technical question to produce an extremely misleading impression.</P>
      <P>I categorically reject that. The replies to the two questions in which I sought information on the strength of the Dublin metropolitan area were presented in the way in which the Minister had always presented it. In the first of those two questions, I sought information on the central units that operated in the Dublin metropolitan area. However, the Minister&rsquo;s reply read as follows.</P>
      <P>There are no central units of the DMA. [...] A number of national units are located in the Dublin metropolitan area [...] These units provide <Col N="2019"/>specialised policing services on a nationwide basis and the tables above do not include the members included in these units.</P>
      <P>I used the format in which the Dublin metropolitan area&rsquo;s strength has always been presented, the end-of-December figures that the Minister used to indicate Garda strength. I reject the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attempt to misrepresent my position and the follow-up by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, in his letter to all Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us address the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Order of Business I would like to raise an issue that I know is central to the concern of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, namely, the nursing home legislation. We know that in 2001 the Ombudsman found that the health boards generally withheld the information from people that they were entitled to public nursing home beds, and many ended up in private nursing homes because that fact has been concealed from them. The Government&rsquo;s health strategy said it would set out a clear legal basis on which eligibility for nursing home care could be decided, clarifying exactly the position regarding the Health Act 1970 when it was clear that anyone who held a medical card was entitled to appropriate care.</P>
      <P>The Minister produced a Bill this week that has not in any way clarified the eligibility of those who hold medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The content of the Bill may not be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>This concerns the legislative programme. When will we see legislation from the Minister to clarify the exact legal rights of those who hold medical cards but who have not been allowed into public nursing homes and find themselves having to fund care in private ones? Why is it not being produced in tandem with other Bills that we have seen in the past two weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Joe Higgins may speak on the same subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that I heard correctly on RTE radio this morning that she proposes to hand the care of our elderly people over to a money-grubbing private American-based franchise, which will rip &euro;10&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is speaking about the contents of legislation. That is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It will rip &euro;10 for every hour a home carer would work caring for the elderly. <Col N="2020"/>The T&aacute;naiste will not resource the public home help system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;yet she proposes this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a legislative point which was raised this morning. The so-called Comfort Keepers website&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot raise it on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;states that it will bring the comfort business to Ireland. I know the Progressive Democrats Party takes the biscuit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is talking about the contents of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;for crassness when it comes to how the health service should be treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to resume his seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Rather than asking the T&aacute;naiste when the legislation will be introduced or whether this will be put on a statutory basis, I ask her, for the sake of decency and our elderly, to scrap this crass incredible privatisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Bruton is correct. The Health (Nursing Homes)(Amendment) Bill, which was published yesterday, will deal with certain legal issues and will ensure that we have primary backing for the subvention scheme. It is being done on the advice of the Attorney General. The wider issue of eligibility and entitlement is the subject of ongoing work within the Department of Health and Children and legislation will be forthcoming as quickly as possible. It is a mammoth piece of legislation which deals with the issue of nursing homes as well as the wider issues of eligibility and entitlement.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s agenda includes policy proposals that have been prepared in respect of care of the elderly in order that we have equity of care between those who are in public institutions and those in private nursing home care. At present, the Government is deliberating on this issue. A small Cabinet sub-committee has been established to deliberate in respect of the policy agenda. We hope to make a decision in this regard quickly as, given the demographics of our population, it would clearly be unsustainable for every person over 70 to be entitled to nursing home care free of charge. That simply would not be affordable. We must have a fair and equitable system based on means and co-payments by the <Col N="2021"/>State and the individuals or their families, if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Rabbitte, on the Order of Business. We cannot have a discussion on the contents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The new Bill will allow me to make regulations to change some of the existing criteria in respect of how the family home is calculated and so on. This Bill, which was published yesterday and which we hope will get through the House very quickly, will allow us to make regulations to change the existing manner in which the family home is taken into account as notional income. At present, this puts nursing home subvention care beyond the reach of many people who have an average family home, which is clearly unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Lots of Bill, but no cheer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>What about franchises? The T&aacute;naiste refuses to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has called Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly legislation is required to support this franchise idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has called Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not franchising anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is not answering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No legislation is promised in this regard. It would be normal for a company to establish itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste will simply hand care over to an American private franchise, just like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The people involved are Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not Russians anyway.</P>

	<P>Or North Koreans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Deputy Bruton, I also received this extraordinary letter from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last night. I thought I was the only one who received it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>He is also the Minister for television.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2022"/>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It proves beyond any doubt that there are more garda&iacute; now than there were in 1997. All Members knew that. Since then however, we have had an extra 500,000 people as well as a few hundred thousand extra crimes. He indicts Deputy Bruton for comparing the end of the year, 31 December with 31 December. He states that one should compare yesterday, 21 March with 21 March. I have some difficulty with this.</P>
      <P>He goes on to state that in Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s case, &ldquo;solely relying on the response to a narrow technical question produced an extremely misleading impression&rdquo;. The only meaning one can draw from that is that Members should not rely on answers to parliamentary questions from his Department any more.</P>
      <P>However, that is not the best bit. He finishes by stating, &ldquo;for those who are making statements based on statistical information and indeed those receiving statements, my Department&rsquo;s door remains open to provide background briefing on the context in which that information should be viewed&rdquo;. Is the Minister saying that we should clear our press statements with him in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be a good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>They would be accurate anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this facility available to all Members of the House? It seems clear that we cannot rely on parliamentary questions. Will this service only be provided for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or will it be provided by other Ministers? In cases where Members cannot rely on parliamentary questions, will the Ministers help them with the true answers and will they draft the statements for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department for the propagation of the faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will Ministers collectively be obliged to go through the Ministry for information on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>He will not even come into the House to answer questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>For example, will the Ministry for information on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green deal with the problem the House is having with the Health Service Executive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>No Member can get an answer regarding any aspect of the health service, no matter how urgent it may be. Will the T&aacute;naiste also consider subcontracting that to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in order that Members can go directly to St. Stephen&rsquo;s <Col N="2023"/>Green, push a button and get the information from the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an open door policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Progressive Democrats should stop digging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I know it depends on the door being open. Apparently there has been a problem in that regard.</P>
      <P>Will census enumerators be obliged to report to the Minister on these statistics or can Members rely on any statistics that do not have the endorsement of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>He will control all information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a novel breakthrough in governance and will certainly reduce the Opposition parties&rsquo; financial obligations. They will be able to have their press statements released by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He will correct the statistics and put out the information. Will the T&aacute;naiste state whether this has been approved by the Government and whether answers on the Health Service Executive in particular can go directly to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I can see why&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No legislation is promised in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is sitting in a draught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am loath to add to the workload of the Minister for justice and lack of remorse, I would sign up to his vetting service in the knowledge that I should say the opposite of anything he might say.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I refer to the Bill sponsored by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the Government&rsquo;s priority listing which has not been published and for which no indication has been given on when they will be debated in this House, namely, the civil law miscellaneous provisions Bill, the defamation Bill and the fines Bill. Is the Minister the cause of the manner in which the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme has become clogged up? He has a need to re-invent every Bill he brings before the House, depending on what he reads in the daily newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>He does not have time. He is working for RTE now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>All those Bills will be published during this session.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2024"/>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had a greyhound doping Bill. Should the House consider a justice minister doping Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Humour was never Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s strong point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The same could not be said of Deputy Roche.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the existing difficulties in the area of adoption, when will the adoption (Hague Convention, adoption authority and miscellaneous) Bill be brought before the House?</P>
      <P>Given that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has shown clearly that he has control over who can or cannot attend RTE debates, when will the broadcasting authority Bill be introduced, so that the background to that situation may be discussed?</P>
      <P>In light of the announcement by the Minister for Agriculture and Food that she intends to introduce new proposals for the survival of farming, when can Members have a full debate on that issue and, as a matter of urgency, on the redistribution of the milk quota?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation will be published later this year. Clearly, the latter matter does not require legislation and that would be a matter the Deputy should discuss with the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have agreement on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>This concerns information and truth as well. On Transport 21, I received an answer from the Minister for Transport last night on the location of the new station at Spencer Dock. I discovered from his answer that it is to be located north of Sheriff Street &mdash; Spencer Dock is, in fact, on the quay, which is why it is a dock &mdash; and that people who will get the privilege of using this will now have to walk 800 metres to potentially&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this about promised legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Bear with me, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. They will have to walk more than 800 metres to access the pedestrian footbridges to the south city or walk a quarter of a mile to Connolly Station. What is included in the Estimates for this Spencer Dock development? The Opposition, unlike the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who has an open door&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That question is not in order on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2025"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We were not invited to this launch but the Minister appeared in a hard hat in the newspaper in some unknown location&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Health and safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that we now find out is north of Sheriff Street. The late Deputy Lawlor often upped the addresses of areas so that, rather than perhaps being in Clondalkin, they became Lucan. There will now be a railway station north of Sheriff Street which is to be called Spencer Dock and the docklands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not appropriate on the Order of Business.</P>

	<P>What is Deputy Burton&rsquo;s point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Opposition has really lost it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>What Estimate has been provided for the station?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

	<P>The most bizarre of them all appears to be the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney&rsquo;s, proposal to rename the accident and emergency units as admission lounges, which I noted from the newspapers this week. She is now in the business of introducing admission lounges. I wonder when we will get the opportunity to question the T&aacute;naiste on this. If we submit questions to her, as has been pointed out earlier, she will kick to touch by referring them to the HSE. I disagree with the earlier speaker. It is not the HSE on which we need to focus but on the T&aacute;naiste because she has no difficulty answering oral questions as they are presented. It is the written ones she refuses to countenance.</P>
      <P>As the oral questions present no difficulty to the T&aacute;naiste and in the interests of better accountability for her and her Department to this House, would she ensure that there is a greater <Col N="2027"/>number of opportunities for oral questions to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children in order that Members may be informed properly of the responses to their questions? We are being left in a limbo, devoid of responses. A vacuum of information exists on a raft of questions that are building up month after month. There is no accountability. Until such time as she presents herself in this House more frequently and allows Members to get through a greater raft of questions, we simply will not make progress. The situation is serious. What does she intend to do about it? Perhaps she will also tell us a little about her admission lounges.</P>

	<P>I can certainly refer to promised legislation. Now that the T&aacute;naiste has returned, would she indicate to the House how this problem will be resolved? There is a serious problem now in the form of a deficit of information that could lead to serious risks occurring in the health services because of this lack of accountability. I tabled a question to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children on 25 November.</P>

	<P>It was referred to the HSE and I still await a response. That is not acceptable within this Parliament and this democratic system. While the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children has a certain reputation of demanding accountability of others and has no difficulty coming into this House and demanding rigorously accountability and responsibility from others, she refuses to take responsibility in her area where we, as public representatives, are unable to access information that is important to our constituents and to the running of the health service.</P>

	<P>I welcome that very much and appreciate that it is a genuine step forward. This is a serious matter.

	<P>Some time ago the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, set up a task force to inquire into the auctioneering business. Nothing has changed in this area because house prices are still inflated. Will legislation be introduced to control that business and to make private treaty sales more transparent?</P>
      <P>I received a letter from Professor Drumm of the HSE. Is there a need for the Minister for Health and Children and her two junior Ministers? Perhaps Professor Drumm might be able to do her job because she certainly is not doing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste stated the Government&rsquo;s success would be judged on how she dealt with accident and emergency departments. This refers to policy and legislation. I deal with the Mater Hospital, in particular, in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency. When will the accident and emergency department waiting lists in all Dublin hospitals be eliminated, which was her priority? When is a priority a priority? When will it be implemented? Is she only paying lip-service to this issue and doing nothing about it?</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Care of the elderly is one of the issues that must be addressed because in Dublin hospitals, in excess of 400 older people have been medically discharged but suitable alternative accommodation must be found on an ongoing basis for them.

	<P>I refer to measures that should be taken to correct the electoral register. The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kitt, outlined statistics in this regard last week. Has the Cabinet taken a decision to instruct the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s 4,500 enumerators to carry two forms rather than one to each household so that, in addition to the census data that will be gathered, with which we are not trying to interfere, a voter registration form will also be delivered and collected by them? The enumerators will measure district electoral divisions, which are statistical units of the electoral register. However, the CSO does not want to deliver the registration forms. Its officials do not get elected; we do. The register is an absolute farce in terms of accuracy. A sum of &euro;50 million will be spent to conduct the census, which is necessary. It would cost nothing extra to ask the enumerators to deliver and collect two forms rather than one. Will the T&aacute;naiste give a direction to the CSO to make that happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has an opportunity to address this in four weeks. ESB and postal staff will not provide the data that can be collected by the enumerators. All that is needed is an incisive action from the Cabinet to direct the director general of the CSO to do the job.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 3, line 20, after &ldquo;1883,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;TO AMEND THE INFANTICIDE ACT 1949,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I mentioned on Committee Stage that I was considering whether to change the law on infanticide. Having examined the matter in consultation with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, I have decided to proceed with two amendments to the Bill which provide for amendments to the Infanticide Act 1949. My first suggested amendment, the inclusion in section 5(3), follows from the recommendation of the Henchy report. In that report the Henchy committee pointed out that the only existing recognition of diminished responsibility is to be found in the Infanticide Act 1949. That Act currently has a reference to a necessary condition for a finding of infanticide, namely, that at the time of the killing of a child under 12 months, the balance of the mother&rsquo;s mind was disturbed by reason either of her not having fully recovered from giving birth to the child or the effect of lactation after the birth of the child. The Act enables the jury to return a verdict of infanticide instead of murder in such cases, with the punishment being as for manslaughter.</P>
      <P>The Infanticide Act allows the prosecution to proffer a charge of infanticide rather than murder in the first instance, whereas section 5 of the Bill, which deals with diminished responsibility, requires that the accused be first charged with murder and the defence of diminished responsibility must be raised by the defendant. On humane grounds, the Henchy committee favoured the retention of the Infanticide Act, with the accused being dealt with in the same manner as if she had been found guilty of manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility.</P>
      <P>My second proposed amendment is in line with that approach. It has the effect of removing the reference to punishment, which is objectionable in this day and age, in these unfortunate circumstances. This amendment provides for the removal of the reference to lactation in section 1(3)(c) of the 1949 Act. I have consulted with the Office of the Attorney General on this matter on the basis that there has been some academic and <Col N="2035"/>legal criticism of the perceived narrow, medical, psychiatric basis for infanticide as set out in the current law. Accordingly, I have decided to remove the reference to lactation, which is dubious, and to replace it with a reference to mental disorder within the meaning of this new Act.</P>
      <P>These amendments give rise to a consequential amendment in the Long Title of the Bill. My third amendment in this group provides for the Long Title to reflect the fact that the Bill also amends the Infanticide Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Minister proposes is right, but it hinges on the definition of &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;. A number of amendments to that definition are proposed also. The definition in the legislation reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; includes mental illness, mental handicap, dementia, or any disease of the mind but does not include intoxication.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;disease of the mind&rdquo; is strange. The proposed amendment is that the Bill would refer to a &ldquo;medical condition&rdquo; rather than a disease of the mind &mdash;&ldquo;at the time of the alleged offence he or she was suffering from a mental disorder such that he or she ought to be found not guilty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that in changing from the word lactation, that this will cover the situation adequately? It is hardly a disease of the mind we are talking about. Would &ldquo;medical condition&rdquo; not be more appropriate terminology than &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that in 1949 the view was that lactation had an effect on the mind of mothers who were breastfeeding. Medical and psychiatric science have moved on from that. Issues such as post-puerperal depression and the like would not necessarily be linked to lactation in the technical sense and it is for that reason I put forward these amendments.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the issue of &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; arises later in a separate grouping of amendments before the House. It would be better therefore to confine my remarks at this stage to what I have said. I am trying to remove what is an out of date and medically unsupportable proposition from the Infanticide Act and to modernise the language used in that Act to deal adequately with the phenomenon of mothers who shortly after birth, unfortunately, injure their child in circumstances where if it was a stranger it would amount to murder.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
      <P LI="1">In page 4, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;<?oasys _is0p1- ?>&ldquo;intoxication&rdquo; means being under the influence of any alcoholic drink, drug, solvent or any other substance or combination of substances;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">During Committee Stage debate of the definition of &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; Deputy English made the point in support of a Fine Gael amendment relating to intoxication that the Bill as presented did not adequately define &ldquo;intoxication&rdquo; or deal with the state of mind induced by intoxication. His principal concern was to ensure that the term &ldquo;intoxication&rdquo; embraced all intoxicants and not just alcohol.</P>
      <P>It might be useful to refer to the report of the Law Reform Commission on intoxication published in November 1995. It states that the definition of intoxication or intoxicant, in the sense that either term involves the consumption of drugs as well as alcohol, does not appear to have given rise to any difficulty in any jurisdiction, including ours, studied by the commission in the course of its work, nor was it raised as an issue by any of the experts who met with the commission. In practice, intoxication is not accepted as a defence in Irish courts. The commission went on to point out that if anything, intoxication was found to be an aggravating factor.</P>
      <P>In response to the points made by Deputies English and Costello on Committee Stage, I undertook to examine whether a definition of intoxication should be inserted in the Bill. I have come to the conclusion that for the sake of clarity, it would be better to define the term. Therefore, I propose a definition which is drawn from the definition in section 4 of the Public Order Act 1994. This should meet the concerns expressed by both Deputies and they should consider whether they are happy with the definition now provided.</P>
      <P>The amendment defines intoxication as being &ldquo;under the intoxicating influence of any alcoholic drink, drug, solvent or any other substance or combination of substances&rdquo;. It is a fairly comprehensive definition.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 7, Deputies already know my position on the issue of the language used in the Bill. These amendments were comprehensively dealt with in the Seanad and were discussed again, in some detail, on Committee Stage in this House, on the basis of formal amendments which were tabled by Deputy Costello, in the case of the three points under discussion. I do not want to repeat at length what I said on that occasion but with regard to amendments Nos. 4 and 13, lengthy discussions took place in the Seanad on the definitions and language used in the Bill. The reason behind some of the amendments proposed in the Seanad was to align the definition of mental disorder for the purpose of this Bill with that used <Col N="2037"/>in the Mental Health Act 2001. I profoundly disagreed with the proposition that there should be an alignment and continue to do so.</P>
      <P>My reasons can be illustrated by an example. A person might have to be deprived of his or her liberty and committed to a mental institution for gross and chronic alcoholism. However, we do not want to allow a situation where, because that is possible, gross and chronic alcoholism can be grounds for claiming diminished responsibility in criminal law. Some argued that the two definitions should be aligned but when one is referring to criminal law, the range of mental conditions that one wants to provide for under insanity legislation is not the same as the range of conditions that one might want to provide for under health legislation covering the treatment of people for various disorders. Therefore, while strong arguments were put forward for using the same definition in both contexts, stronger arguments were put forward for not doing so.</P>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage in the Seanad, the purpose of the Mental Health Act 2001 is to govern the circumstances in which people can be admitted to psychiatric institutions against their wishes and to set a framework for the treatment of patients with mental illnesses. The purpose of this Bill is different, in that it seeks to establish a mechanism for decisions by the court that people are to be excused from criminal responsibility in certain circumstances and to deal with other issues such as an inability to plead and so forth. There should be no spill-over effects between the two areas of law. In particular, if the High Court is deciding what exactly the term mental disorder, as used in the 2001 Act, means in the context of whether a person is liable to be committed to a mental institution against his or her wishes, that decision should not automatically feed into how criminal trials are run. The circumstances are different and two different policies could be at play.</P>
      <P>To revert to my example of chronic alcoholism, criminal law effectively states that if a person drinks chronically, even if he or she is addicted to alcohol, and murders somebody while under the influence of an intoxicant, that is, if anything, an aggravating factor. At the same time, it may be very good policy under the Mental Health Act to commit somebody who suffers from that problem for treatment, against his or her wishes. If a High Court judge held, for instance, that chronic alcoholism was a fit reason to commit somebody under the 2001 Act and we align the two definitions, that might mean that it also becomes a defence to a murder charge in the criminal law. The same applies to drug addicts, who would be able to invoke as a defence the fact that because their condition was one that rendered them liable to be committed to a mental institution for treatment against their wishes, it followed automatically that they were entitled to rely on that fact as a reason for claiming diminished responsibility under ordinary criminal law. I do not want to <Col N="2038"/>chain the two concepts together. It is better to keep the two legal frameworks separate and to have judicial decisions made in the context of the relevant Act.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 5 and 6, I said on Committee Stage I would look again at the use of the term handicap as it relates to mental disorder. I have done that but am still not convinced change is necessary. We use all sorts of words in the English language which are considered to be intolerable. However, the term mental handicap is not a pejorative term. I referred previously to the use of the word handicap in totally different contexts. It is not an exclusionary term. It simply exemplifies the fact that some people may be at a disadvantage relative to others. Sometimes we get very choosy and picky about the language we use, recent events notwithstanding, but the term handicap is not a pejorative term. In fact, in a sporting context, it is used to show an equalising tendency, whereby some people need assistance in order to compete on a level playing pitch. Mental handicap is a term which is easily understood. A juror would understand it and it is not a Victorian or pejorative term. Therefore, it is not worthwhile removing it from the Bill.</P>
      <P>The definition of a mental disorder contained in the Bill is of fundamental importance and is tightly worded. To amend it in the manner suggested by amendment No. 7 would introduce uncertainty into an area where there can be no room for doubt. The reference to &ldquo;other disease or medical condition&rdquo; is far too vague and would allow arguments to be made which have the effect of widening the scope of the defence. I am not prepared to allow that to happen unless I am convinced that we know what we are doing when we insert vague terms.</P>
      <P>I remain opposed to amendment No. 9, which was withdrawn on Committee Stage. I see no reason to define the term &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo;. This Bill, in large measure, follows the recommendations made in the Henchy report from 1978. Indeed, it is a poor reflection on the political system that we are only coming to act on the Henchy report over a quarter of a century later. As far as the definition of mental illness is concerned, which is being discussed at length, the report includes a reference to mental illness but does not define it. What Judge Henchy and his fellow committee members proposed so long ago is still correct. I am concerned that if this amendment was adopted, it could open the prospect of personality disorders being brought within the definition. Such disorders are notoriously subjective from a psychiatric perspective. Jurors would then have to listen to psychiatric evidence as to what actually amounts to a personality disorder as opposed to a character trait. We are not in the business of excusing people from criminal liability because of their character or propensities. It must be much more fundamental than that. The criteria at paragraph (c), &ldquo;serious disorder of <Col N="2039"/>thought form&rdquo; and at (d), &ldquo;a severe disturbance of mood&rdquo; would set the threshold at an unacceptably low level. It would give rise to public disquiet, particularly if we inserted those provisions and juries began to let people off murder charges on the basis that they were suffering from a severe disturbance of mood or a serious disorder of thought form. We should stick with the text as it is and follow the Henchy report in that respect.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 47 proposes to change the reference to mental condition in section 17, dealing with evidential matters, to mental disorder. The term &ldquo;mental condition&rdquo; is correct in this context, as the question of whether an individual is suffering from a mental disorder as defined in the Bill would not have been addressed at that point of the proceeding. Section 39, attached to the Henchy report, deals with this very point. It illustrates why care must be taken with the use of these terms in the Bill. It too makes a distinction between &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;, used generally in the Henchy report as the fundamental term, and &ldquo;mental state&rdquo;, used in the Bill in the equivalent provision to section 17. The Henchy report made a distinction between the two definitions for the purpose corresponding to section 17. The reason for the distinction in the Henchy report and this Bill is to underscore the fact that in the specific matter of the requirement of notice being given to the prosecution about the fact that the defence intends to adduce evidence on the issue, it is not tied to the definition of &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; as used in the Bill, nor should it be.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 51 proposes to change the reference to &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; to &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; in the Short Title. The amendment cannot be accepted because corresponding changes would have to be made to the rest of the Bill&rsquo;s terminology. It would also be undesirable because the use of the less pejorative terminology, &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;insanity&rdquo;, may result in a widespread use of the plea on a mischievous basis. It might also give the misleading impression that any mental disorder, no matter how trivial, would justify returning a verdict of not guilty. The word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; signifies a threshold of disorder which cannot be regarded as trivial or minor. If one claims a person is insane in ordinary parlance, it does not just mean the person is a bit odd.</P>
      <P>The criminal law is the main focus of the Bill. The term &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; is a term of art in connection with criminal law. I do not wish to introduce any doubt or uncertainty into the area. I do not want to wake up some morning, even after a restless night, to discover a judge has interpreted it in a way which was not originally envisaged by the House. This is an attempt to give direction to the courts as to how they should deal with these matters. Throwing up untried and vague language will prejudice, rather than advance, the administration of justice.</P>

	<P>It is a pity that the grouping of amendment&rsquo;s could not have been divided up, as they cover much ground.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 relates to the definition of &ldquo;intoxication&rdquo;. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s amendment on this. It improves the situation we debated on Committee Stage. However, I do not like definitions where the same word is used as a noun and an adjective. In the Minister&rsquo;s proposal, the noun &ldquo;intoxication&rdquo; is defined by the adjective &ldquo;intoxicating influence&rdquo;. It does not give a concrete definition. It is like saying &ldquo;drunkenness&rdquo; means &ldquo;being drunk&rdquo; or &ldquo;intoxication&rdquo; means &ldquo;under an intoxicating influence&rdquo;. Although the Minister claims this is the definition used in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, the Act could have benefitted from a consideration of the appropriateness of the definition. The rest of the amendment covering the influence of any alcoholic drink, drug, solvent or any other substance or combination of substances is appropriate.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 proposes to delete the term &ldquo;handicap&rdquo; and substitute it with the term &ldquo;disability&rdquo;. It relates to a concern expressed on Committee Stage that terminology should be as up-to-date as possible. On Committee Stage, the Minister agreed he would seek to determine whether more modern terminology could be used by consulting organisations dealing with disability. Has he done so and does he feel the Bill has the best wording?</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;handicap&rdquo; is used in sports, say horseracing, in a technical sense. &ldquo;Disability&rdquo; has overtaken &ldquo;handicap&rdquo; as accepted terminology. There are other terms such as &ldquo;physically challenged&rdquo; and &ldquo;intellectually challenged&rdquo;. The amendment aims to ensure terms are not introduced that will grate with organisations working with people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 addresses the definition of &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;. I am concerned that it includes mental illness, mental handicap, dementia or any disease of the mind. The term &ldquo;disease of the mind&rdquo; has particular resonance. While I accept it comes under the definition of &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;, it is not broad enough to cover other mental conditions.</P>
      <P>This would be true for the Minister&rsquo;s first amendment on the Infanticide Act 1949. Amendment No. 32 provides measures to deal with a woman found guilty of infanticide in accordance with subsection (1). The Minister correctly wants to delete the term &ldquo;effect of lactation&rdquo; from consideration of infanticide. However, how does the definition of &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; cover a postnatal situation? How is the state of mind of a woman covered in a possible case of infanticide? It includes mental illness, but it is not a mental illness, a mental handicap, dementia or a disease of the mind. I do not see where it fits in. It would fit in if the Minister accepted my proposal to delete &ldquo;disease&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;other disease or mental condition&rdquo;.</P><Col N="2041"/>
      <P>Amendment No. 47 proposes to substitute the term &ldquo;mental condition&rdquo; with the term &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;. This is the opposite situation where the interpretation is too wide. I am suggesting the term &ldquo;a mental disorder&rdquo; to define it more specifically because &ldquo;the mental condition&rdquo; could refer to something else. One could have a mental condition if one was under stress. For example, let us say that a person had a very bad day at the office, came under severe stress and had a sleepless night.</P>

	<P>One could indeed. It could be a hallucination. Some sinister statistics might appear, which one knows are quite untrue but which may not appear to be quite untrue.

	<P>That would be an interesting addition to our definition. We could examine that but I suppose that is easily solved. One can deflate or puncture an ego fairly quickly too, so there are solutions to that condition without having recourse to medical practitioners. This House is a great way to ensure egos do not get beyond their normal, average size. I have some concerns about the definition which amendment No. 47 seeks to change.</P>
      <P>My final amendment No. 51 concerns terminology also. I know the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; is used in the Title of the legislation but that is becoming an outdated description of a mental disorder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to deal with the question of language in amendment No. 5 and will revert to amendments Nos. 4 and 13 which are in this grouping. We dealt with the language issue on Committee Stage when the Minister said that in his view it was not pejorative or Victorian. He has repeated that view here. In dealing with legislation, especially amending legislation, we should always try to use the most modern terminology. For example, the language used in some of the old legislation which is to be repealed no longer has the same meaning it had 100 or 200 years ago. I recall that we dealt with the Aliens Act, which had a different meaning in the 1930s and 1940s. If one starts talking about aliens in today&rsquo;s terms, however, for most people it conjures up images of a green creature with two heads and huge ears.</P>
      <P>As regards the Bill before us, even the Mental Health Commission said it considered the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; in the Bill&rsquo;s Title to be inappropriate as such terminology was outdated. My amendment, which is similar to Deputy Costello&rsquo;s, sug<Col N="2042"/>gests changing the term &ldquo;mental handicap&rdquo; to &ldquo;intellectual disability&rdquo;. The Minister is correct in stating that in horse racing, golf and other sports the term &ldquo;handicap&rdquo; is used. Outside the sporting domain, however, it is often regarded by the general public as derogatory to talk about somebody being handicapped. We should use this opportunity to change it to an appropriate term which has the meaning that we intend today. Obviously, we cannot plan for the future. Perhaps in 50 years when other parliamentarians are updating this legislation, they will have another term but we should always try to use the most modern terminology.</P>
      <P>I attended an event yesterday at which I was able to examine the use of language in the convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination. The committee working on that convention stated that &ldquo;the use and maintenance of an offending term can at the present time be considered offensive and insulting, even if for an extended period it may not necessarily have been so regarded&rdquo;. Perhaps, therefore, the term &ldquo;mental handicap&rdquo; was not considered derogatory until recently. In this case we are dealing with another term but the same argument applies. That committee considered it to be its duty to recall the increased sensitivities in respect of words such as the offending term. The committee added that &ldquo;in the interests of reconciliation, derogatory or offensive terms will not be used or displayed in future&rdquo;. The same should pertain in any instance where people have highlighted the fact that they would prefer that term not to be used in the legislation, as they have done in this case. We should have listened to what they said. It does not make any difference in terms of the legislation which can still proceed.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The other two amendments in my name, Nos. 4 and 13, seek to outline a definition of mental disorder. Having listened to the Minister on Committee Stage and again today, I still have not been won over to his argument on the two definitions concerned. I do not believe we should have two definitions of mental disorder. We should have a definition similar to that contained in the Mental Health Act 2001. Such definitions should be compatible across the board. If a caveat is required because of the situation in the courts, one can enter it there. I have outlined the definitions in amendment No. 13 to ensure we have a similar definition. I used the same argument when we were discussing disability in the Disability Act. We currently have three different definitions of disability in various legislation. Similarly, we will now have two definitions of a mental disorder.</P>
      <P>The Mental Health Commission has raised questions about this matter, as did the National Disability Authority, which raised a substantial question mark over the definition. The authority stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">We are concerned that the use of the two threshold definitions will be incompatible with <Col N="2043"/>human rights obligations since it would be easier to compel those before the courts than people living in the community and outside the criminal justice system to have mental health treatment. Also, those found unfit or insane under the proposed definition in the Bill will on occasion fail to qualify for hospital detention or treatment under the Mental Health Act.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Even at this late stage, I ask the Minister to re-examine this matter. Amendment No. 13 outlines exactly what is meant by &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;. The amendment defines what is meant by &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; and the possible consequences, such as because of the varying severity of the illness, disability or dementia, somebody may be likely to harm himself or herself or is a threat to others or whether the treatment suggested would improve or alleviate the condition. It is in line with what the mental health commission suggested, and with most of the groups that made submissions and raised questions on the various definitions used. I ask the Minister, if at all possible, to consider the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>In his response, the Minister adequately dealt with amendment No. 8 and the questions raised by Deputy English on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister maintains that inclusion of amendment No. 9 would lower the bar and create public disquiet to a certain extent. I do not accept this. The general public accepts that mental illness is an uncertain science. Without the guidance and advice of experts in all fields, it is impossible for ordinary people to understand what drives or motivates people with such disorders. It is not helpful to suggest that lay members of a jury would not be able to interpret or decide on explanations given by experts. Ultimately, if justice is to be done and seen to be done in a jury system, it is the jury&rsquo;s decision to interpret the advice given by experts in various fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate on this Bill. Regarding amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 13, when we discuss definitions and language, it is important that we use proper and suitable language. We must listen to people directly involved in organisations and groups, particularly parents&rsquo; groups, with focus on people with disabilities and their families. We must ensure the language used in legislation respects the rights of such people. We hear a great deal in this House about inclusion in society. If we are serious about it we must use the proper language and listen to the families and parents of people with disabilities and the people themselves on the terms used in the Bill.</P>
      <P>When we discuss people with intellectual and physical disabilities we must move away from the idea that all they need is support. They are an important part of society, have a major contribution to make and have rights as citizens and <Col N="2044"/>taxpayers. This is often forgotten, particularly in lobbying for money for people with disabilities. Parents and families of people with disabilities are also taxpayers and have every entitlement to services in the State. They should not have to go cap in hand while people pretend to do good works and charity. The vast majority of parents of people with disabilities have rights as citizens and should be supported. I agree with the definition in amendment No. 13 because it is important.</P>
      <P>When discussing crime in the context of this Bill, we must wake up to the reality that people with major mental disorders, who need our support and assistance, are on the streets causing havoc in their communities. I receive many calls at my clinic from particular families with a young son or daughter with a major illness who is responsible for assaults, violence and threats in his or her community and home. We must seek services for them. It is important to point this out.</P>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; as outlined in the Bill is not compatible with the definition in the Mental Health Act 2001. In the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002, &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; is defined as including &ldquo;mental illness, mental handicap, dementia or any disease of the mind but does not include intoxication&rdquo;. Section 3 of the Mental Health Act 2001 provides a more detailed and comprehensive definition of mental disorder. This leads to inconsistency in the Bill, as some sections refer to the definition of &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; as per the Mental Health Act 2001. As this definition underpins subsequent provisions of the Bill, it is essential that the definition of &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; is fully compliant with the definition of the Mental Health Act 2001 in all aspects of the proposed legislation.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that when we discuss the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill we must focus on two key issues, namely, definitions and the use of language when dealing with people with disabilities and that people in our communities with major mental disorders need support and services. If we do not act, somebody will be seriously hurt or killed. I am interested in preventing crime, which is a key strategy in any Department with responsibility for justice. We went into the numbers game this week regarding the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the suggestion that the terms used in the Bill should be made identical to those in the Mental Health Act 2001, the Mental Health Commission re-examined this issue and wrote to me to state that the definition of &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; as used in the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002 is identical to the definition <Col N="2045"/>used in the Mental Health Act 2001 when referring to issues of treatment. The Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill uses a different definition of mental disorder when the matter is considered during court proceedings. The Mental Health Commission stated it now accepts the need for that variation. It examined the issue following the Seanad debate and came to the conclusion that the arguments I made were valid. I should have stated that when I spoke on the matter earlier.</P>
      <P>I listened to all of the descriptions and euphemisms. Everybody is &ldquo;challenged&rdquo; nowadays. I can be described as &ldquo;follicly challenged&rdquo;. However, it is also true that I am balding. Sometimes we get into a condition of euphemising everything. If it is the consensus of the House that we use the term &ldquo;disability&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;handicap&rdquo;, on reflection and having considered the arguments advanced, it seems that Deputy Costello&rsquo;s amendment to remove the word &ldquo;handicap&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;disability&rdquo; is preferable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I will graciously accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should not be too gracious.</P>
      <P>In view of what was stated, it does not involve a point of principle, although I slightly distrust the constant moving of language, which occurs in the area of mental health particularly. Some of the phrases used with technical meaning in old Victorian criminal law and psychiatric books have completely gone out of currency. The term &ldquo;imbecile&rdquo; had a clear meaning to a Victorian or Edwardian doctor which it no longer has. Now it is term of common abuse and has no such meaning. Given that the Mental Health Commission is persuaded that there is an argument for not aligning the two definitions and that Deputy Costello has moved his amendment I propose, with the leave of the House, to deal with all these amendments along those lines.</P>
      <P>To return to Deputy Gerard Murphy&rsquo;s proposal that we set out the ingredients, I made the point about severe disturbances in mood but that would be a very low threshold to present in a criminal justice trial. We all know what a severe disturbance in mood can entail. In those circumstances I ask the Deputy to accept that sometimes in the interests of defining a term one sets out three, four or five definitions, or symptoms in this instance, and find they do not encompass some other condition. This House might set out five or six symptoms in a Bill without thinking around the corner to other possible symptoms.</P>
      <P>There is a canon of legal construction namely, <i>expressio unius personae vel rei, est exclusio alterius</i>, the express mention of one person or thing is the exclusion of another. On that basis we would tread on somewhat dangerous ground if we were to set out the symptoms in sub-paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>), as suggested by Deputy Gerard Murphy. I appreciate, however, that his amendment is constructively intended.</P><Col N="2046"/>
      <P>If the House agrees to accept Deputy Costello&rsquo;s amendment, and if it takes on board my comments about the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s accepting the need for the variation I mentioned, we could reach consensus on those amendments.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This is a fairly standard proposal to ensure there is some level of accountability in respect of these orders. We need some resort to the Houses of the Oireachtas. We often produce legislation which goes on to a shelf, or to whichever Department is responsible for its implementation, and forget about it. In most cases nothing is ever done with the legislation, as we know from the large quantity of Bills gathering dust, only certain sections of which are implemented.</P>
      <P>This section is likely to be implemented, namely, orders made by the Minister under the Act, and the provision we make for that process. The problem is that we have no authority over those orders when they are made. They relate to detention, release and other matters regarding the review board and so on, that are very important. They concern a person&rsquo;s freedoms, care, treatment and appearance before the courts.</P>
      <P>In normal circumstances no doubt everything will be fine but we do not have the luxury of washing our hands of an Act when we provide secondary powers to this Minister or the Minister for Health and Children to operate the legislation. None of these orders will be returned to the House. The Minister said on Committee Stage he did not want to have commencement and establishment orders revoked. That is fair enough and is why I have excluded them in my new amendment. My amendment is quite minimalist in that respect and requires only one step to be taken, namely that the orders be laid before the House. If they are, we have a passive rather than a proactive situation. It means some action can be taken but at the very least it means the orders can be on the floor of the House, are in the Library and can be inspected. People engaged in debating this legislation in the House might feel that is worthwhile and desirable, and that there is a duty to ensure the orders are in accordance with what people thought would happen when the legislation was being discussed.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 4, to delete lines 22 to 27 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) The Minister for Health and Children, after consultation with the Mental Health Commission established under section 32 of the Act of 2001 by order may&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="3">(a) designate a psychiatric centre, or</P>
      <P LI="3">(b) with the consent of the Minister, designate part of a prison,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The issue of prisons or parts of prisons being designated as centres was the subject of much debate in the Seanad and has featured in the debates in this House on Second Stage and Committee Stage. I have made it clear why it is necessary for such places to be available for persons who are not suitable for detention either in the prison or in a designated centre. As I said on Committee Stage, the Henchy report recommended the establishment of special units for persons described as coming within a class referred to as psychopaths or sociopaths but who the committee considered it more proper to identify as persons suffering from a persistent order disability or personality which manifests itself in abnormally violent or aggressive conduct. The fact that such persons in these categories may not be amenable to treatment is also a factor.</P><Col N="2050"/>
      <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>I have taken into account the points made on Committee Stage and I am grateful to the Members here who made those points on that occasion. I have decided to provide for the designation only of a part of a prison rather than designating a whole prison as the Bill originally suggested, as a place of detention in what will hopefully be exceptional circumstances, where no other place would be suitable. In line with the recommendations in the Henchy report I am proposing an amendment which will allow the Minister for Health and Children, with the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to designate a part of a prison as a designated centre. It will not be a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but will have to be initiated by the Minister for Health and Children on the day, and consented to by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>I am also proposing a safeguard by giving the Mental Health Commission a role in that process. The Bill currently provides that the Mental Health Commission consultation procedure only applies in the case of designation of psychiatric centres. On Committee Stage I accepted it might be appropriate for an outside body to have some input into a decision made under the relevant paragraph to designate a part of a prison for detention purposes. My proposed amendment therefore provides for the extension of the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s consultation procedure to the designation of part of a prison in these exceptional circumstances.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>With reference to amendment No. 16 in my name, the Minister has gone some way towards addressing the concerns we raised on Committee Stage, but he has not gone far enough. I do not believe prison is at all an appropriate place in which to commit someone from the courts. I am not alone in this view. Among the UN principles for the protection of persons with mental illness and the improvement of mental health care, principle 1.1 states that all persons have a right to the best available mental health care, which shall be part of the health and social care system. The first UN congress on the prevention of crime and treatment of prisoners listed standard minimum rules for prisons which included the rule that prisoners found insane shall not be detained in prisons and shall be removed to mental institutions as soon as possible. It its submission, the National Disability Authority said it was not appropriate to designate any part of a prison for the assessment or treatment of persons with mental health or intellectual disability. The Mental Health Commission also said it was not appropriate, and that it appeared to be in contravention of the principle I outlined. The commission proposed that designated centres in addition to meeting the criteria specified for approved centres must also meet additional criteria, which arise later in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 40 in my name addresses the fact that the powers of the prison governor are <Col N="2051"/>being extended if the eventuality of patients committed to the prisons is being covered. Under the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, a prison governor will have the additional role of a clinical director, without any additional training. That is odd, and at variance with normal practice. In its long submission, the Human Rights Commission outlined major concerns with this aspect. It said the use of prisons or sections of prisons is clearly prohibited by the UN principles. The commission says that any provision to allow the detention of mentally ill persons in prisons where adequate therapeutic services are not available, as is generally the case in Irish prisons, is wrong.</P>
      <P>One could also consider aspects of the health services in prisons and the failure of our prison system to address the major problems we have in terms of people with mental or intellectual disabilities who are in prison, the major costs involved, and the fact that such people often emerge in worse shape than when they entered prison. Their disabilities are often exacerbated rather than addressed while in prison.</P>
      <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>The Human Rights Commission also noted that the detention of mentally ill persons in prisons where staff are not equipped or trained to treat them appropriately is likely to have a detrimental effect on staff as well as on the detainees. The commission recommended that the term &ldquo;designated centre&rdquo; should not encompass any of the institutions not characterised as approved centres under the Mental Health Act 2001. It also recommended that reference to prisons should be removed and that a resource be made available to ensure adequate levels of accommodation in specialised, secure units in hospitals or clinics are put in place as a priority to accommodate any person committed to detention. That is the issue that needs to be addressed. If there is a need for specialised secure units, the State has a duty to begin putting those units in place so that they are not in prisons and are not required to be built in prisons. I hope they will never be used but given the nature of society and the illnesses from which people suffer, they probably will be used. If nobody is committed to them, that is all the better as it would show that some of our outpatient facilities are properly resourced to do that job.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>In the Johnson case, the European Court of Justice held that the lack of suitable alternative facilities could not be used to justify inappropriate detention. In the event of a person being committed to prison despite his or her mental disorder and despite the court finding that he or she was of unsound mind, the likelihood is that he or she could go to the European Court and win a case against the Government because he or she was being held in an unsuitable facility. That issue needs to be taken on board.</P>
      <P>If the Minister were to say this was a temporary measure of five years until such time as the specialist psychiatric facilities were built and that it would lapse after five years, I might consider it. <Col N="2052"/>Other than that it is not appropriate. If a court finds that a person has a psychiatric illness and is likely to be a danger to himself or herself or others, or is insane, not liable to the courts for his or her deeds and should be committed to a designated centre, then a suitable centre should be built. If the Minister were to agree that this was a temporary clause, I might consider withdrawing my amendment. Otherwise I will press my amendments Nos. 16, 28 and 40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a vexed issue. On Committee Stage we spent some time discussing the appropriateness of the designation of a prison or part thereof as a suitable designated centre. The recommendation in the Henchy report of almost 30 years ago was that special units would be established to provide for persons who needed some care and detention facilities. We do not have even one special unit. The medical profession and the Prison Service loathe the idea that prison would be a centre to detain people in need of treatment. Prison has been used in the past as a dumping ground for people with specific disabilities and problems. The danger is that once it or a part thereof is designated, it will continue to be used as an easy dumping ground for people who are primarily in need of treatment rather than detention.</P>
      <P>While the Minister has at least moved to designating a part and not the entirety of a prison, which is some indication that he is moving forward on the matter, there is still a serious problem. I do not know why he needs to designate a part of a prison. The Central Mental Hospital is a designated centre and has secure facilities. Any replacement for the Central Mental Hospital will also have secure facilities. If we simply say &ldquo;prison&rdquo;, we are bringing ourselves into a situation where the primary factor is secure detention rather than treatment. That will always create a major problem in terms of what we are trying to do in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister is not doing what I fear he is, namely, looking at the proposal for Thornton Hall in north county Dublin. The Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, has reserved his decision on whether he wants part of the site for the Central Mental Hospital. If the intention is to locate the Central Mental Hospital in Thornton Hall as part of the prison complex &mdash; to designate part of a prison, in other words &mdash; there is a danger that people could be interchanged between the Central Mental Hospital and the prison in Thornton Hall and we could end up with the worst of both worlds where there would be tremendous confusion between the categories of treatment and detention.</P>
      <P>Can facilities required for a violent offender, psychopath, sociopath or a person with a persistent personality disorder or whatever not be provided within the designated centre, namely, the Central Mental Hospital? Are we talking about <Col N="2053"/>large numbers of people? We need some statistics on this matter. If we are talking about a very small number, do we need to go that step too far in designating a prison or part of a prison? Inevitably there will not be the same level of treatment because that is not the function of a prison or a part of a prison. One could not have such people in a part of the prison no more than in the prison itself because one could not afford it.</P>
      <P>We have only to look at what is proposed for the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital. The best way to get the maximum facilities is to have a single world class facility where all the services, surgical practices and treatments take place together. If part of a prison is supposed to be a psychiatric institution or a place for the accommodation of those with mental illness, dementia or disabilities of that nature, the position will be compounded.</P>
      <P>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh is correct. If it is the case that 30 years ago we sought to have a special unit established as a designated centre and now, with all the money available and all the modern thinking, we must still resort to designating a prison, it would appear we are regressing rather than progressing. We need some light at the end of the tunnel on this matter. It would be somewhat irresponsible of this House to pass legislation on the assumption that patients, the people we are talking about, would be sent to a detention or custodial centre and that we would simply add the <i>imprimatur</i> of designated centre as though that was appropriate. Will the Minister rethink that aspect? I realise we are on Report Stage but is there any need for this provision given the purpose of section 2(1) is to designate the Central Mental Hospital a designated centre? Also, the Minister for Health and Children, in consultation with the Mental Health Commission and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will designate a psychiatric centre. Could we not just leave it at that? Is it necessary to include amendment No. 15 in subsection (2)(<i>b</i>)? Could we simply accept the first part of the Minister&rsquo;s amendment and leave out the second part? Would we not have adequate facilities, certainly in the short term, to deal with it through the Central Mental Hospital and, in the long term, to come up with the actual recommendation, which was a special unit? That would allow us examine the possibility of a special unit and perhaps amend this legislation in the future when a unit would be in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>The whole concept of mental illness and prisons does not sit well with the general public but to a certain extent we are talking in the dark in that, as Deputy Costello said, we do not have any projected figures on the number of secure places needed in such a facility. We do not know whether this facility should be located in Dublin, whether prevention facilities should be made available or if the figures would justify such provincial facilities. In that context, it is better to tread slowly and recognise that one <Col N="2054"/>facility is sufficient for now. If it is proven that facilities are needed throughout the country, proper facilities away from prisons should be provided in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I examined it carefully, and Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh has acknowledged that I have moved considerably from the original text, but in the last analysis what we are faced with is what it is reasonable to do with somebody who is beyond treatment, for whom therapy is no longer an issue and who is simply psychopathic to such an extraordinary extent that he or she is dangerous to anybody who might come in contact with him or her. In that narrow set of circumstances, do we build a unit somewhere and leave it unoccupied, with no staff, while waiting for somebody to come along? We are talking about a place behind walls with immense security provision around it waiting for a Hannibal Lecter type person to be admitted who is beyond treatment and is not in receipt of drugs, psychotherapy or anything else. Do we build such a unit or in those extreme circumstances do we do what is provided for in this Bill?</P>
      <P>I take the point Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh made about the UN general principles but I remind him that those principles are stated to apply to the fullest extent possible with only such limited modifications and exceptions as are necessary in the circumstances. Under the European Convention on Human Rights Act, any decision to put a prisoner into one of these institutions would have to be taken, first, in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights and, second, would have to be constitutional. We are talking about an exceptional case here. Deputy Costello mentioned figures but I am not in a position to predict the number of people with this condition that would come about but it could only be a handful.</P>

	<P>If an order of this kind were made, the Mental Health Commission would have to be involved in the process. It would not be the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform conveniencing himself. It would be the Minister for Health and Children of the day saying the facilities at the Central Mental Hospital were not appropriate for the person and that the person was effectively so dangerous that the CMH, or any other designated centre for the time being, was not an appropriate place for that person to be detained. From that point of view this is a measure of ultimate resort. I accept the point that we had more resources than we did when Judge Henchy drafted his report but on the other hand we are talking about resources. Members know that although we have resources there are other areas in which to use them. If the Minister for Health and Children were to come into the House and announce she proposed spending &euro;15 <Col N="2055"/>million, &euro;20 million or &euro;30 million to put in place a secure unit on a greenfield site somewhere and she was asked by a Member &mdash; I presume this is a question she would answer rather than Professor Drumm &mdash; how she could justify spending &euro;15 million or &euro;30 million having watchmen and maintenance craftsmen keeping this unit going when there was nobody in it, would we say that was a sensible way to apply resources?</P>
      <P>On the points Deputy Costello made, this is not a back-door method by me to get the CMH out to the Thornton site. If that decision is made it will have nothing to do with this provision. On the contrary, if it were located on a portion of the Thornton site it would be less reason for an order of this kind to be made because there would be no particular advantage one way or the other to making an order of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am resisting all bad thoughts at the moment.</P>
      <P>To reply to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, this is an exceptional power. There are designated centres in place. The Mental Health Commission would have to express a view on this and it is extremely unlikely, therefore, that it would be used in an abusive way because the Mental Health Commission would say we are going down the wrong track in this particular case. It is not as if a Minister for Health and Children could do this overnight in consort with me and get away with it. If that were to happen the Mental Health Commission would have to be involved in the plan. I want to quote from the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s submission to the Department on the Bill as passed by the Seanad. It states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The consultation by the Minister for Health and Children with the Mental Health Commission in relation to the designation of psychiatric centres, apart from the Central Mental Hospital, as designated centres is welcome. [That is section 2(2)(<i>a</i>)]. However, it is the view of the Mental Health Commission that the designated centre should also meet the criteria for registration as an approved centre as per the Mental Health Act 2001 and be so registered. The Mental Health Commission also wishes to highlight that if part of a prison is deemed to be a designated centre, then the mental health services provided in the prison will come within the remit of the Inspector of Mental Health Services and the Mental Health Commission.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The Mental Health Commission has examined this provision and it is saying this cannot be used to put it off campus, so to speak. If it is used for that purpose, it will have a function in regard to it.</P>
      <P>I realise it is probably an extreme case and that this may only happen on a handful of occasions <Col N="2056"/>but if we are dealing with somebody who is beyond therapy, who cannot benefit from drugs or therapy of a counselling kind or whatever, a psychopathic, highly dangerous person who cannot be accommodated in anything approaching a normal mental health institution, there should be some means of dealing with those very rare cases. The safeguards being put in the Bill to the effect that the initiative must come from the Minister for Health and Children, that it must be done with the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and that the Mental Health Commission must be involved in the whole process and take on a supervisory role, means it is not likely to widen out into some abusive arrangement. In those circumstances, I ask the Deputies to accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I acknowledge that the Minister has moved on this issue and I did not suggest that it would be used in an abusive way. I do not believe prison is an appropriate place for such people and that has been borne out by others. The commission also believes that if this Bill is passed it would have to have a role and nobody would suggest otherwise. The commission and others stated that the Central Mental Hospital is the only facility that can meet the needs of those patients requiring medium or high levels of security. If a unit needs to be built for a Hannibal Lecter type individual, the grounds of the Central Mental Hospital might be the appropriate place. The Minister referred to cases where there would be no appropriate medication or therapy, but the very fact of committing someone to such an institution would oblige that institution to use every available therapy to alleviate the person&rsquo;s problems. Otherwise, we are giving up hope on someone and we must always hope to help persons with a mental disorder, even if it is as severe as the example provided by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the commission and the inspectorate would have a role in viewing and visiting a designated part of a prison. However, the prison officers and the prison governor are not qualified, so a huge level of resources would have to be diverted from somewhere else to address one person within the prison system. At least within the grounds of the Central Mental Hospital, such staff would be available and would have the appropriate specialist training, facilities and medication to deal with the person. My amendment should be accepted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The thorny question is whether we need to go down the road outlined by the Minister. We need some clarification. What happens at the moment? Is there any statutory underpinning of the transfer system between the <Col N="2057"/>Central Mental Hospital and Mountjoy for exceptional cases? How often has this happened? What is the best medical advice on this? What are the numbers involved? Do we need a unit at all? Are the security measures in the Central Mental Hospital adequate to deal with the situation? It seems that the Central Mental Hospital is the place to deal with the situation envisaged here, if that situation is of any significance. We are in the dark on these issues to some extent.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the type of person to which he refers is beyond the possibility of care or treatment, that is, a person who is a complete psychopath and is not responsive to any treatment. Immediately after the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, the legislation states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The Minister for Health and Children may by order designate a psychiatric centre or, with the consent of the Minister, a prison or any part thereof as a centre (and any psychiatric centre, prison or any part thereof so designated is in this Act referred to as &ldquo;a designated centre&rdquo;) for the reception, detention and, where appropriate, care or treatment of persons or classes of persons committed or transferred.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">It seems it is not appropriate to treat or care for the person to whom the Minister refers as that person has gone beyond such a stage. How many people are at that stage at the moment? We have not yet legislated for this, so there has not yet been any great outcry about such a situation envisaged by the Minister. We would have known all about characters like Hannibal Lecter for whom the Minister is making provision. Did the medical profession come to him about such people? How many of them are out there and how have they been treated thus far? If there is a major security problem, we should hear about it.</P>
      <P>We should take on board the principle of the Henchy commission recommendations, namely, that a special unit be provided for seriously ill people who need treatment and secure detention. The cheapest and most pertinent place to do this is in the Central Mental Hospital, which is already a designated centre. Our past experience is that people have been transferred higgledy-piggledy from Mountjoy to the Central Mental Hospital without any great medical criteria. Once prison exists for these issues, the temptation is that it will be used and abused.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 5, to delete lines 14 to 25 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) Subject to <i>subsections (7)</i> and <i>(8)</i>, in a case to which <i>paragraph (a)</i> relates, the Court determines that an accused person is unfit to be tried, that Court shall adjourn the proceedings until further order, and may&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="3">(i) if it is satisfied, having considered the evidence of an approved medical officer adduced pursuant to <i>subsection (6)</i> and any other evidence that may be adduced before it that the accused person is suffering from a mental disorder (within the meaning of the Act of 2001) and is in need of in-patient care or treatment in a designated centre, commit him or her to a specified designated centre until an order is made under <i>section 12</i>, or</P>
      <P LI="3">(ii) if it is satisfied, having considered the evidence of an approved medical officer adduced pursuant to <i>subsection (6)</i> and any other evidence that may be adduced before it that the accused person is suffering from a mental disorder or from a mental disorder (within the meaning of the Act of 2001) and is in need of out-patient care or treatment in a designated centre, make such order as it thinks proper in relation to the accused person for out-patient treatment in a designated centre.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I stated on Committee Stage that I would re-examine the provisions of section 3. What I had in mind was that, as drafted, the provisions of the section did not go far enough to give the courts discretion to deal with a person on the basis that <Col N="2059"/>the degree of mental illness might not be serious enough to warrant inpatient care or treatment at a designated centre. Generally speaking, the criminal justice system is concerned with protecting the public, punishing criminals and administering the law in a fair and just manner.</P>
      <P>However, the police and prosecutors in the courts should strive to conduct their business in a way that protects the rights not only of victims of crime but of particularly vulnerable persons, including those unfortunate enough to suffer from mental disorders. An important consideration in all this is that no one with a mental disorder should be inappropriately held in police custody or in prison. I am aware that there is concern that people with mental illnesses are prosecuted and imprisoned, often for relatively minor offences, and I think here of recent research by the national forensic science mental health service at the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, which was carried out for the Prison Service.</P>
      <P>The Henchy report, on which much of this Bill is based, referred to the need to ensure that persons who under the existing law would pass, at least in the first instance, into a prison or other place of detention, should instead go to a designated centre to become a patient rather than a prisoner, generally under ultimate control of the courts. Section 3 has been drafted with that objective clearly in mind. The report, however, also envisages that the courts have the power, based on expert psychiatric opinion, to decree that outpatient treatment and community care should be the primary consideration, so that only those whose condition required it would be detained for inpatient services. It is that possibility that my amendment seeks to address, allowing a court to decide on the basis of expert opinion whether a person charged, whose fitness to stand trial is an issue, could be referred for treatment or care on an outpatient basis. The Mental Health Commission also wrote to me on this point, suggesting that I provide for this additional form of court diversion.</P>
      <P>Overall, the section as amended will bring us more into line with the relevant 1991 UN principles referred to by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh. In the circumstances, the amendments also meet concerns expressed by the Department of Health and Children, particularly concerning the Bill&rsquo;s implications for the provision of mental health services. Such conclusions could only be reached by the court on the basis of evidence provided by an appropriate medical officer that the accused person is suitable for outpatient treatment. We must protect the public too; we cannot have people put out of the courts who clearly should not be. There is an evidential basis.</P>
      <P>I draw Deputies&rsquo; attention to the terms of the amendments that provide for the outpatient option. There are references in the relevant subparagraphs that the accused person is suffering <Col N="2060"/>from a mental disorder or a mental disorder within the meaning of the 2001 Act. That is to ensure that in this context the court will be able to consider the widest possible range of mental illnesses, and not simply the narrow definition for insanity purposes.</P>
      <P>The difference with the inpatient option is that, by confining the definition to a mental disorder within the meaning of the 2001 Act, the court would consider only the more serious cases of mental illness, which are not suitable for outpatient treatment or care. That is because mental disorder, as the term is defined in the 2001 Act, refers to the possibility of the person concerned causing immediate and serious harm to himself or other persons. There are references to aggressive behavioural symptoms or seriously irresponsible conduct. Clearly, in such cases, outpatient treatment or care should not be an option, and the relevant provisions have been drafted accordingly.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 25 is a consequential amendment arising from the amendment providing for a court to refer a person to outpatient treatment. In those circumstances, the reference to committal, which was originally framed in the context of sending someone for inpatient care or treatment, is inappropriate.</P>
      <P>Regarding Amendments Nos. 21, 24, 26, 31 and 39, the revision of section 3 already allows a court to send a person to a designated centre, which includes a local psychiatric centre, for care or treatment. My earlier amendments also allow for that referral option. In the circumstances, the other amendments are unnecessary if the official ones are accepted by the House.</P>

      <P FLI="0">I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage, and I do not intend to dwell on it. In normal circumstances, when someone comes before the District Court, the case&rsquo;s merits are debated, whereas the only question to be answered regarding someone in this case is whether the person is deemed fit to plead. He or she will be sent forward without any examination of the case&rsquo;s merits, which would be the normal procedure if someone were before the court for another offence. Effectively, we are bypassing one of the major functions of the initial court hearing. It goes straight to a higher court, and here I propose, if the determination under paragraph (<i>b</i>) is that the accused is fit to be tried, that the person be sent back by the court of trial to the District Court to enable it to exercise its functions under the Criminal Procedure Act 1967.</P>

	<P>There is nothing to prevent a judge who is passing sentence from expressing an opinion of this kind. Hence, making a formal statutory provision for it would elevate it to an unnecessary degree of importance. While I have an enormous respect for the Judiciary, sometimes the opinions of its members on the question of mental treatment may or may not be correct. It is more appropriate that the opinion of skilled professionals employed by the State to come to considered opinion in such matters receives primary attention.</P>
      <P>One cannot stop a judge from making such a recommendation if he or she so wishes. However, if this provision were to be included in the statute, judges would almost certainly be asked to begin making recommendations. They would then ask on what basis should they make such recommendations and evidence would be brought before them, going this way and that. Time would be wasted by having a formal debate because there would be a statutory jurisdiction for the court to do so.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Hence, I would prefer if matters remained as they are. A judge who really believes something like this should be able to make a recommendation. It can then be left to the authorities to decide whether the judge&rsquo;s opinion is correct without having an adversarial debate with barristers on both sides calling evidence to get a recommendation. As the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment makes clear, such a recommendation would not be binding in any event. Hence, we would be better off if we left it without law attached to it.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This amendment arises from the criticism of a number of groups of the Bill on the grounds that aspects of it are inconsistent with the Mental Health Act 2001. A number of areas will require amendment to be compliant with the provisions of the Mental Health Act. One such example is the operations of the proposed mental health (criminal law) review board, an bord athbhreithnithe meabhair-shl&aacute;inte (an dl&iacute; coiri&uacute;l), which as the Bill is currently drafted &ldquo;shall have regard to the welfare and safety of the person whose detention it reviews under this Act and to the public interest&rdquo;. The Human Rights Commission has recommended that this be replaced with the formulation adopted by the 2001 Act, so that there would be continuity between Acts. That Act states &ldquo;the best interests of the person shall be the principal consideration with due regard being given to the interests of other persons who may be at risk of serious harm if the decision is not made&rdquo;. Basically, this amendment gives effect to that practical recommendation from the Human Rights Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have shown in this debate that I am quite prepared to accept views from Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh, Costello, Murphy and others. However, in this case, I do not agree with the Human Rights Commission. The existing wording strikes the balance properly between the welfare and safety of a detained person and that of the public. This amendment would attach more weight to the interests of the person detained and diminish the public interest or confine the public interest issue. The balance is properly struck at present.</P>
      <P>While I do not wish to delay the proceedings of the House, at present I discharge some of these functions. Files appear on my desk almost daily containing recommendations from the relevant authorities that I should allow a person who was involved in one of these situations out of the Central Mental Hospital on day leave and so on. As one does so, one is struck by the likely consequences if such a person did something appalling. One must be careful with those powers.</P>
      <P>Although I nearly always accept the recommendations of the professionals who deal with the individual in question, sometimes I add small restrictions because I am mindful of what would happen in terms of how any Minister would <Col N="2065"/>appear if he or she made such an order and the person went off the rails while availing of liberty. Consequently, the public good must be considered. The public also has rights in these matters and I prefer to leave the phraseology as it is.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This pertains to the question of having the choice of oath or affirmation. The Minister has stated that this is covered in the Interpretation Act. However, that Act merely states that the oaths and truths affirmation is for people who are entitled to affirm. That is not the same as including a general affirmation. While people who are entitled to affirm is one matter, a general entitlement to affirm is another. The oath refers to people who are entitled to affirm. However, it does not give a general right of affirmation and while the Minister has stated that it is covered by the Interpretation Act, I do not believe it is covered in a general fashion. If it is, perhaps the Minister will tell the House exactly where this is set out in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Interpretation Act 2005 has since come into force and repeals the 1937 Act. The Parliamentary Counsel advises that it is unnecessary to make provision in this Bill for the inclusion of the word &ldquo;affirmation&rdquo;. Section 21(1) of the 2005 Act states:</P>
      <P LI="1">In an enactment, a word or expression to which a particular meaning, construction or effect is assigned by <i>Part 1</i> of the <i>Schedule</i> has the meaning, construction or effect so assigned to it.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Part 1 of the Schedule defines &ldquo;oath&rdquo; as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">&ldquo;oath&rdquo;, in the case of a person for the time being allowed by law to affirm or declare instead of swearing, includes affirmation or declaration.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It is therefore unnecessary to include the word &ldquo;affirmation&rdquo; in the Bill. That is really the same issue to which the Deputy referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>That is my point. There is a precondition for someone&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the Deputy&rsquo;s point is that people should have an option not to take an oath even if they have a religious belief that would permit them to so do. It is much of a muchness. Does the Deputy want a person to opt for what, in his or her mind, is a second class declar<Col N="2066"/>ation and to state that he or she believes in the oath but will only give an affirmation on this occasion? That is the issue. Somebody who does not believe in the oath and has a reasonable ground for not taking it is entitled to affirm. However, if somebody who does believe in it states that he or she will not supply it, then one must ask oneself what is going on here. Such a person believes he or she is entitled to take an oath, believes in the validity and the effect of an oath, and decides subjectively not to give it. The idea of all of this law is that people, in so far as their own beliefs permit, do what is as solemn as they can within their own belief structure to say that they are committing themselves to the truth of what they are saying. Deputy Costello is asking me, in this context, to state that people who believe in the oath should be excused the obligation to take it for no good reason, except that they want to give what in their own view is a second class statement to the same effect. I would prefer to deal with this as a broader issue, in criminal trials, etc. If there is some human rights or dignity issue or it is embarrassing for people to have to identify themselves one way or the other, then so be it. However, that would be an argument for getting rid of the oath for everybody and having an affirmation by everybody which had the same effect, regardless of whether one had a belief of what one was saying in a divine context or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I take Deputy Costello&rsquo;s point. I am not oblivious to it. The new Act does not really change the point substantially. I do not want to start a legal revolution here today and state that the oath is becoming optional for people who believe in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will not start a legal revolution in the matter. My point is, where are the criteria for use of oath or affirmation? In fact, people take the oath or they affirm. Does a judge ask them their beliefs? This does not really happen in practice. In practice, they state that they wish to affirm. As it stands, a person is entitled to affirm if he or she is allowed by law to do so. That is all. What does that mean in practice? It does not refer to a person&rsquo;s beliefs. It is a mess. There is nothing clear about when one is entitled&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We could spend a day trying to research the law on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>We could spend a day on it but the point is that my amendment is the correct one. The Minister is telling me that he does not want to get into that business because it is a bit of a morass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>That may well be the case. He is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and he will be the one who will sort this <Col N="2067"/>out. There are no criteria, as I understand it, other than what is stated, which the Minister read out to me, to which nobody pays a blind bit of heed in any case. Will we give the general entitlement to people to affirm or to take an oath?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that is the question but today is not the day to make that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Then where do we stand on the matter? Perhaps the Minister would clarify it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;for the Judiciary all over the country and for every citizen who may or may not have the beliefs of their childhood or do not understand exactly what the law states about this. They still will not understand and if the judge states in court that if a person is entitled by law he or she can affirm, the person will ask how he or she is entitled by law to affirm. The judge would answer that the Minister stated in the D&aacute;il that it is one&rsquo;s beliefs that count. What if the person states his or her belief and that the law states something different,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>On one occasion a judge was trying to find out whether a child understood the meaning of the oath. He asked what was an oath and the child replied that it was a promise to God to tell the truth. The judge then asked what happens if one tells a lie having taken the oath and the child&rsquo;s reply was that one wins the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>While I will not press the Minister unduly on the matter at this time, it seems that the Interpretation Act leaves the question of oath and affirmation in something of a limbo. Certainly, it is unsatisfactory. Perhaps we might return to the matter.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 13, line 14, after &ldquo;determined&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;by regulations made&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This relates to where the review board reviews its functions under the Act. My amendment provides that its determinations will be &ldquo;by regulations made&rdquo; so that we will have something clear on paper. The Minister has already agreed to take on board my proposal that all the orders made under the legislation will at least be presented to this House. This is an eminently desirable amendment, that all the procedures of the review board would be subject to regulations made so that we know exactly what is happening and these matters can be pursued and changed, as necessary, from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2068"/>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I carefully considered this amendment but I am still against it. It would hidebound the review board too much if it had to proceed by way of regulation the way Deputy Costello suggests. The board&rsquo;s procedures should be flexible and they should not be required to make regulations every time they lay down a procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>If there is nothing specific in terms of their procedures, can we be clear on the criteria under which decisions are made? My amendment proposed that a review by the review board, subject to the provisions of this Act, would be such as shall be determined &ldquo;by regulations made&rdquo;. Will the review board make this up as it goes along without us having any opportunity of seeing the criteria?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no provision as to what would happen to the regulations anyway. There are no supporting amendments. There are only orders at present and, therefore, there would be a technical problem with it in any event.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As I stated on Committee Stage, I do not want to make the system difficult and have statutory instruments every time there is a small change in procedures operated by the review board. The board will be independent in the exercise of its functions. It will have a statutory duty, as we have just decided, to have regard to the welfare and safety of its clients and to the public interest. Unlike the position of the tribunals which do not require the consent of the Minister for Health and Children, I possess a role in that my consent is required for these rules to be drawn up by the review board. That is entirely appropriate in the light of my ministerial responsibility to the persons concerned and the public interest.</P>
      <P>I am not disposed to accept the amendment but even if it were otherwise, we would have to state who would make these regulations, where were they to be laid, etc., and that is not needed.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This is another technical drafting amendment proposed by the Parliamentary Counsel. Its purpose is to make it clear that the review board is not reliant on the initiative of the Minister in regard to reviewing detentions pursuant to certification under section 14(2) or section 14(5)(<i>a</i>) so that it can act on its own initiative in reviewing detentions under section 14 generally.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 46:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 20, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">17.&mdash;Where the clinical director of a designated centre forms the opinion in relation to a prisoner detained in the centre pursuant to section 14 that he or she is no longer in need of in-patient care or treatment he or she shall, after consultation with the Minister, direct in writing&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) the transfer of the prisoner back to the prison from which he or she was transferred to the centre, or</P>
      <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) the transfer of the prisoner to such other prison as the Minister considers appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The amendment will permit the clinical director of a designated centre to order the transfer of a prisoner no longer in need of inpatient treatment at the centre back to the prison from which he or she was originally referred. The matter was drawn to the Department&rsquo;s attention by Dr. Harry Kennedy, the clinical director of the Central Mental Hospital. The lacuna in the Bill in this regard is at odds with the procedure in place whereby two doctors in the Central Mental <Col N="2070"/>Hospital can decertify a ministerial order patient, which has the effect of returning the prisoner to the prison from which he or she was originally transferred. Clearly, it is important for the treating consultant psychiatrist to be able to discharge a patient when he or she no longer needs care or treatment. Given these factors, I propose to deal with the matter by inserting a new section 17. Consultation with the Minister is required before a transfer back to a prison can be effected. This will ensure the prison from which the prisoner was originally transferred is the most suitable location at the time of transfer for him or her to be sent. In other words, if the prisoner came from Mountjoy Prison, the Minister might say he should be sent to Loughan House as it is more suitable or <i>vice versa</i>.</P>

	<P>I fully appreciate what the Deputy is driving at but it is possible to add bodies by statutory instrument under the Freedom of Information Act 1997. Given the sensitive remit and functions of the new review board, I am not disposed to bringing it under the Act on a statutory basis. There is no suggestion that the mental health commission or the mental health tribunal operating under its jurisdiction should come under the scope of the Act. It is provided that bodies can be added to the list of FOI bodies. I do not want to burden this body with a statutory obligation, which could not be amended subsequently, without legislation, particularly as it takes up its new functions and bearing in mind its sensitive remit, without giving it adequate consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the amendment. It is worthwhile to highlight that the legislation is outside the scope of the FOI Act but it may come under it. Could the Parliamentary Counsel&rsquo;s office consider rephrasing this provision in legislation so every Bill presented to the House would be presumed to come within the remit of the FOI Act, unless specifically excluded? This would be proactive, given that is why the legislation was introduced. However, each Bill must be examined separately now and sometime in future it may be included under the Act&rsquo;s remit. In the meantime, no opportunity is afforded to people to avail of the Act. Will the Parliamentary Counsel&rsquo;s office consider changing the mechanism it uses?</P>

    <Title>Care of the Elderly: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the provision of services for older people and to outline what the Government is doing to meet the needs of this group. The significant growth in funding available for this sector in recent years is indicative of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the ongoing development of health funded services for older people.</P>
      <P>Advances in medicine and health care, more in-depth knowledge of health and of how to lead a healthy lifestyle and an increase in environmental standards have all contributed to people living longer. The increase in life expectancy is one of the great achievements of western societies in the 20th century. However, as our population ages, the number of new challenges in health care, housing, transportation and quality of life increases. One in five of the population of the European Union is an older citizen and the ratio is set to rise to one in four quite rapidly. The Central Statistics Office estimates that there will be more than 1 million people over the age of 65 living in Ireland by 2036.</P>
      <P>The Government has made services for older people a priority. This means supporting older people in dignity to live in their own communities, for as long as possible. Studies have shown that older people are happier living among family and friends and that they lead healthier lives if they are allowed remain in their community. It is for that reason most of our funding is directed towards community care and allowing older people make that choice.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, spending on health care services for older people has increased by more than &euro;302 million. Additional funding for services for older <Col N="2073"/>people, amounting to &euro;150 million, was allocated to these services in the December budget. This was the largest ever increase in funding for services for older people and reflects the new emphasis on home and day care. Almost three quarters of the additional funding, &euro;109 million of the full year costs, is being committed to community care supports.</P>
      <P>The investment package is focused on caring for people at home in accordance with their expressed wishes. The budget day package provides for a number of community and home-based initiatives, including home care packages, the home help service, day and respite centres, meals-on-wheels, sheltered housing, etc.</P>
      <P>It is important to have a high quality of residential care available for those who require it and additional funding was made available in the 2006 budget for the subvention scheme. However, many older people in residential care have a low to moderate dependency level and they might very well have continued to live at home if the right supports had been made available to them. The budget package focuses on providing care for people at home, rather than in residential care, as a first option. Often it only takes a little extra to enable people stay in their homes rather than have to go to a hospital or nursing home.</P>
      <P>Home care packages have been piloted successfully in several regions in recent years, with 1,100 provided by the end of 2005. In the 2006 budget a further &euro;55 million in full year cost was allocated for this area, &euro;30 million of which will be spent in 2006 and &euro;25 million of which will be spent in 2007. This will allow for the phased introduction of a further 2,000 packages by the end of this year, almost trebling the service previously provided. The Health Service Executive has advised that 249 such packages have been commenced since 1 January this year. I acknowledge the role of the HSE and its commitment to rolling out these packages that make such a difference to patients and their families. We intend to almost treble the number of home care packages provided last year.</P>
      <P>Home care packages are delivered through the HSE by a range of providers, including the Health Service Executive, voluntary groups and the private sector. The scheme is intended to be as flexible as possible and highly responsive to the real needs of the individual in order that where a family or friends of an older person wish to provide these services, they will be encouraged to do so with support and through linking in with the HSE or the voluntary or private sector.</P>
      <P>Home care packages are multidisciplinary and may include services such as nurses, home care attendants, home helps and various therapists such as physiotherapists and occupational therapists. These packages will be targeted at those persons who have maximised their use of existing core community services and who might otherwise require long-term residential care.</P><Col N="2074"/>
      <P>The home help service also plays an important role in keeping people at home for as long as possible. An additional &euro;33 million was allocated to this service in the 2006 budget, &euro;30 million of which was for 2006. This will provide a further 1.75 million home help hours this year.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive collective agreement between health employers and SIPTU was finalised in 2000 regarding the terms and conditions for the employment of home helps. This agreement provided for a significant improvement in the pay and conditions of home helps with the result that they now receive the same benefits as all other staff in the health services, including premia pay, paid annual and sick leave, etc. It was agreed with SIPTU in February 2006 to establish a high level group with an independent chairman to address issues pertaining to the standardisation of home help services, including clarification on the nature of the service and standard criteria for entitlements.</P>
      <P>Home helps make a significant difference and provide good value for the substantial investment in them. In many cases they make the difference between existing and living. The difference in quality of life for people receiving home help is significant and they appreciate the help they get.</P>
      <P>Day and respite care can give a much needed break to carers. Additional funding of &euro;9 million has been allocated for this, &euro;7 million of which is for 2006. This will allow for an additional 1,325 places per week in respite centres.</P>
      <P>Meals-on-wheels are another area where there is increased investment. Additional funding of &euro;2.5 million will be provided in 2006 with a further &euro;2.5 million in 2007. This service is important and I acknowledge the role played by volunteers in the implementation of the scheme. Apart from the provision of a meal, the social contact involved is important. The service is a means of keeping in contact with older people, many of whom live in isolated areas or suffer from loneliness.</P>
      <P>Sheltered housing for older people provides an alternative to residential care and reflects the desire of older people to live with as much independence as possible. To support the development of sheltered housing, a full year commitment of &euro;1 million was allocated in the budget day package, split evenly between 2006 and 2007, to provide frontline health service support, such as therapists and public health nurses, in this area.</P>
      <P>As outlined, additional funding was allocated in the 2006 budget to the nursing home subvention scheme for residents of private nursing homes. This additional funding amounted to a &euro;20 million full year cost. The aim is to standardise means tests and bring greater consistency to the different levels of enhanced subvention support throughout the country. When the scheme was first introduced in 1993 it had a budget of &euro;5 million. This year we will spend approximately &euro;160 million on it. A sum of &euro;8 million has also been provided to cover the cost of 250 extra nurs<Col N="2075"/>ing home beds which the HSE has already sourced. The HSE is now in the process of acquiring a further 250 beds to relieve the delayed discharges situation in acute hospitals.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Bill 2006 was published yesterday. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the existing subvention scheme for private nursing home care is grounded in primary legislation. This will help the HSE to implement the scheme on a standardised basis. There is some concern about the implementation of the scheme because it lacks uniformity. I hope we will deal with the Bill in the near future and, with the support of the Opposition, the legislation will pass through the House quickly and the scheme will be put on a sound footing. We will then see a standardised implementation of the scheme.</P>
      <P Just="Left">With regard to the repayment of nursing home fees, the Health (Amendment) (No.2) Bill 2004 was published on 16 March. It governs the repayment of long-stay charges for fully eligible people in an in patient setting. The Bill will allow for the full repayment of long-stay fees to 20,000 people who are still alive and to the families of 40,000 to 50,000 others who have died since December 1998. Priority will be given to those who are still alive.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The scheme will cost approximately &euro;1 billion and repayments are expected to commence in June. The Health Service Executive will appoint an outside agency with experience in making mass repayments to administer the scheme. This year we have provided &euro;400 million towards the repayments. I emphasise to those who are owed money that it is not necessary for them to appoint legal teams to collect the repayments on their behalf. They will be paid automatically. The Government introduced legislation more than 12 months ago, which provided for an <i>ex gratia</i> payment. We have most of the names and details of those who are currently alive on file and the money will be paid without any need for recourse to legal professionals. We had intended to pass the legislation before December 2005 but a number of issues had to be dealt with, including putting safeguards in place to ensure that the money is paid to those who deserve it and from whom it was taken. The Government made a commitment to repay the money and will do so.</P>
      <P>Legislation is being prepared in the Department to provide for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and the social services inspectorate function, as part of HIQA, on a statutory basis. The social services inspectorate function will be vested in a new statutory office to be known as the office of the chief inspector of social services. The legislation will also provide for the establishment of a registration system in respect of residential services for children, for older people and people with disabilities to replace existing registration procedures detailed in the Health <Col N="2076"/>(Nursing Homes) Act and the Child Care Act. A working group to examine the standards in long-term care settings has been established and is currently examining minimum standards of care in both public and private settings.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, established a working group to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, including improvements in community care and home care packages. The report of the working group on the future financing of long-term care has been presented to Government, where it is under consideration.</P>
      <P>We are embarking on an era where future policies must reflect the needs of an aging society and when care in the home will be a first option. This is in line with people&rsquo;s preference to grow old in the homes and communities where they have lived for most of their lives. Older people must be given every opportunity to remain in their homes and, where possible, as active members of the wider community.</P>
      <P>The recent budget package gives some indication of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to looking after older people. Having said that, I am conscious that many of the services for which we have now provided extra funding have been under-funded for a long time. In many respects we are playing catch-up. I acknowledge the important role the voluntary sector has played and from the Government&rsquo;s point of view, we have been highly dependent on that sector for the provision of a number of services for older people. It is vital that the investment made last December is continued and built upon. However, while money is very important in the provision of any service, attitudes in society must also change. For far too long, barriers have been placed before older people, preventing them from participating fully in our society. That must change. Just because a person has retired from employment does not mean he or she is any less valuable to society or is not in a position to play a contributory role. Very often, retirement can mean that people can play a more rewarding or fulfilling role. In any organisation one needs the enthusiasm of youth as well as the wisdom of age. Older people are often portrayed as being a burden on society but that attitude will have to change. I am delighted with the investment in, and priority attached to, older people by the Government and hope that will continue.</P>
      <P>Last year media reports on a particular nursing home frightened many older people. The ill-treatment they saw some of their colleagues receiving in that nursing home upset them. However, having visited many nursing homes, my experience suggests that the care given to older people is exceptionally good in most instances. Nevertheless, we must ensure that safeguards are in place to prevent mistreatment of older people.</P><Col N="2077"/>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this issue and emphasise the commitment of the Government to providing services for older people and building on the investment we announced last December.</P>

	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputy McCormack.</P>
      <P>There is no commitment from the Government to care of the elderly. What the Government has been doing in terms of elderly care is seriously lacking, particularly given that it has been in power for the past nine years. There is a growing sense that the Government suffers from inertia, complacency or does not know what it is doing, as far as care of the elderly is concerned. The Government lacks focus and direction and this is reflected in its record in the health service.</P>
      <P>One of the first reports I ever read about political involvement in the health services was entitled, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, published in November 2001. That report is similar to many others that have been published about the health services. The health strategy made numerous references to care of the elderly, as did the primary care strategy. The national task force on medical staffing seems to have disappeared. The Prospectus report examined the financial systems within the health services, but very little has happened in that area. The author of the Brennan report criticised the Government for not implementing her recommendations. We also had the radiation oncology report on the delivery of cancer services to the people of Ireland but again, very little has been done.</P>
      <P>If one looks at the reports published in more recent years, one gets a good picture of where the Government is going. In the Travers report, the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, clearly stated he felt he had no responsibility for the health service. It is some indictment of the Government that a Minister would say that he had no responsibility for what was happening on his watch. The Ferns Report showed shocking abuse of children in our society. Bearing in mind that the Government has been in office for nine years, when representatives of the One in Four group appeared before the Joint Committee on Health and Children, they stated clearly that there are still enormous deficits with regard to the protection of children in our society. The Madden inquiry examined the issue of organ retention. The hygiene audit report highlighted the filthy condition of some of our hospitals. The litany of negative reports has now been crowned off with the Lourdes Hospital inquiry. Almost every report from the Department of Health and Children in the past two or three years highlights what has gone wrong with our health services. We have moved on from the days when Deputy Martin published 150 reports on how he would make the health services better. Now the Government is publishing reports highlighting the prob<Col N="2078"/>lems in the health service. The last report published by the Government on mental health services, A Vision for Change, not only highlights the Government&rsquo;s idealistic nonsense of what it will do for the health service, it also highlights the diabolical state of mental health services. There is no commitment from the Government for care for the elderly, a lack of commitment mirrored across the health service.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The social services inspectorate was to be introduced as part of the 2001 health strategy. Today, however, the Government informs us that it will be part of the forthcoming Health Information and Quality Authority legislation. I hope we will see it, as much has been promised in the legislation, apart from its actual publication. Long before the disclosure of Leas Cross and hiring experts to examine what went wrong with care for the elderly, a policy for funding care for the elderly was promised. Today, the Government informs us that it is still under consideration after nine years. It is unbelievable how slow the Government is when making a decision on any important issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Is the Government aware that the elderly population will increase every year from now on? Only when care for the elderly becomes a crisis might it dawn on someone in Fianna F&aacute;il or the Progressive Democrats what is happening. Legislation was promised in the 2001 health strategy for people to learn about their entitlements in the system, yet it is still not crystal clear with a few million euro here and a few million euro there. Usually it is taken from one service for another with no funding being actually given. The Government has no focus or plan for the health service, especially for care for the elderly. It is as if Ministers pick up the newspapers in the morning, see where the latest crisis is and throw a few million euro at it.</P>
      <P>Cancer rates will increase, yet elderly people are discriminated against in the treatment they receive for cancer. Is there a sense that the service must be rationed because it is not freely available? Will more orthopaedic consultants be recruited to replace broken hips because the Government has not realised osteoporosis, brittle bone disease, is a preventable illness? With health promotion and proper screening, those orthopaedic consultants may not be needed. The Government always waits for the crisis to occur before thinking what to do. A person who fractures a hip, not only loses his or her independence and self confidence but invariably ends up in a nursing home at an even greater cost to the State.</P>
      <P>The home care packages are simply a repackaging of home help hours because the Government was exposed to the fact it had cut home help hours. It is not a suitable alternative, particularly with the problems concerning VAT. The process is too slow. Why does the Government not move on and sort out these problems?</P>
      <P>Heart disease is a growing problem. Again, there is discrimination in how elderly people are <Col N="2079"/>treated for the disease. No proper screening policies are in place. Heartwatch, a secondary prevention programme run by the Government in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner, is not really satisfactory because it is not properly resourced. Diabetes is increasing, yet there is no national strategy in place. Nothing but waffle comes from the Government. It is irritating for Members on this side of the House listening to Ministers rehashing old statements. Why does the Government not publish reports and inform us how it will implement them?</P>
      <P Just="Left">Telling old people that they have a medical card when they are over 70 years or that they might receive &euro;200 a week in the pension is simply a softener for the next general election. That is not good enough anymore. The problems faced by the elderly are too large for that approach. The Government must show where it is going. A small percentage of elderly people will need long-term nursing home care. The majority live well and have reasonably good qualities of life in their own homes. However, if we are to help the small percentage with a poor quality of life, we must begin planning for it now and not massage figures. Last year&rsquo;s budget gave &euro;150 million for care for the elderly. It has been reduced to &euro;110 million this year. The Government is splitting its funding figures each month. I am beginning to have <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i> with what happened with the doctor-only medical cards and the ten-point plan for accident and emergency services. It will be the same for the care for the elderly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Health and Children, who was in the Chamber for the Order of Business, is not present to take this debate. It is obvious she does not want to answer any questions in the D&aacute;il on the health service because she is ashamed of it. The Minister of State claimed elderly people want to remain in their own homes as long as possible. All Members agree that the majority of residents in public or private nursing homes should be still living at home. On 8 December 2005, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children stated in a press release:</P>
      <P LI="1">28% of nursing home residents have a low to moderate dependency and many of these residents might very well have continued to live at home if the right supports had been available to them at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I call on her to provide the proper resources for elderly people to live in their own homes. Despite the praise from the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children for the Health Service Executive, HSE, at both local and national level, it has proved it does not have the will to tackle the problem of better home care help.</P>
      <P Just="Left">To illustrate this, I will give an example of a case in the Galway West constituency. In the <Col N="2080"/>Connemara area a woman suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease was being cared for in her own home by her son. Up to August 2005, she had eight hours&rsquo; home help care, three hours with the registered general nurse and some hours from the Alzheimer Society Ireland. Last September, owing to the retirement of the home help, the aged woman lost the benefit of the eight hours home help for August and September. Four hours were restored in October but ever since, the woman cannot get back the lost four hours.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In early December 2005, I contacted the personnel section in the Health Service Executive western area to inform it of a woman in the area who would take up the remaining four hours home help. I was informed no budget was in place to recruit anyone. I wrote for confirmation and received a reply on 16 December 2005. It stated there was an embargo on the recruitment of staff. It continued: &ldquo;There are some people in the area who would work evenings, but we have an embargo on recruitment at present as we have our full complement of whole-time staff&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I then tabled a parliamentary question on 25 January 2006 on the matter. The reply stated there was no embargo on the recruitment of staff and &euro;30 million had been allocated to the HSE western area budget which would provide 1.6 million extra hours. When I rang the HSE western area, it knew nothing of the extra &euro;30 million or extra home help hours.</P>
      <P>To ensure I received the right reply the next time, I tabled three parliamentary questions on 8 February 2006. One reply stated: &ldquo;Public sector pay and employment policies do not prevent the Health Service Executive from appointing home helps or staff at any other grade&rdquo;. It also stated 1.75 million extra home help hours would be provided.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday 15 February I raised the matter on the Adjournment. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, informed me:</P>
      <P LI="1">There is no embargo on the recruitment of staff in the health service ... Accordingly, public sector pay and employment policies do not prevent the executive from appointing home helps or any other grades to provide health and social services to the public.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I sent this response to the HSE western area which returned it to me highlighting a line on public sector pay.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Since I was making no progress, I rang the national offices of the HSE. I could not get through to Professor Drumm but instead got his personal assistant. I left my telephone number but never received a return call. I was then informed to contact Ms Mo Flynn, the national care group manager of service for older people. However, I could not contact her and she did not return my call. I wrote to Ms Flynn outlining the case on 3 February and received an acknowledgement but <Col N="2081"/>no subsequent reply to my letter. l rang her office three weeks ago and was informed that a reply was being drafted but I did not receive it. I wrote again but have still not received any reply. In the meantime, this 88-year-old woman in Connemara, who is suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s, cannot get the four hours&rsquo; home help that would benefit her son who is struggling to mind his mother in her own home to keep her out of institutional care. The Minister is preaching all the time that such people would like to live in their own communities but no help is being given to them. In his reply, the Minister of State will no doubt read out details of all the extra money provided for various services. He should tell the Health Service Executive that money is available, however, because the HSE tells me that it has heard nothing about it.</P>
      <P>In February, I wrote to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children but received a reply stating that my letter had been forwarded to the chief executive of the HSE. She might as well have thrown my letter in the bin for all I have heard about it since then. I wrote to the T&aacute;naiste again on 6 March and received a two-line acknowledgment on 13 March but no subsequent reply. Last Friday, I spoke to a person in the Health Service Executive, western area, and pointed out the written reply concerning the &euro;30 million and the 1.75 million extra hours. I was informed that the executive had not received any word of this. The idea of announcing financial allocations in the Budget Statement and throwing money at the problem is a complete and utter sham as far as the public are concerned.</P>
      <P>In December and again last week, I supplied the name of a person in the area to the health executive. I was informed that if the person&rsquo;s son got someone who could do the extra four hours&rsquo; home help, he or she could be employed. I have discovered today, however, that the request must go through somebody else because the health executive cannot deal with it. The situation is a complete and utter sham and the Minister of State is paying lip service to the problem. He should ask the advice of those who are seeking the disabled person&rsquo;s grant and the care of the elderly grant in order to be cared for at home for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>I dealt with a case in Galway concerning a disabled brother and sister who applied for a downstairs bathroom. Their request took three years to deal with and both of them were in the graveyard at Bohermore before the grant was sanctioned. The way the Government is acting is scandalous. I do not fault the Minister of State because he is only reading out the script that was supplied to him. The Minister should be here to answer the debate. The purpose of the debate was to elicit answers from the Minister to our queries arising from the problems with which we have to deal. The message is not getting through to the Government that pretending to throw money at the problem is certainly not solving it.</P>

	<P>Ba maith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta Wall. T&aacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo t&aacute;bhachtach, agus t&aacute; athas orm a bheith p&aacute;irteach inti.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office has predicted that the population cohort aged 65 and over will double by 2031, from approximately 11% of the total population to 22%. This projection indicates the extent of the provision that will be required for our aging population. Service provision for the elderly falls well short of what is needed. This underlines the scale of the challenge facing us. First and foremost, as the Minister of State has said, it must be the objective of society to keep our older people in dignity and independence in the community for as long as possible. Unfortunately, however, as our society becomes more violent we must add security to the aforementioned objectives of independence and dignity.</P>
      <P>I was recently informed about a senior citizens&rsquo; Christmas party in Waterford city, which was attended mostly by widows. These elderly ladies used to play bridge and bingo but no longer do so because they fear for their security if they go out at night. There are health implications involved when such people find themselves confined to their own homes. They are unable to take part in leisure activities due to the fact that they are living in fear. I accept that this is not a health issue <i>per se</i> but in examining services for the elderly we must consider a range of such services. The issue of security for older people requires attention. It is appalling that Ireland is no longer as pleasant a place to grow old in, as it once was. While the scourge of crime and anti-social behaviour is a growing crisis for society generally, and must be combated, we have a special duty to look after our senior citizens.</P>
      <P>I also wish to deal with the issue of equity release by senior citizens on their homes to supplement their retirement income. Arising from the fact that interest rates on equity release products aimed at the over 60s are substantially higher than market rates, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority expressed concern about equity release, particularly home reversion. With residential reversion, a 65-year-old owner of a house worth &euro;600,000 can expect to get &euro;114,961 for a 50% share. This rises to &euro;158,773 for a 75 year old. These figures are alarming as regards the return to senior citizens. Age Action sees equity release as an option but the elderly need to consider their situation in the context of longer lifespan and ongoing care needs.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the conveyancing committee of the Law Society, Mr. William B. Devine, has stated that equity release is a complicated area and there is a great deal of responsibility on sol<Col N="2083"/>icitors to ensure that clients are in full possession of the facts.</P>
      <P>The post-retirement market in Ireland is predicted by some to grow to &euro;150 million by 2007. The Government must take all measures to ensure that senior citizens are not ripped off by greedy financial institutions.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I wish to focus on a couple of other care issues. The north-western part of county Waterford is in the south Tipperary community care area. The residential care centre for people in that region is in Cashel, County Tipperary, which is a very long way from their families. There are provisions for public patients both in Dungarvan and Waterford city but the rules are such that those patients will be referred to Cashel. This causes grave concern for families of senior citizens who go into residential care a long way from home. While they will obviously have fewer visitors, they will also be much further away from their own communities. Such links are so important to elderly people.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Deputy Twomey spoke about radiotherapy treatment services. The Waterford council of trade unions has tabled a resolution for the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament backing the provision of radiotherapy services in the local area. In some areas, radiotherapy services can be therapeutic for senior citizens, while in other areas they can be part of a palliative care product which gives older people a quality of life in their declining years.</P>
      <P>I seek the Minister of State&rsquo;s assurance that in no circumstances will a senior citizen be passed over for treatment or put further back down the queue because they are older and thus not given priority for treatment on age grounds alone. I would be very concerned if that practice was happening anywhere in the health service.</P>
      <P>Issues raised regarding the care and provision for older people range across a number of Departments. A SIPTU motion will go to the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament this year seeking that the recommended pension provision for the old age pension be increased from 34% of average industrial earnings to 40%. That is a reasonable request in our modern society where the cost of living is increasing for all sorts of reasons, such as the cold weather this winter and increasing fuel costs.</P>
      <P>The issue of ageism is often raised. I am glad the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department allows new entrants to continue to work until the age of 70. However, that only applies to people who entered the service since 1 April 2004. On an incremental basis we should provide for all those who work in the health services to continue working until the age of 70 if that is their wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>While some speakers are not that happy the Minister of State is present, I am delighted because many of the issues I will mention involve his constituency as well as mine. Perhaps by mentioning them we can move towards <Col N="2084"/>resolving them. One of the major problems we have regarding care for the elderly is the cut in home help hours. One must be careful when discussing the figures used regarding the Progressive Democrats aspect of the Government. However, replies received from the Minister for Health and Children on a number of occasions state that the cut in home help hours in Kildare is approximately 27%.</P>
      <P>In many cases the only human contact the person in receipt of home help has from one end of the week to the other is with the home help provider. If we further decrease those visiting hours, we will put the recipients under greater stress and strain and the demand for care in nursing homes and geriatric hospitals will increase. I cannot figure out how on the one hand we state we can reduce the hours because of the greater efficiency of the system, while on the other hand we state there is a greater demand for hours.</P>
      <P>In the system, a person is allocated one or two hours of home help per day. The people in receipt of the service value it greatly as they love to see someone visiting and relating to them what went on during the day. If we concentrate on the business aspect of this, instead of providing two hours&rsquo; home help and allowing people to get involved in the local community through home help, we will reduce it to an allocation of one hour and the home help provider will leave after that time regardless of the situation.</P>
      <P>I supported the SIPTU demonstrations on this matter. It must be addressed if we are serious about keeping senior citizens in their homes. The way society is evolving means a major decrease in the number of senior citizens who have a loved one at home. In almost all cases, the person who used to care for them is now out working. Those senior citizens are isolated. We are fooling ourselves unless we decide to take action instead of decreasing home help and creating a greater demand for nursing homes, geriatric hospitals and accident and emergency departments.</P>
      <P>For some time I have argued for the need to re-evaluate the nursing home subvention. There is no way a person&rsquo;s home should be used in the means test for enhanced subvention. It is against the ethos in this country of owing a home to pass on to one&rsquo;s loved ones after spending 30 or 40 years obtaining it. This is the only means test in which I am aware that the home is used. It is a disgrace that we allow it to happen. I ask the Minister of State to remove this measure in the new legislation to come before the House in order that we return the family home to senior citizens and that we do not say to them that we will put them into a nursing home and that their homes will no longer be their kingdoms. It is a disgrace that after a lifetime of hard work and putting the country and their families together, the one possession they have is effectively no longer their own because we use it as a charge against enhanced subvention.</P><Col N="2085"/>
      <P>It would be better to provide more wards in geriatric hospitals such as St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital in Athy. It is a wonderful facility and campus. If we examine the figures, the centre built in Maynooth cost approximately &euro;5.5 million while the Department of Health and Children returned to the Exchequer &euro;136 million that was not used last year. Consider what that money would do for the provision of extra wards in places such as Athy, Maynooth and Leixlip. Such facilities would allow people to enter for respite care and return home knowing there was a place they could go, while all the time they would be safe in the knowledge that their homes were still their kingdoms and would not be taken from them. If the home is not removed from the means test, the Minister of State will meet major opposition to this Bill, certainly from me. In all other social welfare means tests, the first line is that the home is not rated as means.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State examine the home help situation and review the forthcoming legislation to allow the family home to be protected? We can made some dramatic improvements to ensure senior citizens are still a priority and valued in the community. If we take away their homes and contact, we isolate them and leave them at the mercy of those who prey upon such people living in rural communities.</P>

	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputies McGrath and Gormley.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the issue of care for older people. This issue has come to the fore in the media and public life generally in recent times. The issue always existed. Older people have always needed the care of their families, their communities and the State.</P>
      <P>Many in the House will recall the dedicated work of the late Willie Bermingham who founded the organisation ALONE and who almost single-handedly exposed the scandal of older people living and dying alone and forgotten in our midst. That was happening at a time when older traditions of large families and wide family support systems were breaking down. Care for older people has greatly improved since, but there are still far too many older people on the margins in our society, often living alone, with inadequate fixed incomes, without proper support and isolated in their final years. Many are long-stay patients in hospitals not because of illness but because the State does not provide the appropriate residential facilities to accommodate them.</P>
      <P>The Leas Cross scandal exposed not only the abuse of older people in that nursing home but, equally scandalously, the failure of the State properly to regulate nursing homes. We are still waiting for legislation and a regulatory framework with adequate numbers of inspectors and enforcement. Most old people want to live their lives as close to their families and friends as they can, in their own homes preferably and with the best supports the State can offer. They deserve <Col N="2086"/>no less and every effort by the State should be geared towards this end.</P>
      <P>One of the main State-provided supports is the home help service. This month, however, home help workers had to demonstrate to demand proper pay. The service is inadequate from the points of view of service users and the home help workers. These services should be expanded and developed along proper lines with decent pay and conditions for home help workers and the provision of the hours of service that older people need.</P>
      <P>Many fear that the only way they can be cared for as they grow older is through selling their homes and using the proceeds to finance long-term nursing home care. In many cases that is the sad reality because there is no family support and State supports are inadequate. The Government needs to look long and hard at its own policies which are driving this process and pushing many older people into nursing home care who neither want nor need to be there.</P>
      <P>The spiralling price of property creates a pressure on older people to sell their homes. This arises directly out of the Government&rsquo;s fundamentally flawed market-driven approach to housing. At the other end of the process this Government heavily subsidises the private nursing home sector through tax breaks as exposed by the recent review of tax reliefs. These reliefs are driven not by the needs of older people but by the profit motive of the private operators in the nursing home sector. In this sector, as in the wider health system, two-tier provision operates.</P>
      <P>Those older people who can afford it can avail of the best care and accommodation while others are left behind. Instead of subsidising such a flawed approach the Government should use public money for direct provision for older people, including care and support for people in their homes and the development of local authority housing for the elderly. Our local authorities need to be funded to provide more accommodation for older people, including places where they can remain independent while availing of on-site facilities in a community setting.</P>
      <P>A recent ESRI survey has shown that 60% of people oppose equity release schemes whereby older people are encouraged to sell their homes to provide themselves with long-term care. There are serious concerns about these schemes. Speaking at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, Mr. Liam O&rsquo;Reilly, chief executive of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority stated that the authority was concerned about the potential mis-selling of home reversion products on the market because they are unregulated. He said it would support the introduction of legislative amendments that would require these products and their providers to be regulated.</P>
      <P>Everyone in this society has a responsibility to ensure that older people are empowered to live their lives to the fullness of their ability. If we are <Col N="2087"/>spared, we will all be there eventually. Individuals in paid employment have a responsibility to ensure that they provide for the future as best they can. Employers and Government have an equal obligation to facilitate this provision through proper pension arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this important debate on the elderly. I also welcome any extra spending and funding used to provide services for the elderly. We should acknowledge any step forward. I wish to support the elderly in a practical way and to put forward a few ideas on how to assist them in their communities and ensure they have maximum support.</P>
      <P>Approximately 440,000 people, 11% of the population are over 65 years of age. Many do not regard 65 as old. People who reach that age want to continue working, contributing to, and being directly involved in society. We should do away with the idea that at the age of 65 people should pack their bags and go fishing when they want to do many other things. The elderly should have choice.</P>
      <P>Of these 440,000, approximately 266,000 are over 70 years of age and one third live alone. There are 25,000 elderly people in long-stay beds or nursing homes and a further 13,000 who need high to maximum dependency care continue to live at home. This should be the focus of the Minister of State&rsquo;s investment. The supports should be in place for these 13,000 people as priority cases.</P>
      <P>We should also respect the rights of the elderly, most of whom wish to receive care in their homes and local communities. We should never take that right away from them. Providing those services where possible should be a key issue for us, as a State, as taxpayers and funders of local services. We should assist the many families of the elderly who make sacrifices to provide the best possible care for them. This topic should be discussed in this debate. We have already made a start on it.</P>
      <P>I demand that the Government immediately provide adequate resources and a comprehensive infrastructure for care for the elderly. I also demand a guarantee of dignity through income support, a priority in health care, back-up support when the elderly are ill or convalescing, and information about entitlements as a right. These are core issues. I also demand accountability from decision makers which our society lacks. Too many people fudge, hedge and dodge decisions and responsibility. The Minister of State should get on with the job of looking after the elderly, put the funding in place and give them maximum support. If the Minister of State does not or cannot deliver he should be accountable to the people and the D&aacute;il.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste spoke this morning about the 400 people in hospitals who need extra supports in their homes or other residential units. This should be an immediate priority too because these <Col N="2088"/>people need the support services. Many of them ring my office regularly. They do not want to be in hospital. They want to be in a home with proper support services or in a different type of community. There are many creative ideas in circulation for looking after the elderly. We need to be flexible and consider these issues.</P>
      <P>On many occasions the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, have acknowledged that the home help service is crucial to Government policy because it allows elderly people live with dignity in their own homes and communities. It helps reduce the demand for expensive hospital and nursing home care.</P>
      <P>For years the service provided personal and social care for many of the most vulnerable in our society and it is often the only daily personal contact an elderly person may have with the outside world. Notwithstanding the public acknowledgement of the importance of the service, the Department of Health and Children and its associated agencies continue to deny fair and reasonable treatment to the home helps who provide the service on the ground. This is unacceptable because the humanity and decency that they unselfishly provide in the care of their clients is denied to them. I support SIPTU&rsquo;s national campaign, Be Fair to Those who Care, to ensure that those who work in the home services are treated with respect and dignity. It is important to respect the rights of the elderly as citizens and provide the services they deserve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>By the middle of the century, it is projected that one quarter of the population will be aged 65 and over. This demographic trend presents challenges and opportunities for the State and for society. Ireland is in a good position to deal with these challenges and opportunities. As a relatively late developer in demographic terms, we can learn from experiences in other EU countries. Moreover, we can harness our recent economic development to help provide a future in which older persons are treated as equal citizens. This presents us with great challenges in regard to our health service and nursing homes. We have an ageing population and people are living longer. We now have the technology and the medicine in our hospitals to help people live longer. That takes extra money, but we should not deal with that in terms of equity release, which was referred to by previous speakers.</P>
      <P>The Government is again going down the Progressive Democrats neoliberal line, allowing the party to dictate policy in this area. It is quite scandalous that the Government will force people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am hoping the Minister of State is listening to what we are saying, will take account of it and will not decide to take this route. It is heartless and ill-considered. The Government is clearly going to force people to sell their homes. This has repercussions not just for the older person but also for the children. So many people now can afford to buy a home in Ireland only if they get some money from their parents. Through the equity release process, that will all be gone. The Minister of State should think before going down that route. I know he is very good at keeping his finger on the pulse and probably realises equity release is not a particularly good idea.</P>
      <P>Older persons make significant contributions to society as citizens, as workers, paid and unpaid, as family members and as members of the wider community. In their varied roles and as individual human beings, older persons have rights. Successive Governments have failed to respect, protect, promote and fulfil these rights. Older persons have become increasingly marginalised and are not benefiting from the economic development they helped create.</P>
      <P>Recognising demographic trends and in response to the manner in which older persons&rsquo; affairs have been mishandled by successive Governments, the Green Party has adopted Citizenship, Equality, Respect: A Policy on Ageing and Older Persons. This document is an attempt to identify the needs of older persons and Ireland&rsquo;s ageing society, and to make positive and innovative policy proposals to address those needs. The issues faced by older people are diverse and this is reflected in the structure of this document. I cannot go into detail in the time allowed but will give some flavour, because it impacts on the role of the Minister of State in Government.</P>
      <P>The Green Party is calling for changes in the political system in order that opportunities for older persons are secured and their rights can be protected. We are looking first for a national positive ageing strategy. Successive Governments have failed to deliver effective, joined-up, holistic policy or action on ageing and older persons. The Government should initiate the drafting of a national positive ageing strategy. This strategy should identify the responsibilities of each Department and agency and establish deadlines by which specific reforms should be achieved. The strategy&rsquo;s targets should be integrated into the work plans of relevant Departments.</P>
      <P>At the time of writing of this document, older people in Ireland are represented by what is effectively a half of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for services for older people and health promotion. It is generally acknowledged that this has not produced satisfactory results for older people. The Green Party believes that older people would be better served by a Minister of State responsible solely for older persons&rsquo; affairs. <Col N="2090"/>This Minister of State should be given a greater role in co-ordinating Government policy in this area. His or her position should recognise that ageing is a growing issue for Ireland and that issues surrounding ageing and older persons&rsquo; needs are not simply health related. To this end, the Minister of State should be placed at the Department of the Taoiseach rather than the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>We would like to discuss these proposals in this House. The issue before us is undoubtedly one of the most important the House and society must face. I hope we will get the opportunity for a discussion at a later stage, particularly on Committee Stage. That is where we can tease out these important issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important business. As other colleagues noted, we must all be committed to care of the elderly.</P>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, on the efforts he is making. I was delighted with his promotion, not just because he freed up an office which I was then able to get, but because it was well deserved. The Minister of State has shown to all colleagues that he is doing a great job.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have said before that I try to bring to my politics, especially my work in Leinster House, my life experience. Deputy Gormley mentioned the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, and we had a meaningful discussion this morning with consultants from St. Vincent&rsquo;s and St. James&rsquo;s hospitals about tuberculosis. I pointed out that I came from a Dublin of a different era. In that environment I noted as a child that my paternal and maternal grandmothers were always very anxious to remain at home, even when they were ailing and becoming very sick. They both died at home, surrounded by the family. I often cite that as an example when people talk of the different levels of care we need nowadays, and of nursing home care and subventions.</P>
      <P>As I go about my business in my constituency and elsewhere in the Dublin region, I still get a clear sense that people recall the days of which I speak when older people had no choice but to stay at home. It was good for them to stay there, and I saw my grandparents staying. Even as a small child I recall they were anxious to do so. My parents unfortunately died in hospitals, but I remain committed to the idea that we should look after our elderly as far as possible in their home environment.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State knows my views on home help. I am very supportive of the Tallaght home help agency which does a great deal of work. I am on the board of the Tallaght welfare council and I try to support the service in a practical way. That is the way forward &mdash; looking after the elderly at home. The welfare council faces other challenges, including helping young handicapped people, and it does a very good and meaningful <Col N="2091"/>job for the elderly. I know such work is done throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Government must understand the needs of the elderly and consider the issue of carers. As a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs I have often made the point that we must continue, as the Government has done, to look after carers and home help needs. We all acknowledge the great contribution made by the elderly over the decades in the development of the Celtic tiger economy. That is not patronising, and it has been recognised by successive Governments. I am proud that Fianna F&aacute;il, in Government with the Progressive Democrats, has honoured the commitments made, certainly with regard to pensions. Other schemes have also been improved. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, has done a great deal of good in that regard.</P>
      <P>We should ensure that more schemes are developed to look after our elderly, such as free passports. Last week we saw the development whereby the elderly can now use their free travel passes at different times. The free transport scheme is important and we must work towards ensuring the elderly can travel free all day and every day on the buses, the DART and the Luas.</P>
      <P>In my D&aacute;il speeches I always refer to my constituency. I spend much time every day, week and month dealing with issues relating to the elderly. I spend as much time as possible going to places such as Glenview Lodge in Tallaght where they gather on a daily basis, in the south Dublin senior citizens group in Kiltipper and the various groups in the constituency not only in Tallaght but in my parish, St. Mark&rsquo;s, in the Tallaght west estates in Firhouse, Templeogue and Greenhills. It is important to do that because the elderly often have different problems and different needs. All of us as public representatives find that people come to us when they have particular needs and the systems are not working. I am always keen to stress &mdash; this falls within the remit of a number of Departments &mdash; that we should always continue to ensure services are easily accessible and known to people. In our clinics and offices every week all of us will get queries from people who, if the system was working, would have no difficulty in accessing services. There is a need to continue to stress that we must have information systems in place and public awareness campaigns on a regular basis so people, particularly the elderly, know what is available to them and how their needs can be fulfilled.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The citizen information centres, of which there is one in Tallaght village, do a great job in that regard but there are still gaps. On a daily basis I get queries from the elderly, or on their behalf, who say they did not know such a thing and ask how it can be done. It is important we continue to do what we can to improve that system as much as possible.</P><Col N="2092"/>
      <P>Any contribution on this subject would obviously have to include nursing homes and that whole system. In the Tallaght area many of the elderly have had to access services outside the area where they live. That happened in my family where an elderly uncle died in a lovely nursing home in Bray. He had to be taken from his home environment because he got to the stage where he was very elderly and needed the service but there were no beds available locally. In recent years much progress has been made in that area. In Tallaght there is Crooksling and there is a fine facility at Kiltipper Woods Care Centre. We must continue to look at the needs of the elderly.</P>
      <P>We are all aging. On the way here when I told one of my sisters I was going to speak about the care of the elderly, she said I would be able to speak about my future. It is the future of us all.</P>
      <P>I live in a town which has a young population. We are aging fast and we have to understand the particular challenges that will hold for future generations. It is important we continue to look at those needs and I expect the Minister of State will continue to do that.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State well. He has an important job and an important remit and has another 400 days at least before the general election and I know he will continue to look at these issues. As the general election momentum carries on, I am knocking on many doors these days and I get the sense that people do not want us to knock on doors for another year but that is the nature of the business. Many issues will be raised on doorsteps in a short time. It is important the business we are dealing with today gets the priority it deserves. All kinds of issues, including issues in the health area, that people regard as pertinent to gaining or losing votes will be raised. The care of the elderly is a matter to which we should pay attention. One has to do things for politics but also one has to do things for one&rsquo;s soul. I do not mean that in a virtuous or patronising way. It is right that we look after the elderly and their care. It is right that the Government would understand this issue is as important as any other.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Neville, will be aware that Deputy Gormley said the Joint Committee on Health and Children has a role in this regard. We have a huge programme over the next year but we have to understand that what we are talking about today is just as important. I look forward to continuing to support the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power. It is good that he is in House listening to the various contributions. He will always have my support. Despite what colleagues on the other side have said he has a particularly demanding and challenging job to do and I look forward to him being successful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this timely debate on services for the elderly. We have already discussed the home help service, nursing home services, assistants in the community and assistance for carers, all of which are important in terms of the State&rsquo;s duty of care to the elderly.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal specifically with one of the most neglected areas of service for older people, namely, mental health services. As life expectancy grows it is increasingly important to consider the mental health needs of people in later life and to provide a comprehensive range of services appropriate to their needs. While all users of mental health services are entitled to know their rights, what services are available and to access those services it is crucial for older people who have mental health problems. In addressing services for older people the Health Service Executive must subscribe to their inherent worth, respect and dignity and care for them on the basis of equity, fairness and accessibility. This is not only for those who are accessing mental health services but all services. We make decisions for elderly people. I see this all the time especially in discharging from general hospitals. We assume they do not have a view, a concern or a choice in regard to services. Of prime consideration is that the mental health services for older people should be person-centred and promote self-determination.</P>
      <P>The role of carers in the older person&rsquo;s life should be considered in every aspect of the service provided for them. It is essential that carers be given support and education on the complex and challenging mental health problems experienced by those in care, especially the elderly in care. People of advancing years are faced with a number of stresses and challenges resulting from a loss of close attachments, their partner and friends, changes in their vocational and social role, retirement, being unable to have the social life they previously enjoyed and the depletion of their health and physical capacities.</P>
      <P>The main conditions that come within the remit of the mental health services area are functional disorders of which depression is the most prominent in older people, organic brain disorder, particularly dementia and Alzheimer&rsquo;s, anxiety, substance abuse, mainly alcohol, and to a lesser extent psychosis which they experience for the first time. We assume that psychosis, like schizophrenia, occurs at a younger age but it also occurs for the first time in the elderly.</P>
      <P>The gaps in the existing mental health services for older people include the following: an absence of mental health services in many catchment areas, incomplete multi-disciplinary representation in almost all mental health services for older people teams, a lack of specialised assessment and treatment in most acute admission settings, inadequate accommodation and continuing care facilities under mental health legislation, a <Col N="2094"/>lack of dedicated day hospital facilities in almost all services, a lack of emphasis on recovery and positive coping skills in existing service provision. In other words, many of the elderly, if they receive psychiatric treatment and are emotionally assisted, recover.</P>
      <P>Primary care should be a critical component in preserving and promoting good physical and mental health in older adults. They should have regular contact with these services. That offers the possibility of identifying problems arising from social isolation, unsatisfactory living conditions and physical health problems. Given that most mental health problems in older persons will first present in the setting I have just outlined, it is important that the awareness level of primary care personnel is honed by education, through formal and informal means, to detect and intervene appropriately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak in this debate on care for the elderly. Care for the elderly in our society must become an immediate priority for the Members of this House and, in particular, the Government. To date, it has a shameful record in terms of its attitude to the elderly. The elderly selflessly contributed to the development of this country at a time when life was much tougher and the rewards for their efforts were more difficult to obtain. It is incumbent upon us to ensure that the elderly in our society are no longer left at the bottom of the pile and that they receive the care and support they rightly deserve.</P>
      <P>Dignity at any stage in one&rsquo;s life is essential. We must ensure that the citizens of this country maintain their dignity and have access to basic services. Those entitlements should be afforded to all but they are even more important for the elderly who should be able to live with dignity, have an adequate income, access to professional and timely health services and support to allow them live longer lives in the manner they wish.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Care for the elderly must be provided on many levels depending on the needs and wishes of the individual involved. This will range from low levels of dependency where individuals require little intervention, starting with weekly visits and monitored alarm systems, to the full-time dependency of nursing home care. In between those two scales are people being cared for by relatives, those requiring rehabilitative care and many more cases to be tailored for. The people caring for elderly relatives in their own homes must be commended in the way they provide that care with little or no financial assistance from Government.</P>
      <P>The key to implementing any system, however, is to ensure that the needs of each individual at the opposing ends of the scale, as well as those in between, are met in a caring and compassionate manner. Many elderly people are keen to maintain their independence. Last week, I visited the Emergency Response social monitoring service in <Col N="2095"/>my constituency in Bunclody. Having seen the service provided by that organisation for elderly people living alone throughout the country, I was very impressed with the way it carries out the service and has a huge impact on the lives of many elderly people. I intend to contact the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, directly in regard to that service to ask him to consider improving the level of grant aid and facilitating improved grant application processes for community groups throughout the country who are interested in accessing the service for elderly people in their neighbourhoods. Initiatives such as this are invaluable and life-changing for many elderly people and we must do everything to ensure the service can be accessed without difficulty and without being hampered by bureaucracy by those who need it the most.</P>
      <P>As we move up the dependency scale, there are people who require more intensive care. I have been very involved in the development of services through my work with St. John&rsquo;s Hospital in Enniscorthy and am very aware of the positive impact of the two 32-bed extended care wards built recently in which patients are now living. They are fortunate to have that facility. The proposed 20-bed unit for the elderly and mentally infirm under phase 2 is awaiting the go-ahead. That is of critical importance and funding for those types of services must be provided. The CSO figures have shown an 11% increase in the population of those over 65 years of age living in County Wexford. Assuming other counties have experienced similar increases, the figures underlie the need to ensure that services for the elderly are put in place without delay.</P>
      <P>Another element of the care package about which I feel strongly is the role played by carers. Whether they are family members, relatives or home help carers, the work they provide is of immense value to this country. Certain families and individuals literally devote their lives to the care of loved ones and the time has come to ensure they are given proper recognition and support. We must back up that support in terms of assistance, advice, guidance and, most importantly, respite care.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I cannot emphasis enough the need for the completion of phase 2 of St. John&rsquo;s Hospital. I am disappointed that the T&aacute;naiste is not in the House to hear Members&rsquo; views on care of the elderly. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, to convey to the Department the importance of the provision of funding for phase 2 of St. John&rsquo;s Hospital in Enniscorthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I preface my remarks by acknowledging the huge amount of work and funding the Government has put into the health services and in particular into the general area of care of the elderly. I acknowledge also that when the Minister was appointed I was of the view, and to a degree I remain of the view, that there is <Col N="2096"/>need for political goodwill on all sides to ensure she fulfils the policies that are vital to improving health services throughout the country. Without that, through constant political debate and sniping we may undermine her position and prevent a speedy delivery of the health services that could otherwise be achieved.</P>
      <P>I am deeply disappointed with the progress being made to date, particularly by the Health Service Executive in the way it is dealing with the development of health services and in particular the responses given to questions from Members of this Parliament. The replies are inadequate, inefficient and, at best, inaccurate. That is not good enough because if we do not have the information we cannot go back to the constituents we represent and help them deal with their problems.</P>
      <P>On the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; last Friday night Brendan Gleeson made some direct comments and was very passionate in the way he delivered those comments. I share his view. The treatment of our elderly citizens in terms of some services is shameful, despite the amount of money being allocated. We are not doing enough. For example, home care and home attendant hours are being cut and changed. In some cases the elderly person being looked after, who has built up confidence in the person coming into their homes, finds that person has been replaced or has left the scene altogether.</P>
      <P>I am aware that over &euro;3.8 million is being expended in my area in respect of that service but it is not enough. Much of that money is being used up by bureaucracy. I do not know the difference between home attendant and home care hours but I know that both services provide great comfort to the elderly person at home and much support to the family concerned. However, home care attendants and home carers draw their funding from different pots of money and are being pushed from pillar to post in their effort to provide that service. I ask the Minister to examine that specific area and ensure these hours do not continue to be cut and that the necessary funding is put in place to ensure a sufficient number of hours&rsquo; help are available to the people who need it in our constituencies.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The disabled person&rsquo;s housing grant was referred to throughout the debate. It is a shameful position for any of us to be in to have to tell the family caring for an elderly person that the funding for the stair lift, the extra accommodation downstairs or whatever will probably come through in 18 months&rsquo; time. Telling that to a person in their late 70s or early 80s who is ill is not good enough because all the family and the person want is a quality of life for the remaining time they have on this earth. It is unforgivable that the HSE and the Government would state this to any person who has made that application. It is not how the elderly should be treated.</P><Col N="2097"/>
      <P>While EPG grants are there to comfort people in their later years and while the projects involved are of great assistance, coming up with the balance of the money owed is often an insurmountable problem for the people concerned. Some other imaginative scheme will have to be put into place to ensure that these necessary aids are obtained almost immediately. That can now be achieved because of the amount of money in the system. Subvention of hospital care is also of great concern. Charges have risen to &euro;600 or &euro;700 per week, far beyond the reach of most families. Families have met financial hardship in attempting to support a family member in such a setting. The Government and the HSE do not do enough to help people being cared for in these private homes. There is a need for more funding in this area and a review of the bureaucratic system that administers the service. There is a need to look at the person and the family involved to ensure that the greatest amount of support is given. The family should not be put through further stress and strain in coming up with the money, sometimes having to borrow it.</P>
      <P>I put down a parliamentary question asking when the Minister would approve the &euro;2.6 million necessary for a 30 bed unit for the care of the elderly in Kilkenny city. The paperwork on the project has not been submitted to the Department for approval. I got a reply stating that it is a matter for the HSE, but that is not the case as the Department must approve it. I cannot understand why we must go around in this bureaucratic circle. If half of the bureaucracy was removed and the cost savings were put to projects such as this, it would allow greater efficiency in the service and provide money for projects needed in almost every constituency.</P>
      <P>Will that project be examined again? Will the &euro;2.6 million be made available? The issue has been debated politically for the past 30 years in Kilkenny and a resolution has been found, if only the money was invested in the project. When the Minister looked at the project several years ago following a visit to Kilkenny, there was a cost of &euro;2 million to care for people in the psychiatric services who were elderly and needed care and for those from the broader community who needed general care. In excess of &euro;1 million has already been spent to fulfil the first part of that project and &euro;2.6 million is needed to complete the project. I ask the Minister of State to take note of this.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister of State, Deputy Power, will visit Kilkenny and the hospital in Castlecomer, which has four long-stay beds and is the only hospital in that part of north Kilkenny. The aged population has increased significantly, as has the demand on services. When he visits the area, he will discover that the community has contributed much money to ensure that the project is continued. The people are asking for more long-stay beds for the care of the elderly in that north <Col N="2098"/>Kilkenny community. I ask the Minister of State to look favourably on their request.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Many elderly people in my constituency live at home and have no alarm system. Greater funds need to be awarded to the different projects led by groups that provide alarms, as it is absolutely necessary. I urge the Minister of State to ensure that the home heating fund operated by the local authorities is increased substantially so that elderly people&rsquo;s homes are heated.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important subject. It is very dear to my heart and it needs much more attention than it has got. I know the Minister of State means well and I pay tribute to him as he made the first move to get a day care home for the elderly in Cootehill opened by next June. It was promised in June 2002, but even though it took four years to get it, I thank the Minister of State for it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The care of the elderly and of the disabled is in serious difficulty. I recently received a phone call from the friend of an Alzheimer&rsquo;s patient. I was advised to call early in the morning or I would be unable to speak to the patient&rsquo;s wife. The patient is aware of what is going on, but he is too ill to be left alone. A very able person from the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society of Ireland is currently on maternity leave and there is nobody to replace her in the area. The patient&rsquo;s wife is now only getting very limited help. An octogenarian man from Cavan with a handicapped son was only recently granted two and a half hours of home help per week, which works out at over 45 minutes a day for three days a week. Anything less than one hour per week is absolutely useless.</P>
      <P>I am worried about the different service provided in different areas. An elderly lady in a wheelchair in Donegal received 12 hours of home help although her husband is still alive. They are now living in County Monaghan where she only gets two hours. This is just not on. Someone in County Cavan has waited for two years for an EPG grant because of difficulties between the HSE and the council. They cannot get the OT&rsquo;s report sorted out. If someone needs an EPG grant, he or she is either aged or sick. I put down a question on this and I was told that the Minister has no responsibility. Who has responsibility for issues such as this? I have heard of another case where an engineer from the county council told a family he could not look at their house for four months. There must be some degree of sympathy for people in such cases.</P>
      <P>An elderly person was in hospital in Dublin and his wife had to stay in a bed and breakfast while visiting him. She was told by the health officer that there was no possibility of her getting any allowance for her stay. However, if that person had received treatment via the national treatment purchase fund in England, they would have been put up in a four-star hotel. We must be serious about health care for the elderly. I <Col N="2099"/>recently received a phone call from a neighbour whose mother has been seriously ill for some years with depression. The last time I raised this issue in the House, she had been speaking to me on the phone a few days before and I could hear her mother crying like a child in the background. Yet those in Cavan General Hospital psychiatric section do not see that as a problem. We must take this seriously and ensure that the elderly and those who care for them are looked after properly.</P>
      <P>I could continue at length on the home help situation and the trials through which people are put to secure their entitlements. We were told in this House at the last budget but one that 9,000 people would receive a subvention for summer respite care, but I believe that the actual figure was only approximately 5,600. Not enough effort was put into it to ensure that those entitled to it received it. The subvention is also a joke &mdash; I raised the matter in the D&aacute;il yesterday and will not return to it &mdash; in that there is totally different financing in the north east from that in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>We are constantly reminded by the Government of continual increases in the old age pension. Only pensioners realise the proportion of their weekly money that they return to the Government in stealth taxes and charges for essential living requirements. The cost of waste disposal, rent, heating and gas has increased enormously in recent years and the amount of disposable income available to old age pensioners is extremely limited.</P>
      <P>It is well established that indirect taxation affects the most vulnerable in society, especially the elderly. People are on fixed incomes and no amount of propaganda that the Government puts out can disguise the fact that the basic costs of running a pensioner household for a week eat substantially into a pension that I accept has increased to some extent. Owing to indirect taxation and stealth taxes, pensioners are no better off today than they were ten years ago.</P>
      <P>Public spending on pensions as a percentage of GDP is projected to increase from 4.7% in 2004, the lowest in the EU, to 11.1% in 2050. That figure will still be one of the lowest in the EU. Public spending on long-term care will rise from a low of 0.6% in 2004 to 1.2% in 2050, approximately 4% less than that spent in a country such as Sweden, despite our economy being among the strongest in Europe. Despite all the promises and announcements, the Government is not prepared to spend the amounts required for essential services. In addition, there is the constant element of fear in old people&rsquo;s lives. How much longer will they be capable of independent living? How many hours more will be cut from their home help? Every elderly person has experienced cutbacks in home help in recent years.</P><Col N="2100"/>
      <P>The Minister points out the increased allocation in each health board area, either failing to realise or choosing to ignore that the cost of home help has risen substantially and that the number of elderly people seeking it has also risen. There are many other issues with which I would like to deal that have already been covered, but the most critical is home help. When it is not properly catered for, enhanced subvention becomes a necessity for those in long-term care. The other two issues that have been addressed today and require immediate attention are the disabled person&rsquo;s grant and the essential repairs grant. If we can get those three matters right, we will save the Exchequer substantial sums in long-term care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the other Deputies for sharing time.</P>
      <P>I am pleased at the opportunity to speak on this vitally important topic. Care of the elderly often seems to come bottom of the list of people&rsquo;s priorities. The elderly are very vulnerable for several reasons, and one of the areas in which that vulnerability manifests itself is their capacity to achieve the type of care and accommodation that they want and need to see out their lives. Often they find that they are not listened to. The dominant factors determining where and how they live their lives become convenience and cost-effectiveness.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman&rsquo;s report on the elderly highlights a large number of issues, several of which I would like to cover. However, I specifically bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention a situation in my constituency concerning St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital in Cashel, which is among the finest of such institutions and has provided a wonderful service over many years. Its future is threatened, and I want the Minister to deal with that. It is a great worry for many in my constituency.</P>
      <P>If an elderly person wishes to remain in his or her home, the State must endeavour to facilitate that. A key plank of that approach would be to accord the important role of carers its proper value in society. In that context, a more flexible approach to the habitual residency clause is needed. I know of the case of a constituent who left her job and family home in America to return to Ireland and care for her sick mother in south Tipperary. She does not qualify for carer&rsquo;s benefit, despite being an extremely deserving case. Carers&rsquo; rights are often inextricably linked to those of the elderly and the Government must bear that in mind. I ask the Minister to examine that issue, which is one of the most important. A person has come from the United States and has been denied carer&rsquo;s allowance and that should not happen because that person is saving the State a substantial amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter. Most Deputies and public representatives have a fair amount of <Col N="2101"/>involvement and engagement with the elderly and it is right that we discuss their needs here. Before moving on to my substantive points, I want to say one thing. Mention has been made of the disabled person&rsquo;s grant and the essential repairs grant, including delays in processing. Those are within the remit of local authorities. Those opposite who criticise the Government should contact their colleagues on local authorities up and down the country and persuade them to vote money for such grants in the Estimates, which will then be matched by the Government.</P>
      <P>I take pride in the fact that in Dublin we decided several years ago to accord priority to the essential repairs grant and the disabled person&rsquo;s grant. I almost collapsed the other day when an applicant came to my office and thanked the staff for encouraging Dublin City Council to turn an application, including occupational therapy assessment, around in three weeks. That does not happen often, but it happens.</P>
      <P>I have a criticism regarding occupational therapy reports. People awaiting such a report from the public sector in the city very often have to wait up to a year or even longer. However, if they pay &euro;150 for a private report, in most cases carried out by the same people, they can have that report in three weeks. That ought to be examined. The cost of the occupational therapy report should be recoupable by the applicant, especially if he or she holds a medical card, as is usually the case.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the number of elderly households in Ireland will increase from approximately 440,000 in 2002 to almost 800,000 by 2025. By 2030, more than a quarter of the population will be aged over 65 and, if today&rsquo;s predictions are true, the figure will be even greater. Furthermore, with improvements in health and lifestyle, life expectancy will also increase, with the proportion aged over 75 estimated to increase significantly. With that comes a reduction in informal family care, principally owing to participation in the workforce.</P>
      <P>In that context, the Government is working towards a co-ordinated approach of integrated primary care, community health and rehabilitation services. We can pick and choose. Of course, not everything is perfect, but a great deal that is right and good is being done, something that the elderly acknowledge. I will not dwell on social welfare increases as they are only a small part of the picture. However, over the past 12 months there have been reports by such organisations as the Mercer Institute on care of the elderly, especially regarding the long-term funding of continuing care. There has been the O&rsquo;Shea report and the National Economic and Social Forum has also reported. All these have stressed that well funded services must be delivered in partnership with the elderly, their families and carers, as well as through a range of statutory and non-statutory voluntary and community groups. <Col N="2102"/>They have supported the Government&rsquo;s aim to maintain older people in dignity and independence in their homes in accordance with their wishes for as long as possible. They have also highlighted the continuing need for high quality long-term residential care for older people when living at home is no longer possible.</P>
      <P>I wish to highlight the Odin&rsquo;s Wood day care centre as a model of good practice. I understand the Minister has had the opportunity to see it for himself. It is a centre which has been developed at Kildonan Road in Finglas with the co-operation of the then Northern Area Health Board and Dublin City Council. It is a good example of a centre to which people with community support needs can come once, twice or thrice a week to have their hair done, engage in some physical and mental exercises, avail of the chiropody services provided or have a meal. We should try to replicate this centre throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The voluntary housing organisation, Respond, has developed a centre, again in Finglas, which contains a number of residential units. The level of dependency is stepped, ranging from some people who are completely independent and are able to live on their own to those who are required to live in semi-nursing home care. They share a common room in which caring and medical facilities are provided as well as someone who is available to help them.</P>
      <P>The initiatives set out by the Government show its commitment to older people and to putting them at the centre of health policy now and in the future. It is entirely proper that we should devote substantial additional resources to services for older people. They have made an enormous contribution to society and need recognition and reward. Sheltered housing is an extremely important part of any strategy to deal with the care of the elderly. Most older people prefer to live in their own homes and consequently, the fixtures mentioned by Deputy McGuinness, such as alarms for the elderly, grab-rails, stair lifts and so on, should be made available without all the fuss and bother that many people are obliged to endure at present.</P>
      <P>However, when the elderly are no longer able to remain at home, it is important that the option of sheltered housing is available. Many local authorities have gone down that route with the help of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and much pioneering work has been done by Dublin City Council. For example, older people who own their homes are able to sell them to the council and to make a contribution of between a third and a fifth, depending on their age, towards getting high quality accommodation in which they can live with the support of many other community agencies. I have seen some very good models of practice in Belfast and other parts of Northern Ireland and I urge other local authorities to go down the road taken by Dublin City <Col N="2103"/>Council, whereby services like general practitioner support and meals are available.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, I saw a good centre of excellence for the elderly in Summerhill, County Meath, and copied the idea. A report which was drawn up by the Finglas-Cabra partnership on the needs of older people in the Finglas area identified the need for a centre of excellence for older people in which there would be a mix of residential, social and medical facilities available in a single site. The centre will accommodate 45 units in a residential setting with some units having more than one person living in them. When its services are integrated with those available from the Odin&rsquo;s Wood day care centre across the road, it will become an important driver of services for the elderly in the Finglas area.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Advocacy by older people is very important and a number of significant groups are active. I will mention two of them. I draw attention to the Senior Help Line for which an 1850 number is available, although I cannot remember the exact number. This useful service is delivered by a woman in Summerhill, County Meath, and is available in different parts of the country. I compliment groups such as Age Action Ireland. I also have a soft spot for the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament. We need such groups and it is important that they form part of the advocacy process. I am glad to see that the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament, Age Action Ireland and a number of other organisations are participating as part of the voluntary and community pillar at the partnership talks which are under way at Government Buildings at present. Our policies must reflect the desires of organisations such as the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their contributions to this informative debate. It is obvious that Members are in touch with older people and the various organisations representing them and are aware of their needs.</P>
      <P>Many contributions mentioned the issue of home help. There have been some difficulties with regard to the qualifying criteria for home help. Moreover, in some cases people may have felt that the hours they received did not match what was required. This year, the Government will provide an additional &euro;30 million for home help which will facilitate the provision of 1.75 million extra home help hours. This has been put in place and should have a significant and positive impact.</P>
      <P>The Government acknowledges that it must continue to develop services to meet growing need and that it cannot be complacent in this respect. Its budget investment has demonstrated its commitment to the wishes expressed by older people, by focusing on community care, to which almost three quarters of the additional funding from this year&rsquo;s budget has been allocated.</P><Col N="2104"/>
      <P>Earlier, I outlined the additional &euro;150 million which was allocated in the budget and the different areas in which it will be spent, which include home care, support packages, home help, daily respite care, meals on wheels, sheltered housing, elder abuse, nursing home subvention and delayed discharges. I also outlined the legislation which will be brought forward to give some indication as to the priority which older people receive.</P>
      <P Just="Left"><?oasys _ic14- ?>While I am proud of this investment and the priority the Government has assigned to it, I do not state that all is well. I am as aware as Opposition Members of the shortcomings and gaps in the services as well as the need for new services in some respects. Some criticism was levelled at the subvention. I appreciate Members&rsquo; concerns and acknowledge the need to streamline and clarify the scheme and to have greater uniformity in the manner in which it is administered. However, I hope that the budget increase of &euro;150 million will signal the start of a new era in which older people and services to older people will receive greater priority and that Members can work together to eliminate ageism and to promote a much more positive attitude towards aging. It is also vital that people&rsquo;s entitlements to services be clarified and that people have greater access to those services when they qualify for them.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
      <P>I again thank Members for their contributions. Their compliments and criticisms were appreciated. There is room for improvements in a number of areas and the Government will work to make them.</P>

        <Quest>if he will report on the decentralisation of his Department and its agencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department is required to move 250 posts to Carlow under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme. In addition, four of the agencies under the aegis of the Department are due to decentralise as follows: F&Aacute;S is to move 383 posts to Birr, County Offaly, Enterprise Ireland is to move 292 posts to Shannon, the Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown and the National Standards Authority of Ireland is to move 132 posts to Arklow.</P>
        <P>The number of Department posts in business units decentralising to Carlow, as at 20 March, is 276. Having regard to the Department of Finance agreed staff protocols, the Department has approached all general service staff who expressed a first preference before 7 September 2004, that is, priority applications, for relocation to Carlow through the central application facility and there are currently 169 priority first preference applications for Carlow, with good interest across all grades.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am confident that in the next two weeks, when officials in my Department analyse the so-called &ldquo;two to ten&rdquo; priority applicants, that is, those who before the 7 September 2004 deadline identified Carlow as their second or subsequent choice, there will be a further significant increase in applications for Carlow. Should there be a deficit of staff in a grade or grades following the &ldquo;two to ten&rdquo; trawl, my Department will then assess the post-September 2004 applications, in line with Department of Finance policy.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to assign Carlow-bound applicants to decentralising posts with 91 such staff currently in place and we expect to have all decentralising posts filled in sufficient time to ensure staff are adequately trained in advance of the move to Carlow.</P>
        <P>On the property side of the Department&rsquo;s move, the Office of Public Works has completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre. The next steps in the process will include the OPW finalising the public sector benchmark exercise and issuing a call for expressions of interest for the design, build, finance and maintain procurement option selected for this project. The OPW expects construction to begin early in 2007 and the construction phase may take up to 24 months.</P>
        <P>In order to accommodate staff who wish to move earlier than the projected new building completion date, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and <Col N="2106"/>the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and business units, are actively exploring the option of an earlier move to Carlow, subject to securing high quality temporary accommodation. This latter option could allow movement of staff to Carlow during the first half of next year.</P>
        <P>The Department continues to provide advice and support to each of the four agencies in progressing their decentralisation programmes and there is a dedicated agency decentralisation committee to drive the process forward. In addition, I am satisfied that each agency is fully engaged in the process and taking all of the relevant steps to advance its decentralisation plans.</P>
        <P>In outlining the current agency position on decentralisation, it must be remembered that CAF data is based on priority first preference applications. As with the Department, agencies will seek details of second to tenth priority applications over coming weeks and will then look at post-September 2004 applications to fill any gaps remaining.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>The F&Aacute;S head office relocation, involving approximately 400 staff, to Birr, County Offaly, has a target date of Easter 2009 for the move. The negotiations for the purchase of a site in Birr are at an advanced stage.</P>
        <P>In addition to the 67 or so first preference CAF applications from across the civil and public service, to date 71 F&Aacute;S staff have signalled their agreement to transfer to Birr. However, the inclusion of a relocation clause in recruitment and promotion contracts is being opposed by SIPTU, which represents a majority of the staff in head office. This was the subject of a Labour Court hearing, which recommended that the matter be referred for discussions to the appropriate central body. SIPTU balloted its members on this issue and has secured a mandate for industrial action. The Department is, with F&Aacute;S, engaging with the Department of Finance to see how the issue can be addressed.</P>
        <P>With regard to Enterprise Ireland, the most recent CAF figures show that a total of 52 people have signalled their interest in moving to Shannon at this stage. The most immediate implementation step for Enterprise Ireland is to provide for a new headquarters building, designed to meet the business needs of the organisation. Enterprise Ireland, working closely with the Office of Public Works, has identified but not yet acquired a preferred site in Shannon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The position with regard to the Health and Safety Authority, with 110 posts moving to Thomastown, is that to date a total of 62 people have expressed an interest in transferring to Thomastown. The authority has been advised by the OPW that as the site procurement is in the final stages, the current time-line for availability for occupancy is mid-2008.</P><Col N="2107"/>
        <P>The authority has now secured an office in Kilkenny city which will act as an interim base for 21 staff who are in the process of recruitment for the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals, REACH, strategy as well as some serving staff who wish to move in advance of the Thomastown premises being available. The authority has informed me that it hopes to have this office fit for occupancy by May of this year. All staff who move in the interim to Kilkenny city will transfer to Thomastown when the premises there are completed.</P>
        <P>With regard to the National Standards Authority of Ireland, a total 132 staff are to be relocated to Arklow. The latest available CAF figures show the total number of first preference priority applications received from within the agency is 11. When those from across the civil and public service are added the total is 130. However, a significant grade mismatch is evident within these numbers. NSAI is working closely with OPW in identifying and securing suitable office accommodation in the Arklow area and the NSAI anticipates a target date of April 2009 as the completion date of its decentralisation programme.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and acknowledge the progress that has been made in decentralisation to Carlow. I hope the transfer of the full complement of 312 posts promised will be able to be achieved in the construction phase and accommodated through that phase.</P>
        <P>On the movement of F&Aacute;S to Birr, notice of strike action has been served. Recently, there was a ballot of people indicating they did not want to go to Birr and there was a low level of interest in any case. In his response will the Minister of State outline how he will reconcile this lack of interest as well the industrial relations problems that the movement of F&Aacute;S to Birr will create, not only for F&Aacute;S but perhaps for other agencies through a knock-on effect?</P>

        <P>One of the issues the Minister of State might take on board is broadband access. There is no planning being carried out to include access to broadband and the Internet for Thomastown in the light of this decision to decentralise the Health and Safety Authority there.

        <P Just="Left">The labour inspectorate contacted the principal parties on this issue on Tuesday, 13 March and subsequently met with senior representatives of the ESB and its agents, and these contacts have been ongoing since.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the meantime, inspectors have commenced inquiries with the contractor concerned in this case and have visited both the head office and the site in Moneypoint. Those inquiries are continuing and a further visit is planned. The inspectorate is examining documentation already obtained from the contractor, who has been fully co-operating with the investigation. Additional documentation has been sought and the contractor has undertaken to provide this material without delay. The investigation is continuing.</P>
        <P>It should be noted also that in many cases current employment rights legislation has provisions whereby workers who believe they have been denied their entitlements, or otherwise unfairly treated, can, as an alternative to dealing with the labour inspectorate, take the matter before a commissioner in the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the Deputy may wish to note that there are plans, albeit only in the early stages of preparation, for a major investment in a programme of information dissemination on obligations and entitlements arising under current employment rights legislation. The programme will be targeted at both employers and employees and will focus on particular audiences such as those engaged in sectors now generally populated by immigrant workers.</P>
        <P>Section 37 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 states that a person guilty of an offence under this Act for which no penalty, other than under this section, is provided shall be liable (a) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &pound;1,500 &mdash;&euro;1,904 &mdash; or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both the fine and the imprisonment, or (b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &pound;10,000 &mdash;&euro;12,697 &mdash; or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the issue of compliance with labour standards the remit of the labour inspectorate is to pursue compliance with the statutory entitlements provided for in employment rights legislation. The inspectorate has no role in the implementation of rates of pay or conditions of employment that would generally be referred to as industry norms. In the pursuit of its remit the inspectorate would engage in targeted campaigns, announced and unannounced inspection calls and the follow-up of specific complaints.</P>
        <P>The current talks on a new national partnership arrangement include a focus on the applicability of employment rights entitlements in the context of public procurement.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. He supplied figures on the rate of inspection on 7 February. In 2002, there were 8,323 inspections and 25 prosecutions; in 2003, there were 7,168 inspections and 20 prosecutions; and, in 2004, there were 5,160 inspections and 14 prosecutions. The reason given for the lower number in 2004 was the EU Presidency. Last year, 5,699 inspections were carried out, 55% of the number carried out in 2002. What happened?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State stated in April 2005 that 11 additional labour inspectors would be appointed bringing the total number to 31. Following the Gama fiasco, only four of the additional inspectors had been appointed. Have all 11 been appointed at this stage? How long more must we wait before sufficient inspectors are appointed? We thought the Government would be sufficiently embarrassed by the Gama incident to appoint a reasonable cohort of inspectors to ensure a similar incident would not happen. However, the case of Polish workers at the ESB plant in Moneypoint, County Clare, came to light recently. That came about because ESB management discovered it and brought it to the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention and not as a result of a departmental inspection.</P>
        <P>Fines of between &euro;1,500 and &euro;10,000 are provided for in legislation to penalise unscrupulous employers. It is estimated the 70 workers at the Moneypoint plant were underpaid by &euro;817 per week before overtime. What is the incentive for employers to comply? If I am fined between &euro;1,500 and &euro;10,000 following conviction, I will still make a huge profit. When will legislation be introduced to ensure the main contractor does not walk away Scot-free from a contract because he has subcontracted the work, given that he can say it was not his problem because he asked the subcontractor to comply?</P>
        <P>How are foreign nationals who move to Ireland to work informed about their rights and rates of pay?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy that 31 labour inspectors have been appointed. Issues arose regarding their recruitment and training and it took three separate recruitment campaigns to achieve the full complement. This is a complex area and the inspectors cannot operate unless they know the rules.</P>
        <P>The number of inspections is interesting. I am not sure whether the same method of calculation is used now compared with 2002. However, a number of inspections, including that referred to by the Deputy, involves considerable manpower over several weeks. It has not been brought to a successful conclusion from the perspective of many of the participants. It can be misleading to compare the numbers of inspections. I expect the number of inspectors will increase in the context of social partnership. The review of the mandate and resources of the labour inspectorate raises many issues, other than the staffing level, such as <Col N="2111"/>the measures that need to be taken to enable the inspectorate to carry out its duties and a statutory requirement on employers. I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point regarding the need to review the penalties. That will happen in the context of the review of resources and mandate.</P>
        <P>The Minister launched a campaign, Know Before You Go, last year aimed at workers in EU accession states. It advises people before they travel to Ireland to be aware of the challenges they will have to deal with following disturbing stories about non-nationals who came to Ireland expecting to be employed but who had difficulty sourcing employment when they arrived. In the majority of instances, a subcontractor was involved but the subcontractor was from the same country as the workers and they were paid less than the minimum wage.</P>

Recently, a small business in Lisdoonvarna was prosecuted but multinationals can do as they please and get away it. Will Gama officials or representatives of the company in Moneypoint be taken to court?</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 31 inspectors are in place and arrangements are made to enable them to visit workplaces throughout the State. With regard to their mandate, a number of difficulties have arisen about what must be provided in wage slips. These are some of the issues that must be addressed under the new mandate that will, undoubtedly, be provided for the labour inspectorate.</P>
        <P>With regard to Gama, the matter has been in the courts on at least two occasions. We await a Supreme Court determination on the most recent High Court determination. The number of prosecutions was approximately 25 last year. The initial mandate of the inspectorate is to seek redress for workers who have lost out because of exploitation by their employers. I understand this has been done successfully for the majority of the workers in the case of Gama. Subsequently the inspectors examine whether it is possible to pursue a case in the courts, something they have done successfully on many occasions.</P>
        <P>One of the recommendations of the report on the mandate of the inspectorate is that it would be more appropriate if the cases were taken to one of the employment rights bodies &mdash; the Labour Court or the Employment Appeals Tribunal &mdash; rather than the civil courts, because of the standard of proof, the speciality involved and the level of documentation required in them. This is something that will be examined in the context of the new mandate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Do the inspectors have the power to inspect the wage slips? What provision will be put in place to stop victimisation of workers who come forward to complain and will the Department protect them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The labour inspectors have the power to examine wage slips. One of the difficulties is that the level of information required to be provided on the wage slips is not of a standard that is useful in terms of pursuing a successful prosecution or of establishing whether the appropriate rates for the employment have been paid. There is a requirement to retain records and wage slips but, unfortunately, their format has not been sufficiently outlined in the regulation or the legislation.</P>
        <P>Deputy James Breen raised the important issue of victimisation. Recent legislation introduced in this area included a section to ensure that people who bring information to the attention of the labour inspectorate or anybody in authority are protected. In the event we introduce additional legislation, I will try to ensure it contains that provision.</P>

        <Quest> in view of recent revelations of abuse by subcontractors, the measures he is taking to ensure that the official net payment documented by employers corresponds to the actual payment received by employees; and his views on whether the existing system of documentation is sufficiently detailed and transparent to act as both a deterrent to and indication of abuse.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with its remit under employment rights legislation the labour inspectorate is empowered to examine particular employer records. In this connection, inspectors can examine copies of statements of pay, payslips, and reconcile these with the payroll records. In addition, inspectors can examine the working time records an employer is obliged to maintain. The preparation and production of false records is an offence.</P>
        <P>In this connection, however, the Deputy is advised that the Department in its discussion document, Report on the Mandate and Resourcing of the Labour Inspectorate, recommended a streamlining of the record keeping requirements to tie in with the statements of pay. In addition, the report called for a significant revamping of the statement of pay so that there will be absolute transparency in the rate of pay per hour, the hours worked, the relevant calculation in respect of all deductions made and the eventual remuneration paid. The report of the employment rights compliance group, which informs the current partnership talks, indicated that there was a con<Col N="2114"/>sensus between the social partners on progressing this proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The nub of the problem is that a payslip can say one thing while the reality may be different. What, specifically, will the Minister of State do to amend this? Is there a legal difficulty in terms of access to bank account details which are the only real way to verify the actual payment made? How does the Minister of State intend to overcome the difficulty created where an employer makes deductions for accommodation or other expenses related to the work?</P>
        <P>It is clear we all agree there is a problem because the employment rights group and the partnership process are focusing attention on this issue. What specific solutions has the Minister of State for the problem? If we take the example of the situation at Moneypoint, the ESB was unable to ascertain what was going on, despite the fact it had audits. It was not the arrival of the labour inspectorate that started the review process. The company and the main contractor had attempted to ascertain what was going on but were unable to do so because of the difficulty in getting accurate information.</P>
        <P>This is a central issue for the partnership talks and in ensuring that migration and the arrival of accession workers here do not distort the labour market in an unfair way. What can the Minister of State do to ensure we have the powers to know who is paid what and whether fair deductions take place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is right that this is an important issue that must be addressed urgently. The issue features strongly in the current partnership negotiations and in the two reviews already completed by the Department. The Payment of Wages Act 1991 states that an employer shall give or cause to be given to an employee a statement in writing specifying clearly the gross amount of the wages payable to the employee and the nature and amount of any deduction therefrom. It further states that the employer shall take such reasonable steps as are necessary to ensure that both the matter to which the statement relates and the statement are treated confidentially by the employer and his agents and by any other employees. This is fine as far as it goes, but clearly one would need important additional information such as the number of hours worked and the rate per hour if one were to pursue cases successfully.</P>
        <P>To be fair, in the case of Moneypoint the auditors for the ESB discovered the underpayments and raised the matter with the ESB which then pursued the issue. First it informed the relevant union, the TEEU, and had a memorandum of agreement with the subcontractor to deal with and resolve the matter. This process was at an advanced stage before the matter came to the notice of the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate. I would prefer the issue had been brought to the notice <Col N="2115"/>of the inspectorate earlier. It might well have happened that it did not come to the inspectorate&rsquo;s notice at all, which would have been unhelpful.</P>
        <P>Arising from the points made by Deputy Eamon Ryan, there are issues with regard to how other State agencies interact with the labour inspectorate and the Department. For example, information available to the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social and Family Affairs could be of major importance in terms of determining how to proceed with particular cases. The new legislation will include provision for an interchange of information among these agencies.</P>
        <P>The Deputy raised the matter of deductions. Specified deductions are provided for under the legislation. Some employers say that in view of the high cost of accommodation, the deductions are particularly low. Be that as it may, there are standard maximum deductions in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister mentioned new legislation. Does that refer to amendments to the 1991 Act? How or when does the Minister of State intend introducing legislation? Are there constitutional or other legal difficulties around the area of exchange of information between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department or labour inspectorate in forming an accurate assessment of real pay? Is that a simple process or does it introduce further difficulties?</P>
        <P>The case involving Moneypoint concerns one of the largest contracts in the country. However, even in the smallest contract of employment it is very difficult to ascertain the real rate of pay unless we have access to bank account details. Is there not a concern, especially with our permit system, that the power of the employer to hold the permit in small localised employment situations is excessive? This power would probably dissuade an employee from disclosing that net pay was much lower than the declared pay on the wage slip. Do we not need to look wider and further in terms of the implications of the recent discovery of these false pay rates? Should we not amend our migration and permit system to ensure we have full transparency and do not allow situations evolve where a gross pay rate is a multiple of the real pay rate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take the last point first. When the new legislation is passed the permit will be held by the employee, but it will be held on foot of an offer of a particular job. This will ensure a more level playing field for the employee. In the majority of cases, except for Gama, the employees involved in cases did not need work permits because they are EEA nationals.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, the more successful we are in finding illegalities and cases where workers are being mistreated, the better placed we will be to deal with the issue. Rogue employers are gradually <Col N="2116"/>coming to the view that, through one means or another they will be found out and not just accidentally by the labour inspectorate, regardless of its staff numbers. The fact that so many people are now attuned to this happening will ensure that gradually more and more unscrupulous employers are found out.</P>
        <P>I am not in a position to give a judgment on the constitutional issues. There could well be a problem with regard to the examination of bank accounts, for example. Traditionally, there was a view regarding constitutional bars that was considerably less liberal than the current view. I am not aware that any of the recommendations in the report on the mandate and resources of the inspectorate would require action that would be likely to run foul of constitutional issues. If I become aware that this is the case, I will revert to the Deputy.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The challenge in achieving work-life balance in individual enterprises is to establish policies that reflect the reality of the workplace and meet the many diverse needs of employees. To this end, the development of work-life balance policies in Ireland is addressed on two fronts, first, through appropriate legislative measures which provide for statutory entitlements such as maternity leave, adoptive leave, carer&rsquo;s leave and parental leave as well as maximum working hours, rest periods, annual leave and public holiday entitlements and, second, through the voluntary approach which is supported by the work of the national framework committee for work-life balance policies.</P>
        <P>The committee, which was established under the social partnership process and chaired by my Department, is charged with supporting and facilitating the development of family-friendly policies at the level of the enterprise through the development of a package of practical measures. One of the tasks of the committee is to examine how best to improve access to family-friendly working arrangements to realise the potential benefits that these arrangements would offer <Col N="2117"/>from an equality and competitiveness perspective.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to the two-pronged approach to achieving the goal of making workplaces more family friendly, namely, the provision of statutory entitlements through legislative measures and the voluntary approach at the level of the enterprise, which is encouraged at national level by the national framework committee for work-life balance policies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply but while a mission statement on work-life balance is fine, the question refers to what the Department intends to do to achieve it. We have just had a discussion on unscrupulous employers. The country is not full of unscrupulous employers. They are very few in number, thankfully, but they exist. People are working for such employers on a permanent or contract basis and we must be serious about legislating to ensure that their families can co-exist with a working life.</P>

Apart from the one day of advertising undertaken annually on work-life balance, what does the Minister of State intend to do to ensure that such a balance is achieved? He has referred to legislation, most of which has a very small impact on people&rsquo;s lives over a very short period of time in the life of a child. What does the Minister of State intend to do with regard to inflexible employers?</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree strongly with Deputy Lynch with regard to the legislation that is already in place. Legislation governing maternity leave, adoptive leave and other issues has had a considerable impact.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation has had a considerable impact. We will best address this issue by having a sensible mix of legislative provisions and voluntary partnership mechanisms. Traditionally we have looked to the partnership process at an <Col N="2118"/>exclusively national level and have not developed it at enterprise level to the extent that we might. As I mentioned, the group has made 42 recommendations. I am chairman of the high level group and am pleased with the level of co-operation from the employer and trade union representatives, as well as the various Departments that have a central involvement. People are clearly intent on ensuring that we deliver on as many as possible of the 42 recommendations, some of which are very far-reaching and go beyond even what Deputy Lynch might seek.</P>
        <P>Senator White has legislation in the wings which is similar to legislation in the United Kingdom, which I am sure will be considered at some stage. This issue is central to the current social partnership negotiations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, when the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights was dealing with the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill, the Minister said that the updating of that legislation would depend on the outcome of the centralised bargaining process currently under way. Given that the aforementioned legislation came about as a result of the last centralised pay agreement four years ago, does the Minister of State envisage updating the legislation next year or in four years&rsquo; time? This is particularly relevant considering we are talking about 14 weeks, while other countries provide for up to three years parental leave. What is the Minister of State&rsquo;s estimate on the timeframe in respect of ensuring that the critical years of a child&rsquo;s life are spent with parents who are not as harassed as many are currently?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>No more than other Deputies, I am very poorly qualified to lecture anybody on family-friendly policies or family-friendly engagement in the workplace. However, we have made tremendous progress. While the legislative measures are enormously important, ultimately they can only work if we have, at enterprise level, a culture of ensuring that provision is made for people to carry on their family lives. Traditionally, the view was that needs relating to caring commitments were paramount but many people have now come to realise that people in the workplace have other interests they wish to pursue, alongside their working lives, including study, leisure and so forth. A balance is intrinsically important from the perspective of the individual employee. Many employers have realised that when they introduce policies which facilitate employees who have caring responsibilities or other interests, everybody benefits, including the employers, through increased productivity on the part of the employee.</P>

Of course, many of these jobs related to projects announced prior to the period in question or not announced at all. It is important to point out that there is always a time lag, often stretching over a number of years, between the announcement of new jobs and their creation. That time is required for such activities as locating and acquiring a suitable site for the company&rsquo;s operations, obtaining planning permission, constructing a facility, installing machinery and recruiting and training staff.</P>
        <P>Of the estimated 80,000 created during the period in question, 14,381 related to projects announced during the period. A total of 635 were announced in 2000, 1,590 in 2001, 1,667 in 2002, 3,069 in 2003, 3,358 in 2004 and 4,062 in 2005. Given the time lags to which I have just referred, the process of creating the jobs announced will continue for some years to come.</P>

	<P>I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, got back in the action as his colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, was getting overburdened.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister of State on the timelag between when new jobs are announced and when they are created. Does he have a figure to indicate in accumulative terms the total number of announcements made and the total number created to date? Has he an indication as to the regional dimension of the figures?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2000, 14,000 extra jobs were created. In 2001 and 2002, there was a fall-off of approximately 4,600. In 2003, the reduction stood at 3,630. In 2004 there was an increase of 197 and of approximately 4,300 in 2005. Multinational companies made regional locations their preference. Out of the total of 71 investments, 46 were located outside of Dublin. Some 50 research and development investment projects were supported by IDA Ireland, involving a total investment in excess of &euro;260 million, a record in number and <Col N="2120"/>value and an 85% increase in value from 2004. Last year was the best since 2000 in terms of the range of quality of new investment and in the development of research capability and capacity. Approximately 40% of all new jobs in IDA Ireland backed projects earn in excess of &euro;37,000 per annum.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of reports of schemes operating in the Cork area whereby people are apparently prepared to hand over amounts of money in the expectation of receiving multiples of that amount in return. The Pyramid Selling Act 1980 prohibits people from inducing other people to participate in pyramid schemes. As the Act only applies to goods and services, there is a legal doubt as to whether the type of transaction in question is covered by the Act.</P>
        <P>The Garda Sioch&aacute;na, the enforcing authority for the Act, is investigating some schemes in the Cork area under the Pyramid Selling Act 1980. I do not want, therefore, to interfere with their investigations. Ultimately it is for the courts to determine whether legislation applies in any particular case.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has instructed departmental officials to contact the Garda Deputy Commissioner responsible for the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation seeking the views of the Garda Sioch&aacute;na on any difficulties being experienced under current legislation. The official will also ask whether the Garda Sioch&aacute;na has any suggestions as to how the legislation might be improved, based on its experience dealing with the sort of practices employed by the people who devise and promote such schemes.</P>
        <P>In the meanwhile work continues in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the transposition of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005/29/EC. The directive aims to protect the consumer by, <i>inter alia</i>, banning certain practices. One practice is described as:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">. . .establishing, operating or promoting a pyramid promotional scheme where a consumer gives consideration for the opportunity to receive compensation that is derived primarily <Col N="2121"/>from the introduction of other consumers into the scheme rather than from the sale or consumption of products.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Although the directive is due to be transposed by June 2007, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment hopes to have the legislation ready this year.</P>
        <P>People should be vigilant in how they use their money. People should reflect on whether it is realistic to expect other people to give them large sums of money for nothing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Advising people to be cautious on how they use their money when legalisation preventing such pyramid schemes is not in place is like telling people to be careful when they are crossing the road but not providing any pedestrian crossings. The Minister must realise the existing legislation for pyramid schemes is inadequate and lacks the power of prosecution. That the Minister will have legislation in place this year does not fill me with any great confidence, considering his record over several years.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to insert into the pyramid selling legislation the type of necessary safeguards to outlaw the practices in question. If the Garda could have prosecuted at this stage, it would have. How long will the Minister wait for the Garda Deputy Commissioner&rsquo;s views on the scheme in question? How long does the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment intend to dally on the issue? It did not have to wait for a pyramid scheme of this nature to reform the legislation. Calls for the legislation to be updated have been made for some time, yet they were ignored. I am sure the Minister hopes the matter will go away again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has acknowledged the necessity for new legislation in the area. The directive is to be introduced in 2007, but the Minister is intent on having legislation in place prior to that date. Media reports of gifting schemes emerged in January 2006. We are aware of a particular scheme taking place in the west Cork region which has expanded to the Cork North Central constituency. The Garda initiated an investigation under the Pyramid Selling Act 1980. According to the Office of the Attorney General, however, a problem exists in obtaining proof to sustain prosecutions when there is no written evidence. We recognise legislation must be introduced to control this.</P>

        <QRef>[11228/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The labour inspectorate contacted the principal parties in the ESB dispute on Tuesday, 13 March 2006 and subsequently met senior representatives of the ESB and its agents. These contacts have been ongoing since and considerable progress has been made.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of employment rights is often characterised as a discrete function undertaken solely by the labour inspectorate. There is an extensive corpus of legislation providing for a range of obligations and entitlements for both employers and employees. The employment rights arena is populated by various bodies, for example, the Labour Court. As always, there is scope for improvement but the solution is not to just simply appoint additional labour inspectors.</P>
        <P>The challenge in a rapidly growing economy is to ensure adequate, timely and effective enforcement of compliance with statutory and other provisions. This was recognised in Sustaining Progress. Arising from commitments then, the Government has completed reviews of the employment rights bodies, the mandate and resourcing of the labour inspectorate, the joint labour committee system. Each of these reviews has been completed and follow-on work is now in train.</P>
        <P>The broad question of sustaining employment standards and initiatives to ensure employment rights compliance is being addressed as a priority in the current round of national partnership talks. Individuals may also take their cases before a commissioner in the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
        <P>There is a commitment to a campaign of dissemination on obligations and entitlements arising under employment rights legislation. The campaign will be targeted at both employers and employees and will focus on particular audiences such as those engaged in sectors now generally populated by non-Irish workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State considering introducing legislation to hold the first contractor responsible for ensuring all labour legislation is adhered to? With 31 inspectors to a workforce of 2.07 million people, each inspector is responsible for 66,775 workers. It is a vast number and those inspectors now have an additional legislative burden. Does the Minister of State consider that the additional legislative burden the inspectorate has to handle has been matched by additional numbers of inspectors? It certainly does not appear to have been.</P>
        <P>Media reports in the past week have suggested the Minister of State may be on the verge of making proposals concerning the labour inspectorate. Could he tell the House what plans he has in this regard?</P>
        <P>In early 2005, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment circulated to the social <Col N="2123"/>partners a report entitled Mandate and Resourcing of the Labour Inspectorate. Will the Minister of State tell us what the shortcomings were in the current set up, and whether they were identified in that report?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct in stating that it can be extraordinarily difficult to establish who exactly is the employer of a particular employee. For example, frequently on building sites not only is there a principal contractor &mdash; this has arisen in the case of Moneypoint as well &mdash; but also there is a subcontractor under which there might be other subcontractors. Therefore, there is a particular difficulty in identifying exactly who is the employer. That is one of the issues currently being examined with a view to ensuring the inspector will have the right to pinpoint exactly who is responsible for a particular employee&rsquo;s pay and conditions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that a &ldquo;No&rdquo;? Does that mean the Minister of State is not considering legislation at present?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>In so far as it can be addressed, that will form a central part of the legislation, which will arise from the current round of social partnership negotiations. The number of inspectors has nearly doubled in the 18 months during which I have been in the Department. That is not to say, however, that the number was in any way near to being adequate previously. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The numbers have halved, not doubled.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Okay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>They rose from ten to 14 and from 17 to the current level of 31. Depending on which dates one takes, the number has more than doubled. In view of the history of numbers and dates quoted in the Chamber in recent days, however, it might be better for us to stay away from that territory.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I think so, too. It helps to keep one&rsquo;s mouth shut.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The review of the mandate and resources issue will inform whatever legislation arises in this area. I cannot say with particular certainty to the Deputy or to the House exactly what will be in the legislation. However, every attempt will certainly be made to ensure all the shortcomings that have been pinpointed, both in terms of mandate and resources, will be addressed in new legislation or amending legislation, if appropriate.</P><Col N="2124"/>
        <P>There is another idea floating about, to which I think Deputy Morgan is referring, that either a new agency should be formed to take over the labour inspectorate or the inspectorate should be placed with one of the existing agencies. Deputy Howlin and others have expressed strong views that the Health and Safety Authority might be the appropriate agency with which to place that inspectorate. No decisions have been made in that regard but I assure the House the matter is being approached with an open mind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the Minister of State is telling us the notion of making the inspectorate a statutory agency is not immediately on the cards. Can he address the concern many of us have that the issue of legislation concerning the inspectorate is not being properly addressed currently because it is being used as a bargaining chip in the social partnership talks? As we all know, those talks could drag on for a considerable time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly hope the talks will not drag on too long but it is inevitable that these issues would be central to the current round of negotiations. Even if the events in Gama Construction and elsewhere had not arisen, the reality is that these reports were commissioned from the previous round of partnership talks with a view to being considered in the current round. That was inevitably going to be the case. Obviously, from the Government&rsquo;s viewpoint, and that of the Oireachtas, it is desirable to have some level of agreement among the social partners on how we proceed. I believe we will have a large measure of agreement. We certainly have had, heretofore, concerning the reports.</P>
        <P>While there is resistance in some areas to some of the changes proposed in the employment rights bodies, ultimately we will come to the view that what operates best in dealing with our current requirements is what we must do. I am confident we will have an agreement arising from social partnership on how we should proceed and that we will be able to do so.</P>

        <P>The primary function of the labour inspectorate is to seek compliance and rectification of any breaches identified, including payment of any arrears due to employees. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and seek redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Successful prosecution can be dependent on adequate support from witnesses.</P>
        <P>Since November 2005, the number of labour inspectors assigned and serving has been increased to 31 officers. As part of the programme of work that is being implemented to train the new inspectors, their schedule includes a focus on national minimum wage compliance, which commenced in February 2006.</P>
        <P>In addition to the new inspectors, a number of experienced officers are participating in this exercise to provide support and guidance as well as undertaking inspections themselves. It is expected the additional resources and the focused campaign will substantially increase the number of inspections and visits carried out in 2006.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has provided the same information we received in the last written answer concerning the amount of prosecutions that were initiated. How many of them were successful and how many have been completed? Does the Minister of State have those figures?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will get them for the Deputy. I do not have them at the moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I think those statistics are important because initiating a prosecution and bringing it to a conclusion are two entirely different things.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is aware of the Labour Party&rsquo;s position on the Health and Safety Authority and he has heard it often enough from Deputy Howlin. Most of us were under the impression that, in this instance, the inspectors unearthed wrongdoing by employers or saw to it that they were compliant. It would appear, however, that the inspectors are now being contacted by employees on a small scale and are then bringing prosecutions. Surely that should be the central job of the various organisations dealing with people who claim to be badly treated at work, rather than being a function of the labour inspectorate. It is outrageous to have the inspectorate tied up at that level. Are there plans to <Col N="2126"/>organise the inspectorate in such as way that its sole function would be to inspect places of employment? Construction sites are not the only locations where workers&rsquo; rights are abused, other areas are also involved. How many initiated prosecutions were concluded?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, I will obtain the exact numbers of successful and completed prosecutions for Deputy Lynch. In fact, that was one of the factors which influenced the report on mandate and resources because successful prosecutions are extraordinarily difficult to achieve due to the level of proof needed and the lack of clarity surrounding the quality of payslips required. We wish to encourage people to raise questions with the labour inspectors. Obviously, we would like them to raise questions that are relevant to the inspectors and sometimes they are not quite sure that is the case. There is a substantial requirement on the burden of proof which most frequently includes a requirement that people are prepared to give evidence. The review recommends a change in that regard to the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Labour Court in dealing with issues of this nature. That has considerable merit and may well happen.</P>
        <P>As regards the HSA proposal, there are 100 inspectors with that authority but many of them are specialist inspectors. There seem to be considerable advantages in having people who are in any event visiting a premises check out the additional issues of, for example, payslips and pay and conditions. If we could manage to impart to employees the information on their rights, they would be in a position to draw the matter to the attention of the inspectorate and fewer visits would be required. Undoubtedly, while there would be many more prosecutions in the short term, in the medium and long term people would comply on a much wider scale than is the case.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 13 together.</P>
        <P>A review group on public safety was established in November 1999. The group was chaired by Dr. Daniel O&rsquo;Hare and was widely representative of Departments and various agencies and bodies. Its report, entitled A Review of Public <Col N="2127"/>Safety in Ireland, was published just over a year later.</P>
        <P>The key recommendation of the group was that an office of public safety regulation should be considered, but there was not full agreement within the group on this key point. The group envisaged that such a public safety office would not itself be responsible for public safety but would have some form of overseeing or co-ordination role of all the agencies and bodies which have a function in public safety matters. Some members of the group expressed concerns about the duplication of existing services and the resulting unnecessary burden on public finances. Even within the group as a whole there appears to have been some doubts as to the long-term need for a new public safety office, which is shown in its proposal that the functioning, appropriateness and continuing need for the office should be reviewed within a five-year period.</P>
        <P>It is evident that the review group&rsquo;s recommendation is inconclusive and a clear-cut case for the establishment of a new agency has not been made. Another State agency whose function is merely to oversee other agencies on public safety matters is not the right way forward.</P>
        <P>The Government task force on emergency planning is chaired by the Minister for Defence and comprises other Ministers, senior officials of Departments and public authorities which make a key contribution to the emergency planning process. This is the top level structure giving policy and direction and which co-ordinates and oversees the emergency planning activities of all Departments and public authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister of State that a new agency is not necessary. However, somebody must take responsibility. Currently, if a serious accident occurs in a public place, nobody can investigate it. A number of cases have come to the attention of the Health and Safety Authority that would originally have been thought not to be within its remit, including road accidents on stretches of road where workmen were conducting road works and cases of MRSA in hospitals. Many people are concerned about who is in charge in terms of investigating these matters. Will the Minister of State at the very least agree that the Health and Safety Authority should be charged with responsibility? An agency of the State should be put in charge of this matter rather than creating a new one. Let us define what is meant by workplace to give certainty in this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Hogan is correct that the background to the establishment of the review group was the fact that many cases referred to the Health and Safety Authority did not ordinarily come within its remit. In an ideal world there would be a clear delineation between the <Col N="2128"/>various agencies. There normally is such delineation, such as between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health and Safety Authority on road traffic issues, although grey areas occurred recently which were eventually sorted out.</P>
        <P>The difficulty in the proposal for an over-arching body is that it would have no real responsibility itself and no capacity to examine issues. It would merely oversee the role of other bodies. It does not seem to be sensible to establish an agency with that remit. I take the point made by Deputy Hogan that if the system could be improved in terms of clarity on the responsibility of various agencies, it would be helpful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>With all due respect to the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks, the system certainly must be improved given that no agency takes responsibility for any accident in a public place. We have nothing so it must be improved. Some existing agency must take responsibility. I do not advocate a new agency. The Minister of State will remember the bus crash on the quays in Dublin where people were seriously injured. Nobody was in charge or responsible. In spite of that accident and a report in November 1999, the Government has done nothing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>As a general principle, road traffic issues are a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I understand that was the case in that instance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Some closure may have been achieved. It is difficult to delineate responsibility in some cases where accidents occur on what is <i>de facto</i> a workplace such as county council roadworks. The two most recent cases brought some clarity and a memorandum of understanding between the Health and Safety Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is visited in these situations. That is probably the situation with most clarity. In other cases it may not be at all clear who is responsible. As I stated in the initial answer, the Government task force on emergency planning is under the aegis of the Minister for Defence and deals with major incidents of that nature.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State give an undertaking to the House that when accidents take place in public areas, an agency will take responsibility for investigating them and dealing with these matters? Will he undertake that he will provide certainty on these matters in light of the concern about a major accident that may take place in a public place in future? We have a number of reports and examples of a shortage of delineation of responsibility. Will the Minister of State give an undertaking that he will return to the House with proposals in the not too distant future to ensure that where an accident or serious incident occurs in a public place, we will have an <Col N="2129"/>agency responsible to take action where appropriate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The recommendations of the review group are anything but conclusive. They are quite inconclusive. At this stage, the Government task force on emergency planning is the group which deals with situations of this nature. It is chaired by the Minister for Defence and perhaps a question to him might be more appropriate in terms of establishing the remit and role of that group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State might speak to him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give the undertaking across the range of issues which Deputy Hogan mentioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State ask the Minister for Defence?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will mention it to the Minister for Defence. The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 considerably improved the situation, which we will see better soon when the general application and construction regulations are in place.</P>

	<P>The labour inspectorate of the Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to other workers.</P>
        <P>The labour inspectorate contacted the principal parties in this issue on Tuesday, March 13 and subsequently met senior representatives of the ESB and their agents and these contacts have been ongoing since. In the meantime, inspectors have commenced inquiries with the contractor concerned in this case and have visited both the head office and the site in Moneypoint.

Some of the most common foreign languages involved in this sector are Czech, Polish and Latvian. I do not argue that they should speak these languages.

To the best of my knowledge the Department&rsquo;s website was corrected and is back up and running since 21 March. I understand the correction was made in one place and it was assumed that the package automatically changed it everywhere else. That did not turn out to be the case and making the change became a difficult process. Some places on the website showed &euro;7.65 while others showed the old rate of &euro;7.</P>

	<P>I am informed that the report, entitled Managing Migration in Ireland: A Social and Economic Analysis, commissioned by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and undertaken by the International Organisation for Migration has not yet been finalised. I understand that NESC is considering a draft of the report and that it will formulate its comments on it over the next few months. It would not be appropriate for me to make any detailed comments on the possible content of the report or on the NESC view of it.</P>
        <P>However, I look forward to the publication of the report and hearing NESC&rsquo;s views on it. I expect that this work will be a useful contribution to examining all of the social and economic effects of migration into Ireland and how best to deal with them in a fully integrated manner. This Department already works closely with the other <Col N="2131"/>Departments and State agencies in this field, but any recommendations in this regard will be carefully considered.</P>
        <P>As regards the general issue of the potential for immigration to generate adverse labour market impacts in a less favourable economic environment, no such less favourable economic environment is in prospect. We have strong economic and employment growth and most of our problems are those of success. Recent labour market data published by the Central Statistics Office do not suggest there has been any significant adverse labour market impact due to migration into Ireland. In the context of the Employment Permits Bill 2005 the Minister announced new arrangements actively to manage economic migration from outside the European Economic Area. This active management includes giving priority to migrants in sectors where there are strategic skills shortages and only issuing work permits for other occupations on a restricted basis. For example, he has indicated that as part of the new arrangements, work permit applications would require not only advertising with F&Aacute;S, but also in the national newspapers.</P>
        <P>This Government pays particular attention to ensuring that the employment rights of all workers, both Irish and foreign are protected. In the past 18 months the number of labour inspectors has almost doubled and the Department is engaged with the social partners on how compliance and enforcement of employment rights can be enhanced into the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>This report describes how we treat people who come here. The investigation does not necessarily stop when dealing with employment and employment rights. If we agree that we need 40,000 people a year over the next few years and that the economy will be as good as it has been for the past six years, the Minister of State should be able to tell those who come to service our economy that they can become citizens after a certain length of time and that their families may join them.</P>
        <P>People are being denied these rights and those on short-term work permits will not stay, although we need them. We should treat them as if we hope they will stay here in the long term. Does the Minister of State intend doing anything about this problem?</P>

	<P>Issues of citizenship and family reunification are, in the first instance, matters for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

These issues will be examined in this report <Col N="2132"/>which, among others, will reform public policy in this area.

	<P Just="Left">I welcome to the House the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan. I would have liked to see the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children here because this is such a serious issue.</P>
        <P>Next month, I will have been three years protesting outside the accident and emergency unit at the Mater Hospital. I have been there every Saturday between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. I did not do that for the exercise but because three years ago next month a lady aged 89 years entered the accident and emergency unit in the Mater Hospital. She had a slight heart attack on a Monday and <Col N="2133"/>the following Thursday a member of her family contacted me asking if it was possible to get a bed for her because she would have her 90th birthday on the following Saturday, and wanted to be in a bed to receive her grandchildren. She did not want to be sitting on a chair or on a trolley in the accident and emergency unit.</P>
        <P>I contacted the bed management section in the hospital which said it would do its best, it could not do anything that day but would get a bed on the Friday. I checked on the Friday and it had given the lady a bed. I visited her on the Thursday night. She was a fabulous, sprightly little old lady, full of life. I telephoned the hospital on the following Monday and the management told me the lady was fine, had been treated and had gone home. A week later a member of the family telephoned me to say that in fact the lady had never gone home but had died that day in the hospital.</P>
        <P>It was atrocious that a lady of that age should be kept on a trolley for virtually a week, and that I should have been told a lie about what had happened. I subsequently raised this matter with the hospital management which said it would look into it but I never received a satisfactory response. I was determined that, arising out of that incident, I would leave no stone unturned until the waiting lists in the Mater Hospital had been eliminated.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately it has not been eliminated although three years have passed, and for half of that time there has been a new Minister for Health and Children, who, on taking office in September 2004 said her priority was to sort out the problems in accident and emergency units and that she and the Government in which she served would be judged on her success in this matter. In January 2005 she said that people judge our health service by their experience of accident and emergency units. The T&aacute;naiste went on to provide her ten-point plan to deal with it. That plan was supposed to bear fruit within six months. Much more than 18 months have now gone by and the situation is worse than it was when the T&aacute;naiste took up office. Last week we saw a record 455 people on chairs and trolleys in accident and emergency units. The stage has now been reached whereby there is no room for the normal chair, an armchair. We have had the trolleys, the armchairs, soft plastic chairs and now hard chairs because there is no room for the normal chairs. It is scandalous.</P>
        <P>A Minister arrived to deal with the matter and the situation has worsened rather than improved. I do not know where we can go from here unless we can deal with the situation of an 89 year old lady who has never cost the State a penny, and there are many similar people now in need of State assistance. They are in their hour of need and are let down by the State and the services. We must deal with that and I hope the Minister of State has some answers for me.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding to this matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. Deputy Costello is aware, as he indicated in his contribution, that there have been particular pressures on accident and emergency services in recent weeks. A number of factors have contributed to these pressures, including increases in the number of attendances and the rate of admission at accident and emergency departments, an increased incidence of influenza and the winter vomiting virus and an increase in the number of patients awaiting discharge from acute hospitals. The winter vomiting virus has had the added complication of closing acute beds to new admissions and slowing the discharge of patients to a number of sub-acute facilities.</P>
        <P>Particular difficulties were experienced over the recent bank holiday weekend when 27 patients were in the accident and emergency department of the Mater Hospital awaiting admission. Latest available figures for the hospital show that 14 patients were awaiting admission at 2 p.m. yesterday.</P>
        <P>Prior to the more recent difficulties experienced in accident and emergency, the Mater Hospital had shown a reduction of over 20% in the numbers waiting in accident and emergency at 2 p.m. when comparing January 2005 and 2006 figures. This reduction in numbers waiting in the Mater Hospital accident and emergency department was achieved through the opening of the 33-bedded transit ward in December 2005 and the sustained focus on tackling delayed discharges. A total of 45 patients were discharged under this initiative in late 2005, 92 patients benefited in 2005 under home care packages and a further 153 patients were discharged to intermediate care.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive and the Mater Hospital are working closely together to alleviate further pressures in the accident and emergency department and in this regard, the HSE has announced an initiative to contract 250 long-stay beds in the private sector to facilitate discharges from the acute hospitals. This initiative is to free up capacity in acute hospitals, including the Mater Hospital. It is expected that patients will begin to move from acute hospitals in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the broader context of accident and emergency services, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Deputies on all sides of the House agree it is unacceptable that elderly people in particular should have to wait for long periods at accident and emergency units or sleep overnight on trolleys rather than in beds. Every available action that can be taken will be taken to improve patients&rsquo; experience of care. These include a continuation of the steps in the ten-point plan. For example, the HSE will continue to provide many more long-term beds, step-down places and home care packages. These actions are recognised as <Col N="2135"/>essential by all concerned. In particular, the HSE&rsquo;s management actions are focused on attendances and admissions, delayed discharges and improving efficiency and throughput.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In terms of implementation, the following approach is being taken: tackling the issue hospital by hospital, developing hospital-specific time-based targets for accident and emergency and delayed discharges, development of financial incentives linked to performance in these areas and development of targeted initiatives aimed at delivering immediate and sustained impact in the areas of attendances, delayed discharges and efficiency. A dedicated team has been established by the HSE to drive the implementation of this framework.</P>
        <P>In terms of immediate action it is critical that all hospitals take appropriate steps to ensure that patient privacy, dignity and comfort is preserved. In this context, funding is being made available within the capital programme to develop admissions lounges or transit units to ensure that patients are treated in an acceptable environment. Discussions are already under way with hospitals in this regard and detailed proposals will be agreed within the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>The HSE has been asked to undertake a bed capacity review in light of changing demographics and proposals for the development of community services. This work will be conducted as a matter of priority and reported on at the earliest possible time. The HSE will undertake, as a matter of priority, an assessment of the future requirements for long-term care residential capacity.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State with special responsibility for children for attending to respond to this debate. While I have the utmost respect for him, I am very disappointed that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, is not in the House to respond to this issue of major concern in Waterford city.</P>
        <P>De La Salle Stephen&rsquo;s Street national school is an excellent school that has provided education in inner city Waterford over many years. It is located in a RAPID area. The removal of its disadvantaged status and its concessionary post would be an act of educational vandalism and an attack on the futures of the boys attending the school. Any Minister who would wilfully dramatically worsen the educational provision in such a school must consider his or her position. I sincerely hope the Minister will immediately resolve this situation and allow a highly effective principal and staff continue with their most important work unhindered by a Department which should be doing everything possible to support and encourage their work.</P>
        <P>The Minister should visit the school and meet the parents and staff to see at first hand the damage done to the morale of the staff and <Col N="2136"/>parents alike. They are proud of their school and its achievements. There is an extended school community which contributes much to the sporting, cultural and social life of Waterford city. To harm seriously the kernel of such an important component of the community life of Waterford would be unforgivable.</P>
        <P>Brother Martin, principal of De La Salle Stephen Street, has stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">We have been told that we have lost our disadvantaged status. This will mean that the school will be crippled. Two teachers will be let go this summer and grants for vital materials and other resources will be withdrawn.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Brother Martin has further stated the school is unlikely to survive the next four to five years without disadvantaged status.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware that in 46% of the households that provide pupils for this school, the main income earner is unemployed and that 45% of parents were early school leavers? Is the Minister aware that in recent years the De La Salle Order has donated &euro;18,500 of its own funds to provide a part-time teacher in mathematics and English four days a week for those pupils who require such provision?</P>
        <P>The school also received funding from the Waterford area partnership which helped provide music lessons for all pupils from first to sixth standard. That such a school could lose the major prop of disadvantaged status beggars belief. Is it the education policy of this Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government to punish those schools which successfully confront the ongoing education problems facing them?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There are specific questions which must be answered to clarify what exactly is happening with the disadvantaged status of De La Salle Stephen&rsquo;s Street national school. What is the present position regarding the designated disadvantaged status awarded to the school under the disadvantaged areas scheme in 1994? Will the Minister of State confirm that the additional permanent concessionary post allocated to the school and to which the first appointment was made in 1995 will continue to exist? Is the Minister&rsquo;s decision regarding disadvantaged status for the school based on a genuine mistake in the course of completing an application form relating to disadvantaged status? Will the Minister of State give a categorical assurance that at least St. Stephen&rsquo;s De La Salle national school will be no worse off in the coming year than in the current year in meeting the many problems the De La Salle order, the principal, staff and parents have been so successful in addressing to date.</P>

The position of the Department of Education and Science in regard to the school support programme and St. Stephen&rsquo;s De La Salle <Col N="2137"/>national school, Waterford, will be outlined in this reply which I make on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin.</P>
        <P>The school support programme under DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, is the new action plan for educational inclusion. It will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. The new action plan is being introduced on a phased basis, starting during the current school year. It will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40 million on full implementation. In addition, supports will continue to be provided for schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.</P>
        <P>The process of identifying primary and second level schools for participation in the new school support programme has been completed. This process was managed by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of the Department of Education and Science and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the inspectorate. In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey of all mainstream primary schools. An excellent response rate of more than 97% was achieved from this survey.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Shea outlined the particular difficulties facing St. Stephen&rsquo;s De La Salle in Waterford. That it was not assessed as qualifying for the programme suggests the standard of teaching and the achievement of students in the school are at a very good level. As a result of the identification process, 840 schools have been invited to participate in the new school support programme. These comprise 640 primary schools &mdash; 320 urban-town and 320 rural &mdash; and 200 second level schools. Letters of invitation were issued to all 840 schools in late February with a request to complete and return an acceptance form by 10 March 2006.</P>
        <P>The school to which the Deputy refers is not among the primary schools selected for participation in this programme. However, this school is among the schools receiving additional resources under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing concentrated disadvantage and will retain these supports for 2006-07. The efficacy of these supports will be kept under review.</P>
        <P>As well as the provision being made under the new school support programme for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will also continue to be provided for other primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed. This support will be based on the results of the new identification process, and the arrangements which will apply in this regard will be notified to schools early in the autumn.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism has been put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the school support programme but regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant <Col N="2138"/>their inclusion in the programme. The mechanism will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The school to which the Deputy refers has requested a review, and a review form issued to the school on 7 March 2006. The closing date for receipt of review applications is Friday, 31 March 2006. The position at St. Stephen&rsquo;s De La Salle national school, Waterford, will be reviewed. I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Shea for his interest in this question and I hope the reply has clarified the position.</P>

The people of Foxfield, St. John&rsquo;s parish, and St. Benedict&rsquo;s parish in Kilbarrack were devastated and distraught, as a sixth year pupil told us in late March 2004, when the Greendale community school's trustees, the Jesuit and Holy Faith orders and the VEC, announced the closure of Greendale community school by June 2007. Disgracefully, there was no consultation process whatsoever with the staff, students and parents, or with representatives of the local Kilbarrack parishes, such as Councillor Anne Carter or me. This was the second body-blow to my constituency in a matter of months since it followed the appalling decision by the Oblate Order to sell the historic Belcamp College in Belcamp parish to a developer for &euro;105 million, thereby depriving a huge area of north Coolock and Ayrfield of its long-standing historic secondary school.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Two years ago the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, said he had no objection to Greendale's closure and when I raised the matter with the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, in February 2005 I received a similarly unhelpful reply. I hope that reply referring to enrolments in the mid-1970s and 1980s will not be recycled here again this evening.</P>
        <P>During the past six months especially, Kilbarrack parents and local residents in the Greendale Road district of Foxfield, St. John&rsquo;s parish, are increasingly anxious as to the future of the impressive Greendale community school campus following the Government sanctioned closure next summer. Because massive high rise and high density developments are being approved across the constituency of Dublin North-East and particularly in the north fringe, local residents are deeply fearful that the site will be sold to developers and turned into a massive apartment and commercial complex. I ask the Minister of State <Col N="2139"/>to address and remove these fears in this short debate this evening.</P>
        <P>My Kilbarrack constituents are rightly adamant that Greendale community school campus must continue as an educational and community resource for the whole of the Kilbarrack, Raheny and mid-Sutton area. Greendale community school was founded in 1975 and had a peak enrolment of 950 students in the early 1980s. An impressive teaching team led by the inspiring principal, Mr. Anton Carroll, including teachers such as the distinguished novelist, Roddy Doyle, the famous playwright, Paul Mercier, the iconic Dublin star, Brian Mullins, and dozens of other wonderful teachers have made an enormous contribution to several generations of Kilbarrack children and their families.</P>
        <P>While second level numbers had fallen to 220 students two years ago with the maturing of the Kilbarrack area, the Greendale campus had more than 1,000 adult students and provided an important second chance gateway to third level through Greendale&rsquo;s key association with Trinity College, Dublin. It is this crucial work for adult and second chance education which local residents believe should be the core role of Greendale community school campus following the closure of the second level school next June.</P>
        <P>The large campus and its fine gym should also be permitted to continue the school&rsquo;s deeply appreciated role as a readily available and pleasant facility for all the community and residents&rsquo; groups, sports and youth bodies of Kilbarrack. Over the years those bodies have included Kilbarrack and District Residents Association and our two great local soccer and Gaelic clubs, Kilbarrack United and Naomh Barr&oacute;g.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, and her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Department to liaise with me and my two D&aacute;il Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues in the constituency, all the local community and sporting bodies, local councillors, the Northside Partnership led by chairperson Padraic White, Dublin City North Central Area Management team led by Mr. Declan Wallace and Ms Elaine Mulvenny and the city and county VECs, Trinity College Dublin, UCD, DCU and all the other educational stakeholders. The objective must be to keep Greendale community school in educational and community use as a continuing focal point for the two parishes of Kilbarrack and the surrounding districts of my constituency.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin. The reply deals with the planned closure of Greendale community school in Kilbarrack.</P><Col N="2140"/>
        <P Just="Left">Greendale community school was built in 1975 to accommodate 800 pupils. The school expanded quickly to exceed its enrolment capacity. An extension to increase the school&rsquo;s capacity to 900 pupil places was provided in the early 1980s. In line with demographic changes in the area, the school has experienced a steady decline in enrolments in recent years. Since 1996-97, enrolment has declined by more than 50%, from 449 students to 215 students in the 2003-04 school year. Current enrolments in primary schools in the area indicate that this decline will continue.</P>
        <P>The school applied to the Department of Education and Science for major capital funding in 1999. A feasibility study commissioned by the Department estimated that an investment of &euro;2.4 million was required to address the remedial works necessary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Greendale community school is located in the Howth Deanery of the Dublin archdiocese. The general decline in enrolments in this area has resulted in spare capacity of an estimated 2,300 places at post-primary level. In the circumstances, the Department did not consider that the level of capital investment required was a viable option. However, grant aid was made available to ensure immediate health and safety issues at the school were addressed.</P>
        <P>Subsequent to that, officials from the Department of Education and Science held meetings with the trustees to discuss the future of the school because there did not appear to be adequate pupil numbers in the locality to enable it to regenerate. The Department was concerned about the ability of the school to offer a broad and balanced curriculum given the relatively small number of pupils enrolled.</P>
        <P>The trustees advised officials in the Department of Education and Science in March 2004 that a decision had been taken to close the school in June 2007 and that there should be no intake of pupils in September 2005. The Department concurred with this decision.</P>
        <P>Ownership of the school property is currently vested in the trustees. This will revert to the Department when the school closes. I assure Deputy Broughan that the Department of Education and Science is open to considering any proposals made to it with regard to the future use of the building. Furthermore, in common with all educational facilities, any need for the retention of the building for alternative educational provision will be explored before any decision is taken on its disposal. I thank the Deputy again for raising the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>This year marks the 25th anniversary of the tragic Stardust disaster and it is perhaps fitting that we have a much-needed debate on reform and improvement of the fire service. On the Stardust issue, I reiterate Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s <Col N="2141"/>absolute support for the campaign of the families of those killed and injured.</P>
        <P>In 2004, Dublin Fire Brigade responded to more than 200 incidents per day on average. That single statistic is a testament to the skill, courage and determination of the men and women of the fire brigade but without substantial changes, a disaster is waiting to happen. Our overstretched fire service is unable to respond adequately. There is an urgent need to focus attention on reform and investment in the fire service. Dublin Fire Brigade delivers a range of services and it is unacceptable that the last fire risk assessment was carried out more than 20 years ago.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to indicate in his response if the Government would be prepared to pursue the issue of putting such an assessment in place with the various local authorities. Blanchardstown fire station, whose area includes Connolly hospital as well as a major chemical storage facility, has just one fire appliance. Fingal has some of the largest chemical sites in the State but to date has no equipment for mass decontamination. In addition, the two high-reach turntables for buildings over three storeys are based in Tara Street and would require a lengthy period of time to reach areas like Fingal or my area in Tallaght, where 12 storey apartments are currently being built.</P>
        <P>There has been a short-sighted approach taken and criminal disregard for the non-involvement of the fire service in planning matters in Dublin. Since it is not represented on many of the major planning forums in the city and county, due consideration is now given to the way good planning can impact on, for example, access to fires and other emergencies and a faster reaction time, in allowing multiple units to congregate at a serious incident and enabling sustainable traffic diversions to be put in place. Dublin Fire Brigade is not represented on the Northern Fringe Forum and the forums overseeing developments in Adamstown, Poolbeg, Rathmichael, Cherrywood and Cherry Orchard.</P>
        <P>In addition to the issue of assessment, I ask the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to take steps to address the lack of representation of the fire brigade as of right on planning forums such as those I mentioned. Concern has also been expressed about the fact that there are no plans to purchase fire tenders with a reach longer than seven storeys, despite the increasing number of taller buildings. The two turntables for three storey and higher buildings are located in Tara Street, which prolongs the response time to some areas. A review of equipment in terms of what is available and needed and where it is deployed is essential.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another indictment of the parties that have been in power relates to the fact that the number of fire brigade ambulances has not increased since 1986. The number of emergency calls received annually has increased from 26,000 to <Col N="2142"/>more than 80,000 yet there are still only 11 ambulances. The fatal accident on Dublin&rsquo;s south quays in 2004 that left five people dead stretched the fire and ambulance units. Eight ambulances were deployed to Wellington Quay, leaving just three for the rest of the county. Two major accidents occurring at the same time, therefore, would cause a major problem and would inevitably lead to injury and possible loss of life. I urge the Government to carry out urgent reform and invest in the State&rsquo;s fire service, which is currently under-resourced and under-structured.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am giving this reply on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche. I thank Deputy Crowe for raising the matter on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>The Minister is anxious to record the commitment of the Government to the fire service and the way that commitment has been backed up by positive action both in terms of change and financial investment. He also wants to express his appreciation for the very significant contribution the fire service has made, and continues to make each day, in safeguarding our communities. I join the Minister in that tribute.</P>
        <P>The environment in which the fire service operates has changed dramatically in recent years. With that in mind, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, appointed consultants Farrell Grant Sparks to carry out a review of the fire service and make recommendations. The outcome of that review was the report, Review of Fire Safety and Fire Services in Ireland. That is the template for the development of the service.</P>
        <P>Many of the recommendations of the Farrell Grant Sparks report have been implemented already. These include, in particular, the enactment of the Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003, which addressed a number of legislative changes called for in the review. In February 2005, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, announced the fire services change programme to implement the key fire services and fire safety recommendations of the report.</P>
        <P>The fire services change programme sets out the strategy for the future development of the fire service and includes measures addressing the development of community fire safety programmes; the development of a risk based approach to the determination of fire cover standards; the introduction of a competency-based approach to recruitment, retention and career progression in the fire service; and the enhancement of health, safety and welfare programmes within the fire service.</P>
        <P>Work on the fire services change programme is being carried out by a project team of dedicated fire service professionals and is progressing satisfactorily. All of the key stakeholder groups in the fire service are participating positively in the <Col N="2143"/>change programme. The Minister is confident this approach can take us forward and achieve real progress in modernising the fire service. The outputs from the change programme will significantly reshape the delivery of fire and rescue services in the years ahead. The Minister has made it clear on many occasions that his priority under the fire services change programme is not to pursue further institutional change at this time but to use the available resources to bring about direct and real improvements in the key fire services and the fire safety area.</P>
        <P>The fire service can never have enough resources but we must achieve a balance. There have been massive improvements affecting all areas of the service &mdash; more investment in infrastructure and equipment, more staff, better training, improved communications and legislation has been stepped up. We have 3,400 persons employed in the fire service. There are more than 1,000 full-time firefighters in our major cities and more than 2,000 retained staff who respond to protect their own communities when needed. We have 170 senior personnel who lead the service, including professional staff members who examine all building plans for fire safety and carry out inspections of premises.</P><Col N="2144"/>
        <P>Our training in the fire service is to international standards. The Fire Services Council assists fire authorities through the provision of training courses and seminars to supplement the training provided by the authorities. The council runs an annual programme of training courses and seminars for senior and junior fire officers and for the instructors who train the firefighters at local level. Since 2001, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has provided more than &euro;2.3 million to the Fire Services Council for this purpose.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In tandem with implementing the fire services change programme, we are continuing to maintain a very high level of capital investment in the fire service. Over the past 25 years, almost &euro;240 million has been provided to local fire authorities under the fire services capital programme for the provision of new and refurbished fire stations and the purchase of fire appliances and other equipment. At this stage, more than two thirds of our fire stations, including almost all of the busiest stations, have been replaced, we have a modem fleet of front-line fire appliances and a modem emergency response communications system and our equipment is world class.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>the steps he intends to take to provide alternative employment for workers at a company (details supplied) in County Cork which is to close; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the implications for the workers in question following the announcement of the closure of this company. The decision to close was made for business reasons and was not a reflection of the performance of the operation in Cork. The Irish operation is relocating to the company&rsquo;s base in Portsmouth, England.</P>
        <P>Initially, the role of F&Aacute;S, the State training agency, will be particularly important in assisting the workers. The agency is providing advice and training opportunities for the workforce as well as making its full range of services available to all of the workers. The employees are currently being interviewed by F&Aacute;S. The priority will be to find alternative employment for those involved.</P>
        <P>In this regard, there have been substantial inward investment job announcements in the Cork area in recent years. In 2003, new projects with the potential to create up to 900 new jobs in companies such as Trend Micro, ACS, Altana, Schlumberger, Pepsi and Recordati were announced. In 2004, there were project announcements from companies including Centocor, Altera, AK Pharmaceuticals and McAfee with employment potential of approximately 800 new jobs. In 2005, over 600 new jobs were announced in companies such as Engenio, <?oasys _ch ?>Siemens, Parsons, VMware, Alps, Cascade Designs and Alcon.</P>
        <P>To date in 2006, new projects have been announced in Cork by Citco, Amazon and Amgen which will result in 1,800 new jobs at full operation. Citco will create 250 new financial services jobs, Amazon&rsquo;s investment will create up to 450 new jobs while the Amgen announcement of 1,100 new jobs at an &euro;820 million facility at Carrigtohill is of particular importance being a <Col N="2146"/>major global project that has chosen Cork as its development location.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards indigenous industry, Enterprise Ireland is focusing on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up high-potential start-up companies and the creation of new jobs in existing companies. Since the beginning of 2003 to date, the agency has made payments of over &euro;22 million to its client companies in County Cork. The State development agencies, including the local county enterprise boards, will continue to work closely together and with local interests to promote Cork for further investment and job creation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Irish national reform programme brings together a broad range of policies and initiatives to sustain Ireland&rsquo;s strong economic growth and employment performance as part its contribution to the relaunched EU Lisbon Agenda over the period to 2008. It was agreed that Ireland&rsquo;s social partnership process would serve as the Irish national reform partnership under the Lisbon Agenda. The national reform programme is co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach and prepared by the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance, taking into account policies agreed in both the programme for Government and Sustaining Progress. The social partners were consulted in the course of preparation of the programme for the period 2005 to 2008 and it was considered in both Houses of the Oireachtas on 25 and 26 October 2005.</P>
        <P>The European Commission&rsquo;s assessment of the national reform programme was contained in its annual progress report, published in January 2006. The Commission&rsquo;s view of the Irish programme was that consultation and efforts to develop ownership of the document were very substantial, assisted by the fact that it was built on policies on which there was a fair degree of existing consensus.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 38 and 73 together.</P>
        <P>The latest statistics compiled by the Central Statistics Office indicate that the total labour force is 2.07 million. The assignment of previously announced additional labour inspectors was completed in November 2005. That brought the complement of serving inspectors to 31 officers. The increase in staffing represents almost a doubling of the number of labour inspectors in the last 18 months.</P>
        <P>The ratio of the number of labour inspectors to the labour force is one for every 67,000 in 2005. This shows a marked improvement in the ratio of labour inspectors over the past ten years, from one inspector for every 150,000 people in the labour force in 1996 to one for every 67,000 in 2005, and this against an increase of over 500,000 in the labour force in the same period.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that there is a wide range of employment rights bodies and services. These include the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the redundancy and insolvency sections of this Department, the rights commissioner services provided by the Labour Relations Commission and the services provided by the Labour Court. The labour inspectorate is a unit within the employment rights compliance section, which also includes the employment rights information unit and a further separate unit that administers the referral of cases for prosecution and legal enforcement of orders. Between them, these various services have a complement of staff in excess of 150 people.</P>
        <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment circulated a discussion document, &ldquo;Mandate and Resourcing of the Labour Inspectorate&rdquo;, to the social partners in early 2005. That document was the basis for further consideration by the employment rights compliance group, <Col N="2148"/>ERCG. The group, which is made up of representatives of the social partners, including the CIF and SIPTU, together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance, has completed its report. The report will inform the current national partnership discussions.</P>
        <P>Some of the key proposals in the report are: a streamlining of access to redress through the existing employment rights bodies thus enabling individuals with the information and facility to more easily vindicate their employment rights and entitlements; greater emphasis on proper record keeping together with increased transparency regarding pay and the associated information provided to employees on payslips; organisational improvements in the service provided by the employment rights compliance section of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, including the labour inspectorate and a regionalised structure; major investment in education and information dissemination on employment rights obligations and entitlements for both employers and employees.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that the new round of social partnership talks will embrace consideration of the resourcing of the labour inspectorate and options to enhance the effectiveness of our employment rights compliance regime.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>if it is his intention to urgently introduce legislation to provide for the creation of a new offence of corporate manslaughter, as suggested by the Law Reform Commission in October 2003 and recommended by the commission in its recent report to which a draft Bill is appended; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Law Reform Commission, in its report published in October 2005, recommended that as the current law of corporate liability for manslaughter does not provide a clear basis for constructing liability, a new basis, in legislative form, is necessary. To this end the commission included the draft of a short Bill in its report. The commission also recommended that there should be individual statutory liability for managers who were culpable in the causation of death. Section 80 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 provides for directors, managers or other similar officers of an undertaking to be held liable by the courts for an offence that is attributable to connivance or neglect on their part.</P>
        <P>While this is a considerable step forward in implementing the recommendations of the commission, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office was of the opinion at the time of the drafting of the Bill, <Col N="2149"/>which is now the 2005 Act, that there were much broader issues relating to the overall criminal justice system which needed to be considered and that, therefore, it was not appropriate to comprehensively deal with the issue of corporate manslaughter in a Bill which was providing for the law and regulation of occupational safety, health and welfare. It should be noted for the record that the commission accepted the Office of the Attorney General&rsquo;s view that the scope of the 2005 Act was narrower than the proposed offence recommended by it in its report.</P>
        <P>Further consideration of the recommendations in the report of the Law Reform Commission will now take place primarily at Government level by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the context of his main responsibilities for the criminal law system.</P>

	<P>The provision of grant assistance for individual companies is a matter for the development agency or body concerned and not one in which I have a direct function. However, I am advised by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development that they are satisfied that there is no evidence to suggest that client companies are under-reporting job losses to avoid a clawback of grant assistance.</P>
        <P>In the event of a company failing to meet conditions attached to grant aid the agencies take whatever action is deemed necessary, which may include seeking repayment of grants received or portions thereof.</P>

	<P>Officials from my Department&rsquo;s employment rights section have participated in all five meetings of the European Commission&rsquo;s group of national experts on the implementation of the posting of workers directive, since October 2003 when the group was first established. The group&rsquo;s mandate is to foster practical co-operation between EU member states regarding implementation of the directive. Further meetings of the group will take place during 2006. The contributions of the officials in question are informed by a knowledge of the law, of Government policy and of experience of the operation of the directive.</P>
        <P>The mandatory provisions of the posting of workers directive were transposed fully and robustly into Irish law by section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001. At none of the meetings of the expert group did the European Commission suggest that Ireland had not transposed the directive properly.</P>

	<P>In 2005, the Health and Safety Authority consulted widely with relevant interests in the cash in transit industry at all levels in the development of the &ldquo;Guidelines for Employers, Employees and Clients involved in the Cash in Transit Industry&rdquo;, which were formally launched on 2 March this year. Speaking at the launch of the guidelines, my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and commerce, Deputy Michael Ahern, said that the guidelines were a shining example of what could be achieved when employers and employees co-operated towards a shared goal. Indeed, proper safety and health procedures in the cash in transit industry will bring benefits not just to the industry but also to the general public in terms of safety and security.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A working group comprising representatives of employers, employees and their union, the Private Security Authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Bankers Federation assisted in the development of the guidelines. At an early stage in the process, the working group met employee representatives and heard their views. They were further consulted on the final draft of the guidelines.</P><Col N="2151"/>
        <P>The guidelines are designed to give practical advice to those working in the cash in transit industry so that the safety and health of all employees are protected and ensured. Employers, employees and client companies who follow the guidelines will be taking the recommended steps to protect the safety and health of their workers and will be demonstrating their intentions to achieve best practice.</P>
        <P>The guidelines deal with a range of issues, from servicing ATMs and manual handling issues to syringe and knife attacks and hostage situations &mdash; so called tiger attacks. The specific objectives of the guidelines are to: promote and protect the health, safety and welfare of people working in the CIT industry and others who may use the services of CIT companies or who are engaged in carrying cash in the conduct of their own business or employment; provide guidelines on the standards of safety to be provided by those who conduct CIT business; ensure that risks to safety and health in the CIT industry are identified, assessed and eliminated or controlled in the most appropriate way; promote consultation and co-operation between employers, employees, contractors, sub-contractors, clients and controllers of premises in ensuring the safety of their employees.</P>

	<P>It is not possible to infer precise causes for the decisions taken by companies relating to location or relocation. The reasons may be many and varied and include the availability of incentives, market access, availability and cost of labour, regulatory and financial issues. I am aware that some international research suggests that only 20% of the de-industrialisation between 1970 and 2002 in OECD countries was due to offshoring and trade effects. Forf&aacute;s, the policy advisory body under the aegis of my Department, is also undertaking some research in this area, which should be completed later this year.</P>
        <P>It is certainly the case that manufacturing firms in the more traditional sectors have, in recent years, operated against a backdrop of significantly declining external demand, downward price pressure and an increasingly competitive international environment, together with upward pressure on costs and the strengthening of the <Col N="2152"/>euro against our key trading partner currencies. There are areas of activity in which Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness is seriously challenged and it is inevitable that, among the factors which influence the location decisions of companies, the competitive attractions of alternative geographic locations will figure.</P>
        <P>Our experience of the increasing trend towards globalisation has been a largely positive one. There was a 4.7% increase in employment during 2005 with 87,000 new jobs created across the economy. This was the highest annual rate of employment growth recorded since 2000. Since 1997, employment in financial services and other business services has grown by 100,000 approximately, while employment in the construction sector grew by 100,000. Employment within manufacturing has declined by 31,000 since peaking at 251,000 in 2001. However, this decline has been more than offset by the rise in the number of jobs in services. Furthermore, manufacturing output has continued to increase, indicating improved productivity.</P>
        <P>One of my Department&rsquo;s principal tasks is to ensure that Ireland continues to be attractive place to do business and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain. In that regard, we have made significant efforts to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions and to promote new areas of competitive advantage, such as by developing our research and development base.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our priority is the creation of sustainable employment, driven by companies with higher profitability, that are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy. In this context the enterprise development agencies are working on an ongoing basis with companies to provide mentoring and developmental supports, to enhance management capabilities and critical workforce skills, to build productivity, to support the creation and implementation of strategies for market entry, development and growth and to provide support for innovation and for research and development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the changing nature of our economy resulted in some losses, in contrast, the new jobs created in the economic development agencies&rsquo; client companies in the last number of years are heavily concentrated in high value added, knowledge based companies that offer greater security in the face of intense international competition.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 47 together.</P>
        <P>Exemption from statutory audit removes the need for companies to engage an independent external auditor. Following a proposal and recommendation from the task force on small business, audit exemption was first introduced in Ireland under the Companies (Amendment)(No. 2) Act 1999 and came into effect on 21 February 2000 for certain small private limited companies.</P>
        <P>In 2003, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment undertook a review of the audit exemption threshold, arising from which the turnover limit was increased from &euro;317,000 to &euro;1.5 million with effect from 1 July 2004. This increase was seen as striking an appropriate balance between competing principles of better regulation and facilitating enterprise. Although this revision is only quite recent, I am conscious that there is a view developing that the level of the limit should be revisited. In addition, I understand that the small business forum, which was established last July to consider in broad terms the current environment for conducting small business in Ireland, has been examining the question of audit exemption. I also understand that this group will report to the Minister in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>In line with Government policy in &ldquo;Better Regulation&rdquo;, it is appropriate that all regulatory requirements, including audit requirements, should be kept under review in consultation with all relevant parties. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently engaged in a process of reform and consolidation of the Companies Acts in conjunction with the Company Law Review Group. The question of change in the audit exemption limit is a matter I will examine in the context of that process. As regards the number of businesses that would benefit from an increase in the exemption limits, clearly this would depend on any revised limit that might be agreed.</P>

	<P>In accordance with its remit under employment rights legislation, the labour inspectorate is empowered to examine particular employer records. In this connection, inspectors can examine copies of statements of pay or payslips and reconcile these with the payroll records. In addition, inspectors can examine the working time records that an employer is obliged to maintain. The preparation and production of false records is an offence.</P>
        <P>In this connection, however, the Department, in its discussion document &ldquo;Report on the Mandate and Resourcing of the Labour Inspectorate&rdquo;, recommended a streamlining of the record keeping requirements to tie in with the statements of pay. In addition, the report called for a significant revamping of the statement of pay or payslip so that there will be absolute transparency around the rate of pay per hour, the hours worked, the relevant calculation in respect of all deductions made and the eventual remuneration paid out. The report of the employment rights compliance group, which is informing the current partnership talks, indicated that there was a consensus between the social partners on progressing this proposal.</P>

	<P>The Labour Inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality, as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to other workers.</P>
        <P>In the area of pay and conditions, it is primarily the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 that apply to employees who are employed in domestic service. Employees working in the provision of domestic service, as is the case for employees in most other areas of the economy, are not categorised in any unique fashion in current employment legislation. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual/s concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. In this regard, I urge anyone who has evidence of the mistreatment of workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.</P>
        <P>The Labour Relations Commission commissioned the University of Limerick to carry out a review of the JLC system in 2005. Arising from this review and following bilateral consultations with the social partners and stakeholders, the Department has prepared a paper that will be used as the basis for implementation of the review in further consultation with the social partners and stakeholders, in the context of the current partnership talks. The issue of a JLC for domestic workers, and proposals for new JLCs for other sectors, will be considered in this context. Other measures aimed at assisting vulnerable workers, including domestic workers, are also being considered in the context of the current partnership talks.</P>

	<P>Sustaining Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness continues to be a key priority for this Government. It is monitored in particular through the work and advice of the National Competitiveness Council. The Government&rsquo;s response is manifested in numerous ways, most recently as evidenced by the introduction of a non-inflationary budget for the third consecutive <Col N="2156"/>year. This displays the Government&rsquo;s prudent fiscal management of the economy at a time of ever increasing global competitiveness pressures.</P>
        <P>Competition is the best way to ensure we have a competitive cost base. In my own Department I have assigned more resources and given more powers to the Competition Authority. I have abolished the groceries order and strengthened competition legislation to deliver more competition and help create a more cost effective base for doing business from Ireland.</P>
        <P>In its annual report for 2005, the NCC found that the rate of growth in the cost of insurance has slowed down substantially in recent years. This can be attributed to the series of initiatives the Government has pushed through to reform the insurance sector. The action taken by Government to ensure reform and healthy competition in the insurance sector had already seen benefits for consumers. The cost of motor insurance, for example, continues to decline and in the 12 months to February 2006 declined by 8.6%, while the Personal Injuries Assessment Board continues to deliver fair compensation at costs that are significantly lower than under the old litigation system. At the end of December 2005, the PIAB estimates that its process has saved litigants over &euro;4.3 million compared to comparable settlement costs under the old system.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume this question relates to the decision of the Competition Authority regarding Irish Actors&rsquo; Equity, SIPTU and the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland concerning the terms and conditions under which advertising agencies hire actors. I have already spoken on this issue a number of times in the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The authority&rsquo;s decision, which is published on its website <i>tca.ie</i>, states that while it is perfectly legal for Equity to represent employed actors in collective bargaining with their employers, its trade union mantle cannot exempt its conduct when it acts as a trade association for self-employed contractors. In this case the authority determined that the actors in question were self-employed contractors and not employees. Section 4 of the Competition Act prohibits anti-competitive practices, such as price fixing, by &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo;. An &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; is defined in the Act as &ldquo;a person being an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons engaged <Col N="2157"/>for gain in the production, supply, or distribution of goods or the provision of a service&rdquo;. This definition has been in use in Irish competition law for some time and is supported by EU case law.</P>
        <P>In its decision, the authority quotes a European case where the EU Commission found opera singers to be &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo;. The authority&rsquo;s decision is, therefore, consistent with European Law and any attempt to exempt a particular sector or profession would place Irish law out of step with European law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, I understand that the view expressed by the Competition Authority concerned this particular case only and it should not be taken as a definitive interpretation of the law. It is, of course, only the courts that can interpret the law. However, in entering into undertakings in settlement of the case, thereby avoiding the need to go to court, the parties appear to have accepted the authority&rsquo;s view. With the benefit of hindsight, it might have been more beneficial to all concerned had the case been heard before the courts so that a legally certain interpretation of the law could have been obtained. This course of action might be considered in the future should the issue arise again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The bottom line regarding competition law and policy &mdash; and probably tax law and other laws too &mdash; is that there is no distinction between a self-employed actor, musician or journalist on the one hand and a self-employed electrician on the other, or a self-employed publican or hospital consultant. In considering the question of whether self-employed individuals should be permitted to have a trade union negotiate on their behalf, it is important that we bear in mind that almost any group of self-employed contractors &mdash; such as barristers, solicitors, pharmacists, architects, plumbers, undertakers, electricians, engineers, carpenters, shopkeepers, taxi drivers, consultants, farmers, pub owners, vets and so on &mdash; could, by joining together, adding &ldquo;union&rdquo; to their name and getting a negotiating licence, attempt to circumvent the protections afforded to consumers by the Oireachtas in the Competition Act.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 52 together.</P>
        <P>The overall assessment of the Irish national reform programme, NRP, by the European Commission is very positive. It acknowledges the strong labour market performance in Ireland over the past five years and the effectiveness of our policies to sustain and enhance employment growth. The emphasis in the NRP on measures to integrate inactive people into the labour market, to increase female participation and to address skills development are seen as particularly positive elements.</P>
        <P>The NRP is an integrated document covering policies across a number of Government Departments. The employment aspect was prepared in consultation with a number of Departments, including the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Social and Family Affairs. As required under the Lisbon Agenda, the national reform programme outlines the policy priorities for the next three years and is not designed to be a comprehensive statement of all existing measures/programmes. There is an extensive body of employment legislation in place, for example, which ensures that workers rights are enhanced and protected and it is not covered in the report.</P>
        <P>Quality of work is a multidimensional concept encompassing issues such as upskilling, lifelong learning, health and safety at work, adaptability, work-life balance and equal opportunities. These are addressed throughout the report and, together with the range of existing measures, are designed to ensure that the quality of work in Ireland is enhanced. Responsibility for policy to address poverty among employed people cuts across a number of Government Departments, including the Departments of Finance and Social and Family Affairs. In so far as my Department is concerned, the national minimum wage aims to ensure that employees are provided with a certain level of income. This is reviewed on a regular basis with the current rate at &euro;7.65 per hour effective since 1 May 2005.</P>
        <P>As regards adult participation in learning, the Department of Education and Science has the main responsibility in this area. My Department has placed increased emphasis on training employees, particularly those with low skill levels, to gain new skills and qualifications, through the one step up initiative. Over the period 2005-07, funding for supports and services under this initiative will total over &euro;150 million.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the provision of affordable, high quality child care services is a matter for the office for children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>In general there is no employment rights legislation covering overtime. While the Organisation of Working Act 1997 regulates rest breaks and maximum weekly working hours it does not <Col N="2160"/>cover overtime payment. Employees do not have a statutory entitlement to overtime pay except in certain employments covered by employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements. Policy on overtime pay may be decided by the employer and agreed as part of the employee&rsquo;s terms and conditions of employment or through collective agreements negotiated between employers and employee representatives.</P>
        <P>Terms and conditions of employment are determined in the main by a process of voluntary collective bargaining between the employers and employees or their representatives. Within this system parties are free to negotiate or not to negotiate. To support the process and ensure a level of fair play, a floor of statutory rights, for example, minimum wages, holiday entitlements and so forth, are in place that can be improved upon by negotiation but which cannot be taken away. The State facilitates the bargaining process by providing a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper. Institutions have been established that can assist in the resolution of disputes between employers and workers such as the Labour Relations Commission, including its rights commissioner service, and the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>While a feature of voluntarism is that collective agreements are generally not enforceable in law, in Ireland there are two areas where collective agreements have a legal foundation and are enforceable through the labour inspectorate, that is, registered employment agreements and employment regulation orders.</P>
        <P>A number of employment sectors have pay and conditions of employment regulated through the joint labour committee system/employment regulation orders, EROs, or through registered employment agreements, REAs, that are legally binding on employers in the sectors to which they apply. A small number of individual firms also have binding REAs. Some of the EROs/REAs regulate overtime pay. Employment regulation orders or registered employment agreements regulate overtime payment in the following sectors: aerated waters and wholesale bottling &mdash; agriculture; catering &mdash; outside Dublin city and D&uacute;n Laoghaire; catering &mdash; Dublin city and D&uacute;n Laoghaire; construction; retail footwear and drapery &mdash; Dublin only; electrical contract; wholesale fruit and vegetable &mdash; Dublin only; hairdressing &mdash; Dublin city and county, Bray and Cork city only; handkerchief and household piece goods; hotels &mdash; outside Dublin city, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Cork city; law clerks; printing &mdash; Dublin Only; provender milling; retail grocery; security; shirtmaking; tailoring; women&rsquo;s clothing and millinery.</P>
        <P>The Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 provides that an employer is obliged to provide an employee with a written statement of terms of employment within two months of the <Col N="2161"/>commencement of employment. The written statement of terms must include information on any terms or conditions relating to hours of work, including overtime, as well as information on the rate of pay of the employee or how the pay is calculated. An employee who is not paid in accordance with his/her terms of employment may refer a complaint to a rights commissioner under the Payment of Wages Act 1991.</P>

	<P>I am satisfied that there is good co-ordination between my Department and the Department of Education and Science on the issue of providing skills. There is regular contact and co-ordination between the two Departments, both in the identification of skills needs and in the responses required to meet those needs. This co-ordination is achieved through regular interaction between officials in a number of fora and on a day-to-day basis. The following are just some examples of how deep and wide this interaction is.</P>
        <P>In terms of policy development, both the Minister for Education and Science and I are represented by our departmental officials as advisers to the expert group on future skills needs. This is one of the principal fora dedicated to addressing skills issues at the nexus of the education and training strands of policy. In that context, there is ongoing discussion involving both Department officials and representatives from their respective agencies &mdash; Forf&aacute;s, FAS and the HEA &mdash; leading to agreed policy advice to myself and the Minister for Education and Science on a range of skills related issues. Officials from both the Department of Education and Science and my Department are also participating on an interdepartmental group on lifelong learning to further the lifelong learning agenda. Both Departments also participate in the ongoing work in supporting the implementation of the national workplace of the future strategy.</P>
        <P>Both Departments or their respective agencies have representatives on a number of boards, councils or other bodies appointed either by myself or the Minister for Education and Science. The Department of Education and Science and/or its agencies, for example, are represented on the F&Aacute;S board, F&Aacute;S committees at local and national level, ESF committees and CEB structures. My Department and/or its agencies are represented on the HEA, the NQAI, HETAC and <Col N="2162"/>FETAC. In addition, there is significant ongoing interaction on skills related topics between the respective Departments and agencies under the aegis of both ministries.</P>
        <P>These examples give some sense of the degree to which there exists a regular flow of information and joint participation in policy development processes involving the two Departments.</P>

        <Quest>if he has read the CEO Pulse 2006 report from PricewaterhouseCoopers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, inaugural CEO Pulse survey is a useful addition to the analyses and commentary that I receive about evolving confidence indicators and the competitiveness of the economy. The CEO Pulse survey reveals that business confidence among Ireland&rsquo;s CEOs is high, with more than 75% predicting growth in revenues, profits and spending within the economy in 2006.</P>
        <P>Government policies are encouraging the transition to growth that will be increasingly based on higher levels of value added output and skills. The CEO survey finds that 70% of CEOs of multinational corporations indicated that Ireland was currently being considered for additional investment by their parent. This reinforces my belief in the strength of what we have to offer in the competition for foreign investment.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I have prioritised the enterprise agenda both in policy development within my Department and in its delivery through the development agencies that report to me. I note that the CEO survey reports that two thirds of Irish CEOs feel that the Government is more in touch with the needs of the business community than governments in other countries. This confirms that the Government&rsquo;s business agenda reflects the needs of Irish entrepreneurs in the real world of global competition and supports an entrepreneurial spirit that looks for and captures the opportunities emerging in world markets.</P>
        <P>Despite some very favourable comments coming from the survey, there are some matters of concern. The survey reflects dissatisfaction with our infrastructure. I recognise the importance of having first rate infrastructure to meet our development ambitions into the future. While infrastructure investment has been sustained at a high level under the current national development plan, this will be added to as the Department of Transport rolls out its Transport 21 programme. An unprecedented &euro;34.4 billion will be invested in public transport infrastructure and equipment over ten years.</P><Col N="2163"/>
        <P>I notice one of the major challenges mentioned by CEOs in the survey related to business costs. The Government&rsquo;s response is manifested in numerous ways, most recently as evidenced by the fact that for the third consecutive year we implemented a non-inflationary budget in budget 2006. This displays the Government&rsquo;s prudent fiscal management of the economy at a time of ever increasing global competitiveness pressures.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Health and Safety Authority began a consultation process with the social partners and key players in the construction industry on proposed new construction regulations under the safety, health and welfare at work legislation in 2003. The authority undertook public consultation during a six-week period towards the end of last year. A total of 46 submissions was received during this latter period. The proposed new regulations are designed to replace previous regulations in force since 2001 and 2003, to fully implement European directives relating to the construction sector and to give regulatory effect to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</P>
        <P>I understand that the board of the authority is due to hold a special meeting tomorrow, Friday, 24 March, to consider the regulations. I expect to receive the proposed regulations immediately afterwards and they will be sent by the Department to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office for legal settlement. I intend to invite comments from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. Unless there are unforeseen difficulties, I expect to be in a position to sign the new regulations into law within about six weeks and to lay the statutory instrument before the Houses.</P>
        <P>The Department, with assistance from the HSA, undertook a regulatory impact analysis which I also intend to lay before the Houses with the statutory instrument.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment circulated a discussion document, Mandate and Resourcing of the Labour Inspectorate, to the social partners in early 2005. That document was the basis for further consideration by the employment rights compliance group, ERCG. The ERCG, which is made up of representatives of the social partners, including the CIF and SIPTU, together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance, has completed its report. The report will inform the current national partnership discussions.</P>
        <P>Some of the key proposals in the report are: streamlining of access to redress through the existing employment rights bodies, thus enabling individuals with the information and facility to more easily vindicate their employment rights and entitlements; greater emphasis on proper record keeping together with increased transparency regarding pay and the associated information provided to employees on payslips; organisational improvements in the service provided by the employment rights compliance section of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, including the labour inspectorate, and including a regionalised structure; major investment in education and information dissemination on employment rights obligations and entitlements for both employers and employees.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that the new round of social partnership talks will embrace consideration of the resourcing of the labour inspectorate and options to enhance the effectiveness of our employment rights compliance regime.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 67 together.</P>
        <P>I was very concerned to hear the announcement of the closure of the plant in question at Mallow, County Cork. I am fully aware of the impact the job losses will have on the employees concerned and the local communities in both Mallow and the surrounding area. I understand that the company had hoped to undertake one more sugar campaign but it then decided that it was not feasible to do so.</P>
        <P>Finding alternative employment for those affected will be a priority for the State&rsquo;s development agencies. The services of F&Aacute;S are being made available to the workers who are to lose their jobs. On 21 March 2006, representatives of F&Aacute;S met with company management and provided a full briefing on the range of F&Aacute;S services available. I understand that F&Aacute;S representatives are meeting with the staff today. The registration process will begin next week so that progress will be made before the employees are let go.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to F&Aacute;S, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will play an important part in developing a way forward for the employees involved. At present, IDA Ireland is promoting north Cork to potential investors from across the full range of its targeted sectors such as pharmaceuticals, medical technologies, information and communications technologies and internationally traded services. Every effort will be made to secure new advanced, knowledge-based industry for the area. Several significant inward investment projects have been secured for the county in recent years.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is working with just over 700 client companies in County Cork, which employ over 22,000 people. This reflects an increase of over 3,000 jobs in the agency&rsquo;s client companies in the area over the past five years.</P>
        <P>Finally, on 21 March 2006, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and I, together with the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, met a delegation of various interested and concerned parties. In the course of our discussions, I assured the delegation of the full commitment of the State development agencies to addressing the difficulties facing the workers, their families and the local community. It is also <Col N="2166"/>my intention to ensure that possible alternative uses of the company&rsquo;s facility are explored.</P>

Research proposals to conduct the survey have been received and are currently being reviewed. I expect the successful tenderer to start the survey in the second quarter of this year and to complete it within as short a timescale as possible.</P>

        <P FLI="0">From April 2006 to December 2006 another nine directives require to be transposed. A further ten directives require to be transposed in 2007 and subsequent years.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to provide definitive information on proceedings relating to the delay or non-implementation of directives prior to 2001. However, since 2001, my Department has received 26 notifications &mdash; additional to the five extant notifications in the table &mdash; from the Commission in respect of the non-transposition of EU directives. All of the directives covered by the previous 26 notifications have now been transposed. My Department continues to accord a high priority to the transposition of directives and makes every effort to transpose directives in time to meet the deadline given for transposition.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The labour inspectorate of the Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to other workers.</P>
        <P>In the area of pay and conditions, it is primarily the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 that apply to employees who are employed in domestic service. Employees working in the provision of domestic service, as is the case for employees in most other areas of the economy, are not categorised in any unique fashion in current employment legislation.</P>
        <P>Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, prosecution is initiated. In this regard, I urge anyone who has evidence of the mistreatment of workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.</P>
        <P>The Labour Relations Commission commissioned the University of Limerick to carry out a review of the JLC system in 2005. Arising from <Col N="2170"/>this review and following bilateral consultations with the social partners and stakeholders, the Department has prepared a paper that will be used as the basis for implementation of the review in further consultation with the social partners and stakeholders, in the context of the current partnership talks. The issue of a JLC for domestic workers &mdash; and proposals for new JLCs for other sectors &mdash; will be considered in this context. Other measures aimed at assisting vulnerable workers, including domestic workers, are also being considered in the context of current partnership talks.</P>
        <P>Against this background, I do not propose to avail at this time of section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 to request the Labour Court to furnish a report into the employment conditions prevailing for domestic workers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As I advised the House previously, the Consumer Strategy Group report, Make Consumers Count, was published in May 2005 and to date considerable progress has been made in progressing its recommendations. The report&rsquo;s core recommendation that a new national consumer agency, incorporating the existing Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, be established was fully accepted by the Government. Preparations for the establishment of the new agency are well under way. In this regard, I hope to publish the legislation establishing the new agency later this year and to have the NCA up and running early in 2007.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that I appointed a board to the NCA in June 2005 to act in an interim capacity until the agency is formally established. Since its appointment, the interim board of the NCA has been very active in advocating the consumer&rsquo;s cause and raising the awareness of consumer rights. The interim board has been allocated funding to allow it to continue and intensify its activities throughout the course of 2006. In addition to being a forceful advocate on behalf of the consumer, the interim board as part of its terms of reference will have a key role in preparing the way for the fully operational agency itself.</P>
        <P>The other significant recommendation in the Consumer Strategy Group report related to the abolition of the groceries order. The Deputy will be aware that on Monday of this week I signed the order to commence the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006. The new Competition Act will finally abolish the Groceries Order 1987, <Col N="2171"/>which kept the prices of groceries in Ireland at an artificially high level by allowing suppliers to specify minimum prices below which products could not be sold. The new Act will also strengthen the provisions of the 2002 Competition Act by specifically prohibiting the fixing of minimum retail prices by suppliers, unfair discrimination in the grocery trade and the payment of advertising allowances and &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On other recommendations of the CSG, a number of the recommendations relating to my Department have already been implemented. The Deputy will be aware that the fines for breaching consumer protection laws have been significantly increased as recommended by the CSG. Furthermore, the fundamental review of the existing code of consumer protection law, as recommended by the CSG, is already under way and additional resources have been dedicated by my Department to this task.</P>
        <P>The CSG report contains over 30 separate recommendations involving a variety of different Departments and agencies whose activities directly impact upon the interests of consumers. Given the scope of the CSG&rsquo;s report, a high level interdepartmental committee was established to examine and prepare a detailed plan for the implementation of the recommendations. The committee&rsquo;s report, which was endorsed by the Government, was recently published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Considerable progress has been made in progressing the recommendations of the CSG since the publication of its report. I am determined that this progress will continue throughout the coming year and I am confident that, together with the interim board of the NCA, progress will continue to be made to the benefit of consumers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>In the case of the construction sector, there are two separate registered employment agreements, REAs &mdash; the construction industry, wages and conditions of employment, registered employment agreement and the construction industry, pensions assurance and sick pay, registered employment agreement, generally referred to as CFOPS. In 2005 the labour inspectorate carried out 50 inspections/visits under the construction industry, wages and conditions of employment, registered employment agreement.</P>
        <P>Broadly speaking, monitoring of compliance with the CFOPS is a matter for signatories to the agreement. To assist them in this task they established, in 1998, the construction industry monitoring agency, known as CIMA, to monitor compliance on their behalf. The labour inspectorate, at the request of the Labour Court, carried out 47 inspections in 2005 under the pensions, assurance and sick pay registered employment agreement.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of the provisions of a registered employment agreement may also be effected through the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts. A trade union, an association of employers or an individual employer may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with a registered employment agreement. If, after investigating a complaint, the court is satisfied that the employer is in breach of a registered employment agreement it may by order direct compliance with the agreement. Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine.</P>

	<P>Management skills are critical to the success of business and to the viability of the more than 200,000 SMEs in Ireland. For this reason my Department and its agencies are <Col N="2173"/>already significantly involved in a range of programmes to support management development. The Department, F&Aacute;S, Skillnets, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards all provide support for training and other forms of management development. Funding for in-company training, including management development, increased significantly in 2005 and this level of investment is being maintained in 2006.</P>
        <P>These supports include the following features. The F&Aacute;S competency development programme saw its allocations increase from &euro;8.5 million in 2004 to &euro;35.6 million per year in 2005 and 2006. About one third of this will be invested in management development. F&Aacute;S investment will be matched by contributions from industry. Skillnets Limited also receives funding from my Department to manage a networking programme that involves training for networks of companies. The national training fund investment, which increased to &euro;8.5 million in 2006 &mdash; up from &euro;5.175 million in 2004 &mdash; will also attract matching funds from the employers. About 35% of this will be invested in management development activities.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland and the country enterprise boards offer a range of supports to help client companies identify and build on the current and future management capabilities they need for growth. In addition to supporting management development courses, these industrial development agencies also provide access to mentoring so that clients can access the wide ranging knowledge, connections, experience and advice of expert mentors. Enterprise Ireland has also developed an export development programme aimed at developing the skills of executives in manufacturing or internationally traded service companies so they can win international sales and sustain export growth into the future.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland and Skillnets are also managing ESF supported in-company training initiatives on behalf of my Department. Enterprise Ireland is supporting about 20 companies at a cost of about &euro;6 million over three years. The Skillnets initiative, known as the Accel programme, has a public budget in the order of &euro;16 million over the next two years &mdash; one third of which will be invested in management skills.</P>
        <P>In addition, the expert group on future skill needs has undertaken a study on management skills in SMEs. This will be published shortly and will inform the development of future policy in this area.</P>

	<P>Improved access to medicines is a matter which has been considered and discussed by World Trade Organisation, WTO, members in Geneva in the context of the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights, known as the TRIPs agreement.</P>
        <P>Multilateral trade policy, in the context of the formulation and development of the common commercial policy of the European Union, is a Community competence and not solely a national competence. In this regard, the European Communities and member states have played a very active role in the adoption of the WTO General Council decision of 30 August 2003, which by waiving WTO members&rsquo; obligations under Article 31(<i>f</i>) of the TRIPs agreement, allows members to grant compulsory licences for the production and sale of patented pharmaceutical products intended for export to third countries with insufficient or no manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector. The waiver is a temporary measure and, in December 2005, the WTO General Council adopted a decision on a permanent amendment to Article 31 of the TRIPs agreement which has been submitted to WTO members for acceptance.</P>
        <P>The EU is currently at the final stages of adopting a draft regulation transposing the temporary waiver into Community law. This will ensure that the right conditions are put in place, in the EU, to allow the system set up by the WTO decision of August 2003 to operate efficiently. Ireland has fully supported the above approach and is seeking the earliest adoption of the regulation.</P>

	<P>The current body of Irish legislation in the intellectual property field provides a comprehensive legal framework for the protection and exploitation of such property. However, the field of intellectual property is constantly evolving in response to advances in technology and other developments internationally. My Department is therefore fully alert to the need to keep the present legislation under review and to bring forward proposals for necessary change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In that context, I confirm my intention to progress primary legislation in this area aimed at maintaining an optimal legal environment for intellectual property. The Patents Amendment Bill 1999 will be taken on Committee Stage in the near future. This Bill has evolved considerably since its publication in response to international <Col N="2175"/>developments. It aims to update the Patents Act 1992 to bring our legislation more fully in line with the agreement on the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights, TRIPs agreement, and to give effect to revisions to the European Patent Convention and to the signature by Ireland of the Patent Law Treaty concluded under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organisation.</P>
        <P>Later this year, I aim to publish an intellectual property miscellaneous provisions Bill intended to transpose several EU directives into Irish law. These include the artists&rsquo; resale right directive, the introduction of a public lending royalty and provisions needed to support the transposition of a directive on the civil enforcement of intellectual property rights.</P>

	<P>Very significant growth in research has been achieved through the commitment of &euro;2.5 billion to science, technology and innovation across a range of Departments under the current NDP. The Government is committed to continuing to invest in research and development. Investment to date has been critical in developing the base of knowledge, discoveries and new ideas from which new products, services and enterprises can be generated and substantial efforts have also been made to ensure that this research can be commercialised.</P>
        <P>Effective commercialisation is dependent on a clear framework for intellectual property rights arising from research. In that context, two national codes of practice for managing intellectual property, for fully and partly publicly funded research, respectively, have been published under the aegis of the Advisory Science Council.</P>
        <P>EI supports the construction of campus based business incubation centres in all institutes of technology and universities. To date, it has approved 25 incubation centres, 16 of which are in institutes of technology or equivalent third level colleges, and a further nine of which are on university campuses. Specific incentives are also in place under the aegis of EI to support collaborative research involving firms and higher education institutions.</P>
        <P>Currently, my Department is working with the enterprise agencies, Science Foundation Ireland and the Higher Education Authority on the development of a measure to further strengthen and support the technology transfer function in the higher education institutions to ensure that <Col N="2176"/>ideas generated from research are more effectively captured and brought to market. The commercialisation of research will continue to be a major area of focus by Government to ensure that investment in research is leveraged as effectively as possible for the economic benefit of the country.</P>

	<P>Sixteen investigations into company law matters were initiated by my predecessor in the period since 1997. In three cases, the High Court appointed, on an application by the Minister, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990. The inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on 10 June 2002. The report was subsequently published and was referred to the DPP.</P>
        <P>The inspectors appointed to National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited presented their report to the High Court on 12 July 2004. The report was subsequently published. The court ordered that a copy of the report be referred to several relevant authorities, including the DPP. In 2005, the Director of Corporate Enforcement initiated pro<Col N="2177"/>ceedings in the High Court under section 160(2) of the Companies Act 1990, as amended, seeking the disqualification of nine persons against whom adverse comment was made by the inspectors. I note that last October the High Court granted a disqualification order against one of the nine persons. The proceedings against the other eight remain before the court.</P>
        <P>One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990 was completed in 1998. The report on this was referred to the DPP. One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act 1989. The report on this was referred to the DPP as well as to the inspectors who undertook the section 8 investigation into that company.</P>
        <P>Eleven investigations were initiated by the Minister under section 19 of the Companies Act 1990, six of which have been concluded. Of the six investigations completed, reports were referred to the DPP in two cases. A number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded in one case. One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors. One report was completed in September 2002 and a further report was completed in March 2003. Both reports have been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
        <P>Two of the 11 section 19 investigations were held up in legal appeals, to such extent that no effective progress was made by the authorised officer and the matter of reports of the examinations did not arise. These inquiries are now the responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Regarding the three remaining section 19 examinations, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 66 today.</P>

	<P>The national minimum wage legislation provides for a monetary deduction which can be made from the statutory minimum pay of an employee if the employee is provided with board and/or lodgings as follows:</P><Col N="2178"/>
        <P LI="1">For full board and lodgings, &euro;54.13 per week or &euro;7.73 per day.</P>
        <P LI="1">For full board only per week, &euro;32.14 per week or &euro;4.60 per day.</P>
        <P LI="1">For lodgings only per week, &euro;21.85 per week or &euro;3.14 per day.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Information is not available on the number of employers who avail of this provision. The national minimum wage legislation makes no provision relating to the quality of lodgings provided in this regard.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the practice of some sports organisations, including the Irish national soccer team, involving their changing their shirts on a frequent basis in association with sponsors, primarily for marketing reasons; if his attention has further been drawn to the cost consequences for consumers; if the National Consumer Agency or some other consumer body will be asked to examine this practice with a view to ensuring adequate protection for consumers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of concerns raised in a number of quarters regarding the practice highlighted in the Deputy&rsquo;s question. It is the case that there is no law to prevent sports organisations from changing their sports shirts. I would, however, agree with the Deputy that constant and frequent changes of replica apparel by sports organisations can give rise to considerable expense for some consumers. For that reason, I intend to request my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, to raise the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns with the relevant sports organisations to ensure that they fully appreciate the difficulties that too frequent changes in their sporting apparel can cause for some consumers.</P>
        <P>It is, however, ultimately a decision for the consumer himself or herself as to whether he or she considers the cost of any good, including sports shirts, to represent value for money. It is not a matter for Government to make such decisions. Nevertheless, the European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002 oblige traders to indicate the selling price of goods/products which they offer for sale to consumers. It is important, therefore, that consumers use this information to assist them in making informed choices as to whether a particular product or item of sporting apparel offers value for money.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Since the establishment of the county development boards, the relevant CDB is now seen as the body that is best placed to oversee any additional response that is required over and above the work of the agencies under the auspices of my Department. IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and F&Aacute;S all play their part in developing a way forward for redundant workers.</P>
        <P>In co-operation with the industrial development agencies and local interests, F&Aacute;S provides a comprehensive range of support services to workers who are facing redundancy and, in particular, where company closures arise. The process is flexible and adaptable to meet the needs of each closure. The services include the following: provision of intensive vocational guidance and counselling to the individuals affected; information on current job vacancies; assistance in CV preparation and interview techniques; advice and assistance on a comprehensive range of training options; identification of portable skills that can be applied to other sectors of employment; specially tailored and flexible training programmes; and assistance in investigating self-employment opportunities.</P>
        <P>In the delivery of these services, F&Aacute;S liaises with other relevant agencies such as area partnership companies, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the city and county enterprise boards. To further develop and inform F&Aacute;S services in this area, F&Aacute;S has commissioned an external review of its support services. The final report is expected shortly.</P>

	<P>Since the accession of the ten new member states in May 2004, over 190,000 PPS numbers have been issued to EU-10 nationals and Revenue data indicate that about 70% of them may have participated in our labour market at some stage. It is not possible to predict the number of workers that will come from these member states to work in Ireland over the next five years.</P><Col N="2180"/>
        <P>However, I am informed that the &ldquo;Population and Labour Force Projections 2006-2036&rdquo; published by the Central Statistics Office last year included two alternative projections for net inward migration for the period 2006 to 2011. The first projection, which was based on the continuance of the present rate of strong economic growth, estimated that net annual migration over the period 2006 to 2011 would average 30,000. The alternative projection based on moderate levels of growth would be 20,000 per annum. The projections do not give details for nationals of EU-10 member states.</P>
        <P>The policy is that workers from abroad working here are entitled to the same employment rights as Irish workers.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Figures published by the Health and Safety Authority show that 72 work related deaths were reported to it in 2005 compared to 50 in 2004 and 65 in 2003. There were 23 construction related fatalities in 2005 compared to 16 in 2004 and 17 in 2003. Of the 23 fatalities in 2005, 21 were employees, one was a member of the public and another was a non-construction worker.</P>
        <P>In the period 1 January to 22 March 2006, eight workplace fatalities were reported to the Health and Safety Authority. These comprised four in agriculture, two in manufacturing industry and one each in construction and transport.</P>
        <P>On injuries arising from workplace accidents generally, to date, a total of 8,095 non-fatal accidents, resulting in absence of more than three days from normal work, was reported to the authority across all sectors for 2005. Of these, 1,627 related to the construction sector. In the period 1 January to 22 March 2006, 1,320 non-fatal accidents were reported to the Health and Safety Authority, including 320 in construction and 309 in manufacturing.</P>
        <P>I include a tabular statement on workplace fatal and non-fatal reported accidents and rates and comparisons. There are over 200,000 workplaces in Ireland and, to make best use of its resources, the authority is once again prioritising a number of sectors for attention. These include the high risk sectors of agriculture, construction, mines and quarries. Key actions in these sectors will include a major national road-show which <Col N="2181"/>will visit a minimum of 5,000 construction workers; the development of a farm &ldquo;safety village&rdquo; at the World Ploughing Championships; the publication of codes of practice tailored to those employing three or less in the agriculture, quarrying and construction sectors; an effective inspection programme targeting key risks; a series of construction briefings targeting managers and designers on the new construction regulations, including information on vibration, noise, work at height, underground services, roof work and cranes; research into the issues involved in the employment of non-English-speaking workers.</P><Col N="2182"/>
        <P Just="Left">
          
          The rate of deaths and injuries in Irish workplaces is unacceptable and a range of approaches is necessary to secure and maintain a significant improvement. There are considerable responsibilities on all parties in the workplace and the issue of safety can only be corrected by dedicated efforts by all those involved in day to day operations.</P>
        <P>I repeat my appeal to all parties to do more work to promote awareness of the need for a safe work environment which has benefits for workers, employers and for society generally and which will engender a safety culture.</P><Col N="2181"/>

        <Quest>the position in regard to the investigation by the labour inspectorate into allegations of very serious irregularities in regard to the treatment of employees of a Turkish company, Gama, which has been operating here; if all the workers have been given access to money held in accounts in a bank in Holland; if he has considered requesting the Garda to conduct an investigation into allegations that money had been diverted into accounts to which the workers previously had no access; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[11271/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Allegations of non-compliance with labour legislation in respect of a major construction firm were raised in this House on 8 February 2005 by Deputy Joe Higgins. Those allegations were that certain non-national construction workers were required to work excessive hours and that such workers were in receipt of pay of between &euro;2 and &euro;3 per hour in contravention of the statutory minimums applicable.</P>
        <P>The labour inspectorate of the Department undertook an investigation of these allegations. That investigation was completed within six weeks and required the exclusive attention of three labour inspectors under the direction of two senior members of staff. A report on the investigation was prepared and circulated to relevant parties, including the construction firm involved.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, the Department was informed that the firm proposed seeking a judicial review with regard to the investigation and inspector&rsquo;s report. At an interlocutory hearing a judgment was given whereby the Department was restrained from publication of the inspector&rsquo;s report but permitted to forward the document to relevant prosecutorial bodies. On foot of this outcome a copy of the inspector&rsquo;s report was sent to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Revenue Commissioners, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Competition Authority, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda Commissioner.</P><Col N="2186"/>
        <P>The inspector&rsquo;s report was quashed in the judgment that followed the full High Court hearing of the case. That decision is being appealed to the Supreme Court. I am unable, accordingly, to elaborate any further on the content of the inspector&rsquo;s report or offer any observations on the actions that the prosecutorial bodies, mentioned above, may be considering.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Martin, was concerned that all Turkish workers would have access to the money that had been transferred to their bank accounts in Finansbank in Amsterdam. To that end, the Minister and senior officials met with senior management from Gama Turkey and Gama Ireland, the legal advisers to Gama Turkey and a human resources consultant retained by Gama. At that meeting, the Minister was assured by these senior managers, their legal adviser and the human resources consultant that all Gama workers in Ireland, past and present, would have full access to the money that had been transferred to their bank accounts in Finansbank.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Martin, contacted the president of Finansbank and was assured that, provided the consent of the workers was forthcoming, his bank would co-operate in ensuring that the departmental officials would have sight of relevant bank records in his bank so that they could be satisfied that all workers would have access to the money in their bank accounts. Officials of the Department travelled to Finansbank on 14 April last. Following these meetings and contacts which Department officials had with SIPTU and Deputy Joe Higgins, I am satisfied that a substantial number of Turkish workers, who were in Ireland around last April, received value for the funds that had been transferred to their personal bank accounts in Finansbank.</P>
        <P>The Department wrote to Gama Turkey&rsquo;s legal advisers on 29 April 2005 seeking certain details on each current and former Gama employee, including the money transferred to Finansbank and the money transferred from Finansbank to their personal bank account in Isbank in Turkey. Despite reminders to Gama Turkey&rsquo;s legal advisers, and engagement with a PR company engaged by Gama, this information was not supplied at the time. In recent days a substantial vol<Col N="2187"/>ume of data has been presented by Gama to the Department. Department officials are currently examining this material. Pending the outcome of this examination, I cannot assure the Deputy that all Gama workers in Ireland, both past and present, have received value for the amounts that were transferred into their personal accounts in Finansbank.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, there were ongoing contacts between officials of my Department and the company. Matters were brought before the Labour Relations Commission and then the Labour Court. Arising from these actions, substantial transfers of money were secured for workers in lieu of overtime worked. In addition, certain professional Gama workers, in respect of whom transfers were not made into Dutch bank accounts, were also awarded sums of money by the Labour Court. Many of these Turkish workers have now returned home.</P>
        <P>A routine inspection by the labour inspectorate of Gama is now under way.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>the number of inspections which have been carried out by the labour inspectorate in respect of compliance with the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 since its enactment; and the number of prosecutions for failure to comply with its provisions during the same period.</Quest>
        <QRef>[11230/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of inspections which have been carried out by the labour inspectorate in respect of compliance with the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 since its enactment, and the number of prosecutions for failure to comply with its provisions during the same period, are set out in the table.</P>
        <P>The primary function of the labour inspectorate is to seek compliance and rectification of any breaches identified, including payment of any arrears due to employees. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and seek redress for the individual/s concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Successful prosecution can be dependent on adequate support from witnesses.</P>
        <P>Since November 2005, the number of labour inspectors assigned and serving has been increased to 31 officers. As part of the programme of work that is being implemented to train the new inspectors their schedule included a focus on national minimum wage compliance, which commenced in February 2006. In addition to the new inspectors, a number of experienced officers are participating in this exercise in order to provide support and guidance as well as undertaking inspections themselves. It is expected that the additional resources and the focused cam<Col N="2188"/>paign will substantially increase the number of inspections/visits carried out under the National Minimum Wage Act.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should be aware that rights commissioners of the Labour Relations Commission &mdash; a body independent of my Department &mdash; also hear complaints concerning breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. In addition, there are some 19 employment regulation orders drawn up through the joint labour committee system that regulate statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for workers employed in the various sectors where these apply. Ensuring compliance with the minimum pay amounts and terms and conditions forms a major element of the work of the inspectorate.</P>

        <Quest>the steps he <Col N="2189"/>has taken arising from the announcement by NEC, Ballivor, County Meath, that it is to cease operations with the loss of 350 jobs; his views regarding the continuing loss of jobs in the general manufacturing sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I was very concerned to hear that the company in question was closing with the loss of 350 jobs. The decision to cease production was announced by the parent company on 21 February 2006. On 22 February 2006, I met with representatives of Meath County Council and the State development agencies to discuss the situation.</P>
        <P>Finding alternative employment for the workers is a priority for the State development agencies and IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and F&Aacute;S will play their part in developing a way forward for the workers. To date, F&Aacute;S has briefed all 350 employees on the range of services available to them. Registration and guidance interviews are due to commence on 24 March 2006 and are expected to continue for approximately three weeks. A training plan will be developed when the interviews are completed.</P>
        <P>The workforce in Ballivor is highly skilled and the loss of these jobs will be a severe blow to the area. The industrial development agencies will strengthen their marketing efforts in County Meath. This will be done in partnership with the county council and other key players to increase the flow of potential investors for the county and to convert these into investment and job opportunities for Ballivor and the surrounding area.</P>
        <P>Job losses in any sector are of concern. Ireland has a predominantly modern manufacturing base which competes in a range of growth sectors. However, as with most other European countries, there are areas of activity in which Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness is seriously challenged. In the main, these are in activities where labour cost is the primary driver behind business decisions. It is inevitable that the investment decisions of some companies will be influenced by the competitive attractions of alternative geographic locations.</P>
        <P>Manufacturing has been a key driver of prosperity across the economy for many years and enterprise policies will continue to emphasise the strategic importance of the sector to future economic growth. A key element of our strategy to help enterprise is to encourage increased levels of investment in research, business related technological development and innovation across all enterprise sectors, which will assist firms to produce improved products and services with added value. In the longer term, this approach will provide both more sustainable and higher quality jobs. Our objective is to ensure that our economy remains a globally competitive, profitable and secure location for business. When provided with the best supporting and competitive <Col N="2190"/>environment, I am confident that business and industry can develop to capitalise on investment and growth opportunities.</P>

        <Quest>the costs incurred by the State, at the latest date for which figures are available, arising from the various inquiries instigated by or on behalf of his Department; the element of these costs which have been recovered from any of the other parties involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to approximately &euro;11.3 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of Civil Service staff who worked on a number of these investigations or those legal costs borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
        <P>Costs of some &euro;9.3 million were incurred by High Court inspectors appointed under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990, &euro;5.8 million in the case of National Irish Bank Limited/National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited and &euro;3.5 million in the case of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited. In the case of the Ansbacher inquiry, the High Court proceedings taken by the State to recover the costs of the inquiry were settled out of court for the sum of &euro;1.25 million in favour of the State. In the case of National Irish Bank Limited/National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, the court ordered that National Irish Bank pay the full costs of the investigation. I understand that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which had borne the costs of the investigation, has recouped the full cost from National Irish Bank. The aggregate recoupment to the State from section 8 investigations was &euro;7.05 million or over 75% of the total of &euro;9.3 million.</P>
        <P>The balance of &euro;2 million represents the costs arising from section 19 examinations. Section 19 as originally enacted did not provide for the recoupment of costs. This has now changed with the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the report to which the Deputy refers. I do not necessarily agree with its conclusions. However, in general, terms and conditions of employment are determined by a process of voluntary collective bargaining between employers and employees. As the Deputy will be aware, the current discussions on a possible social partnership agreement will impact on the terms of conditions of employment of workers for the next period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The position of the low-paid has improved through successive national partnership agreements, through increases in the national minimum wage and in the annual budgetary changes to taxation.

	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, report that was published recently. Terms and conditions of employment are determined in the main by a process of voluntary collective bargaining between employers and employees or a trade union acting on their behalf. To support the process and ensure a level of fair play, a floor of statutory rights &mdash; for example, minimum wages, holiday entitlements and so forth &mdash; are in place that can be improved upon by negotiation but which cannot be taken away.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The position of the low-paid has improved through successive national partnership agreements, through increases in the national minimum wage and in the annual budgetary changes to taxation. Examination of statistical earnings produced by the Central Statistics Office shows that there is considerable uniformity in gross earnings increases across the economy over the five year period 2000 to 2004 and evidence of some compression of earnings differences within sectors.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In June 2005 I directed the authorised officer, in the case of the three section 19 examinations, to place at the disposal of relevant public authorities, including two tribunals, the information and assistance arising from his investigative work that was required by the authorities for the purpose of the performance of their statutory functions in accordance with section 21 of the Companies Act 1990. The public authorities in question are the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Moriarty tribunal and the Mahon tribunal.</P>
        <P>All information, books and documents required by the two tribunals in question for the purpose of the performance of their functions have been disclosed to them by the authorised officer under directions issued by me or my pre<Col N="2194"/>decessor. The authorised officer is providing follow-up assistance and information, as directed, to the tribunal that has requested it. All information, books and documents required by the three other authorities for the purpose of the performance of their functions have been disclosed to them by the authorised officer, as directed. This is being followed up by the provision of appropriate assistance and co-operation. Some recently received documentary material is being considered by the authorised officer with a view to disclosure, if appropriate, to relevant authorities.</P>
        <P>My objective in directing the authorised officer to provide all relevant information and appropriate assistance to the authorities in question was to facilitate the earliest possible pursuit by them of matters which may require action by them. I was concerned about the length of time which had elapsed since the initiation of the examinations in January 1998. I was particularly concerned that any further delay could put at risk the possibility of achieving results from the examinations, such as the investigation and prosecution of offences, the collection of taxes owed to the State and the investigation of matters by tribunals.</P>
        <P>Section 19 of the Companies Act 1990 provides for a preliminary examination &mdash; the procuring and inspection of a company&rsquo;s books and documents and the obtaining of explanations &mdash; but it does not involve final or conclusive determinations. A section 19 examination may lead to more substantive action, such as the investigation or prosecution of certain specified offences by relevant authorities or the provision of assistance to any of the bodies mentioned in section 21 of the Act, including tribunals of inquiry, in the performance of their functions. There is no statutory requirement for the making of a report on foot of a section 19 examination. Formal reports have not been completed in respect of the present three examinations.</P>
        <P>However, I have directed the authorised officer to give the relevant authorities, in addition to the information already disclosed, whatever further information and assistance they require, in whatever form. I am satisfied that the measures I have taken in respect of the examinations have ensured that any wrongdoing suggested by the investigative work of the authorised officer has been brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities for such action as they think fit.</P>

	<P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment&rsquo;s labour inspectorate is responsible for monitoring the employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. As statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in the same way that they apply to native Irish workers, the inspectorate operates without any regard to worker nationality.</P>
        <P>Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment. If evidence of non-compliance with employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Employment regulation orders govern the wages and employment conditions of workers who are employed in the mushroom industry, unless they are covered by the terms of a registered employment agreement in line with to the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004.</P>
        <P>The inspectorate has been in contact with the individuals who carried out work at the premises over a number of months and several statements have been recorded. The inspectorate is clarifying the nature of the employer-employee relationship that may exist between the owner or operator of the facility and the individuals in question. The complex issues which arise in this case may be compounded to some extent because the current operator may not be resident in the State. The inspectorate is actively pursuing the case and will focus on trying to secure appropriate redress for the people concerned after the facts have been satisfactorily established.</P>

	<P>The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act 1977 makes statutory provision for employee representation at board level in certain State owned companies. The purpose of the Act is to provide for the representation of workers at board level in certain enterprises listed in the Act, by means of the election of employees from among the workforce for appointment to the boards. Candidates for election have to be nominated by a trade union or another body that is recognised for collective bargaining purposes within the company.</P>
        <P>There have been a number of developments in employee involvement since the worker participation legislation was enacted. The section of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 dealing with collective redundancies and the transfer of undertakings regulations require employers to inform and consult workers and their representatives about forthcoming collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings.</P>
        <P>The Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Act 1996 provides for provision of information and consultation of employees by means of works councils on transnational issues in Community-scale undertakings and groups of undertakings.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ireland is making good progress in putting in place the required policy framework to develop as a knowledge-based economy. It continues to face the fundamental challenge of moving from an investment-driven economy, which has brought tremendous benefits in terms of jobs and increased living standards over recent decades, to developing an innovation and knowledge-based economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s strategy to progress towards a knowledge-based economy and society involves investing in the people and ensuring they have the skills they require to live and work in the global knowledge economy. It needs to ensure that Irish enterprises have the absorptive capacity to turn knowledge into competitive products and services, develop the capabilities to undertake research and development work in-house and to link effectively with the generators of new knowledge in the higher education sector in Ireland and internationally.</P>
        <P>I will shortly bring to the Cabinet a proposal for a new science, technology and innovation strategy, to cover the years between 2006 and 2013. The strategy will set out ambitious but necessary goals and actions to develop Ireland&rsquo;s knowledge economy. This country needs to accelerate its rate of human capital development, to bring about a transformation in the quality and quantity of research undertaken by enterprises, directly and in co-operation with third level institutions, and to develop its reputation as one of the most attractive locations for leading researchers to live and work and for knowledge intensive enterprises to prosper. The forthcoming strategy will contribute significantly to achieving the goals I have mentioned.</P>
        <P>The objective of the strategy is to make a quantum leap forward in research and development and to move Ireland from an impressive latecomer to an acknowledged leader in this critical area. Success will be marked by demonstrable <Col N="2199"/>achievements in a number of areas, including increased participation in the sciences by young people, increased numbers with advanced qualifications in science and engineering, enhanced contribution of research to economic and social development, increased output of economically relevant knowledge, enhanced productivity and an established profile for Ireland. The investment proposed in the strategy is in addition to the &euro;1.2 billion announced by the Government in last December&rsquo;s budget to develop fourth level education in Ireland.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Finance is responsible for the Government&rsquo;s policy on the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for the Government&rsquo;s policy in the wider public service. The Government&rsquo;s target that 3% of those employed in the Civil Service should be people with disabilities is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>While it is important that there are targets in the Government&rsquo;s policy, targets alone are not enough and must be supported by real and practical measures. The Department of Finance commissioned Goodbody Economic Consultants to review independently and in some detail the operation of the policy in the Civil Service. A detailed study of a number of Departments, carried out as part of that research, showed that 7% of existing Civil Service staff have disabilities, which is broadly in line with the findings of similar surveys in other countries.</P>
        <P>The Government has examined its policy in detail in light of the research and the consultants&rsquo; recommendations. It is important to emphasise the need to continue to recruit people with disabilities to work in the Civil Service and to ensure that proper supports are in place for all staff with disabilities. The Department of Finance and the Public Appointments Service are considering the development of a recruitment programme to maintain work opportunities for people with disabilities in the Civil Service. Work is under way, in conjunction with the Civil Service unions, on developing a new and detailed code of practice and a more effective approach to monitoring staff with disabilities.</P>
        <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment&rsquo;s disability liaison officer partici<Col N="2200"/>pates in the disability officers&rsquo; network, which was established to share information between Departments. I understand that the Department of Finance&rsquo;s disability advisory officer is preparing a new code of practice and providing advice for Departments and offices.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A fundamental review of the role and functions of the county and city enterprise boards in the development of micro-enterprises was conducted on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment by a group of economic consultants, Fitzpatrick Associates in 2004. The review, which was the most comprehensive examination of the role and functions of the enterprise boards since their inception in 1993, largely endorsed their activities and operations, found that there is justification for continued State support to micro-enterprises and concluded that the enterprise board network can continue to play a useful role in overall national enterprise development policy.</P>
        <P>It recommended that, in providing assistance to micro-enterprises, enterprise boards should focus on economic objectives rather than social or local development objectives, that there should be a renewed focus on the core enterprise mission; that issues of potential deadweight, displacement and duplication should be more systematically and rigorously addressed, that there should be a move away from direct grant aid to repayable finance and that more soft supports should be provided as an alternative to grant aid. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment continues to work with the enterprise boards on the reorientation of their focus in line with the recommendations.</P>
        <P>The small business forum, which I established last summer, is due to report back to me in the near future. The forum was asked to consider in broad terms the current environment for conducting small business in Ireland and to advise on the adequacy and appropriateness of the public policy responses, including the interventions by the enterprise development agencies, in that context. I look forward to learning of the conclusions of the forum in this regard.</P>

	<P>The domiciliary care allowance, which was introduced in 1973 under circular 24/73, is payable under section 61 of the Health Act 1970. It is a monthly allowance that is administered by the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department of Health and Children. In 1999, the Department of Social and Family Affairs introduced the respite care grant for recipients of the carer&rsquo;s allowance. In 2000, the respite care grant was extended to beneficiaries of the domiciliary care allowance. The respite care grant is paid by the Health Service Executive to persons receiving domiciliary care allowance and by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to persons receiving carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit, or carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit as well as domiciliary care allowance.</P>

	<P>The recently enacted Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a podiatrists&rsquo; registration board, which will be responsible for establishing and maintaining a register of podiatrists. Statutory registration will involve podiatrists working in the public health service and in private practice. The Department of Health and Children is working on the establishment of a council of health and social care professionals in advance of the establishment of the podiatrists&rsquo; registration board.</P>
        <P>In advance of the establishment of the council and the registration board, the Health Service Executive and the Department are liaising with the relevant professional bodies on the further development of an assessment system to add podiatrists to a list of practitioners eligible to practice in the public health service. An assessment process carried out by the Department resulted in the addition of a further 81 names to the list in April 2005. The assessment process will be advanced further in the context of improving the supply of podiatry professionals. Discussions are ongoing between the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Science on the proposed establishment of a new school of podiatry to train practitioners to degree level.</P>

	<P>I am fully committed to the national roll out of a cervical screening programme in line with international best practice. The Department of Health and Children has asked the Health Service Executive to prepare a detailed implementation plan for a national programme. It is planned that cervical screening will be managed under a national call or recall programme with effective governance structures which will provide overall leadership and direction in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.</P>
        <P>The programme&rsquo;s elements &mdash; call or recall, smear taking, laboratories and treatment services &mdash; must be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service. Significant preparatory work is under way involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register. This year, the Department has made an additional &euro;9 million available to the HSE for cancer services development, including the continuation of preparations for the roll out. The programme should be rolled out in the primary care setting, subject to affordable and acceptable arrangements being agreed.</P>
        <P>A review of the contractual arrangements for the provision by general practitioners of publicly funded primary care services is being conducted under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. I have requested that the GP elements of a national cervical screening programme be considered at these discussions. Any remuneration arrangements which are agreed must be <Col N="2207"/>capable of delivering a high uptake among women. Payments must be primarily based on reaching acceptable targets.</P>
        <P>I am convinced that we must put in place tailored initiatives to encourage take-up among disadvantaged and difficult to reach groups. I would like the programme to be rolled out as quickly as possible but only when the essential infrastructure, organisation and services which are quality assured and meet international standards are in place.</P>

	<P>The Department of Health and Children and the Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety jointly commissioned a consultancy study on the costs and benefits of the introduction of a dedicated emergency medical services helicopter for the island of Ireland. The study, which was published last year and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, concluded that the introduction of a dedicated inter-hospital air ambulance service would be appropriate in an all-island context. In considering the report, the Northern Ireland Department advised that its priority is further investment to improve the ambulance service on the ground.</P>
        <P>On foot of the report, the Department of Health and Children had detailed discussions with the Department of Defence about the future provision of air ambulance services by the Air Corps. A detailed service level agreement has been prepared and signed arising from the discussions. The signatories to the agreement are the Department of Defence, the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive, the Defence Forces and the Air Corps.</P>
        <P>The agreement sets out the range of services to be provided by the Air Corps, specifically inter-hospital transfer for spinal and serious injury and illness, air transport of neonates requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland, air transport of patients requiring emergency organ transplant in the UK, air transport of organ harvest teams within Ireland and air transport of patients from offshore islands to mainland hospitals when the coastguard service is not available.</P>

Officials in the Department of Health and Children are finalising a package of regulations relevant to medicinal products and when these regulations are in place, all medicinal products, including herbal and homeopathic medicinal products, will be required to be authorised or registered by the Irish Medicines Board and it will be unlawful for any medicinal product not so authorised or registered to be placed on the market.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am conscious that complementary therapy, including homeopathy, is of increasing interest to the public and that more people are now attending complementary therapists. A key concern of mine is protection of the public and a national working group on the regulation of complementary therapists has already reported to the Department of Health and Children with recommendations on future measures for strengthening the regulatory environment for complementary therapists. I will publish the group&rsquo;s report shortly.</P>
        <P>One of the challenges facing the consumer is making informed health care choices. To this end, the Department of Health and Children is launching an information leaflet for the general public offering guidance when choosing to see a complementary therapist, including questions to ask the practitioner before embarking on a treatment. A key message is that patients with conditions which may require medical treatment should see their doctor first and I would strongly advise members of the public to take this message very seriously.</P>
        <P>The Irish Medicines Board has no function in regard to the certification of practitioners of homeopathic medicine. The responsibility of the board relates only to the controls that apply to homeopathic medicinal products, which are required to have certificates of registration granted by the board before being placed on the market.</P>

	<P>Motor neurone disease is a progressive neurological disorder, the cause of which is unknown. There is no specific test and the diagnosis is made by clinical examination. While there is no cure for motor neurone disease at this time, certain treatments can slow the progression of this condition.</P>
        <P>As part of the Estimates for health services in 2006, additional funding of &euro;3 million was allocated specifically for the further development of neurology and neurophysiology services. This funding was provided to allow the Health Service Executive to further progress the implementation of the recommendations made by the former Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al in respect of these services. The Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al report, which has been published, recommended significant enhancement of services, including the appointment of additional consultants. While reaching the full complement of consultant posts as recommended will take some time, major improvements in patient care can be achieved in the shorter term through a combination of additional consultant posts and the appointment of a number of clinical nurse specialists and allied health professionals.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children is advised by the executive that the development of three new neurology units will commence during 2006, one in the mid-west, one in the north west and one in the south east, with the appointment of multidisciplinary teams comprising consultant neurologists and support staff.</P>

	<P>While issues relating to school services, including school transport services, are appropriate to the Minister for Education and Science, the Deputy may be aware of the recently announced National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 which will provide a proactive response to the development of quality child care supports and services, including services for school age child care. The programme is being implemented by the Department of Health and Children through the newly established office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children, OMC, under my auspices. The OMC will also be responsible for implementing the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, EOCP, which is set to continue until the end of 2007.</P>
        <P>The need to support the further development of child care services for children of school-going age, including before and after school hours and out of school terms, is an important objective of both the EOCP and the new national child care investment Programme. The issue was examined in detail by a working group of the national child care co-ordinating committee, set up under the EOCP, and resulted in the publication in June 2005 of the report, School Age Childcare in Ireland. The report made a number of recommendations for the development of school age child care to support the child care needs of parents, including the use of school premises, where appropriate, as a location to develop a quality school age child care service, as well as laying down guidelines for the delivery of a quality service. It is hoped that its publication and promotion at local level by the city and county child care committees, CCCs, will give greater impetus to the development of these important services.</P>
        <P>Funding is available under the EOCP and the new child care investment programme for the development of child care facilities, including facilities with a specific focus on school age child care. Community/not-for-profit and private sector child care providers may apply for grant assistance of up to &euro;1 million and &euro;100,000 respectively, towards the capital cost of developing a child care service in a catchment area where there is a demonstrated need, and subject to the relevant criteria. Schools, groups or individuals interested in applying for school age child care funding should contact their local CCC. Full contact details for the CCCs are available on the OMC website at<i> www.omc.gov.ie</i>.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) Order 1993 provides a scheme for the refund of VAT paid by farmers on the construction of farm buildings and structures, fencing, drainage and the reclamation of farmland. Refund orders are very much an exception to the general rule, and I have no plans to extend the 1993 refund scheme for farmers to cover farm equipment.</P>
        <P>However, as a group, unregistered farmers are compensated for the VAT borne on their farming inputs in accordance with a special mechanism provided for under the EU sixth VAT directive. The operation of the flat-rate scheme minimises the cost of administration which would be necessary if farmers were obliged to register and reduces the burden of administration on farmers generally in complying with VAT law. The flat-rate scheme provides for a set percentage, known as the flat-rate addition or refund, by which unregistered farmers may increase their prices when selling to VAT registered businesses such as co-operatives, meat factories and so forth. The VAT registered business, in turn, deducts the addition as a normal business input in its periodic VAT return. The current level of the addition is 4.8%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The application of VAT on such charges is governed by the EU law with which Irish VAT law must comply. An ECJ ruling on this issue in 2000 meant that Ireland was required to apply VAT at the standard rate on all existing and future roads and bridges which are subject to tolls. The VAT treatment of tolled facilities was amended in the Finance Act 2001 to take account of the court judgment. Toll charges are therefore subject to the standard VAT rate of 21%.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to provide a breakdown of VAT collected in 2005 from each tolling facility in the State. The VAT collected on all toll toads and bridges in 2005 is estimated at approximately &euro;13 million.</P>

        <P>Apart from incapacitated children, the tax code does not provide tax relief in respect of the maintenance of children.

        <P>It is certainly the case that manufacturing firms in the more traditional sectors have, in recent years, operated against a backdrop of significantly declining external demand, downward price pressure and an increasingly competitive international environment, together with upward pressure on costs and the strengthening of the euro against our key trading partners&rsquo; currencies. To counterbalance the threat from lower-wage competitor economies, our policy is to encourage a move to higher levels of productivity and value-added products and services in sectors where we have or can develop a competitive advantage. While manufacturing will continue to play a key role in the economy, Ireland will also make a transition towards more service-orientated activities, as is the case with all developed countries.</P>
        <P>One of my Department&rsquo;s principal tasks is to ensure that Ireland continues to be an attractive place to do business and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain. In that regard, we have made significant efforts to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions and to promote new areas of competitive advantage, such as by developing our research and development base. Our priority remains the creation of sustainable employment driven by companies with higher profitability that are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy, consequently <Col N="2219"/>being less likely to move on the basis of simple cost influences.</P>
        <P>To assist the drive towards competitiveness and increased productivity, the enterprise development agencies are working with companies: to provide mentoring and developmental supports; to enhance management capabilities and critical workforce skills; to support the creation and implementation of strategies for market entry, development and growth; to build productivity; and to provide support for innovation and research and development.</P>
        <P>We will also continue to pursue labour market policies to promote lifelong learning and upskilling as a means of enhancing labour market flexibility and, where necessary, ensure that appropriate training supports are provided for workers in sectors that are no longer competitive to help them find alternative employment. Moderation of the rate of growth in operating costs is also necessary to ensure that our costs remain in line with those of other high-cost locations and that cost increases do not negate or overshadow the effect on competitiveness of productivity growth.</P>
        <P>While the changing nature of our economy has seen some losses, in contrast, the new jobs created in the economic development agencies&rsquo; client companies in the last few years are heavily concentrated in high value-added, knowledge based companies that offer greater security in the face of intense international competition.</P>

        <P>The county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, provide support to micro-enterprises with ten employees or fewer. The function of the CEBs is to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity at local level.

        <P>All the CEBs operate to the same criteria regarding the assistance that they can offer, that is, they can support the establishment or development of new and existing enterprises by individuals, firms and community groups, provided that the projects, which should generally be in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector, have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and over time may develop into strong exporting entities. In that regard, therefore, funding is unlikely to be available towards the costs of refurbishing a bar and restaurant.</P>

	<P>Legislation to increase statutory redundancy payments was enacted by means of the Redundancy Payments Act 2003. This increased the level of redundancy payments from a half a week&rsquo;s pay per year of service under the age of 41 and one week&rsquo;s pay per year of service over the age of 41, plus one bonus week, to two week&rsquo;s pay per year of service, plus a bonus week. This increase resulted from the Sustaining Progress agreement between the social partners. S.I. 695 of 2004 increased the ceiling on reckonable earnings <Col N="2222"/>used in calculating statutory redundancy payments from &euro;507.90 per week to &euro;600 per week from 1 January 2005. This represents an increase of 20% in the ceiling and follows from the recommendations contained in the report of the redundancy review group published in 2002 and from the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress. In light of the foregoing, there are no plans to increase further the level of statutory redundancy payments in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>Statutory redundancy has been paid to the workers in the factory named by the Deputy and a 60% rebate was paid to the company last December. <i>Ex gratia</i> payments are a matter of negotiation between the company concerned and the workers, represented in this case by SIPTU.

	<P>Under the industrial development Acts, support for job creation and investment on a regional or local basis comes within the remit of the industrial development agencies and I am precluded from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over another.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is the agency charged with the attraction of foreign investment, FDI, to this country. As part of its strategy to attract FDI to Dublin, IDA Ireland works with its existing client base in Dublin to encourage them to expand and diversify into higher value added goods and services. The agency also provides modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure to potential clients.</P>
        <P>Under existing EU regional aid guidelines, RAGs, IDA clients investing in the Dublin region can receive grant assistance up to a maximum of 17.5% of eligible expenditure. Overall, the region has now attained sufficient critical mass in terms of population, its skills base, infrastructure offering, enterprise base and economic activity that it can attract and sustain business investment independent of grant support. As a result, IDA&rsquo;s policy is to utilise grant support in the Dublin region on a selective and exceptional basis.</P>
        <P>In 2005 there were a total of 68 first-time site visits to Dublin, while in the same period, four additional IDA supported companies announced the creation of over 650 jobs in the following areas, Swords, Hartford Financial Group and Palm Global Operation, Eastpoint, Yahoo, and Blanchardstown, Qlogic.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland, which is the agency with primary responsibility for the promotion of indigenous industry, works closely with third level colleges in encouraging the commercialisation of research. The agency has supported the development of business incubation space in Dublin City University, Blanchardstown Institute of Technology and in the National College of Ireland. Under the community enterprise centres schemes, Enterprise Ireland supported centres in Coolock, Darndale and in the north city centre.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005, Enterprise Ireland has approved over &euro;33 million and made payments of over &euro;27 million in support of development projects throughout the region. Figures from the 2005 Forf&aacute;s employment survey indicate that at the end of 2005, there were 4,033 people employed in 196 Enterprise Ireland client companies in Fingal and 23,508 people in 1,048 client companies in Dublin city.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During 2005, the Fingal County Enterprise Board and the Dublin City Enterprise Board paid out just over &euro;1 million in grant assistance. In 2005 there was a total net increase in enterprise <Col N="2224"/>board-assisted employment of 212 jobs in the area covered by both boards.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that the strategies and policies being pursued by development agencies are producing real and sustainable results for the people of north Dublin in terms of additional investments and jobs and I am confident that this will continue to be the case into the future.</P>

The national markets in which oil companies operate are no exception. Should any oil or fuel company decide to exit the market, I expect that there would be a high level of interest in the business being sold and many suitable prospective bidders. However, there is nothing the Government or anyone else can do to force incumbents to stay in a market. It is the right of any individual or corporation to sell its business and exit the market if it so wishes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124, 126, 127, 129, 130 and 132 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The National Competitiveness Council through its work on competitiveness benchmarking highlights where the economy is strong in competitiveness terms but also warns us of emerging or potential challenges. I give very careful consideration to the council&rsquo;s annual analyses when they are published. These reports provide a valuable input to the essential formation of policies necessary to encourage and support enterprise development.</P>
        <P><?oasys _ic14- ?>Since the beginning of 2006, Amgen, the largest biotechnology company in the world, announced it has chosen Ireland in which to invest $1 billion and create 1,100 jobs by 2010. Vesta Corporation, a leader in virtual commerce solutions, will establish a European operations centre in Dundalk. Georgia Tech Research Institute will set up an applied industry research institute in Athlone and Actel will set up a European processor centre in Dublin. These are just a sample of high technology investments that have been attracted to Ireland because of our developing competitive strengths in technology, science infrastructure and knowledge confident and skilled employees.</P>
        <P>Decisions by global businesses to make investments of this importance and scale are not made in favour of uncompetitive and lowly rated locations. In global terms we have not lost but are sharpening our competitive edge in terms of technological and innovation advantage &mdash; the very attributes that will sustain enterprise as the impact of globalisation becomes more influential and the severity of competition more intense. We are making impressive progress in winning significant employment from the outsourcing and relocation decisions of foreign investors. These investments, as well as the 65 high potential start-ups that were supported by Enterprise Ireland last year, are just some of the capital Ireland is generating to seed future growth.</P>
        <P>As further evidence of our commitment to assisting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s knowledge economy, overall Government investment in research and development increased fivefold, from &euro;500 million between 1994 and 1999, to &euro;2.5 billion between 2000 and 2006. My Depart<Col N="2226"/>ment is using some of these funds to aggressively support Science Foundation Ireland in its programme to build centres for science, engineering and technology. These connect world class researchers with industry through grants worth as much as &euro;20 million over five years. These are targeted investments in areas with the most likely scientific and economic impact. I believe our aim to invest in performance and excellence is already paying off by repositioning Ireland at the sharp end of what global companies are looking for when making decisions about complex, high value investments.</P>
        <P>To help indigenous firms tackle technological vulnerability that can lead to job losses, the enterprise development agencies under my Department&rsquo;s aegis have developed a range of programmes to encourage more firms to innovate and undertake research and development that will transform their ability to compete. This is critical for Irish small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs, because virtually all companies regardless of size now have to compete in some form of global marketplace. For example, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s productivity improvement fund helps companies access new capital equipment, acquire strategic new technologies or fund training and management development initiatives. Our aim is to drive productivity performance across indigenous companies so they not only survive the globalisation process but have the ability to profit from opportunities which globalisation offers.</P>
        <P>Our future is inextricably linked to succeeding as a knowledge economy. Knowledge companies develop by collaboration and by building networks and clusters for mutual benefit. In response to the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group, I have authorised Enterprise Ireland to explore how these could be best utilised in an Irish context by promoting pilot industry-led networks with the aim of meeting either national economic or joint company development objectives. This is an exciting project for enterprise to work with my Department&rsquo;s agencies to imagine the future and help shape it.</P>
        <P>These policies are designed to improve national competitiveness, sustain employment in Ireland and limit the attractiveness of lower cost economies for job relocation. It is not possible to identify the number of jobs that have relocated from Ireland over the past five years to low cost economies nor is it feasible to identify the myriad business reasons companies might have for making this decision. Furthermore, the life cycle of companies influences the ebb and flow of employment and investment and relocation is just one factor in the many enterprise related issues that determines employment levels. Nevertheless, the Government and I are determined that Ireland will be a competitive economy for the clever, research <Col N="2227"/>driven innovations that will be demanded by tomorrow&rsquo;s industrial and personal consumer markets.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>

	<P>Sustaining Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness continues to be a key priority for the Government. It is monitored in particular through the work and advice of the National Competitiveness Council. The Government&rsquo;s response is manifested in numerous ways, most recently as evidenced by the introduction of a non-inflationary budget for the third consecutive year. This displays the Government&rsquo;s prudent fiscal management of the economy at a time of ever increasing global competitiveness pressures.</P>
        <P>Competition is the best way to ensure we have a competitive cost base. In my Department, I have assigned more resources and given more powers to the Competition Authority. I have abolished the groceries order and strengthened competition legislation to deliver more competition and help create a more cost-effective base for doing business from Ireland.</P>
        <P>Developed economies usually have higher costs than less developed regions and Ireland is no exception. While our cost base may be relatively higher than other economies, our competitiveness in skills, education, knowledge infrastructure and an ambitious workforce sets us apart from our competitors. This makes our economy an attractive location for investment and from which to do business globally. The consistent flows of high quality, sophisticated and research orientated investments that locate here is tangible evidence we are at the sharp edge of competitiveness in the products and services that will be needed by tomorrow&rsquo;s industrial and consumer markets.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, with global competition becoming more pressing and influential, enterprise needs to place a greater emphasis on productivity improvement. To help indigenous firms in this area Enterprise Ireland is running a productivity improvement fund that will help firms access new technology or initiate training and management development projects.</P>
        <P>Finally, I have no doubt that the competitiveness and business costs imperative will be a critical overarching issue that must be taken into account by the various stakeholders in the social partnership discussions.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 133 together.</P>
        <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply I made to similar questions put by him on 7 February 2006. As a small open market economy, exporting over 90% of its GDP, Ireland is hugely dependent on the ability of its exporters to succeed in world markets and has, as a result, fully embraced the global economy. Figures released this week by the Central Statistics Office show that Irish exports for 2005 increased by 5% on 2004 export figures. This compares with a 2% increase for Irish exports between 2003 and 2004. I am heartened by the continuous improvement in our export position against a background of continuing low growth rates in the European and US economies over the past year.</P>
        <P>The Government is strongly supportive of Irish exporting firms seeking to increase their level of exports on world markets and in that regard my Department, through its agency, Enterprise Ireland, is active both domestically at the developmental level and through promotional activities carried out from a range of locations abroad, in assisting Irish indigenous companies to find new markets for their products and to increase their existing level of market share.</P>
        <P>In this, Enterprise Ireland is ably assisted by Irish embassies abroad whose staff work closely with the agency in facilitating the development of export markets for Irish exporting companies. Close co-ordination is also maintained with other export promotion organisations, such as Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and non-governmental bodies such as the Irish Exporters&rsquo; Association and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland. In addition, both I and my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, have been active in leading trade missions, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, to the new member states and Asia, with a view to increasing the share of exports by Irish companies to these countries.</P>
        <P>While the focus of our efforts has in recent years been towards developing and expanding markets in northern Europe and the USA and, consequently, reducing our dependence on the UK export market, we have also begun to explore the potential for increasing our exports to Asia and the Far East. In that context the Taoiseach last year launched the second phase of the Asia <Col N="2229"/>Strategy 2005-2009, following his successful visit to China. The Asia strategy contains a number of export oriented targets and objectives, which is overseen by a committee representative of public and private sector interests, with a view to exploiting fully the potential for Irish companies to develop new markets in Asia over the coming years.</P>
        <P>My Department and its agencies will continue to work with other organisations engaged in export promotion, with a view to increasing the overall level of Irish exports in existing markets and creating new markets for Irish exporting firms.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>if he is satisfied that sufficient action has been taken to address the issue of jobs lost in County Kildare over the past three years to other economies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Provisional figures suggest that job losses in companies supported by the enterprise development agencies which have occurred during the past three years have been offset by job gains. Overall permanent employment in agency supported firms in County Kildare has increased from 15,293 in 2003 to 16,070 in 2005. No data are available to indicate what impact relocation to other economies may have had on employment levels in the county.</P>
        <P>Over the past five years, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s focused strategy for Kildare has been to promote the county as part of an integrated east region with access to a population base of 1.5 million people. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for County Kildare is to: progress the development of a knowledge economy; encourage increased co-operation between foreign direct investment companies and third level institutions in the county; work with the existing client base in the county to expand its presence; and provide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure work with local authorities and relevant infrastructure providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure to the county.</P>
        <P>Kildare has in recent years attracted some world class manufacturing companies such as Intel, Braun Oral B and Hewlett Packard. IDA Ireland is also working to attract the international services, software, financial services and pharmaceuticals sectors and in recent months IFS, a financial services company, has established a facility in Naas. To support this strategy IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions in the county, in developing the skill sets necessary <Col N="2230"/>to attract high value added employment to the county. IDA Ireland is also working with F&Aacute;S to provide guidance in developing the skill set needed by those already in the workforce who are interested in upskilling.</P>
        <P>In line with the strategy currently being pursued by the enterprise development agencies, new jobs are being created by established firms in the county. Green Isle Foods, for example, announced a major expansion in 2005 at its plant in Naas, generating 130 new jobs. The services sector has also continued to grow and is now the most rapidly growing sector of the economy in County Kildare.</P>
        <P>County Kildare has benefited from significant investment in recent years in technological infrastructure in NUI Maynooth. This will be the key to ensuring that the county is an attractive location for knowledge based industry in future years. Since 2002, Enterprise Ireland has approved over &euro;3.3 million to support innovation partnerships between NUI Maynooth and industry. In addition to providing direct financial assistance, Kildare CEB also provides indirect assistance such as advice, mentoring and a broad range of training programmes for prospective entrants or established participants in the micro-enterprise sector.</P>
        <P>Improvements to physical infrastructure facilities, required to attract today&rsquo;s FDI, include the development of Millennium Park, Naas. The park has three modern 40,000 sq. ft. advance office buildings, which are now available for marketing to inward investors.</P>
        <P>Enterprise in Kildare encompasses a broad range of activities in a number of important sectors. I am confident that the strategies and policies of the enterprise development agencies will continue to meet both the needs of businesses that generate and sustain high quality employment opportunities and, as a consequence, the needs of society in terms of those opportunities in Kildare.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is fully seized of the need for oversight and public transparency in the area of export licensing of military and dual use <Col N="2231"/>goods. This issue was addressed in the 2004 Forf&aacute;s review of Ireland&rsquo;s export controls, which recommended that an annual report be laid before the Oireachtas on the licensing and export of military and dual use goods. The new export control legislation being prepared by my Department will provide for such reports and it is my intention to present the first such report, in respect of licensing activity in 2006, in 2007.</P>
        <P>The export licensing pages of the website are updated on a regular basis, for example, to reflect changes in the lists of controlled goods. However, we ceased publication of licence numbers because they did not reflect the volume of military goods exported and, therefore, gave a misleading impression of such exports. It is anticipated that a more substantive revision of the website will be undertaken in the next few months, in the context of the imminent introduction of the on-line electronic licensing application system, with a view to better meeting the information needs of industry and other stakeholders.</P>

	<P>Missionaries who have made sufficient social insurance contributions can qualify for an old age contributory pension. Contributory pensions are payable abroad and so missionaries who qualify and who chose to settle overseas can receive a payment. Non-contributory pensions are only payable where a person is resident in this country. Accordingly, missionaries who return here and who satisfy the habitual residence condition and a means test can qualify for a pension.</P><Col N="2232"/>
        <P>Officials of my Department made a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in November 2005 on pensions for missionaries. Following the presentation, a working group, which includes my Department, was established to examine issues relating to social protection coverage for missionaries, notably relating to pension coverage. The question of providing pensions for missionaries who retire abroad will be considered in the light of the conclusions of the working group.</P>

	<P>An application for family income supplement, FIS, was received by my Department from the person concerned on 8 February 2006. One of the principal conditions for receipt of FIS is that a person must work at least 19 hours per week or 38 weeks per fortnight. Based on the information available to my Department, the person concerned was not considered to be in full-time remunerative employment, as prescribed in regulations. Accordingly, her claim was disallowed and she was advised of this decision and of her right to appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>

It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person&rsquo;s pension. People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.</P><Col N="2233"/>
        <P>There have been a number of requests and inquiries relating to the extension of entitlement to free travel in Ireland to Irish-born people living outside Ireland, or to those in receipt of pensions from my Department, particularly in the UK when they return to Ireland for a visit. I am continuing to explore all aspects of an approach, subject to clarification of legal advice. I will continue to review the operation of the free travel scheme with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.</P>

Accordingly new trucks being registered and entered into service here on or after 1 October 2006 must, <i>inter alia,</i> meet the emission limits of row B1.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, there is a proposal for an EU regulation concerning the rights of persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air. The proposed regulation will mean, among other things, that persons with reduced mobility will have strengthened rights when travelling by air, that they may not be discriminated against in any way and that they cannot be refused a reservation or embarkation on grounds of reduced mobility except in certain circumstances where there may be a safety issue. Furthermore, the proposal will mean that assistance must be given to persons with reduced mobility in airports and when on aircraft, free of charge. Persons with reduced mobility will have to give advance notice of their needs to airlines and airports when making their reservation, and airlines and tour operators must determine whether there is a justified safety reason which would prevent such persons being accommodated on the flights concerned before refusing any booking.</P>
        <P>Member states will be required to designate a body responsible for enforcing the regulations and receiving complaints. They must also lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the regulations. Ireland has strongly supported this proposal and will designate an enforcement body when required.</P>
        <P>The text of the proposal has been substantially agreed, with legal and linguistic issues to be resolved by the experts of the Council and the Parliament. It is hoped that it will be formally <Col N="2240"/>agreed at Council in May. Following adoption of the proposal at European level member states will have to transpose the regulation into domestic law. In Ireland this will probably be done by means of statutory instrument.</P>
        <P>In respect of national legislation, the Disability Act 2005 is comprehensive and crosscutting legislation designed to support and underpin the participation of persons with disabilities in everyday life. The emphasis of the Act is to develop services and to put in place the requisite infrastructure in a systematic way. The Act puts on a statutory footing a wide variety of positive action measures to improve fundamentally the position of persons with disabilities in Irish society.</P>
        <P>Under section 34 of the Disability Act 2005, the Minister for Transport is required to draw up a sectoral plan covering accessible transport, including transport by air. An outline sectoral plan was published in September 2004 and was the subject of a public consultation process. A second edition of this plan is currently being prepared, which will also be the subject of a consultation process. When finalised the departmental sectoral plan will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas by 29 July 2006 as required by the Disability Act 2005.</P>

	<P>Road traffic and parking regulations made in 1997 under section 35 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 provide that only vehicles in which a disabled person&rsquo;s parking permit is displayed may stop or park in a disabled person&rsquo;s parking bay provided the vehicle is being used for the convenience of the person to whom the permit was issued. The provisions contained in the traffic and parking regulations relating to the use of disabled persons&rsquo; parking bays apply in respect of the use of public roads only.</P>
        <P>The 1997 regulations also provide that in areas where time restricted parking is in operation by the road authority, vehicles that display a disabled persons parking permit are not subject to those time restrictions.</P>
        <P>Section 36 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 provides that road authorities may make by-laws for the control and regulation of the parking of vehicles at specified places on public roads within their functional area and shall provide for payment of fees in respect of such parking. The by-laws may provide for the exemption of any specified classes of vehicles from the payment of fees in respect of parking, the conditions under which <Col N="2241"/>specified classes of vehicles may be so exempted and the identification of exempted vehicles fees. The making of such by-laws is a reserved function of the elected members of the local authority. It is a matter, therefore, for each individual road authority to determine whether vehicles displaying a disabled persons parking permit should be exempt from parking fees in areas where a paid parking scheme is in operation.</P>
        <P>Section 101 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 provides that local authorities may make by-laws in respect of the use of car parks they provide. The determination of the provisions, including payment of parking fees, in such by-laws is a matter for the elected members of the local authority. The operational rules applicable to parking in non-local authority car parks are matters for the private owner or management interests concerned.</P>

	<P>I have no proposals to issue such a policy direction to the Commission for Taxi Regulation. The Commission for Taxi Regulation is the independent body responsible for the development and maintenance of a new regulatory framework for the control and operation of small public service vehicles, including taxis, and their drivers, under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.</P>
        <P>In 2005, the commission initiated a national review to assess the extent and quality of services currently provided by small public service vehicles and subsequently published the document, Roadmap &mdash; Towards a new national code of regulation for taxis, hackneys and limousines in Ireland, which sets out the areas where change is required along with the commission&rsquo;s proposed solutions. Submissions were invited on the roadmap by 26 September 2005, following which the preparation of new regulations commenced. The commission has also taken over the power to declare or alter taximeter areas and to fix maximum taxi fares from local authorities and invited submissions on consultation paper No. 3, Taximeter Areas and Taxi Fares, by 19 December 2005.</P>
        <P>I understand that the commission, prior to making its recent determination on taxi fares and other related taxi matters, received over 500 submissions as part of the various consultation processes. In addition, numerous meetings took place with a broad range of stakeholders and interested parties, including the advisory council to the Commission for Taxi Regulation.</P>

        <P>The following offences all carry a prescribed fine of &euro;19: contravening a parking by-law made by a road authority; contravening a regulation prohibiting or restricting the parking of a mechanically propelled vehicle; contravening a car park by-law made by a road authority; breach of the prohibition on a street service vehicle from standing for hire at a place in the area in respect of which the by-law or rule is made other than an appointed stand; the stopping or parking of an omnibus at a stopping place or stand; and illegal parking by vehicles at a bus stopping place or stand.</P>

Following processing of her application, she was notified on 5 March 2005 that her inheritance application was successful and advised of the need to procure a herd number in her own name to facilitate the transfer of entitlements and payment of the single payment.

        <Quest>the number of single males in residence at Kiltimagh, County Mayo, while awaiting asylum seeker decisions; the reason the reception and integration agency of his Department has exceeded its initial proposal of ten single males at this location; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[11402/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The reception and integration agency, RIA, is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers. In replies to recent parliamentary questions I have outlined, in detail, current trends in asylum seeker numbers such as a fall in the number of new applications together with a fall in the number of families seeking asylum, and the consequent implications for the RIA. Accommodation provision is a demand led process driven by factors over which the RIA has no control and it is obliged to adjust its accommodation portfolio to reflect current demands. It is also obliged to use the accommodation at its disposal in the most effective way and provide the best value for money for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>In the case of the Kiltimagh centre, the RIA considered it to be suitable for possible reclassification from family to single person accommodation. As part of the reclassification of this centre, the RIA intended to relocate its families to other centres where they could benefit from special facilities for children and young people, including preschool facilities. For several reasons, the RIA has agreed that the families with school-going children who currently reside at the centre should be allowed to remain there at least until the end of the current school year.</P>
        <P>The RIA has to date allocated a total of 17 male asylum seekers to the centre. The RIA undertook to place ten male asylum seekers in the annexe to the building and to monitor the arrangements on an ongoing basis. Having done so, a small number of additional placements were then made. Placements at this centre, as at any other centre, are determined by demand for beds. This demand is, in turn, determined by several factors, including the profile of asylum seekers <Col N="2247"/>entering the State, families, single persons, nationality, gender, age and so forth, the movement of asylum seekers from and to RIA accommodation and bed-space availability across the accommodation portfolio. The RIA will continue to monitor the arrangements in Kiltimagh.</P>
        <P>The centre at Kiltimagh has operated as an accommodation centre since December 2003 and it has been well run, without incident, by its owners and their staff throughout this time. The RIA is obliged to accommodate all asylum seekers and, in doing so, it cannot discriminate on the basis of the sex of the person seeking asylum. The RIA has in its accommodation portfolio 16 male-only centres and no significant issues have arisen at these locations. Single male centres have, in the past, operated in small villages where residents of the centres helped in a voluntary capacity with various community activities such as the annual clean up for Tidy Towns competitions.</P>
        <P>The RIA is aware of the concerns and fears expressed by some residents in the town, through various fora, about the placement of male asylum seekers in the centre. The RIA appreciates the degree of anxiety or unease that some local residents may feel if a centre profile is changed from women, children and small babies to single persons. It is the RIA&rsquo;s experience that, over time, such feelings dissipate as local residents come to know the individuals concerned and as their practical experience of the centre operation allays their initial concerns.</P>

        <P>With regard to the application for capital grant assistance under the equal opportunities child care programme, I understand the community based group in question submitted an application <Col N="2248"/>to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform some time ago. Each application undergoes a thorough assessment by Pobal, formerly ADM Limited, which is engaged to administer the day-to-day operation of the programme, to ensure that it meets the programme&rsquo;s funding criteria. In addition, large scale projects such as the capital development proposed in this instance, undergo an intensive assessment process by an external building consultant.</P>
        <P>I understand the application is in the final stages of the appraisal process, following which a decision will be made on funding. The group will be informed of the outcome in due course.</P>

	<P>The Morris tribunal was established by instrument of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, made on 24 April 2002, S.I. 175 of 2002. Its wording reflects the wording of a resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 28 March 2002 to the effect that ten definite matters &mdash; numbered items (<i>a</i>) <Col N="2250"/>to (<i>j</i>) &mdash; of urgent public importance were to be the subject of inquiry.</P>
        <P>The systematic approach adopted by the tribunal has been to progress its work on a modular basis, with each module being related in so far as practicable to individual items numbered (<i>a</i>) to (<i>j</i>) in its terms of reference. The tribunal reported on item (<i>e</i>), managing explosives, on 2 July 2004. It reported on item (<i>a</i>), Peoples&rsquo; extortion calls, and part of item (<i>b</i>), the Barron investigation, on 19 May 2005.</P>
        <P>My understanding is that the tribunal has completed its investigations into three further items, namely, items (<i>d</i>), arrest and detention of Mark McConnell and Michael Peoples, (<i>g</i>), Ardara arson attack, and (<i>i</i>), Burfoot arrests and detentions. I understand that reports on these three elements of its work will be presented to me in the near future.</P>
        <P>On 21 March 2006, counsel to the tribunal read out the opening statement concerning its public hearings on the detention module of its work, which embodies item (<i>f</i>) and the remainder of item (<i>b</i>). The remaining items are: items (<i>c</i>) allegations of harassment of the McBrearty family and their friends and associates; (<i>h</i>) allegations contained in documents received by then Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Howlin; and (<i>j</i>) the effectiveness of the Garda Complaints Board inquiry <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the complaints made by Mr. Frank McBrearty senior.</P>
        <P>I understand that the tribunal currently anticipates that, if all the participants co-operate, it will complete all its work by the summer of 2007.</P>

        <P>Ministerial cars are Garda cars driven by Garda drivers who have completed special advanced driving courses. I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that there are currently 77 garda&iacute; attached to the ministerial pool of which 56 are allocated on a full-time basis as drivers for the ministerial fleet. The remaining 21 garda&iacute; are on a relief panel and cover periods of absences through annual leave and illness.</P>
        <P>These drivers are tasked with providing close personal protection to Government Ministers and other designated protected VIPs, in addition to their driving duties. State cars are available to the users on a 24 hour per day basis.</P>

        <Quest> in the case of a foreign national marrying an Irish citizen and where the marriage fails, the attitude his Department takes to the permission to reside here previously granted to the foreign national; the situation where Irish born children are involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>A non-EEA national who is residing in Ireland on the basis of marriage to an Irish citizen, and whose marriage subsequently fails, will no longer be residing in the State in accordance with the permission granted to them <Col N="2252"/>by my Department. This change of circumstances will necessitate a review of their situation by my Department. If I am satisfied that there is a legitimate basis for the continued residence of the non-EEA party in the State, my Department will grant an appropriate permission.</P>
        <P>In the event that the person in question does not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction, the issue of permission to remain will be considered but only in the context of a ministerial proposal to deport the person concerned. In that circumstance, the person will be notified of the proposal and given an opportunity to make representations about it. If, after consideration of those representations and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, it is decided not to make a deportation order, the person will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis.</P>
        <P>With regard to the situation where Irish born children are involved, the Deputy will be aware that the Supreme Court judgment in Lobe and Osayande, 2003, confirms that the parentage of an Irish citizen child by a non-EEA national does not infer an automatic right of residence in the State. However, the presence of Irish born children in a failed marriage situation will be considered by my Department in the context of any representations made as a result of a proposal to deport from the State.</P>

At my request, Operation Anvil will be extended outside the Dublin metropolitan region during 2006. I also obtained funding to enable Operation Anvil to continue as long as it is deemed necessary in operational policing terms.</P>
        <P>All operational personnel in the Dublin metropolitan region may be employed on Operation Anvil as the need arises. Personnel from the Garda national units are also deployed on the operation as appropriate. The net incremental cost of the operation from its commencement to 21 March 2006 is &euro;11,205,071. This figure includes the cost of overtime, travel and subsistence and other ancillary costs. The table, which shows the statistics for Operation Anvil up to 19 March 2006, indicates that the operation has contributed to encouraging successes across a number of headings.</P>

	<P>When the decision was made to <Col N="2256"/>close Fort Mitchel Prison, all furniture and equipment was examined to identify what could be used in other prisons. Following this, certain items were transferred to other prisons. Other items were then sold locally, which realised approximately &euro;3,000 of which &euro;500 remains outstanding. I understand this was due to an administrative oversight and the Irish Prison Service expects that payment will be made in the next few days.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service engaged the services of CCM Property Services, Midleton, County Cork, to dispose of the remaining equipment at auction. The public auction realised approximately &euro;100,000. The funds have been received and lodged to the Prison Service Vote as appropriations-in-aid in 2005. Items such as built-in units and light fittings remain in Fort Mitchel as it was not economically viable to have them removed and transferred elsewhere. Other fixtures, equipment and stock items which were of no further use to the prison service were donated to charity.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength, all ranks, of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as at 31 December 1997 and 20 March 2006 was 10,702 and 12,445, respectively. This represents an increase of 1,743 or 16.3% in the personnel strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during that period.</P>
        <P>The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P>As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by way of intakes of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first of these intakes commenced training on 9 February 2006. The first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; <Col N="2257"/>under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;ochana Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na inspectorate comprising three persons to be appointed by the Government, one of whom shall be appointed as its chief inspector. The purpose of the inspectorate will be to seek to ensure that the resources of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are used to achieve the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness benchmarked with best police standards. Recruitment of the chief inspector is at an advanced stage and will be followed closely by the appointment of the other two inspectors.</P>
        <P>Following its establishment, I intend to request the inspectorate to carry out an inquiry to identify the required manpower needs of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, having regard to international best practice in policing. This investigation will not only examine the force&rsquo;s requirement for trained police officers, it will also seek to identify the requirement for civilian support staff, for example, scenes of crime investigators, crime analysts, financial, IT and human resource personnel. I will examine the results of the inspectorate&rsquo;s inquiry in due course with a view to ensuring that the resources at the disposal of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are sufficient to enable it to provide an effective policing service.</P>

        <Quest>the number of civilian vacancies within the Garda service; if the public service staffing embargo is preventing these roles from being filled; the number of garda&iacute; spending a large proportion of their working day performing duties arising from these civilian vacancies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There are the equivalent of 42 civilian posts vacant within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This includes some 15 posts at clerical level with the remainder in professional, technical and general services grades. Several of these vacancies arise from worksharing arrangements and the normal time-lags between selection and appointment.</P>
        <P>The Government decision of December 2002 to cap and reduce the numbers in the civil and public service does not impact on the filling of these vacancies. Generally speaking, these are filled through a combination of internal promotion, recruitment from either the Public Appointments Service or from centrally agreed transfer lists in the case of provincial locations. In provincial locations, temporary staff are regularly recruited to make up any attendance shortfalls. As this is an ongoing process, there is a minimal requirement, if any, for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to perform clerical duties in such circumstances.</P><Col N="2258"/>
        <P>I am committed to the ongoing implementation of the civilianisation programme. I am also determined that the additional garda&iacute; being recruited under the historic expansion of the force will be deployed to frontline, visible and effective policing duties.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made on the implementation of the civilianisation programme to date, for example, 113 civilian finance officers have been appointed and are carrying out the district finance officer duties which were hitherto performed by garda&iacute;. In addition, the recent establishment of the Garda information service centre in Castlebar will, when fully operational, allow for the equivalent of up to 300 garda&iacute; to be freed up for frontline outdoor policing duties.</P>

	<P>Road traffic legislation, in particular section 27 of the Road Traffic Act 2004, provides exemptions for the drivers of emergency vehicles from the application of restrictions, requirements and prohibitions imposed under the Road Traffic Acts generally. Such exemptions apply where the safety of a road user is not endangered.</P>
        <P>Bar the exemption provided by section 27, the typical reason for cancellation of a fine on the spot is the absence of sufficient evidence to sustain a prosecution. In the case of parking offences or speeding offences detected on camera, the registered owner was not the actual vehicle owner at the time; non-display of a tax disc, application had been made to the relevant licensing authority for a road fund licence prior to the date of affixation of the notice; an alleged seatbelt offence, the person was the holder of a medical certificate which exempted the person from wearing a seatbelt.</P>
        <P>Statistics are not compiled in such a way as to establish the number of fines on the spot or fixed charge notices cancelled by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. To identify and collate the number cancelled for any particular reason would require an unjustifiable deployment of Garda time and resources.</P>

	<P>Garda&iacute; at roadside checkpoints do not have direct access to the PULSE system. However, the Garda information service centre has been established in Castlebar to centralise the inputting of data onto PULSE. A pilot of the centralisation of the input of data was extended to the entire southern region by the end of February 2006.</P>
        <P>This means that in the pilot area, garda&iacute; no longer have to return to the station to input incident details but are supplied with mobile phones and are required to phone in details of the incidents they investigate to the Garda information service centre from the site of the incident. This service is available to garda&iacute; in both networked and non-networked stations in the pilot area. Where this pilot is not in operation inquiries can also be made to an operator in a control room who has access to PULSE. I am informed by the Garda authorities that PULSE contains vehicle registration and owner details as provided by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>The new ICT strategy for the Garda S&iacute;ochh&aacute;na, which is being finalised at present, recommends the use of mobile technology in the field to provide on-line access to PULSE. As part of the fixed charge processing system, hand-held units have been provided for the capture of fixed charge incident data at the roadside. I am informed by the Garda authorities that a proof of concept to allow garda&iacute; to look up the national driver file using this hand-held technology is being developed.</P>

Before a prosecution may be instituted the person must have failed to pay the fixed charge notice within the statutory period. Statistics are not compiled in such a way as to identify the number of non-residents driving foreign registered vehicles who have been issued with fixed charge notices.</P>

	<P>The persons concerned, a husband and wife, arrived in the State on 25 April 2001 and 30 December 2000 respectively and applied for asylum. Their applications were refused following consideration of their cases by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The persons referred to by the Deputy were informed, by letter dated 16 August 2002, that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of them and afforded them three options under section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of deportation orders or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>Their cases were examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, including consideration of representations for temporary leave to remain in the State lodged on their behalf by their legal representatives. In addition to the 11 factors contained in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, I must also have regard for section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, on the prohibition of <i>refoulement </i>before signing a deportation order. This means in essence that the safety of returning a person to their country of origin, or <i>refoulement </i>as it is referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether to make a deportation order.</P>
        <P>
          <i>Refoulement </i>means that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including the UNHCR, in evaluating, in each individual case, the safety of making returns to Nigeria and other third countries.</P>
        <P>On 11 March 2005, I signed deportation orders in respect of the persons concerned. Notice of the deportation orders was served by registered post requiring the couple to present themselves to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, on Thursday, 7 April 2005, to make arrangements for their deportation from the State. The couple failed to present themselves as required and were thus classified as evading their deportation.</P>
        <P>On 15 March 2005 the couple were arrested and are currently detained in prison pending the making of arrangements for their removal from <Col N="2263"/>the State. Representations have been made to the effect that the wife is suffering from a medical condition. Her legal representatives have been asked to provide up to date medical reports by 31 March 2006. These reports will be considered prior to removal but it should be understood that in the meantime, arrangements for their removal from the State will continue. The enforcement of the deportation orders remains an operational matter for the GNIB.</P>

        <P>The Deputy may recall that I set out a number of areas to be addressed in this engagement, which can be summarised as: whether the content covered on pre-service teacher education programmes has adequately kept pace with the changing demands now facing teachers in our <Col N="2265"/>classrooms; the appropriateness of the current focus on academic studies at primary pre-service teacher education; and the requirement to align the allocation of H.Dip. places more closely to identified needs such as languages, the sciences, Gaeilge and mathematics.

The general allocation for the school referred to by the Deputy equates to 7.5 hours part-time hours per week. I am informed that the school has the services of a fully qualified teacher for these hours and the relevant grants have issued.</P>
        <P>The school made an application for a set-up grant for a new special education teaching post. However, as the school has only part-time hours and not a full-time post, it does not qualify for such a grant. To qualify for a full-time special education post, the school needs a minimum of 22 part-time hours.

	<P>My Department has received correspondence from the school referred to by the Deputy in regard to the appointment of a third mainstream class teacher under developing school criteria.</P>
        <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year. According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management of the school in question, the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2005 was 77 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule, circular 0023/2006, which has issued to all primary schools and is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie,</i> the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006-07 school year will be a principal and two mainstream class teachers. The school will also have a shared learning support-resource teacher based in the school.</P>
        <P>Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools, there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>It is open to the board of management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeal board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in circular 0024/2006, appeal board for mainstream staffing in primary schools, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Hard copies of this circular will issue to primary schools shortly.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that the first meeting of the appeal board will be held in May 2006. Further meetings will be held in July and October 2006. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 12 <Col N="2268"/>May, 24 June and 18 October, respectively.

This school was one of 135 schools invited to participate in the small schools scheme, a devolved scheme for primary school building works that enables the school authorities to extend and refurbish their schools. Devolving funding to school management authorities allows them to have control of their projects, assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction and can also deliver better value for money.</P>
        <P>The decision on whether to participate in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of the build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for the school authority. The management of this school, together with the other schools invited to participate in the devolved scheme, attended an information meeting held by my Department in Tullamore on 20 March 2006. This school raised a number of issues regarding its project which are being addressed at present.</P>
        <P>Schools intending to participate in the devolved scheme have until 31 March to inform my Department of their decision. Should this school decide not to accept the invitation, its project will remain in the mainstream school building programme in line with the project&rsquo;s priority band rating.</P>

	<P>DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, the new action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme, SSP. The process of identifying primary and second level schools for participation in the new school support programme has been completed.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, 840 schools have been invited to participate in the new programme. These comprise 640 primary schools &mdash; 320 urban-town schools and 320 rural schools &mdash; and 200 second level schools. Letters of invitation were issued to all 840 schools in late February with a request to complete and return an acceptance form by 10 March 2006.</P>
        <P>The school to which the Deputy refers is not among the 640 primary schools selected for participation in the school support programme. However, this school is among the schools receiving additional resources under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing concentrated disadvantage and will retain these supports for 2006-07. The efficacy of these supports will be kept under review.</P><Col N="2270"/>
        <P>As well as the provision being made under the new school support programme for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will be provided for other primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed. This support will be based on the results of the new identification process and the arrangements which will apply in this regard will be notified to schools early in the autumn.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism has been put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the school support programme but regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. This mechanism will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The school to which the Deputy refers has requested a review and a review form issued to the school on 7 March 2006. The closing date for receipt of review applications is Friday, 31 March 2006.</P>

        <Quest>the reason a school (details supplied) in Dublin 5 has been designated in band two disadvantage while the school adjoining is in band one despite the latter having a somewhat lower level of children from families with features of disadvantage; and if her attention has been drawn to the fact that as a consequence the school is likely to lose one of its learning support teachers and as a result will have to abandon the three year infant programme, reading, recovery and first steps.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, the new action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme, SSP. The process of identifying primary and second level schools for participation in the new school support programme has been completed.</P>
        <P>This process was managed by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through my Department&rsquo;s regional <Col N="2271"/>offices and the inspectorate. In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried out by the ERC in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The analysis of the survey returns from primary schools by the ERC identified the socioeconomic variables that collectively best predict achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools for participation in the school support programme. The variables involved were: unemployment; local authority accommodation; lone parenthood; Travellers; large families &mdash; five or more children; and pupils eligible for free books.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, 840 schools have been invited to participate in the new school support programme, which comprise 640 primary schools &mdash; 320 urban-town schools and 320 rural schools &mdash; and 200 second level schools. Letters of invitation were issued to all 840 schools in late February with a request to complete and return an acceptance form by 10 March 2006. A completed acceptance form has been received from the school to which the Deputy refers.</P>
        <P>The 320 urban-town primary schools in the school support programme have been categorised into two bands as follows, that is, band 1 includes the first 180 urban-town primary schools identified for inclusion in the programme and band 2 includes the next 140 urban-town primary schools.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism has been put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the school support programme but regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. This mechanism can also address the concerns of primary schools identified for inclusion in band 2 but that regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in band 1.</P>
        <P>The review process will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The school to which the Deputy refers has requested a review and a review form issued to the school on 13 March 2006. The closing date for receipt of review applications is Friday, 31 March 2006.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department will contact the school authority directly to discuss the learning support-resource teacher staffing for the coming school year.</P>

        <Quest>if she will make resources available to a school (details supplied) in Dublin <Col N="2272"/>16 to provide special needs tuition to a pupil.</Quest>

	<P>My Department provides a range of supports to second level schools to enable them to cater for pupils with special educational needs. The supports in question include remedial and resource teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has been established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order, 2005. Since 1 January 2005, the NCSE, through local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is responsible for processing resource applications for children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>The level of teaching and special needs assistant support for special educational needs is determined by the SENO in accordance with my Department&rsquo;s resourcing policy for special educational needs. In this case the SENO recommended a total of 35.5 teaching hours and 28 hours special needs assistant support to cater for the special educational needs of pupils at this school, including the pupil referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>In situations where schools have surplus teaching posts, my Department routinely requires that these posts be utilised to meet new and emerging needs within such schools, including those of pupils who have special educational needs, where appropriate. In the case of the school in question, my Department decided that the teaching hours recommended by the SENO should be met from within the school&rsquo;s existing resources, which included 2.89 surplus teaching posts.</P>
        <P>An independent appeals committee is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation. The school in question appealed this decision to the independent appeals committee. The appeals committee decided that an allocation of a further 0.23 whole-time teacher equivalents was warranted and this allocation was granted by my Department for the 2005-06 school year. This committee operates independently of my Department and its decisions are final.</P>

	<P>I am aware that Sallins, Naas, Kill and Johnstown, like many areas located within close proximity to Dublin, continue to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision. However, a range of significant measures has been undertaken by my Department to address the current and future need for pupil places in these areas.</P>
        <P>At primary level, an entire new school has been provided at Killashee while temporary accommodation has been provided at Scoil Corbain, St. Conleth&rsquo;s and St. Mary&rsquo;s national school and St. Conleth&rsquo;s Naofa in Naas. Temporary accommodation has also been provided at one of the two nearby national schools at Caragh. In addition, approval has been given to Gaelscoil N&aacute;s na Riogh, Caragh national school and Kill national school for additional accommodation for September 2006. GS N&aacute;s na Riogh has recently been approved to commence architectural planning for the provision of a new 16 classroom school.</P>
        <P>At Sallins national school, a seven classroom extension is completed and this extension has increased capacity from nine classrooms to 16 classrooms. An extension to bring the school up to 24 classrooms has commenced architectural planning.</P>
        <P>Additionally, there are proposals to improve accommodation at St. David&rsquo;s national school, Two Mile House national school and Caragh national school. The accommodation needs of the national schools at Ballycane, Convent of Mercy in Naas and Scoil P&aacute;draig in Johnstown are also currently being assessed.</P>
        <P>Currently, two junior infant classes are accommodated in the new national school to which the Deputy refers. When fully occupied, the school will operate as a two-stream 16 classroom school. To enable it develop in this manner, it can only enrol two junior infant classes annually. This incremental development is common to all newly established schools to ensure that a shortage of accommodation at the school is avoided by an over enrolment in the early stages and, crucially, to ensure that the enrolments and staffing levels in other schools in the area, where older pupils would inevitably be drawn, are not adversely affected.</P>
        <P>My Department is awaiting details of an agreed enrolment policy from the primary providers in the area to ensure that the development of the new school is underpinned as envisaged. It is satisfied that the totality of the primary accommodation available in the area in question provides sufficient places to cater for all those seeking places.</P>

        <Quest>the options which are available to the parents of a four year old child who <Col N="2274"/>does not have a primary school place for September 2006; the action which can be taken to alleviate the situation for concerned parents and their children; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age. Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</P>
        <P>Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</P>
        <P>I am aware that Kill, Sallins and Naas, like many areas located within close proximity to Dublin, continue to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision. However, a range of significant measures has been undertaken by my Department to address the current and future need for pupil places in these areas. At primary level, an entire new school has been provided at Killashee while temporary accommodation has been provided at Scoil Corbain, St. Conleth&rsquo;s and St. Mary&rsquo;s national school and St Conleth&rsquo;s Naofa in Naas. Temporary accommodation has also been approved at Caragh national school, St. Corban&rsquo;s, Gaelscoil Nas na Riogh in Naas, and Scoil Naomh Brighde.</P><Col N="2275"/>
        <P>A brand new state of the art 16 classroom school together with a double autistic unit was opened this September in Naas town. This project, in particular, will assist in easing any difficulties for primary pupil places that may exist in Naas. It is also proposed to build a brand new state of the art 16 classroom school for Gaelscoil Nas na Riogh.</P>
        <P>With regard to Kill, the property management section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department on to site acquisitions generally, is continuing, in consultation with the local authority, to explore all possibilities for the acquisition of a site for a new 16-24 classroom national school in Kill.</P>
        <P>Additionally, there are proposals to improve accommodation at St. David&rsquo;s national school and Two Mile House national school. The long-term accommodationneeds of the national schools at Ballycane, Caragh and Convent of Mercy in Naas are also currently being assessed. At Sallins national school, a seven classroom extension is under construction. When completed, this extension will increase capacity from nine to 16 classrooms. An extension to bring the school up to 24 classrooms is being allowed into architectural planning this year.</P>
        <P>All of these initiatives represent huge capital investment and demonstrate my commitment to meeting the needs of the areas concerned. The school planning section of my Department will keep the position under review to ensure that any additional emerging needs are met as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The national water services pricing policy framework requires local authorities to recover the cost of providing water services from non-domestic users of these services. It is a requirement of water pricing policy that the cost of providing water services to the non-domestic sector should be fully recovered by local authorities by means of a meter based volumetric charge. This is the most equitable approach which also promotes maximum environmental efficiency.</P>
        <P>While current arrangements for schools may, in common with many other non-domestic users, be based on fixed water services charges, local authorities are moving towards the metering of all non-domestic water use. This will provide a transparent and equitable cost recovery mechanism for water services which should incentivise all non-domestic users, including schools, to conserve their use of water.</P>

	<P>Section 26(2) of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, allows the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to grant to the master or other person having charge for the time being of a pack of beagles or harriers a licence to hunt hares in any district or districts specified in the licence with that pack on such day or days, being a day or days which are not specified in the hares order providing for the open season, as are both specified in the licence and are in the year in which the licence is granted.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of applications from the Irish Masters of Beagles Association and Cork Southern Hunt Club, it was decided to issue these organisations with a licence for the period from 1 March 2006 to 31 March 2006. Licences have been given for this period annually for the past number of years. As a condition of the licences a return giving the dates and number of hares hunted and killed on each of the days specified shall be made to the national parks and wildlife service of my Department.</P>
        <P>Returns from previous years have shown that beagling results in extremely low hare mortality giving no strong conservation reasons to oppose the issue of these licenses: 2005 &mdash; three hares killed; 2004 &mdash; two hares killed; 2003 &mdash; three hares killed; 2002 &mdash; two hares killed; 2001 &mdash; three hares killed; 2000 &mdash; three hares killed.</P>

	<P>Information on the number of social and affordable housing units acquired under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 &mdash; 2004 in each local authority area until the end of September 2005 is published in my Department&rsquo;s housing statistics bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library and also on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>. Provisional annual data for 2005 on the number of social and affordable houses acquired in the areas requested in the question indicate that Kildare County Council acquired 45 units. While the number of instances of financial transactions is not available in my Department, Kildare County Council received a total of &euro;1,971,153 in lieu of land transfers. There have been no sites acquired by any of the councils referred to in the question.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department issued circular letter PD 1/06 on 25 January 2006 reminding local authorities of their obligations under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 in taking in charge of estates. Each local authority has been directed to establish a policy addressing certain specified issues on taking in charge of housing estates to be agreed by the members of the authority, which must be reported to those members on a regular basis and at least once annually. The circular letter also states that the existence of a management company to maintain elements of common buildings, carry out landscaping and so forth must not impact upon the decision by the authority to take in charge roads and related infrastructure where a request to do so is made.</P>
        <P>The circular letter also directed each local authority to submit a report to my Department detailing how each local authority is performing in taking in charge of estates. The specific infor<Col N="2278"/>mation sought related to the anticipated number of housing estates which will be taken in charge this year and how many houses will be affected; the number of housing estates that have not yet been taken in charge whose planning permission expired more than two and less than seven years ago; the number of housing estates which are finished or unfinished in line with the relevant planning permission; the action being taken to resolve the issue of unfinished estates; whether the planning authority has a stated policy in regard to taking in charge of housing estates; the average length of time it takes to take an estate in charge; and whether a national policy on taking in charge would assist and if so the issues such a policy should address.</P>
        <P>These reports are currently being received and collated in my Department. I will consider the question of any further guidance on taking in charge thereafter.</P>

        <Quest>the performance in each of the county councils and county boroughs in respect of the performance indicators, for example, costs per million cubic metres of water, percentage level of leakage, level of enforcement of planning control, percentage of recycling, litter fines issued per litter warden and the average time to re-let dwellings.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The report, Service Indicators in Local Authorities 2004, which was published by the local government management services board in July 2005, contains comprehensive information on local authority performance in 2004 across a wide range of activity programmes, including enforcement of planning control, recycling, enforcement of litter legislation and the average time to re-let local authority dwellings. The report is available in the Oireachtas library. I expect to receive the 2005 report on service indicators from the local government management services board by end June 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The cost of water services across the country ranged between &euro;610,000 and &euro;2.03 per cubic meter in 2004. The unit cost of water services provision differs between sanitary authorities given the differences in the costs of water production across each sanitary authority area and the economies of scale that apply. It is a matter for each sanitary authority to set the appropriate level of charges for non-domestic users of water services, subject to the water services pricing policy framework, which provides for the full recovery of actual costs, and water and waste water charges being determined having regard to this principle.</P>
        <P>The National Water Study, which was published in 2000, involved an audit of individual <Col N="2279"/>public water supplies outside the greater Dublin area serving more than 5,000 people. The study examined all aspects of water supply, including availability of raw water, treatment capacity, water distribution systems and associated management issues, and found, <i>inter alia</i>, that unaccounted for water levels varied significantly between regions but were generally in the range of 40% to 50%. This data can be compared with the results from pilot water conservation projects that began prior to 2000 by a number of local authorities, for example, rates reduced from 42.5% to 28.7% in Dublin, in Donegal from 59% to 39%, in Meath from 47% to 34% and in Kilkenny from 45% to 29%. This resulted in significant ongoing cost savings.</P>
        <P>All of the pilot projects were completed with the aid of capital funding of &euro;63 million from my Department. Following a further allocation of &euro;276 million by my Department in May 2003, local authorities are currently implementing a wider programme of water conservation projects that will identify and substantially reduce unaccounted for water in public supply networks.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 and 210 together.</P>
        <P>The local government sector operates under public procurement guidelines issued by the Department of Finance. These require contracting authorities, including local authorities, to ensure that tenderers have regard to minimum pay and other legally binding industrial or sectoral agreements when preparing tenders and that tender documents should have an appropriate reference to this.</P>
        <P>Transgressions of labour legislation are a matter in the first instance for the labour inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has the power to examine relevant records and, where breaches of statutory obligations are identified, to have matters rectified.</P>
