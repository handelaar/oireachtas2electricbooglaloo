      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised in the House with the Taoiseach on a number of occasions in the past one of the great scourges of humanity, and every parent&rsquo;s worst nightmare, namely, paedophilia, which is a transnational problem and an international phenomenon.  This issue is on the front of one of today&rsquo;s major newspapers.  Following the assault of two young girls in Dublin at the weekend, there is genuinely great fear, anxiety and concern among parents all over the country about the way we regulate these issues and the legislation that is in place.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Child Protection has been dealing with this issue.  Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, on behalf of this side of the House, has been raising a particular point about Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  It is absolutely essential that our enforcement measures are on a par with the best of those that apply elsewhere.</P>
        <P>I was struck by the dedicated unit that has been set up in Great Britain &mdash; the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre &mdash; which brings specialists from a variety of backgrounds to work together to protect children.  That centre launched a website this week which is dedicated to locating child sex offenders who have failed to <Col N="2"/>comply with the notification requirements.  The difficulty, which is exacerbated in this country, is that while the details on the UK&rsquo;s most wanted offenders are now posted on a dedicated website,<i> www.ceop.gov.uk/wanted</i>, one of them has been identified as living and working in Donegal for the past two years.  It appears that if a convicted sex offender here wishes to work in one county, he or she can register in another.  The concentration through this site in Great Britain is now having an effect &mdash; alleged, perceived or real &mdash; of sex offenders and paedophiles arriving in this jurisdiction.  This is obviously of great concern.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that in this jurisdiction we must not be found wanting in what is the worst nightmare for parents, namely, to find their children tragically involved in something like this.  Following the initiatives taken in the UK, we cannot afford to wait two or three years to follow suit.  Can the Taoiseach guarantee that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister of State with responsibility for children will see to it that providing resources and getting our agencies working <Col N="3"/>together in our children&rsquo;s interests will be given absolute priority?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Kenny that it is a nightmare thought for parents that any of their children would be interfered with, harassed, assaulted or abused in any way.  Obviously, it is an issue to which the authorities and the Government give the highest priority.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kenny stated that a number of issues have been highlighted in a newspaper today.  There is no evidence that sex offenders from other jurisdictions are abusing the system here.  I have checked this matter with the justice and Garda authorities who have assured me that is not the case.  We have had very close co-operation for many years and these issues have been highlighted previously.  There is close co-operation between the Garda authorities.  It is wrong to say that a system is not in place for tracking sex offenders who come here from Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Any sex offender coming to this country from Great Britain or Northern Ireland is obliged by law to notify the Garda of his or her whereabouts, not to mind the co-operation that takes place between the police authorities.  Failure to do so carries a penalty of imprisonment.  That obligation extends to any sex offender entering this jurisdiction from abroad who has an obligation to register in his or her own country.  If a person does not register in his or her own country, that is picked up also in the international system.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a system in place to monitor offenders who are subject to these notification requirements and either they inform us or the other authorities inform us that they have gone missing.  This means that nominated Garda inspectors in each Garda division are notified when a registered offender comes to live in their division.  These officers are responsible for monitoring, and do monitor, such offenders.</P>
        <P>When offenders go on the sex offenders register, the convictions are recorded on the Garda computer system &mdash; PULSE &mdash; even if those offenders had committed their crimes in another jurisdiction.  This means that offenders&rsquo; criminal records would show up in any vetting process, including if they sought work in any of the vulnerable areas such as schools or health services where they might have access to children.  It is wrong to suggest that a sex offender convicted abroad who seeks a job working with children or vulnerable adults could beat the vetting system.  If the offence is on the vetting system it will come up, as would any offence committed in another jurisdiction, just as it would come up if it occurred in the west or in the middle of my constituency.  Furthermore, the Garda can apply&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Information is not automatically given to the vetting process.  The Taoiseach does not know what he is talking about.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="4"/>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Only if it is paid employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to the court for a sex offenders order against any registered offender if there is a belief that his or her behaviour in the community gives reasonable cause for concern or is a danger to the public.</P>
        <P>In reply to Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s fair question, I want to stress that this provision of the Sex Offenders Act, which is now five years old, applies to offenders coming here from abroad and the evidence necessary for obtaining that order can be sought from the police force of the country in which the person has offended.</P>
        <P>A number of issues also arise about closer co-operation and tying it into memorandums.  I will return to this point when I get an opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not doubt the Taoiseach&rsquo;s concern in this matter.  I assure him that whatever action the Government is required to take to make this area as regulated as it should be will have the support of this side of the House.  Deputy Enright raised the issue on a number of occasions that volunteers and those working with young people in sporting facilities and other areas are not vetted.  Yesterday I raised the issue that in the context of any constitutional referendum being held on the rights of children, soft information should be made available.  I instanced the third anniversary of the Huntley case in Britain where evidence was clearly available about that person being interviewed in respect of serious sexual assault on a number of occasions prior to a double murder taking place.  I know the committee dealing with child protection is looking at the law but what concerns me is that the administration of practice be implemented in the best way possible.  For example, the different agencies that should be brought together, such as the ISPCC and Barnardos, under the chairmanship of the Minister of State with responsibility for children should see to it that the political drive and the political will exists to ensure this area is as regulated as it should be because of the genuine concern expressed by so many parents.  The Taoiseach will be aware that a different system operates on the Continent than applies in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and, as a consequence, here.  My principal concern is with the UK and Northern Ireland.  I do not have evidence of the numbers of paedophiles or convicted sex offenders who are in this jurisdiction, suffice to say that the information or material that was available to a now-resigned former member of the Bench was apparently appalling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>There may well be other elements of that in this jurisdiction in serious quantity.  I do not know.  As a parent I am concerned, and I express that concern on behalf of many others, <Col N="5"/>that we should have the best level of regulation as possible in this area.  For my part and that of my party, whatever active participation and regulation the Government requires we will assist.  This is much too serious a matter on which to make mere political points.  It is one of the great scourges of humanity and, as I said earlier, one of the true nightmares of every parent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what Deputy Kenny has said.  I accept also that this is an area which cannot be over regulated, if it stops paedophilia or any kind of abuse.  To reply specifically to some of the questions raised, the issue of soft information which has come to the fore a number of times is being examined.  The T&aacute;naiste has already said at the committee that that requires a constitutional amendment or a change.  In the process of the constitutional discussions we are having on the related issues we would consider that important point.</P>
        <P>There is close co-operation between the Garda and the authorities on this matter.  Following the Huntley murder case and others, the British authorities stepped up co-operation because of concern in its jurisdiction and co-operation was also stepped up here.  The Garda and the PSNI work closely on this because of the easy movement of people.  Of course, there is easy movement of people between many places now.  The movement of offenders is shared and exchanged on a daily basis between the police authorities.</P>
        <P>A memorandum of understanding which will enhance the existing information sharing arrangements between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland, relating to sex offenders, will be signed by the T&aacute;naiste next Monday.  In addition, under the intergovernmental agreement on North-South co-operation on criminal justice matters, an advisory group on registered sex offenders has already been established to enable continued and close co-operation and information sharing between the two parts of the island and with our neighbours in Britain.  Clearly one can never say that nobody can get through the system but everything that has been recorded is available to our police.  There is close co-operation and information is exchanged on a daily basis.  There are nominated garda&iacute; in each division who have a part to play.  PULSE is updated on the position.  The Garda has the power to monitor convicted sex offenders coming here from abroad and the power to seek a sex offenders order against them if they think they are a danger to the public.  As I understand it, the Garda can move that order based on any&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>How many orders have been obtained?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask the Garda.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda is very conscious of this issue.  The case in Swords is another example of a case that received much publicity.  Unfortunately, there are many cases that get no publicity.  It is an issue on which we have to be vigilant and nobody wants to tolerate these issues.</P>
        <P>The memorandum of understanding on the sharing of arrangements will be launched by the T&aacute;naiste and the Home Office Minister and the signing will take place at Hillsborough next week.  That memorandum of understanding relates to information about persons travelling between this jurisdiction and the UK and those who are subject to sex offender notification requirements in their own jurisdiction.  Its purpose is the sharing of such information for, first, the protection of the public from the risk presented by sex offenders and, second, the investigation of serious sex offences and covers any information necessary to achieve those purposes.  That will strengthen what is contained in the memorandum of understanding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There are gaping loopholes that need to be closed both in the law and in the practice.</P>

	<P>Relatives of the 48 young people who lost their lives in the unimaginable horror of the Stardust fire will be picketing outside the gates of Leinster House later today.  What response can the Government make to their plea?  They made a comprehensive submission to the Government during the summer.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform eventually met relatives.  We do not know the Government&rsquo;s response even though the matter has been raised here consistently by my colleague, Deputy Broughan.  The last thing we want to do on this side is to raise hopes that cannot be met.  Nonetheless, the submission suggests there is good reason to believe that further investigation is warranted.  It comes down to a net point &mdash; was the fire arson or accident?  Their submission believes, and there are expert witnesses to suggest the same thing, that the tribunal misdirected itself as to a crucial fact relating to the layout and design of the premises and that it worked from a map that did not show the correct layout of the storerooms and the combustible material.  The Keane tribunal found that the forensic investigation of the site was inadequate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The owners of the premises were left for a number of days in control of the premises before the forensic investigation took place.  I put it to the Taoiseach that we have a tried <Col N="7"/>mechanism that may well be appropriate in this situation, the facility to send in a senior counsel with the assistance of an expert assessor to review the tribunal papers, to review the Garda reports, to study the submission from the relatives, to take whatever evidence he would consider appropriate and to establish whether there is a basis for a fuller public investigation.  This was an unimaginable horror inflicted on a working class community.  They believe, as I do, that if they had some of the great and the good in their midst and if they were assisted by some of the professional classes they would not have been ignored for 25 years in the manner in which they have been ignored.  It is coming to the stage where the Government must make up its mind.  I do not understand the procrastination.  A very long time has transpired since disturbing evidence was proffered that the tribunal may have misdirected itself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all very familiar with the Stardust events and I certainly am because at the time I lived beside the Stardust site in the Pinebrook estate in Artane.  As I was the administrator on call in the Mater Hospital that night, I remember it very well.  It was for that reason that I decided after 25 years it was time for somebody to do it.  Deputy Rabbitte is right in stating that no Government for the past 25 years has taken too much interest in it since the public inquiry &mdash; I did.  I would like to consider that I got some credit for taking that interest.  I will gladly acknowledge that Deputy Broughan has raised the matter with me in the House a number of times over the years.</P>
        <P>For that reason I agreed to meet the relatives in the early part of the summer.  However, Greg O&rsquo;Neill, their legal representative, with whom I have dealt on many cases, did not have the evidence available.  Deputy Rabbitte can drop the &ldquo;eventual&rdquo;.  When they had the information I met them with the T&aacute;naiste and we had a long meeting.  That meeting was about two issues.  I am very familiar with all the details in the submission.  I met the committee on 18 September when I got the submission and had a chance to look at it.  There has been very active and positive consideration to address the issues of concern to the committee and to provide assistance to the families since then.</P>
        <P>The first issue they raised with me on that day and in their data was to initiate and oversee a process intended to lead to the identification of the five unidentified victims.  The Garda authorities followed a very exhaustive process, because on that day the chief forensic scientist and other senior staff were present.  We then pursued it with the Garda.  The Garda authorities have agreed to give their full support in the logistics of this process.  That will be assisted by the forensic science laboratory with specialist analytical input from the UK.  We could not have done <Col N="8"/>that in the past &mdash; so it is not a criticism &mdash; because it is only in modern times that the DNA would have helped in this.  The costs of the process will be borne by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  These include the analytical expenses as well as the exhumation and reburial expenses and reasonable costs.  That was the first issue.</P>
        <P>The second issue was as follows.  They had an independent evaluation of the evaluation that was done for the independent inquiry &mdash; not new information.  It is an independent evaluation of the original evaluation.  I know the families are very anxious to receive a response to this.  They particularly looked for a new public inquiry.  They believe that the inquiry of the former Chief Justice, Ronan Keane, was flawed.  They asked that these issues be looked at.  There are the issues raised by Deputy Rabbitte and a number of other issues as well.  However, it centres on the arson-accident issue and the technical issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will give Deputy Rabbitte the answer he knows.  It is not within my competence or that of my Department to make the technical, engineering and forensic analysis of this.  It is a complex evaluation.  After that meeting I asked senior officials, including senior technical officials, to examine these matters fully with an absolutely open mind.  I will do anything I can to help these families.  I know many of them personally and have met many of them over the years.  I have met many delegations on their behalf.  They have protested at my office and are protesting outside Leinster House.  They believe that such actions highlight the issue.  My advice is that it will not help one bit.  I will help them to the best of my ability and in every way I can, but I must go on the total assessment made by the people who are independently capable of doing this.  I have asked them to do this as fully and comprehensively as possible.  When they give me that information, I will give that report.  I cannot make a judgment about all the issues and I do not want to make any glib answers.  I know what the issues are.  I am not in a position to do that.  However, there are people who can make that assessment.</P>
        <P>We are talking about a very long public inquiry held under the chairmanship of the former Chief Justice, Ronan Keane, with all the advice that was there.  They have now come back with their independent analysis of that and I have asked for people to make a judgment on it.  I will report that.  I will do that as soon as I have it.  With the greatest of respect and to be helpful to the people, because I know them all, there is no need for them to be protesting and to be out in inclement weather.  As soon as I have that report, I will do that, as I did with the exhumations, which was not a very good area for them to deal with &mdash; it was very horrific stuff.  The House has my word that I will do that.  However, I cannot pre-empt it and I cannot ignore it.  I must base it on the evidence I get.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not raise this matter in any partisan way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am merely concerned that some peace of mind should be brought to the relatives concerned about the terrible tragedy that befell them.  The Taoiseach says: &ldquo;Deputy Rabbitte is right in stating that no Government for the past 25 years has taken too much of an interest in it since the public inquiry &mdash; I did&rdquo;, but I am bound to remind him that he has been in government since 1987 with the exception of two years.  He has been Taoiseach for ten years.  If he cannot offer them some way forward or some hope, who can?  As far as I am concerned, this was an act of corporate manslaughter.  If ever there is a definition of corporate manslaughter, this is it, with people crowded in unconscionable numbers into an unsafe space with the doors padlocked and combustible materials in the attic.  How long does it take us to get this independent evidence that will enable the Taoiseach to make a decision about what mechanism can be put in place to satisfy the reasonable requests of the people concerned?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The finding of arson enabled the owners of these premises to get millions in damages from the State and the taxpayer.  The most serious questions were raised into which I do not want to go here.  Given the precedent of Mr. Paddy McEntee, SC, being appointed in respect of the Barron report and other precedents since the commission of inquiries legislation was introduced, there is a way to appoint a senior senior counsel with an expert assessor.  Let them do the work that the Taoiseach claims he cannot do.  However, let Government make a decision on the matter and take those people out of their agony.  They do not feel they have any clout in Irish society.  They do not feel anybody is listening to them.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>They understand that the Taoiseach, along with everybody else in the House, has sympathy for the terrible grief they endured.  However, they do not believe that anybody is likely to act to give them some confidence that at least the State has sought to get answers to questions that remain unanswered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not be partisan about it either.  I do not believe that Deputy Rabbitte can fairly make a political point that if I got information in September and dealt with it immediately, that was delaying it.  They did not present this information.  They did present other infor<Col N="10"/>mation over the years, which successive Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and Justice, Equality and Law Reform considered.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Let us not forget that a full sworn inquiry into this matter took place and that a comprehensive system designed to help the families involved was established.  Politicians, including the then Taoiseach, and the then Attorney General, Mr. John Rogers, made huge efforts to deal with these issues in the 1980s.  With the passage of time, new issues arose, particularly in respect of DNA, a matter with which we have since dealt.  I understand the nature of the grieving process and I accept that people were not sure or could never be certain about their loved ones being identified and asked that the matter be addressed.</P>
        <P>In terms of technical issues, the tribunal concluded that it was arson&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not arson.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but the relatives put forward their own claims in their submission.  I cannot supply an exact date in respect of this matter.  My officials have been trying to press the people who have the relevant technical competence to deal with this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The first tribunal did not have access to vital information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have accepted that the information has been provided in good faith.  However, I cannot make an assessment because I am not a forensic scientist, an architect or an engineer.  I have given careful consideration to the matter, taken on board the submissions and listened to the relatives, their advisers and Mr. Greg O&rsquo;Neill.  I spoke to the relatives and understand the hurt they have suffered for 25 years.  When the competent authorities provide me with an answer, I will gladly supply it.  I cannot do any more than that.  I sincerely say to the relatives that they have fought long and hard in respect of this matter and as soon as the information becomes available &mdash; it will be a matter of weeks rather than months before this happens &mdash; I will supply it.  I cannot be pinned to a date in that regard.  I checked the position in recent days before making an announcement yesterday regarding the exhumations.  I accept Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s bona fides in respect of this matter and as soon as the information is communicated to me, I will make it available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>For the past two years, a small, isolated, part-Gaeltacht community in County Mayo has, on the authority of the Government, been bullied and harassed by major oil and gas companies in order to railroad it into accepting the running of pipelines that will contain raw, untreated gas at unprecedented pressure through <Col N="11"/>their area and an industrial refinery in the heart of what is one of the most pristine and beautiful parts of the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has put the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the position of acting almost as a private army for the notorious Shell oil corporation, a company that has left a trail of environmental destruction around the world.  The Garda has used totally unacceptable and heavy-handed tactics against the people of Erris.  Let us scotch, once and for all, the spurious propaganda put abroad by some Government politicians and elements of the media that outsiders are going into Erris and causing trouble as if the local people were puppets on a string.  The entire protest has been directed by members of the local community and is designed to protect the locality and its natural resources.</P>
        <P>I wish to illustrate what the people of the area are being obliged to endure.  On 16 October, when three other Independent Deputies and I held, in a totally peaceful context, a press conference and a meeting with local people at Bellanaboy, two members of the Garda with video cameras intruded upon it and filmed the proceedings in their entirety.  We complained to the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform in respect of what must be an unprecedented action on the part of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in intruding upon Members of the Oireachtas carrying out their representational functions, but we have not yet received a reply.  If the Taoiseach was meeting a Fianna F&aacute;il cumann in north Mayo, is he of the view that members of the Garda would barge in and make a video recording of proceedings as if he were a criminal?  The verbal and physical abuse to which members of the community to which I refer have been subjected is reprehensible.</P>
        <P>A number of Independent Deputies do not fully agree with all the demands of the people of Rossport.  However, we all want justice for those people and their community.  Deputy Cowley has staunchly represented the community when others turned away.  In recent times, a new initiative has been undertaken by the Shell to Sea campaign, directed by the local community, in respect of bringing into being an independent public commission which would conduct public hearings and in respect of which community consent would be a fundamental criterion.  Opinion polls carried out in Mayo and nationally indicate that a majority of the people support their counterparts in Erris in demanding that the Shell facility be placed offshore in order that the intrusion, pollution and danger it might cause can be avoided.</P>
        <P>The initiative to which I refer has been dismissed with an arrogance that only the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources can summon.  Will the Taoiseach accept the initiative and put into being a new process under which this issue might be resolved?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="12"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When Deputy Joe Higgins and other Members of the House raised this matter a few years ago, I supported the carrying out of a further examination of the safety and security issues and the procurement of outside and independent international advice in this regard.  The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, spent a year carrying out such an examination.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the site development work relating to the Corrib gas terminal at Bellanaboy is continuing.  I am also aware that protesters continue to attempt to block workers from entering the site.  I respect the right of people to protest but I am strongly of the view that employees also have the right to travel to work unimpeded.</P>
        <P>I have no reason to argue about these issues.  There has been unprecedented consultation and deliberation in respect of them.  It was a long process and separate statutory approvals and consent had to be obtained.  Licences were required in respect of six separate elements of the project.  Under the Continental Shelf Act 1968, everything had to be examined in respect of the construction of the onshore installation.  That was completed on 15 April.</P>
        <P>Matters also had to be examined in the context of the Petroleum and Minerals Development Act 1960, a process that concluded on 15 April 2002, and the Gas Act 1976, as amended, deliberations in respect of which also concluded in 2002.  An integral part of the plan for the development was approved on 15 April 2005.  A foreshore licence was approved, under the Foreshore Act 1993, as amended, in respect of the routing of the pipelines through the foreshore connecting the gasfield to the land-based installation.  Under the Planning Acts, in respect of the land-based installation &mdash; the terminal &mdash; this was a condition of the plan of development approval and An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission in October 2004 for the gas terminal and the associated disposition site subject to 42 conditions.</P>
        <P>Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, an integrated pollution control licence for the operation of the terminal was issued.  This is a condition of the plan of development approval and is under negotiation with the EPA.  In addition to these and the issues to which I referred earlier, the Minister issued compulsory acquisition rights orders and compulsory purchase orders.  Environmental impact assessments were carried out and an environmental impact statement completed.  All these statutory processes have been gone through and most had been completed when I supported the independent assessment that was carried out.  These matters are finished and the Deputy will agree that an end position is sometimes reached in a case.  That was reached some time ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter is not finished.  The Taoiseach is dealing with a county and a community that introduced the word &ldquo;boycott&rdquo; into the English language when the agents of an <Col N="13"/>imperial power imposed on the local community.  History is repeating itself in a different way.  The investigations to which the Taoiseach referred were not comprehensive enough to take into account all the issues of crucial importance to the community.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la reversed the decision of one of its key inspectors.  No planning permission was needed for the pipeline through Rossport on the basis of the Alice in Wonderland logic that it was an offshore pipeline, even though it will be laid six miles inland.</P>
        <P>The Government has no problem giving away our natural resources for nothing to multinational corporations, as it has done in the case of the Corrib gas field, Aer Lingus, Telecom &Eacute;ireann and other critical infrastructure.  Apart from other considerations, does the Taoiseach ever think of his own legacy in this regard?  He has said in a few years he will hang his flower baskets full time.  Does he want as a permanent legacy the destruction of a landscape of great beauty by the imposition of an entirely inappropriate industrial and polluting entity so that a few dollars more profit can be made by the notorious Shell oil corporation?  Will the Taoiseach recognise that, unless the Government has community consent, which it does not, the issue is not finished?  Will he grant the independent commission?  When the Independent Deputies raised the issue of natural resources during Private Members&rsquo; business, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources said he would revisit the terms under which licences are given to major corporations.  Has that been done?  When will the outcome of the review be known so that at least the people will receive royalties from their own natural resources?</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to distinguish the cost of Government meetings generally from the overall costs associated with the operation of the Government secretariat.  Where Cabinet meetings are held outside Government Buildings, additional costs may arise.  The cost for my Department to date in respect of the meeting which was held in Avondale House, County Wicklow on 31 July 2006 is &euro;8,031.  The additional cost for such Cabinet meetings is mainly accounted for by staff costs, the need to provide communications and media facilities and related catering.  The holding of Government meetings outside Dublin is very much welcomed by local communities and provides an opportunity to meet with local organisations and groups.  To date, nine meetings have been held outside Dublin.  Cork, Donegal, Kerry, Laois, Louth, Roscommon, Waterford and Wicklow have been venues for Government meetings in previous years.  No further meetings are planned for outside Dublin but it is an initiative I intend to continue in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested in the costs involved but the Taoiseach stated it is difficult to provide that information, although the Wicklow meeting cost &euro;8,031.  Have the costs in general increased in recent years?  When I raised the issue previously, the Taoiseach stated very little money was available for Cabinet meetings outside Dublin.  Has the position changed?  Will he take into account the special case that could be made to hold meetings in rapidly expanding commuter belt communities as well as further afield?  Perhaps Wicklow falls into that category but the Taoiseach should appreciate the difficulties people in such communities face in their day-to-day lives.  The population has exploded and facilities are not available.  I mentioned Swords yesterday during Leaders&rsquo; Question as a case in point.  Has the Taoiseach plans to take on board people&rsquo;s wishes to meet in towns such as this?  They are under the impression the difficulties they face are not appreciated as they try to cope with commuting, child rearing and a lack of facilities.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="16"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On average, only one meeting a year is held outside Dublin and the cost is low.  The meeting in Wicklow was held during the Wicklow 400 celebrations and we met those involved in organising them as well as local community representatives.  We have met in Cork and Waterford cities.  My ministerial colleagues regularly hold meetings in commuter towns.  They commute themselves and it is an issue with which they are most familiar.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>But they are not on trains or buses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, commutes seven or eight hours to his home a few times a week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>In a nice car.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is more familiar with commuting than the Deputy who takes a handy route on the motorway to Swords.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Try the bus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The intention is to have a good reason and, normally, an invitation.  It is in cases such as that of Cork during its year as the European capital of culture that we tend to have meetings outside Dublin, but it is a rare, once a year occurrence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach read out a long list of venues at which Cabinet meetings have been held.  Has he carried out an analysis of the impact of the meetings?  From an examination of interviews on local radio stations and in local newspapers, the meetings seem to be convoys of camaraderie to different locations.  The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism might give a few cheques to the local sports club or visit a football club to tell it to submit its application.  I recall the case of Ballaghaderreen when the convoy went into the west.  Most of the promises made by the litany of benign Ministers did not achieve much, but I understand the necessity for the Taoiseach to consider this matter important.</P>
        <P>Has the Taoiseach planned Cabinet meetings outside Dublin for next year or has he stopped at a particular point on the calendar because of a realisation that he may not be able to plan beyond it?  Will he consider holding a Cabinet meeting in Lucan at 8.30 a.m. and have Ministers travel from the Ballyowen roundabout into some of the local estates to see what people must put up with?  Will the Taoiseach hold the meeting in Firhouse in Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s constituency where I was last night?  In some areas, the only bus service is at 7.15 a.m. while other locations have no bus services.</P>
        <P>While it is nice and important for the black convoy to speed through the countryside to get to where the people are, perhaps the Taoiseach should focus more on the reality of what people <Col N="17"/>must live with.  It might be of practical importance to the members of the Cabinet who stare out benignly from their leather seats&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I was near Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s constituency where we all keep an eye on him.  The other day, I went to Abbottstown to watch schools going up before houses are built.  The construction of the new commuter station is well advanced before other developments occur.  I have seen ideal planning and development.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been enormous change.  The metro west will be in that area to take plans into the future.  I watched commuter trains on the rail line speed off to the west.  People travel in record times now compared to the past.  If I had time, I would gladly have more meetings in such places to see the quality of life and ideal communities there.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte has reminded me that I was recently in Clonakilty to open some of the offices in question and that I visited some of the offices in Cavan.  I opened the Marine Institute on the beautiful coast of Galway Bay.</P>

	<P>No, it is a fine building that cost more than &euro;10 million to complete.  It is an architecturally fine building that opens onto the sea.  I can see why only eight people did not want to go, because it is a good location.  They told me that four and five bedroom houses there cost only 55% of what they cost in this city and I understand why people would want to go to those lovely locations.  It might not be as nice today as it was in the summer months, but these are the reasons people are queuing up for decentralisation.  I will take Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s invitation and try to bring the Cabinet to some of those locations if I get a chance in the next number of years.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 21, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Prime Minister Blair and I hosted three days of intensive multi-party talks with the Northern Ireland political parties from 11 to 13 October at St. Andrews in Scotland.  The focus of the talks was on achieving full and effective operation of the political institutions of Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The St. Andrews Agreement, which the two Governments published on 13 October, addresses the essential issues necessary for a stable and peaceful settlement in Northern Ireland.  It underpins the Good Friday Agreement and is built on the twin pillars of power-sharing and support for policing and the rule of law.  It sets out a clear roadmap to restoration.  In particular, it also includes practical changes to the operation of the political institutions, which were originally the subject of the review process undertaken in 2004.  A number of other issues relating to human rights, equality and victims are also addressed in the agreement.</P>
        <P>Following the talks and at the request of the Governments, the parties engaged in extensive consultations regarding the agreement.  On 10 November, the Governments announced that they were satisfied on the basis of their contacts with and responses from the parties that the St. Andrews Agreement, implemented in good faith, represented the basis for a political settlement.</P>
        <P>Last week, the British Government published legislation that will give effect to the agreement.  It makes the necessary legal provisions to allow devolved government to be restored in Northern Ireland on the basis of the timetable set out at St. Andrews.  It also provides for assembly elections in March.</P>
        <P>The leading parties are expected to indicate their intentions regarding nominations for the posts of First Minister and Deputy First Minister this Friday, 24 November, following which a transitional assembly will come into effect.  The full slate of Ministers will be nominated in March in light of the outcome of the election and the executive will be restored on 26 March.  There will also be an IMC report in January.</P><Col N="21"/>
        <P>In the interim, the new programme for Government committee will discuss all of the necessary arrangements relating to ministerial responsibilities, ensuring that the executive can operate with immediate effect from next March.  It had been intended that this committee would meet in the week following the talks at St. Andrews, but, as the House is aware, this did not happen.  However, I welcome the fact that the inaugural meeting of the committee finally took place this week.  It is essential that the parties engage in the committee&rsquo;s work fully to ensure that all issues relevant to the formation of the executive in March are addressed and resolved in good time.</P>
        <P>The Governments are examining the bilateral measures they will need to take to give effect to the relevant St. Andrews amendments.  The Attorney General will advise the Government on any other implications that may arise in light of the final text of the legislation when passed at Westminster.  The Governments are determined to maintain momentum in the process.  The St. Andrews Agreement offers the basis on which we can bring this process to successful finality.</P>
        <P>There is an overwhelming wish in Northern Ireland to see devolution restored.  This was particularly evident when the political parties engaged collectively, as a follow-up to St. Andrews, with Chancellor Gordon Brown prior to his announcement of a financial package for Northern Ireland.  The announcement of the package is a clear demonstration of what can be achieved for the people of Northern Ireland when the parties work together.</P>
        <P>I had meetings with representatives of both Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP in advance of the multi-party talks in Scotland.  I had further meetings with Sinn F&eacute;in on 2 November and the SDLP on 9 November.  At those meetings, we discussed a range of issues of concern to both parties.  I have maintained contact with Prime Minister Blair since St. Andrews and we both remain absolutely determined to ensure that the vision of the Good Friday Agreement will be fully realised.  I expect to meet with him on 4 December in London.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Brown, has promised &pound;50 billion over the next ten years, assuming the parties agree to restore the Assembly, which everybody would support.  When will the Irish Government make known its commitment to financial backing in that regard?  Has the Government considered what major infrastructure projects would be involved, such as development of the Letterkenny-Derry gateway or the Shannon-Erne waterway?  What is the figure, when will it be announced and what projects does the Taoiseach envisage the funding will cover?</P>
        <P>Has there been any progress in the discussions on adjustments to taxation North and South?  I refer specifically to the corporation tax rate of 12.5%, piloted through the Cabinet of the rainbow Government by Deputy Rabbitte and <Col N="22"/>Deputy Bruton.  Parity of taxation was discussed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Finance and it is a matter of interest to business North and South.</P>
        <P>Following the decision yesterday to freeze property in Manchester worth over &pound;2 million belonging to the brother of Thomas Slab Murphy, can the Taoiseach provide an update on the attempts, ongoing for some time, to recover the proceeds of the Northern Bank raid?</P>
        <P>In response to a parliamentary question I tabled last week the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said garda&iacute; had conducted inquiries in Colombia into the activities of the Colombia three.  What was the nature of those inquiries?  Has the Department been in touch with the Colombian authorities on the subject of their becoming a signatory to the Council of Europe convention which allows for imprisonment of persons in this country instead of extradition?  Has the Taoiseach received any response from the Colombian authorities to direct questions put to them by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has put forward a package for infrastructure.  A large portion corresponds to the ongoing costs of Northern Ireland to the British Exchequer but there is an additional sum.  The package consists of &pound;35 billion for the Executive for the next four years and &pound;18 billion in support of a capital investment strategy until 2017.  I have urged the Northern Ireland political parties to revive power-sharing so the people of Northern Ireland can benefit from the increased investment.</P>
        <P>The parties intend to hold further discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the first meeting of the programme for government committee on this and on other demands they have.  We have already helped with a number of projects, including the Ulster Canal, the development of Derry Airport and improvements in the Belfast road, much of the work on which was undertaken by our engineers.  We are examining ways of contributing to the peace process with infrastructural projects in other Border areas.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has made a number of detailed speeches on those matters and we are open to engagement on such projects.  Many projects were put on hold because of difficulties with the Northern Ireland Office, though some progressed.  If the North-South bodies were up and running again, some projects which would be well within our funding capability and would be helpful both North and South, without threatening anybody, could be progressed.</P>
        <P>A number of investigations are ongoing, including the ones to which the Deputy referred.  I have not received any new report on the Northern Bank raid but the file is still live with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI.</P><Col N="23"/>
        <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs held discussions earlier this year on the Colombia three.  I headed an international meeting in which I had agreed to meet the vice-president of Colombia.  He left to deal with another crisis but I spoke to some of his officials and we have maintained communications.  I am not aware of the ongoing investigations being carried out by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>What was the Deputy&rsquo;s final question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked a further question about Colombia becoming a signatory to the relevant Council of Europe convention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  That was one of the issues&mdash;&mdash; </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I also asked about the investigation carried out by garda&iacute; in Colombia and responses from the Colombian authorities to direct questions put by us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has co-operated throughout with the Colombian authorities.  He has held discussions with them but apart from the fact that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has held recent discussions I have not seen any new correspondence or requests from the Colombian authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach concerned about the slippage that has taken place since the St. Andrews Agreement?  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said in the House of Commons last night that there would no longer be nominations to the positions of First Minister and Deputy First Minister but that the parties would indicate their willingness to take those posts when the Assembly met on Friday.  Does the Taoiseach believe there is a major difference between nominating and indicating?  What is his position on that?</P>
        <P>Was it not the expectation after the St. Andrews Agreement that Sinn F&eacute;in would move quickly on policing?  That has not happened.</P>
        <P>Is the slippage because of DUP pressure?  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s assessment of the DUP&rsquo;s willingness to share power?  Does he believe the central commitment to do so exists?</P>
        <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of any side deals having been done?  What undertaking has he given on representation in the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Is there an explicit commitment on that issue about which we ought to be concerned?  Is the Taoiseach concerned the process appears to be in another logjam?  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s position has been that the Attorney General cannot advise on a referendum, mooted by the Taoiseach as a possible requirement arising from the St. Andrews Agreement, until the legislation in the House of Commons is enacted.  Given the guillotine <Col N="24"/>imposed on the legislation in the House of Commons, meaning it went through in one day, the prospect of its being amended is remote.  Is the Taoiseach in a position yet to say whether his Government will hold a referendum arising from the St. Andrews Agreement?  If he is not yet in a such a position when, given that the legislation is before the House of Lords and will be completed today, will he be able to tell the House whether it is his intention to hold a referendum in this jurisdiction?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will endeavour to answer all the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.  The main slippage has taken place in respect of the programme for government committee.  The intention, when we broke up on 13 October in St. Andrews in Scotland, was that the programme for government meeting would be held on the following Tuesday.  Regrettably, that did not take place.  I was concerned about that; it was unhelpful to the process.  I will not enter into the blame game about it but it lost valuable weeks.  The programme for government committee met on Monday.  I always try to keep this constructive so at least that was a comprehensive and good meeting.  It was well attended by senior members on both sides.</P>
        <P>The agreement is that the committee will meet weekly in future.  I hope that process continues.  However, it did create difficulties and we lost valuable time from what was a clear understanding in St. Andrews up to Monday&rsquo;s meeting.  Monday&rsquo;s meeting was important and useful.  The committee dealt with substantive issues.  It pledged it would meet on a weekly basis to deal with policy and preparation issues with the intention that when the Executive is up and running at the end of March the parties would be able to move fully into positions.</P>
        <P>It was always intended that on 14 March the parties would put forward the names of the Ministers who would serve in the Executive.  They will take up their positions and sign the pledge on 26 March.  There have been considerable issues surrounding the pledge of office and the circumstances for taking it.  The two central issues are whether the DUP will engage in power sharing and whether Sinn F&eacute;in will deal comprehensively with policing.  The pledge will deal with both issues when it reaches that stage.</P>
        <P>The pledge of office set out in Schedule 4 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 was amended by the Northern Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Bill in the House of Commons last night by the insertion after paragraph (c) of the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(ca) to promote the interests of the whole community represented in the Northern Ireland Assembly towards the goal of a shared future;</P>
        <P LI="1">(cb) to participate fully in the Executive Committee, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council;</P><Col N="25"/>
        <P LI="1">(cc) to observe the joint nature of the offices of First Minister and deputy First Minister;</P>
        <P LI="1">(cd) to uphold the rule of law based as it is on the fundamental principles of fairness, impartiality and democratic accountability, including support for policing and the courts as set out in paragraph 6 of the St Andrews Agreement;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The pledge deals comprehensively with both issues.  Obviously, until those issues are addressed the agreement of the parties on how they will handle that on Friday is one I support.  We will not get any further on that until a pledge is signed and embraces both issues, that is, power-sharing and support for policing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the pledge be signed on Friday?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  The pledge will be signed in March but what is in the pledge and the basis of the pledge are now agreed.  That was a difficult exercise but it embraces the two issues.  While Friday is important, everybody knows there will not be a development in March until these issues are dealt with.  That must happen before March.  Needless to say, I would like that to happen as soon as possible with regard to the indications from the DUP on its position and the issue of Sinn F&eacute;in dealing with policing.</P>
        <P>The legislation provides that if at any time before 25 March 2007 the Secretary of State considers there is no reasonable prospect that we are on track for devolution in the time specified, it will be possible to abort the process, including the election.  Obviously, I hope that will not be necessary.  If it did happen, we would continue to have the option of plan B.  Everybody is clear on what is the position.</P>
        <P>With regard to side deals, there were no side deals with the Irish Government on any of these issues.  We were asked about a number of issues but we stuck with our present position.  On the issue of Oireachtas representation, I had to say there was an unwillingness in this House to abide by the report of the all-party group, which was prepared some years ago.  However, there was a willingness to deal with a committee of the House, as party leaders had indicated.  I will take it forward on that basis, not on the basis of the all-party discussion.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte is correct that it is unlikely there will be many amendments to the legislation but we must wait and see.  There were a few attempts last night to get amendments through but they were soundly beaten.  If the same happens in the House of Lords today, there should be no requirement for a referendum.  However, the Attorney General wants to wait until the final Act is available.  The referendum was based around an alternative to avoid an election in the North.  I was of the view that we needed neither an election nor a referendum.  I still hold that <Col N="26"/>view but there was no convincing one party of it.  We will have to wait and see what happens in an election.  Deputy Kenny mentioned yesterday my fear about that.  I do not believe it is helpful but the parties have reluctantly agreed to go with the position as per the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>If I am not mistaken, St. Andrew&rsquo;s day falls around this time.  Apart from wishing the people of Scotland well in celebrating their patron saint, perhaps a prayer or two would not go amiss in trying to bring a resolution to the intransigence we are currently trying to overcome.  In the midst of the delays does the Taoiseach see a prospect of other issues giving some momentum and a context or relevance to the process?  I have in mind issues that have been in the news, for example, child abusers.  That issue appears to have been caught up in the politics of Northern Ireland, given the delays in introducing cross-Border legislation to prevent the Republic becoming a haven for paedophiles.  Does such an issue impact on the stand-off positions that are adopted, be they with regard to policing, power sharing or the other matters that crop up?</P>
        <P>In that regard, sectarianism and the sectarian divide, particularly in housing, seem to be getting worse in the North.  Does the Taoiseach envisage a role for the non-sectarian parties in the North, given that much of the attention appears to be concentrated on those who have the most sectarian backgrounds?  Will that role include parties in this House, including Opposition parties, as well as parties in the North?  Could that be seen as an effective catalyst to try to move beyond the sectarian politics which continue to exist, regardless of what agreement is reached?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The memorandum of understanding on information-sharing arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, relating to sex offenders has been negotiated between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the UK Home Office.  The T&aacute;naiste has received Government approval for its signing.  It will be signed next Monday by the T&aacute;naiste and the Home Office Minister at Hillsborough.  The memorandum includes most of the outstanding issues.  It is not the perfect solution we would like if the North-South bodies were fully operational but it avoids some of the difficulties that have occurred.  It is a useful exercise.</P>
        <P>With regard to sectarianism, Deputy Sargent is correct that there are still many worrying issues even though a great deal of work has been done by the parties in an effort to make progress across the peace lines and the sectarian divide.  There has been unprecedented dialogue and many of the groups which receive funding have been trying to broaden their horizons.  That is helpful but the sectarian element was still visible during the summer months, in particular, where people were <Col N="27"/>forced out of housing estates into sectarian areas, and these activities continue.</P>
        <P>A number of initiatives have been taken recently regarding the removal of graffiti and emblems of all sides and kinds from estates.  Projects have been proposed and resources have been provided by the NIO to some loyalist communities in order to end the attempts at ownership of these estates in the face of Nationalists and <i>vice versa</i>.  These have been helpful where they worked.  Parties have also made good efforts at building community relations.</P>
        <P>Progress is being made on the relatively small number of flashpoints that remain for summer parades.  These flashpoints create tension during the months that precede and follow them, so that half the year passes and only the winter period remains for making progress.  Some attempts have been made in that regard because they are extremely important in terms of removing sectarianism.  The more understanding people on all sides have about them, the better.  The only way to deal with the matter is through direct dialogue between the Orange Order and communities.  Such dialogue has been conducted successfully in Derry and it would be helpful if it took place in other areas.  In Drumcree, both sides need to find a solution to the issue because it remains a problem for Portadown and surrounding areas.  On the Lower Ormeau Road, difficulties arise in terms of coming back through the flashpoint of Ardoyne, where at 9 o&rsquo;clock every 12 July, one can be sure issues will arise.  These outstanding issues, which continue to create sectarian tensions, are not many in number but they are extremely important.  Apart from the political issue, we could move them on.</P>
        <P>In terms of the Oireachtas, if we established an all-party committee and engaged with Northern parties, we could help in a meaningful way.  Airing and discussing these issues in this House with representatives from the North would help, as well as give us a chance &mdash; if I can express myself diplomatically &mdash; to expose people to the reality of some of these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach confident that the proposals and timeframe set out at St. Andrews will result in participation by the DUP in a new Executive?</P>
        <P>Does he accept that the issue of policing is one for all the parties, not only Sinn F&eacute;in, and that the DUP and the British Government have to endorse a system of policing which is accountable, under democratic control and leaves behind the sectarianism and repressive legacy of the past?</P>
        <P>Does he further agree that the appointment of the Commissioner for Victims in the North by Mr. Peter Hain was an insensitive and disastrous decision?  Does he know that the appointee is totally unacceptable to many victims and that the appointment has been challenged in the courts?  Is he aware that the High Court in Belfast has <Col N="28"/>referred Mr. Hain&rsquo;s decision to the British Attorney General and that an inquiry has been ordered into the way the matter was addressed?  Has he raised this issue with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the second issue raised by the Deputy, I am aware that the appointment of the interim Commissioner for Victims is being investigated by the British Attorney General.  The process was regarded as not being properly followed, issues arose with regard to cross-community support and the matter is under investigation.  I have not raised the matter with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, because I have not met him since it arose.  We are awaiting the outcome of the investigation by the Attorney General, so I do not think it necessary for me to raise the matter.  I do not know how quickly the investigation will be completed.</P>
        <P>On the issue of policing, my reply to Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s question outlined the contents of the pledge and what people must sign up to before we can bring the Executive into being.  I hope everybody will sign the pledge.  If everybody signs the pledge, everybody is signed up to policing and because nobody is excluded from signing the pledge, nobody is excluded from signing up to policing.  Deputy Ferris will be aware of the discussions we have had on the St. Andrews Agreement and that his own party has to deal with the policing issues.  I understand that Sinn F&eacute;in is following a process, which was explained to me, and I hope that process will be completed sooner rather than later.  That is a matter for the organisation of the Deputy&rsquo;s own party affairs, which are not my responsibility.  He knows, however, that we cannot establish a working Executive next March unless the pledge is signed and that signing it will require his party to make a decision.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the difficulties surrounding MI5 which have been raised by Sinn F&eacute;in and other parties.  We have been endeavouring to find a resolution to these and, in fairness to the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, he is personally and directly engaged in trying to resolve the issue.  Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP have raised the issue, Deputy Ferris has expressed his views on it and we have been supportive in seeking a resolution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the fact that, with one garda for every 558 people, the Carlow-Kildare Garda division has the lowest ratio of garda&iacute; to population in the State; that serious crime in the Carlow-Kildare division has <Col N="29"/>risen by 55% since 2000; that, at 30%, the detection rate in the division is one of the lowest in the State; that there is no Garda barracks in Leixlip and that there is no 24 hour Garda barracks in Celbridge, Maynooth or Leixlip, which have a combined population of 45,324; and the refusal of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take effective action on the issues outlined, citing operational matters as his reason.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the decision by the Minister for Education and Science to withdraw the home-school-community liaison scheme from Athenry and Loughrea vocational schools in County Galway and many other schools nationwide; whether the Minister is aware of the bridge that the scheme has built between the schools in question and the many dysfunctional families who need all the help they can get to keep their children at school, thereby helping to reduce anti-social behaviour; and to call on her to expand this vital scheme rather than have it terminated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the proposed transfer of patients and services of St. Lukes Hospital, Rathgar, to St. James Hospital on an incremental basis to conclude in 2011.  The loss to patients of support buildings and services that were built up by cancer survivors or families of former patients over a period of decades is a blow to those who wish to create a less stressful environment for patients.  It is difficult to understand the referral of 20,000 additional patients to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, which is currently overstretched and for which additional clinical staff, although sought, have not been provided.  The Minister for Health and Children should outline the rationale for such a radical move given the proven track record of this hospital.</P>

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate a matter of major national and local importance, namely, why the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, on the basis of information available to him from monitoring committee reports, including assessments of continuing spend under the national development plan, expects the original forecasts for Exchequer and EU spending in the BMW region will have been realised in full by the end of the programme period in six weeks&rsquo; time while there remains a &euro;3.75 billion underspend, with a &euro;500 million underspend on roads.  On the question of motorways and dual carriageways planned for 2010, no mention is made of the N5, N26, N4, N2, N14 and N3, and only 20% of EU co-funded projects can be financed beyond 2006.</P>

	<P>Pierre Gemayel, the Christian Lebanese Minister, was assassinated yesterday and it is feared this may lead to all-out civil war.  Has the Government considered the serious implications for the 158 members of the First Southern Brigade who are serving in the region with the United Nations?  The Defence Forces have a long history of serving in the Lebanon.</P>
        <P>One of the greatest challenges facing the United Nations is the conflict in Darfur in Sudan.  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether we will have a debate on the genocide in that region before the Christmas recess?</P>
        <P>Are we to have the much-promised debate on the Harris report into the decline of spoken Irish, particularly in primary schools, before the Christmas recess?</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has done a U-turn regarding his arrogant position on the register of electors; the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht affairs has done a U-turn in respect of his obstinacy over &ldquo;Dingle Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In view of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report and recommendation, will the Government make a single-line amendment to the relevant legislation so owners of property will not be required to retreat in the event of an invasion of their privacy or a break-in by would-be burglars?  Single-line legislation would not cost anything and the issue is not a constitutional matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, Deputy Gilmore has been pressing the Government on the refurbishment of the register of electors.  He published a Bill that would take into account the additional time necessary for this process.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government stated yesterday the changes he is now agreeing to would be facilitated by way of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2006.  The deadline is Saturday, 25 November but the Bill is not listed for this week.  Will the Taoiseach clarify how the Minister, Deputy Roche, will deal with the matter?</P>
        <P>I wrote to my county manager asking him for the list of deletions from the register of electors.  Such lists have been furnished widely to colleagues in the House.  I got a letter back eventually&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not enough for me either, but we will let him in somehow.</P>
        <P>Yesterday evening, when speaking on the Book of Estimates, I referred to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, who had entered the Chamber without her script.  When I asked her for it, the usual procedure when a Minister speaks on the Estimates or on any other important occasion, she told me she was not obliged to furnish it.  That is not the approach we should have in this House, since it lowers the standards previously adhered to.</P>
        <P>I pointed out to the Minister her foolish spending on prefabs.  We have prefab villages growing up around schools across the country and this year the Minister is spending more than &euro;20 million on renting them.  If that money was spent on providing permanent extensions to schools, we would achieve far better value for money.  It is a scandal that we pay approximately &euro;60,000 per annum to rent a prefab at a school but will not provide the same amount to it for a permanent extension.  It is wasteful and shows the Minister failing to address the relevant issues; I regret that she is not here to hear that point.</P>
        <P>I welcome the increase of which the Minister spoke regarding her departmental Estimates for the coming year.  She outlined many areas where it will be felt.  However, she must urgently address the fact that over the next five years there will be approximately 60,000 extra children at primary school, equating to 2,300 classrooms.  Planning for those additional schools should now be well advanced.  We will have a situation like that in Mullingar, where there are no places for children at primary school.  Parents must drive six, eight or ten miles out of town with their children to find a school at which they might be enrolled and that is not good enough.  There must be a forward planning section in the Department that can examine those areas of expansion and plan in advance so that we do not end up with this ridiculous situation permanently.</P>
        <P>The Minister trumpeted an increase of 17% for the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and I also welcome it.  However, she did not mention that 50% of schools in the country do not have access to NEPS.  At the same time, we have a NEPS office in Mullingar, only one third of which is being used, despite the fact that rent is being paid for its entirety.  That is an absolute waste of money.  Why did the Department, in co-operation with the Office of Public Works, OPW, rent that large space without using it?  There is a crying need to expand NEPS and that is not good enough.</P>
        <P>Since the Department of Education and Science has this space, why is it not using it for <Col N="37"/>an advance party in the context of it being decentralised to Mullingar?  Would that not be the best use of taxpayers&rsquo; money?  That does not seem to matter where the Minister is concerned.  It is a question of throwing the money around and seeing what happens to it.</P>
        <P>My time is drawing to a close but Deputy Ring has indicated that he will wait until later, when he will make his major contribution.</P>
        <P>Regarding value for money in primary schools, an excellent service provides special needs assistance across the country, but the Minister must establish a structure within schools into which special needs assistants doing good work can fit.  In many schools, they are not sure where they fit in and neither are the principals.  There is no programme to assess their effectiveness, use or how they might be best deployed around schools.  It is crucial that the 8,000 special needs assistants be absorbed into a formal structure so that we might know how they are being looked after.</P>
        <P>It is outrageous that approximately 150 students have been refused higher education grants because their parents happen to have availed of the special savings incentive accounts, SSIA, scheme.  I am aware of three such cases in a single local authority area.  Since there are approximately 60 local authorities processing grants for students across the country, we can estimate that there are perhaps 150 or 200 such students.</P>
        <P>The SSIA payment, which came from the Government, was meant to be a tax rebate.  When one has one&rsquo;s P60 and asks the Department of Finance whether it will add in the tax rebate that one is receiving through the SSIA, it answers in the negative.  However, the Department of Education and Science takes it into account.  It is backward-looking and prevents genuine students from attending college.  The Minister should have addressed it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the Abridged Estimates of public expenditure for 2007, which reflect further consolidation and prioritisation of Government spending after several years of unprecedented growth.  I am particularly pleased that the allocation of more than &euro;698 million available to the arts, sport and tourism sectors, an increase of 17.6% on the 2006 allocation, will enable me to maintain the thrust of State support for these sectors.  The 2007 Estimates provide for a combined allocation of more than &euro;216.5 million for my Department and the National Gallery of Ireland, an increase of 8.65% over 2006.</P>
        <P>The Arts Council is the main vehicle through which State support is channelled to the arts and the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to this sector is demonstrated with a further increase of 11% in funding to the council in 2007.  This means total funding for the council will have increased by some 52% in just three years, from &euro;52.5 mil<Col N="38"/>lion in 2004 to &euro;80 million in 2007.  The Government is conscious of the significant benefits to quality of life that accrue to all levels of society in every area from investment in the arts.  Artists and arts organisations should see this increase in the Arts Council funding as proof of the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to supporting the valuable contribution they make to Irish life and society.</P>
        <P>Schemes designed to lead to the provision of a high-standard arts and culture infrastructure and allow greater access to the participation of arts and culture activities on as broad a geographic basis as possible have been in operation for some time.  The 2007 capital allocation of &euro;43 million for cultural infrastructure will allow continued funding of the arts and culture capital enhancement support scheme, ACCESS, covering some 44 ongoing capital projects, most of which are now at an advanced stage.  It will also facilitate the commencement of a new ACCESS II scheme, for which over 150 applications were received by the deadline of Friday last.  It will also allow me to fund a range of other capital projects, chief among them the rebuilding of the Wexford Theatre Royal and the refurbishment of the Gaiety and Gate theatres in Dublin.</P>
        <P>In the 2007 Estimates, funding for national cultural institutions and projects has increased by 9.4% over the 2006 allocation.  Of particular note is the 70% increase in the capital provision for the National Library of Ireland, which will facilitate its exhibition and acquisitions programme.  I have also secured major increases in the current and capital allocations provided to the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the National Concert Hall, the Chester Beatty Library and the Crawford Art Gallery, Cork, averaging 29% in current funding and 38% in capital funding.</P>
        <P>These major increases will facilitate the implementation of acquisition policies and enhance outreach and educational programmes at these institutions, and enable the National Concert Hall to replace obsolescent musical equipment.  Of particular note is my determination to enhance the facilities of Crawford Art Gallery, which is now a national cultural institution.  To this end, I am providing a 71% increase in current funding and a 60% increase in capital funding for this new national cultural institution.  I have also secured an allocation of more than &euro;11.7 million for the National Gallery of Ireland, an increase of almost 25% on the provision made available to the gallery in 2006.</P>
        <P>The National Archives of Ireland holds the household returns of the 1901 and 1911 censuses for the island of Ireland.  These returns are of great interest because they are the earliest returns that still exist in their entirety and also because they cover the entire island.  The digitisation of the 1901 and 1911 census records will proceed with the provision of &euro;1.1 million.</P>
        <P>I have also decided to support the day-to-day working costs of Exploration Station, the <Col N="39"/>National Children&rsquo;s Science Museum, with &euro;250,000 in current funding for 2007.  The museum will encourage children to explore and discover at their own pace.  One of Exploration Station&rsquo;s core goals is to provide the opportunity for children to explore and discover science, history, culture and the arts.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will provide the capital requirements of the museum.</P>
        <P>The Irish film industry continues to be an important medium through which to showcase not only Ireland itself, but its culture and indigenous talent.  The total Estimates provision for 2007 for the Irish Film Board represents an increase of 15% on the original 2006 allocation.  This increase will enable the board to continue its essential role of developing and supporting the Irish film sector.  It will facilitate the board in marketing Ireland as a film location and, in particular, will assist the work of the newly opened office in Los Angeles in raising the profile of the Irish audiovisual industry abroad.  This provision underlies the sustained Government support for the board, which has seen its total allocations increase by 60% since 2002.</P>
        <P>I will also increase the funding available to Culture Ireland, which works to promote Irish culture and the arts abroad, from &euro;3 million to &euro;4.5 million, a 50% increase over the 2006 allocation.</P>
        <P>A total budget of more than &euro;316 million will be made available to the sports sector in 2007, an increase of 30% over 2006.  Sport plays a vital role in our society in promoting healthy lifestyles, creating a sense of identity and belonging, channelling energy in rewarding activity and bringing people together.  The Government has spent more than &euro;900 million on sport since 1997.  This unprecedented level of investment is clear evidence of the importance the Government attaches to the establishment of modern, well-equipped and well-managed sporting facilities supported by a wide range of programmes.  These developments are of significant benefit to communities.</P>
        <P>The 2007 budget for the Irish Sports Council has increased by 20%, or more than &euro;8 million, to more than &euro;49 million.  The continued increased level of funding will allow the council to realise fully the commitments in its strategic plan to increase participation in sport and improve the levels of performance by our elite athletes in world-class competition.</P>
        <P>Funding is also being provided for the Institute of Sport, which was launched in July.  In the lead up to the 2008 Olympics and Paralympics, the institute will concentrate on 14 focus sports, with some 90 athletes involved under the carding scheme.  2007 will see the institute up and running with increased funding and key professional and scientific staff in place to ensure optimum preparations are under way for Beijing 2008.</P>
        <P>The newly established national governing body, Horse Sport Ireland, will be responsible for <Col N="40"/>devising and implementing strategies for the development and promotion of an internationally competitive Irish horse sport industry.  Provision for funding for this new body is included in the 2007 budget for the Irish Sports Council.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Irish Sports Council will be in a position to extend the network of local sports partnerships through which sports initiatives at local level are delivered and co-ordinated, as well as maintaining support for specific initiatives for which I earmarked funding in previous years.  These include the development of hurling and camogie on a nationwide basis, the development of Gaelic games in Dublin and programmes to attract more women to participate in sport.</P>
        <P>The Government has provided tangible support for the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road stadium with a 2007 provision of &euro;76 million.  Although it is not possible to estimate the length of time that will be required to complete the planning process, the project has proceeded on schedule up to this point.  I am hopeful that by the end of 2009, we will see the completion of the redevelopment of the stadium, which will cater for the international rugby and soccer requirements of the IRFU and FAI.  Ireland&rsquo;s international rugby and soccer squads will then have a platform on which to showcase their skills and supporters will be able to view these games in a modern and comfortable environment.  The recent announcement by UEFA that a European club football final could take place in the new stadium is also a major boost to the project and to sport, especially soccer, in Ireland.</P>
        <P>A capital allocation of &euro;30 million has been set aside in 2007 towards phase one of a campus of sports facilities at Abbotstown.  This first phase will provide for the development of modern facilities, including pitches and support facilities, for the three major field sports, rugby, soccer and Gaelic games, with shared core facilities including accommodation, fitness area, medical and gym facilities.  Facilities to cater for more than 30 indoor sports as well as community playing pitches and support facilities are also included in the plan.</P>
        <P>The Government has made a considerable effort to bring our sporting infrastructure into line with best international standards.  In many ways, the sports campus can be seen as a real and tangible symbol of Ireland&rsquo;s determination to compete on the international stage by ensuring our sports men and women have at their disposal cutting edge sporting facilities.  It is a vital component in our developing sporting infrastructure and will provide the ideal venue for our elite athletes in their preparations for future sporting events.  I am optimistic the provision of such modern and well-equipped sporting facilities will give our sportsmen and women the edge in international competition in years to come.</P>
        <P>The refurbishment of the former State laboratory at Abbotstown as the new headquarters for the FAI is under way and this will be the first <Col N="41"/>tangible evidence of the sports campus becoming a reality.  It is anticipated the FAI will relocate to its new headquarters by the middle of next year.</P>
        <P>Funds will be set aside in 2007 for the operation and management of the National Aquatic Centre.  The recent Supreme Court order means the current operators of the National Aquatic Centre, Dublin Waterworld Limited, will leave the centre with effect from 30 November and that possession will be restored to the State company, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited.  Once under new management, an immediate examination of the centre will be undertaken so we can all be reassured it is safe and sound.</P>
        <P>With regard to the provision of quality sports and recreational facilities throughout the country, the total 2007 capital budget for grants for sports facilities, including swimming pools, will be almost &euro;88 million.  This will be used to meet payments in respect of commitments already made as well as those to be made in 2007 under the sports capital and local authority swimming pool programmes.  Between 1998 and 2006, almost &euro;470 million has been allocated to more than 5,700 projects throughout the country under the sports capital programme.  Under the local authority swimming pool programme, 23 swimming pool projects have been completed since 2000 and a further 15 are under construction.</P>
        <P>I have secured an allocation of &euro;154 million, an increase of 9% in the 2006 budget, for the tourism sector.  This increased allocation is the largest ever Exchequer budget for the tourism industry, representing the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to it.  The international market continues to present intense and increasing competition.  The 12.5% increase in the tourism marketing fund to &euro;45 million builds on the increased funding provided in previous years, representing the largest ever marketing budget for the promotion of Irish tourism.  This record budget will enable Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland to ratchet up their marketing activities in 2007, with a particular emphasis on an enhanced regional focus and new marketing strategies for North America and new and developing markets.</P>
        <P>The past four and a half years have been tough for tourism and travel worldwide.  We have responded to these challenges through a programme of reform of the State&rsquo;s tourism structures and their operational strategies in human resources.  It has resulted in encouraging figures.  Last week&rsquo;s CSO figures show overall trips to Ireland for the year to end-September up 11.2%, Britain by 7.6%, mainland Europe by 18.8%, North America by 11% and other long-haul destinations by 7.5%.  Revenue earnings are up 7% for the first half of the year.  There were 90,000 extra visitors for the Ryder Cup.  Domestic tourism is growing and average hotel room occupancy rates increased from 62% to 66% in the first eight months of 2006.</P>
        <P>I commend the Estimates to the House.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="42"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>While a more in-depth debate on these Estimates will occur at the Select Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I want to give an overview of the three main sectors for which the Minister has responsibility.</P>
        <P>Despite the increase in the numbers of tourists entering Ireland, the level of tourism spend has remained static.  People are visiting Ireland for shorter stays and are, therefore, spending less.  Many of these extra visitors come from Poland, Latvia and Lithuania to visit their relatives and friends working in Ireland.  They do not have the same disposable income as, say, American or UK visitors.</P>
        <P>Dublin&rsquo;s tourism industry has been transformed into a buoyant market with tourists visiting it throughout the year.  Some 20 years ago, it was seasonal but now tourist coaches are parked outside Trinity College Dublin all year round.  Traditionally, the west and the south west depended on tourism revenue.  With the decline in farming and fishing and the closure of many light engineering industries, the south west and west are now more dependent on tourism.  Unfortunately, the number of visitors coming into these areas is in decline.  Between 1999 and 2004, the west lost over 3 million bed-nights.  Major pressure has been brought to bear on tourism enterprises such as hotels, bed and breakfasts, guesthouses and restaurants.  Only for the domestic tourism market and the spending power of the domestic consumer, tourism in Kilkenny, Westport and many places in County Kerry would be under serious threat.  Westport, for example, is 90% dependent on the domestic tourist.  If interest rates rise again, the domestic tourism market may slow down with consequences for restaurants and tourism accommodation outside Dublin.</P>
        <P>The Government claims it has a low taxation policy but it piles on taxes indirectly.  The number of stealth taxes affecting the tourism industry has put it under pressure.  Local authorities must increase rates, water and service charges to business because they are not getting enough funding from central Government.  As the Minister is aware, County Kerry has the highest rates, next to Limerick.  This puts extraordinary pressure on bed and breakfasts and hotels in the region.</P>
        <P>Much has to be said for the restructuring of the State&rsquo;s tourism institutions.  The regional tourism authorities were not working.  Most of their powers have been taken away and centralised in F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Will the RTAs be just talking shops or will they give direction?  Consultants could easily produce similar reports and not cost half as much.  I hope the Minister will give the committee a detailed breakdown of what will be their role.</P>
        <P>This year the Arts Council applied for overall funding of &euro;120 million.  It received &euro;8 million, an increase of 11% in last year&rsquo;s funding.  I accept that is more than the average but the council must provide for theatrical tours for the Abbey <Col N="43"/>and Druid.  There will be more theatrical tours using the facilities provided in, say, Portlaoise and Letterkenny, for the past 20 years.  Recently the Druid Theatre toured in Kerry with &ldquo;The Year of the Hiker&rdquo;.  However, funding of &euro;2 million will not be made available to the council until next year.  I understand the council has another commitment to the Abbey for &euro;1.7 million and a small grant of &euro;1.7 million for product development.  The increase, therefore, has already nearly been spent.  This year only one in three individuals who apply for funding from the Arts Council will receive it.  The Minister should consider how many artists and groups will be disappointed.</P>
        <P>Arts centres around the country are under considerable pressure to survive and to pay their managers.  I thought a scheme might be introduced to provide subsistence to managers, funded through the Arts Council.  There is an indirect system but no direct subsistence.  That will not happen now.</P>
        <P>The pre-budget Estimate for the arts is not as good as it seems.  Many people will be very disappointed.  There will be no increases on last year to those who receive funding, although the stealth taxes that affect tourism will also affect those working in the arts.  This is not the utopia that the Minister would have us believe.  How much time do I have left?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of sports, I am delighted that the Minister is spending money from the national lottery that Fine Gael and Labour set up so well in the 1980s.  That much-maligned coalition Government had the vision which enables this Minister and his colleagues to look good as they distribute money all over the country.  I welcome that fact.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that money is being spent to develop the profile of sport.  However, there are problems.  In a survey I conducted of 1,400 primary schools, only 23% had sports halls.  I appealed to the Minister a few weeks ago to give priority to any applications he receives from schools and local sports clubs.</P>
        <P>This alone will not resolve the problem.  There must be a national commitment to installing sports halls in schools.  There is a major obesity problem with 300,000 young people identified as obese or overweight, a figure increasing by 10,000 annually.</P>

        <P>Part one of the saga of the National Aquatic Centre has come to an end but the problem is rooted in the fact that while the building looks fine, it is defective and leaking.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There are structural faults in the building.  I have called on the Minister several times to commission a proper structural engineer&rsquo;s report.  He mentioned this today.  One would not expect 25 sq. m. of the roof of a modern building to blow off.  It is crazy to say that there was no structural fault in this building.  I acknowledge the merits of the building from several points of view and it will be a great facility, but it needs to be repaired.  I hope the Minister brings in an independent, reputable, perhaps international, group that will have no prejudice coming into the examination.  It should carry out a fair examination so that we all know once and for all whether there are defects in the building.  If so, we should repair them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion regarding the pre-budget Estimates.  Unlike the two previous speakers, I wish to address it in general rather than confine my comments to one Department.  The 2007 gross pre-budget Estimates provide for expenditure of just over &euro;54 billion, comprising &euro;46.7 billion in current expenditure and &euro;7.6 billion in capital expenditure.  In real terms, that is an increase on the forecasted outturn for this year of &euro;4 billion, or a little over 8%.</P>
        <P>A good balance has been struck between making necessary provision for public services and ensuring that we maintain a prudent and sustainable budgetary position.  The actions of the Minister for Finance must meet several criteria but should not be seen to be inflationary.  The capital expenditure meets the growing demand for infrastructure which is being met through various projects but specifically Transport 21.</P>
        <P>Between 1997 and 2005, the average annual growth rate has been 7%.  Our debt to GDP ratio has declined.  In 1997, it was 65%; it is now down to 27% or 28%.  The level of employment exceeds 2 million for the first time in the history of the State.  It is hard to believe that 15 years ago only 1 million people worked.  Unemployment has fallen from 10% in 1997 to a little over 4%.  There has been considerable debate about pensions but the <Col N="45"/>pensions reserve fund was valued at &euro;17.5 billion at the end of September.</P>
        <P>Some Opposition Members have commented in the past that the country&rsquo;s economic success would have happened irrespective of who was in government and is due to external factors.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  As a people, and as a Government, we created the economic conditions, in fiscal policy, and through education and training.  Social partnership agreements in particular have enabled the economy to develop.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a real increase in expenditure across all Departments in this Book of Estimates.  That is in excess of the outturn for the rate of inflation, indicating that there will be no reduction in any service provided by the existing programmes and providing scope for all Departments to increase their activity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Between 2000 and 2005, some 78 new schools were built at primary and post-primary levels and 23 new schools were under construction.  Almost 400 large-scale refurbishments took place and approximately 50 new schools or projects are under construction.  These figures may sound meaningless but in my area, Lucan, during that period they included three new primary schools, Lucan Educate Together, Griffeen Valley Educate Together and Archbishop Ryan national school, and one secondary school.  This year, two secondary schools, Col&aacute;iste cois Life in Lucan, and Col&aacute;iste Br&iacute;d in Clondalkin have opened with capacities of 600 and 800 respectively.  That is the real development into which the Book of Estimates translates for the people I represent.</P>
        <P>There has been much talk about the rapid population growth in the west of Dublin due to economic success.  That is the area I represent and its change from a three to a four seat constituency reflects the rise in population.  The list of new schools, in addition to those that were extended, shows we are meeting the demands of the people coming to live in this area.  I was taken by a point made by Deputy Paul McGrath earlier.  He spoke about the need for better forward planning by the Department in regard to schools and education.  He is right, but this is not only a matter for the Department of Education and Science; local authorities must put together sustainable plans and make site and other provision for schools rather than having <i>ad hoc</i> development.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to believe we are living in the same country.  Last Friday, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was in my constituency to turn the sod for a brand new school in Adamstown.  What was most interesting and unique about this is that while so many hundred housing units are built, they are all currently unoccupied.  The sod for this new school was turned before there is a single resident in Adamstown.  The school will be built and operational by September 2007.  That is an example of proper planning and development working hand in hand.  Adamstown <Col N="46"/>was probably the first strategic development zone to come on stream but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the exception, not the rule.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I use it as a model.  I take Deputy Costello&rsquo;s point fully.  We can all look at examples of where things have not worked in the past but, specifically, this is a model where the sod was turned before a single person is living in the area and by September of next year that school will be operational.  That is the way it should be done.  The Department of Education and Science, to which Deputy Paul McGrath referred earlier, is only one of the elements &mdash; other partners such as the local authority are required to engage in this process also.  I agree that this is the way we need to strategically plan and develop.</P>
        <P>I have been a member of a school board of management for a number of years.  The proposed increase in capitation is more significant than in previous years.  At primary level the basic rate will increase by &euro;18 per pupil next year.  That is 50% more than the rate of increase last year.  That means that every primary school will get &euro;163.50 from January to cover expenses.  In addition, the ancillary services grant is going up by &euro;6.50 to &euro;145.50 per pupil.  The overall increase is approximately &euro;24.50.</P>
        <P>A 300 pupil school, which is a little smaller than my local school, would receive in excess of &euro;90,000 per annum.  That is, effectively, an increase of &euro;7,000 or &euro;8,000 which is a significant amount.  It is probably the largest single increase we have ever received by way of capitation.  My local school&rsquo;s board of management considers this is a realistic budget from which to deliver the necessary services of caretaking, cleaning, heating, lighting, etc.</P>
        <P>It is a pity the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, has left the Chamber as I wished to compliment him.  At the end of his speech he briefly referred to the provision of &euro;88 million for local recreational facilities.  That includes the swimming pool programme, the sports capital programme etc.  I have lived all my life in Clondalkin and I still live there.  My 14 year old son, who is a sports enthusiast, is enjoying facilities that did not exist in my time.  When I was his age there was not a single sports hall in Clondalkin and not a single sports club had a changing facility.  When I was 14, the first swimming pool was opened in Clondalkin.  Next year, it will be replaced by a brand new swimming pool.</P>
        <P>Members on all sides would acknowledge that the sports capital programme has delivered local sporting facilities around the country that could never have been envisaged.  The advent of changing facilities has afforded girls an opportunity to participate in sports, especially soccer and GAA games.  The level of female membership of sports clubs is increasing because the facilities are in place.  I acknowledge what the Minister has <Col N="47"/>achieved but I wish to speak with him about a couple of key projects.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Funding is in place and every year the stock of sporting and recreational facilities is increasing significantly.  It is probably time for the Minister to commence a second swimming pool programme because, as other speakers like Deputy Deenihan have stated, obesity is a major problem.  It is important for children to be involved in sport from a young age.  The existing swimming pool programme is very successful and popular.  It is co-funded by the Department and local authorities.  There has been a keen interest in this programme.  Local authorities such as South Dublin County Council have bought into the programme.  It has two swimming pools, one in Tallaght and one in Clondalkin, both well advanced in construction.  I would like to see phase two of the swimming pool programme initiated.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, on the Book of Estimates.  He has achieved a balance between capital and current expenditure without having a negative or inflationary impact on the economy.  I commend the Estimates to the House.</P>

	<P>Never has so much money been available to a Government to provide every man, woman and child in this tiny nation of 4 million people with sufficient resources to live in comfort, yet never has so much taxpayers&rsquo; money been wasted and squandered.</P>
        <P>Since the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, gave us a budget surplus ten years ago, each successive Minister for Finance has had an abundance of riches.  Ten years of prosperity should have been harnessed into a great plan to eliminate poverty.  Alas, there was no one in Government with a grand vision.  The one big initiative of the Government was the setting aside of &euro;2 billion in the national development plan in 2000 for large-scale national, structural and project development in the 37 RAPID or disadvantaged areas throughout the country, rural and urban.  Project co-ordinators were employed, communities were mobilised, projects were identified and &euro;2 billion was to be set aside for spending on the programme.  It was all smoke and mirrors.  It was a lie.  Only &euro;5 million was spent on preparatory work up to 2002.  When the general election took place in 2002 and the Government was re-elected, the RAPID programme was jettisoned and the &euro;2 billion vanished into thin air.  A trickle of dormant accounts funding is all that remains to keep the dream alive &mdash; the miserly largesse of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs that is doled out in smoky committee rooms around the country as the gift of the Minister.</P>
        <P>The Progressive Democrats philosophy of the unfettered marketplace became the order of the day and has remained so throughout the past dec<Col N="48"/>ade.  Fianna F&aacute;il has accepted without question the major Progressive Democrats input into the approach to the economy.  The reneging on the RAPID programme was the defining moment of ten years of Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government.  Instead of endeavouring to build a strong cohesive society, the Government&rsquo;s role has been primarily to facilitate the private sector with tax breaks, to curtail regulation and inspection of product and employment and to deprive the public sector of resources and supports.  The Government&rsquo;s policy mantra is straight out of <i>Animal Farm</i>, &ldquo;Private is good, public is bad.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The ugly face of capitalism is evident in the sale of public lands for private hospitals by the Minister for Health and Children and the sale of local authorities&rsquo; land banks to private developers and speculators when tens of thousands of households are desperately seeking to acquire homes.  There are 60,000 more applicants on the housing list.  That is double the level of ten years ago.  Profit at all costs is the name of the game.  Instead of a caring society we have a vulgar economy.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, gangland killings, drug and alcohol abuse, wanton violence and mindless vandalism destroy the quality of life for many urban communities.  The rape of young children, the assassination of a young mother in north County Dublin and the gangland execution of a man in my constituency last week are now common occurrences that were unthinkable ten years ago.  I raised the issue of anti-social behaviour on the Adjournment last night.  On Sunday morning, the windscreens of 14 cars were smashed in the Stoneybatter-Oxmantown area.  A Polish national was beaten up on the same morning.  On the previous Wednesday, tyres were slashed in the same area.  These types of events are happening on a regular basis the length and breadth of the country and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has nothing except bluff and bluster to offer to deal with it.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The treatment of our elderly in nursing homes is a scandal as is the appalling condition of accident and emergency units for patients throughout the country.  These are the real monuments and legacies of the Government.  The estimated cost of running the State next year is &euro;54 million.  It is a large sum of money but will it make life better for young people who are in need of child care and smaller school classes?</P>
        <P>Will it make life better for workers who have to travel increasingly longer distances and spend more hours dealing with congestion on polluted streets to get to work?  Will it make life better for young families who cannot afford to buy a home of their own?  Will it make life better for people with a disability who cannot access independent living or for the elderly who fear the neglect and inadequacy of nursing home care or the sick who dread the trolleys of the accident and emergency departments, MRSA and the winter vomiting bug on a hospital ward in the coming months?</P><Col N="49"/>
        <P>The Government has wasted and squandered for ten years.  These are the real issues that put people before profit, that determine whether a set of Estimates and a new budget benefit society or just the economy, and a certain cosseted section of that society.  The Estimates for each Department give some indication of the Government&rsquo;s true intentions.  We must wait for the budget to get the full picture and see the extent to which the forthcoming election colours the final figures and the final allocations.  The Departments of Justice, Equality, and Law Reform, Education and Science and Health and Children have received substantial increases in the region of 10% while the Department of Defence has received less than half this amount.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Undoubtedly, the Minister for Finance is bowing to pressure from his backbenchers to spend generously in the big spending Departments which are election sensitive.  Despite his protestations to the contrary, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has already signalled in the Estimates his willingness to splurge in 2007, as his predecessor, Charlie McCreevy, did in 2002 to buy the forthcoming election.</P>
        <P>When the crunch comes, as it always does in an election year, Fianna F&aacute;il has an unerring ability to metamorphose Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s electoral interests into the national interest.  I wait with bated breath for an election budget giveaway that will be packaged with protestations of prudency, the national interest and national responsibility.</P>
        <P>Nothing can hide the fact that the Department of Defence is the Cinderella of the spending Departments.  The increase in the 2007 Book of Estimates is a mere 4.6% compared to an average of more than 8% in all Departments.  This increase does not compensate for the steady erosion of funding for the Defence Forces over the past ten years.  A 4.6% increase will barely keep pace with inflation which has been approaching this mark over the past six months.  Therefore, the Estimates for the Department of Defence represent no significant increase in year-on spending.</P>
        <P>Moreover, while the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, indulges in self-congratulations, the reality remains that, over the past ten years, Defence spending has fallen by 50% from 1.3% of GNP to only 0.65% of GNP today.  This is having a damaging effect on the morale of officers and ordinary members of the Defence Forces who believe that the Government does not attach sufficient importance to their needs.  Contrast with the larger budgets supplied for defence spending among other European Governments.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s commitments to United Nations missions overseas have increased substantially in recent years.  At present, our troops are deployed to every trouble spot around the globe.  The Defence Force quota of 10% of the Permanent Defence Forces on United Nations duty and missions is stretched to its upper limit.  At such a time, Defence spending should also be increased to meet these responsibilities and to ensure our <Col N="50"/>soldiers have the best equipment, best training and knowledge to carry out their international duties.</P>
        <P>We are likely to get another &ldquo;squandermania&rdquo; from the Government in the forthcoming budget.  What has been spent hitherto has been spent badly.  The quality of society has disimproved.  Following on from what the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism said in regard to Lansdowne Road and Croke Park, the amount of money provided to those national stadia is welcome, but nothing has been given to improve the quality of life for the people in the areas.  Croke Park is an 82,000 plus stadium and yet not a cent has been made available to provide a single parking place for those 82,000 people.  There are no park and ride facilities or car parks.  No attempt has been made to get public transport to take people to Croke Park.  In other words, people have not been a consideration for the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the publication of the abridged Estimates for 2007 and, in particular, the commitment shown to maintaining high levels of provision for the wide range of essential public services and for the continued growth of infrastructural programmes across all Departments in response to the needs of an expanding population and a growing vibrant economy.</P>
        <P>Almost &euro;2.9 billion is being provided for my Department in 2007.  This is an overall increase of 6% over the provision for 2006, providing the biggest ever Government spend on local government.  It is appropriate that this should be the case.  We face phenomenal challenges across the functional areas for which my Department is responsible.</P>
        <P>The major global problem of climate change, the pressures that arise from rapid population growth, the challenge of providing housing in record quantities, the ongoing challenge of providing the infrastructure to support sustainable communities, responsibility for securing and enhancing our environment and for protecting our very considerable built heritage and the critical responsibility for protecting Ireland&rsquo;s biodiversity to the less elevated but equally important responsibility for waste policy all fall within the extraordinary broad range of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The list does not stop there.  Local government, the point at which citizens interface with the State in so many ways, also falls within the remit of the Department.</P>
        <P>In my two years as Minister of State in the Department, I have placed strong emphasis on promoting more effective performance and adopting best practice to maximise the benefits of the considerable resources being made available.  Value for money is a core principle and I will <Col N="51"/>continue to provide a sharp focus on this in terms of achieving the programme objectives in 2007.</P>
        <P>By any objective yardstick, my Department has made massive progress across the full range of its operations.  The overall provision of &euro;2.9 billion for 2007 equips my Department and our local authorities well to continue the momentum on key capital programmes and service provision for which we are responsible.  This is particularly important in 2007, the first year of the new national development plan.  We are well placed to build on the achievements made during the past five years.</P>
        <P>It is worth briefly looking back at some of the achievements before we look forward to what remains to be done.  A total of more than &euro;3.5 billion has been invested in Ireland&rsquo;s water services infrastructure between 1997 and 2006.  Government investment in recent years has resulted in increased waste water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.1 million and additional drinking water capacity for a population equivalent to more than 1 million.  The EPA has verified improvements in drinking water quality during the past three years and also improvements in river water quality.  We have a record number of blue flag beaches.  We are 90% compliant with the urban waste water treatment directive compared to just 20% compliance in 2000.  The recycling rate for municipal waste was just less than 34% in 2004, compared to 9% in 1997, and figures should show we surpassed our 2013 target last year.  Recycling of packaging waste has risen from 15% to 56%.  Construction and demolition recycling is at a high of 85% and waste going to landfill generally has fallen by 9% in four years, in spite of an expanding economy.  The recycling scheme for electronic waste, which came in for considerable criticism from the Opposition, has collected 2.3 million pieces of equipment since I introduced it in August 2005.</P>
        <P>Some 14% of the national territory is now protected for habitat or species conservation, and this year I have designated new marine conservation areas covering an area the size of County Wexford.  Increased resources have been allocated to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Heritage Council and the EPA to ensure that these key agencies continue to deliver high quality services, which are crucial to our continued economic and infrastructural development.  Some 170 capital projects are completed annually by the national parks and wildlife service.  These are aimed at developing and maintaining our six national parks and 78 nature reserves.</P>
        <P>A major component of the Department&rsquo;s Estimate relates to housing, a matter that will be addressed this evening by the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, during debate on the Private Members&rsquo; motion.  The Government&rsquo;s approach to housing aims to address the wide spectrum of housing needs.  Our success in increasing housing supply is fundamental to this objective and is well <Col N="52"/>reflected with more than 81,000 housing units supplied in 2005.  This year we are on course to achieve approximately 90,000 units.  One third of all houses in the State has been provided during the ten years of this Government and its predecessor.  The Government is also determined to maintain the momentum on social and affordable housing provision.  The total Exchequer provision for housing in 2007 is almost &euro;1.5 billion &mdash; an increase of 9%, &euro;125 million, on the 2006 provision.  This increased level of funding is in line with the housing commitments contained in Towards 2016 and demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s determination to honour these commitments fully.</P>
        <P>We have prioritised investment on non-national roads and good results are being achieved.  By the end of last year, almost 80% of deficient non-national roads, as identified in 1996, had been restored.  Almost &euro;560 million in State aid is being invested this year in our non-national roads.  This represents a 13% increase on 2005 and we will be in a position to announce further increases in this programme in January when the local authorities will be notified of their 2007 allocations.</P>
        <P>At this stage, the vast majority of the busiest fire stations in the country are modern up-to-date buildings with all the necessary facilities required by today&rsquo;s fire brigade standards.  We will continue to invest in fire-fighting facilities in 2007.</P>
        <P>The provision of &euro;427 million on water and wastewater infrastructure in 2007 represents an increase of 7% on the 2006 provision of &euro;399 million.  Since 2000, some &euro;9 billion has been spent on new water and wastewater projects, including the major new sewerage schemes in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, and in other locations too numerous to mention.  Funding of more than &euro;5 billion covering 899 projects, including projects at planning stage, is provided for the projects in the Government&rsquo;s current investment programme.  The increased funding for 2007 reflects the importance the Government attaches to water services infrastructure as a facilitator of economic growth.  Not only does the provision of this infrastructure meet essential environmental needs, it also gives us a competitive advantage in attracting inward investment and supports new house building for the benefit of all communities, big and small, throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The resources the Government has provided to local authorities through the local government fund have risen dramatically since the fund was established in 1999.  The fund will deliver &euro;1.48 billion to local authorities next year, compared with &euro;800 million in 1999.  This level of resources has enabled the Minister, and his predecessors, to double the level of general purpose grants from the fund between 1999 and 2006 and I am pleased to say that we intend to continue this trend and increase grant levels further in 2007.</P><Col N="53"/>
        <P>I know, from my close and long involvement with local government, that the demands on the sector have increased substantially in the past decade and it is requisite that we should meet that demand.  These increased demands are due to a number of factors, including population growth, servicing of an expanding industrial and commercial sector, higher standards required in areas such as waste management and water treatment, quality, maintenance and operation of new infrastructure provided through public capital programmes, better planning enforcement, as well as the rising levels of expectations by the population.  Local authorities have risen to the challenge.</P>
        <P>We will be notifying local authorities of their general purpose grant allocations shortly so that they can adopt their budgets for next year.  In framing these budgets I want local authorities to keep two matters in mind.  While the level of increase in the rate on valuation and other charges is, of course, a matter for elected members, I urge councillors to be mindful of the need to maintain competitiveness within the local economy when they are making decisions.  Minimising increases will, in the long term, contribute to local enterprise and employment growth and in turn ensure the long-term sustainability of their commercial rates base.  I urge elected members to insist that their councils pay greater heed to efficiency and value for money.  Between capital and current expenditure, the local government sector will spend &euro;9 billion in 2007.  While efficiencies have been delivered by the sector in recent times, significant potential remains for further efficiencies to be achieved.</P>
        <P>The 2007 spending provisions confirm the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to the development of the local government sector and will allow continuation of the high levels of activity achieved in addressing social needs and providing the necessary infrastructure to assist sustainable development and improve the quality of life of our citizens.</P>

        <P>The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s right-wing priorities and disdain for justice and human rights are crystal clear in the Estimates for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The so-called Independent Monitoring Commission, a politically biased body established outside and in breach of the Good Friday Agreement, is to receive another &euro;1.5 million in funding next year, which shows the Government&rsquo;s faith in the St. Andrews Agreement, whereas the Human Rights Commission, a body established on foot of the Good Friday Agreement and tasked with advocating respect for human rights of 4.2 million people in this State, is to receive just &euro;2 million.  The Human Rights Commission needs significantly greater resources if it is to carry out its large remit.</P>
        <P>We were promised that the Garda Ombudsman Commission would also be fully operational in January 2007.  However, the Estimates contradict that promise.  The completely ineffective and unacceptable Garda Complaints Board, which should be winding down next year, is being given an increase.  If the Garda Ombudsman Commission is to be properly funded next year, why is it receiving virtually the same amount of money that it received last year, when it was inoperative?  This does not instil confidence that the target of 1 January 2007 will be met.  That is a great pity because the commission is obviously needed.  Furthermore, if the Garda Ombudsman Commission is to have any opportunity of being effective and realising its potential, the &euro;10 million provided will not be adequate.  The Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland receives an additional &euro;500,000 over and above that amount but the Garda Ombudsman Commission will be responsible for overseeing a force which is almost twice the size of the PSNI, which is responsible for a geographical area that is nearly three times the size of that of the North of Ireland and which must deal with a population that is three times the size of that which obtains in the North.</P>
        <P>Where are the additional funds for the civilianisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, its operations and its stations?  Priority is being given to doubling the number of fully trained crime fighters who are being deployed on traffic duties.</P>
        <P>I again wish to raise questions with regard to the Secret Service Vote, which, for the fifth successive year and despite it having a significant surplus annually, will increase.  The Minister must indicate why some of these bizarre funding <Col N="55"/>decisions continue to appear in the Estimates, with no one being held accountable for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>When one looks at the Book of Estimates and sees that an additional &euro;4 billion will be spent, one would imagine that all one&rsquo;s problems will be solved.  The 11% increase, to &euro;14 billion, in spending on health looks good, as does the additional 8% in respect of teachers.  Indicating that an additional 800 teachers will be appointed also looks good.  However, as regards the 11% increase in respect of health, provision has not been made to provide additional beds in the health service.  A marker should be laid down in respect of that matter.  What will be the percentage gain to the health system by the closure of smaller hospitals and how much of this will be spent on feeding the fat cats?  This is the greatest deceit of all within the health service.</P>
        <P>I will concentrate on the health service because it was on that ticket that I was elected.  The money being invested will not change the direction in which the health service is heading.  Several problems exist.  The first of these relates to communications and what one is told by different Departments.  It also relates to what one is told by the Government, the HSE and those at general manager level.  They all say different things.</P>
        <P>On Thursday of last week, the Minister for Health and Children indicated that the implementation team is proceeding with plans that will effectively demolish and finish off Monaghan General Hospital.  We were informed that there would be vast volumes of work carried out at the hospital.  Day services will continue to be offered there but the 24-hour, seven-day accident and emergency and X-ray services are being removed, as are acute medical care and the new acute unit.  We have been informed that there will be a better service on offer, without one additional bed being put in place.  People are expected to travel to Cavan General Hospital, which is already overcrowded and its staff overworked, for treatment.  The position is similar in respect of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.</P>
        <P>What is happening does not make sense.  The co-authors of the report presented to the Joint Committee on Health Children on Thursday last agree with me in that regard.  Mr. John Saunders stated that it does not make sense to remove services before other services are put in place.  Mr. Saunders&rsquo;s important statement should be examined because he obviously does not agree with what is happening.  Anyone with a brain would not agree with taking a 24-hour service away.  A test run of what it is proposed to do at Monaghan General Hospital was carried out between June 2002 and January 2005.  In June 2002 there were five patients in the hospital, which was well on the way to being closed and which was off-call.  During the period in which it was off-call &mdash; it is proposed to take the hospital off call again &mdash; 17 lives were lost.  Numerous <Col N="56"/>other lives were saved because people insisted on bringing loved ones and others to hospital by car.</P>
        <P>When we raised this issue at ministerial, Department of Health and Children and hospital CEO level, we were informed that we were scaremongering and that we should not worry.  That is a matter of D&aacute;il record.  In my view we should examine the Teamwork report to which I refer before matters go too far.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I smiled when the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government said that councillors must heed the need for competitiveness.  When they look at the Estimates, councillors will find that statement difficult to take.  The Estimates involved quite an amount of inaction.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, referred to spending on transport but he failed to come to grips with the cost of congestion.  The latter costs businesses approximately &euro;3 billion per year.  In an IBEC survey, 89% of businesses indicated that they bear the cost of congestion and that it has an adverse effect on their operations.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s direction to councillors to heed the need for competitiveness and extract large amounts of money from businesses through rates will not go down well with such businesses, particularly when one considers the effect of congestion on their operations.  The Government should go back to the drawing board before dictating to councillors on the importance of competitiveness.</P>
<?oasys _dc14- ?>
        <P>The Minister for Finance did not refer to the biggest elephant in the room.  He spoke about water and waste but he never mentioned climate change.  The cost of the latter will really affect the Estimates in the future.  That cost already stands at &euro;1 billion in respect of carbon and it is growing all the time.  We will be obliged to pay this amount &mdash; or between &euro;2 million and &euro;4 million each week &mdash; in addition to the country&rsquo;s normal running costs in the period 2008 to 2012 on foot of ineffective Government.  That matter must be tackled but the Estimates do not appear to take account of it.  Perhaps action will be taken in the budget.</P>
<?oasys _dc0- ?>
        <P>Money is certainly being spent on water services.  However, it is not being invested in water conservation and is being spent instead on supply.  The position is similar to one having a leaky tap and being obliged to keep the plug in the bath.  We would save a great deal of money if we were to examine the possibilities with regard to water conservation.</P>
        <P>The happy campers in all of this are the builders.  They are making a great deal of money and the Government is benefiting as a result.  The revenue being accrued is welcome but the cost involved is being levied on taxpayers who are obliged to pay high energy bills and who must take account of the amount of water they use because the houses being built do not include conservation mechanisms.  In international terms, housing standards in Ireland are extremely poor. <Col N="57"/> That is one of the reasons builders would resist Fianna F&aacute;il getting its act together.  As a result, they continue to benefit.</P>
        <P>I also smiled when the Minister of State referred to the value for money principle.  Value for money does not seem to have impinged to any great degree on the Department of Transport, which wants to construct a new runway at Dublin Airport.  A cost-benefit analysis was not carried out in that regard and billions of euro are going to be poured into that black hole.  In light of the fact that traffic congestion in the Dublin area will make it extremely difficult to proceed with and operate the proposed runway, it is ironic that the Minister of State referred to the need to obtain value for money.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance will call on his colleagues in Government to insist that cost-benefit analyses should be carried out before vast amounts of money are spent.  We could thereby avoid a great deal of waste.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>The debate on the Estimates gives us the opportunity to examine a number of matters in respect of which money is being provided.  In 2007, &euro;54 billion will be spent by various Government agencies and Departments and this is comprised of &euro;47 billion in current expenditure and &euro;7.6 billion in capital expenditure.  These are the sort of amounts that many of us who were Members of the Houses upwards of 20 years ago never dreamed would be available to deal with certain of the country&rsquo;s problems.</P>
        <P>It would be easy for Members to talk for an hour about any of the headings contained in the Estimates.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if the tax targets set out in the Programme for Government 2002 continue to shape Government policy; and if he has satisfied himself that current tax policy is fair to ordinary families. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s questions is yes.  The Government&rsquo;s approach to tax policy is set out in An Agreed Programme for Government and in recent budgets and Finance Bills.  In addition, the partnership agreement, Towards 2016, states the Government is committed to a taxation policy designed to maintain and strengthen the competitive position of the economy, foster improvements in productive capacity, economic and social <Col N="58"/>development, and equity, while maintaining a sound fiscal stance.</P>
        <P>With regard to the fairness of current tax policy, improvements in the tax system since 1997 have meant more than 776,000 income earners are out of the tax net compared with approximately 380,000 ten years ago.  Those on the minimum wage are exempt from tax.  In addition, the tax burden for the married one-earner on average earnings has fallen from 20% to 8% under our watch.  The married one-earner on average earnings has seen his or her annual tax bill fall by almost &euro;1,500 even though his or her annual gross income has risen by over &euro;12,000 in that time.  Even for those whose tax is calculated at 42%, the effect of the new fairer tax credit system brought in by the Government parties in 1999, combined with the other income tax changes to rates and bands, means that four fifths of earners pay no more than one fifth of their earnings in income tax.</P>
        <P>Rates under most tax heads have reduced since 1997.  At the same time, the tax yield to the State has continued to rise due to the extra economic activity accompanying this policy.  In some cases, such as capital gains tax and corporation tax, the tax yield increased substantially after rates were cut.  This extra tax revenue has been used, among other things, to reduce tax on the ordinary PAYE worker, remove lower income earners from the tax net altogether and fund the provision of increased public services.  The Government&rsquo;s tax policies have been designed to promote the competitiveness of the economy, support enterprise and reward work.  The practically full employment which the economy enjoys is tangible evidence of the success of these policies in delivering fairness and dignity to ordinary families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the Government&rsquo;s tax targets.  Over the past four years, total tax as a proportion of national income has increased.  Far from being a low tax Government, this has been a high tax Government.  It is even worse for families.  The proportion of their personal income taken in tax has increased by seven percentage points to 38.5%.  The Minister has the unusual distinction of being the first Minister for Finance to have more people paying tax at the 42% rate than at the 20% rate, which is extraordinary.  The reason is that a single person on 80% of average earnings is taxed at 42%, the same rate that applies to a millionaire.  Where stands the commitment in the programme for Government to ensure 80% of all earners pay tax at the standard rate?  Has it been abandoned or will the Government progress the reforms to deliver it, instead of regressing, which has been the case for the past four years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The tax strategy group and the Revenue Commissioners independently conducted an exercise, which found that even for those whose tax is calculated at 42%, the effect of the <Col N="59"/>new fairer tax credit system brought in by the Government in 1999, combined with the other income tax changes to rates and bands, means that four fifths of earners pay no more than one fifth of their earnings in income tax.  The tax credit is deducted from the gross liability to compute the effective rate of tax and, therefore, four fifths of income earners pay an effective rate of tax of 20% or less.  It was different under the old allowance system.  The tax free allowance was subtracted from the top rate of tax to prevent people from entering the top rate more easily.  Under the fairer tax credit system, which creates the net liability once the gross liability is computed, four fifths of people pay an effective rate of tax of 20% or less.  The effective position if that if a worker is earning &euro;50,000 per year, he or she pays &euro;10,000 in tax or at a tax rate of 20% or less.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a new interpretation.  It is a good try on the Minister&rsquo;s part.  He should read his own Department&rsquo;s Budget Statement last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>That is Clara economics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us deal with the facts.  The Deputies can play around all they like.  Revenue has confirmed that of the 32% of earners who pay tax at the 42% rate, the tax liability of 11% of them is more than offset by the tax credit.  Their effective tax rate, therefore, is 20%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not make sense.  Talk about the devil reciting scripture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it a fact?  The tax strategy group&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very clear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Excuse me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is asking the question and I was going to volunteer an answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am answering, not asking, the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is not answering the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Four fifths of income earners have effective tax rates of 20% or less.  This has been confirmed by the Revenue Commissioners and the tax strategy group.  It is annoying the Opposition that this is the fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that the commitment in the programme for Government made no reference to effective rates of tax, which have been produced like a rabbit out of a hat to pretend that something promised was not promised?  That is the reality.  The programme stated <Col N="60"/>the Minister will ensure 80% of all earners pay only at the standard rate, without a mention of effective rates of tax.  I am reminded of <i>Animal Farm</i>.  The pigs who took control had a slogan, &ldquo;Four legs good, two legs bad,&rdquo; but when they decided that did not suit them, they changed it to, &ldquo;Four legs good, two legs better,&rdquo; because they were moving on two legs themselves.  The Minister has adopted the same strategy and his advisers are changing the citation, like the sheep in <i>Animal Farm</i>, to effective tax rates.  That is not the Minister&rsquo;s commitment.  He has not delivered on his promise and he stands indicted for failing to even attempt to deliver.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.  The Deputy has suggested that everyone with a gross liability at the market rate pays all taxes at that rate, which he knows is untrue.  The Revenue Commissioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not suggest that.  I read the Minister&rsquo;s promise from the text.</P>

	<P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  Through the tax strategy group mechanism, the Revenue Commissioners have independently brought forward information that, despite the Deputy&rsquo;s blather, confirms that 80% of income earners pay tax at rates of effectively 20% or less.  The bottom line&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>When one speaks about tax, one discusses credits, bands and rates.  If one asks an ordinary person on the street earning &euro;50,000 per year with a tax liability of &euro;10,000 about the rate of tax, he or she will say that it is 20%.</P>

	<P>What if they do overtime?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is 20% of that person&rsquo;s gross income.  The logic of Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s position&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the Minister to honour the commitment he made in the programme for Government, not to create a new concept and target that he has not mentioned until today.  The only reason it suits him to create the concept is because he has failed to honour his commitment to the people just as the Government failed to put children in classes of 20 pupils and to end to waiting lists.  These bogus promises have been exposed.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the widespread use of avoidance mechanisms in respect of development land and stamp duty, particularly the use of licensing arrangements and the transfer of property via the sale or transfer of shares in a company; if his Department or the Revenue Commissioners have carried out an examination of the actual and potential loss of stamp duty revenue to the Government and the impact of stamp duty avoidance mechanisms on house purchasers and others acquiring property; the estimated cost of avoidance mechanisms; the number of deals in which avoidance mechanisms are involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Revenue Commissioners have been examining the operations of stamp duty and developers and have undertaken a survey of a number of developers to gather more precise information.  I will decide what to do when I receive the observations of the Revenue Commissioners.  Stamp duty applies when a title to property is legally conveyed.  A legal instrument must convey the title, but such an instrument is not created when a licence is given.</P>
        <P>Regarding the conveyance of shares in a company, it has long been the position that conveyances are charged at 1% of the value of the shares irrespective of the assets of the company.  There is no provision in law for examining the underlying <Col N="62"/>assets of the company.  Legally, a company is a separate legal person to its shareowners.  I would be reluctant to overturn that distinction lightly and to make the operation of stamp duty law uncertain or complex in terms of the exchange of shares and company transfers generally because they are a normal part of commercial life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the pre-budget outlook, first-time buyers will pay &euro;70 million in stamp duty.  Does the Minister know how difficult it is for them to understand how he can endorse in the House a situation in which, one month ago, a deal on land transfers to the amount of approximately &euro;400 million in respect of the Irish Glass Bottle site was made?  It involved a share transfer and attracted a 1% stamp duty rate.  Had the Minister closed that avoidance mechanism, &euro;30 million would have been paid in stamp duty in a similar fashion as the stamp duty paid by first-time buyers of secondhand houses worth more than &euro;317,000.</P>
        <P>In the event of the Irish Glass Bottle site being developed as housing and apartments, which has been indicated, first-time buyers of new homes at that location will pay stamp duty if their homes cost more than &euro;317,000.  However, Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s friends in the building and development industry have two mechanisms for avoiding paying their fair share, namely, the licences to build and the transfer of shares.</P>
        <P>I have raised this question with the Minister seven times since he entered office.  Where is the review, why is it taking so long and what is the Minister afraid of in reforming these avoidance mechanisms?  For first-time buyers, it is difficult to understand why they are caught for stamp duty when the big boys are not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>This year, Revenue is conducting a broad review of the construction industry.  When it reports before the Finance Bill, we will see what it has to say about the situation.</P>
        <P>Under the stamp duty code, a developer can obtain a licence from a landowner to build on that land without incurring a stamp duty charge at that stage of the venture.  There is no duty on the licence, as the licence only confers on the developer a right to build on the land.  Once the buildings, whether commercial or residential, are completed, the conveyances or transfers of such properties to purchasers are chargeable to stamp duty in the normal manner unless specific exemptions are available.</P>
        <P>Due to the nature of stamp duty being primarily a tax on legal instruments under which the interest in the property passes, no stamp duty is payable on the legal instrument until the title passes.  However, if the property is paid for by a developer in the normal way instead of via taking a licence to build on it, the situation would be reflected in the purchase price because there would be an up front cost to the developer.</P><Col N="63"/>
        <P>In the other situation, which has been a feature for some time, developers get licences to build on land and sell the building to purchasers.  In effect, the purchaser buys from the developer and the original landowner.  I have asked the Revenue Commissioners to report to me to allow the full consideration of any issue that arises in respect of this matter prior to the Finance Bill 2007.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have figures on the amount of stamp duty avoided by these mechanisms, the number of such transactions and the amount involved?  Does the Minister agree the situation is a scandal and that it is open to him to close these loopholes to ensure a sense of justice and equity between ordinary people buying family homes and big developers and builders, the type of people who go to all of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s social functions?  I cannot understand why the Minister could not take action to close the loopholes available to his friends in the building industry and introduce a level playing pitch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The continual reference to personal friends is a joke.  From the point of view of the person who grants a licence to a developer rather than making an outright sale of the lands concerned, the same amount of capital gains tax would arise as if there were such a sale.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>We are discussing stamp duty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Sub-sale relief has always existed in the stamp duty code and licensing arrangements with landowners have been a traditional way in which developers develop land.  The arrangements involving powers of attorney are more recent, but in recent years and owing to prosperity, the proliferation of developments structured in this way has come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners and such arrangements are being reviewed by them.  I have asked them to let me know the outcome of their review and I will decide what action, if any, is required, bearing in mind the effect on the housing market and the cost to the Exchequer.</P>

        <Quest> if he will direct the Revenue Commissioners to prepare, in co-operation with the Central Statistics Office, an accurate assessment of underclaimed tax reliefs by ordinary families in order <Col N="64"/>that an informed policy can be framed to refund tax rightly due. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I refer the Deputy to the statements made by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Mr. Frank Daly, to the Committee of Public Accounts when he appeared before it on 9 November 2006.  In response to questions from the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts on the amount of money that may be owed to taxpayers and a suggestion that, in the case of PAYE taxpayers, large amounts are not owed in individual cases, Mr. Daly said Revenue had made a total of 485,000 repayments up to the end of October 2006, involving an amount of &euro;353 million.  He said this was the factual situation in respect of what was claimed and repaid and that it was difficult to speculate about what more might be reclaimable.  Mr. Daly said he was reluctant to put a figure on what had not been claimed but repeated the figure of &euro;353 million claimed to the end of October 2006 and gave the comparable figures for 2004 and 2003, which were &euro;325 million and &euro;295 million respectively.  Mr. Daly suggested that to say almost the same amount remained unclaimed as had been repaid would be an overstatement but perhaps there is a further &euro;100 million unclaimed.</P>
        <P>The figures quoted by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners clearly show that taxpayers are becoming more aware of their entitlements and, as a consequence, the number of repayment claims and the amounts being repaid are increasing year on year.  During August, September and October this year Revenue ran an intense high-profile campaign to encourage taxpayers to claim the reliefs to which they are entitled.  This campaign involved advertisements on radio, bus shelters, the DART and the Luas.  There is also a continuing campaign involving the placement of leaflets and claim forms in clinics, doctors&rsquo; surgeries and pharmacies to encourage take-up of the relief available for medical expenses.  There has been a positive outcome to this campaign which is shown in a significant increase in the number of people contacting Revenue and claiming entitlements particularly relating to trade union subscriptions, bin charges and age, rent, home carers and dependent relative credits.</P>
        <P>There are preliminary indications that claims for some of these reliefs have more than doubled following the Revenue campaign.  It is expected that the campaign will also lead to an increase in the number of claims relating to health expenses at the end of this year and early in the new year when the majority of such claims are normally made.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners can only allow tax credits or reliefs on the basis of information that is known to them and, consequently, there is no way for Revenue, with or without the involvement of the CSO, to accurately assess underclaimed entitlements where changes in individual <Col N="65"/>circumstances have not been notified by the people concerned.  Revenue&rsquo;s attempts to bring the existence of various reliefs to the attention of those that might benefit from them is a far better use of resources than a statistical exercise, which of its nature could not achieve that result.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that Revenue takes a very proactive approach to ensuring that individuals are made aware of and are granted their entitlements and that further initiatives in this regard will be forthcoming in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  Does he not find it significant that in approximately 75% of cases where balancing statements were sought a refund was made?  The average refund in such cases was &euro;800 per person, which is very significant.  Does he not think that, based on that fact and the chairman&rsquo;s report to the effect that there may be a further &euro;100 million to be repaid, efforts must be redoubled to make the repayments to the taxpayers concerned?</P>
        <P>How many of the 2.1 million or 2.2 million people who work make annual tax returns?  I suspect the number is quite low.  The process of making repayments might be easier with a better system for making tax returns.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister not find the moratorium restricting backdated claims to three or four years, introduced by his Government, grossly unfair?  Is it not very restrictive?  If I were a taxpayer who owed the Revenue money for five, six or seven years but had a credit from four years ago I could not put that credit against moneys owing from the earlier period.  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor brought in the restriction but it is grossly unfair that I cannot set my credits against other liabilities.  The Revenue may go back as many years as it deems necessary but I, as a taxpayer, cannot do so to claim credits.</P>
        <P>Are health-related expenses, such as those on nursing homes, prescriptions and doctor&rsquo;s expenses, the largest area in which tax reliefs are not claimed?  Can the Minister launch a campaign to make people more aware of their rights in regard to those?  Does the Minister not agree that the minimum qualifying expenditure of &euro;125 per annum constitutes a disincentive to claiming and clogs up the system?  For what it is worth to the Government surely it would be better to wipe out that threshold altogether.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will consider some of the suggestions the Deputy has made.  I indicated in my reply that, as a result of much discussion in this House and committees of the Houses, in consultation with the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, efforts have been made to improve the ability to claim back ordinary credits to which taxpayers are entitled.  The chairman has said in recent years that increasing amounts have been claimed.  As a guesstimate, a further 20% or 25% may remain to be claimed.  If that is the case and, according to the chairman, whose judgment and <Col N="66"/>knowledge is better than most, the Revenue Commissioners are doing all they can by taking practical initiatives, particularly in medical relief which involves placing forms where people access medical services, then that is as good as they can do.  In addition they run many publicity campaigns, provide information on their website and produce information leaflets etc.  </P>
        <P>The new computer system will not change the fact that the ultimate responsibility is on PAYE taxpayers to ensure their tax credit certificate is correct or to request an end of year review if they feel they have overpaid.  However, the system allows PAYE taxpayers to access their records in a way that was not possible before, and to view their allowances, credits and details of pay and tax at any time.  They can amend their tax credit certificate on the web, either to claim an allowance or credit not on a certificate or to change the amount involved.  Taxpayers can request an on-line review or balancing statement based on Revenue records and confirmation that details are correct and complete.  They can also receive an automatic repayment in certain cases where Revenue is fully satisfied from their records or recent contacts that a repayment is due.</P>
        <P>The new computer system will also provide for details of taxable payments from the Department of Social and Family Affairs to be provided to Revenue on an updated and regular basis.  Part of the new PAYE computer system will involve details of pay and tax from employers&rsquo; P35 returns being made available much more quickly than before.</P>
        <P>The combination of on-line access and amendment, together with the availability of quicker and more reliable information about pay and tax and payments from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, should help to increase the reliability and accuracy of the PAYE system and reduce the number of PAYE overpayments that remain unclaimed, which is one of the issues often discussed in this House.</P>
        <P>The vast majority of taxpayers are conscious of the reliefs to which they are entitled.  When claims are necessary they take the required action.  That said, in reality some taxpayers do not claim all the reliefs to which they are entitled each year and may not have kept a record of expenditure on doctors&rsquo; bills and prescription drugs so it requires an ongoing effort.</P>
        <P>As I have said, introducing tax relief at source is another solution for some, though not all, credits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister say how many of the total number of workers make returns?  If he does not have the figure can he come back with an answer?</P>
        <P>The Minister said people could download details of their credits from a computer but that only applies to a limited number of people.  The people at the margins who pay tax but cannot afford to pay accountants are losing out.  Those <Col N="67"/>who employ accountants will do very well and receive all their tax credits.  Some become so expert in tax credits they pay no tax at all, even if they have income of more than &euro;1 million per annum.  The Minister must reach the ordinary middle class people so that they can receive their just entitlements and not overpay tax.</P>
        <P>The Minister forgot to deal with the question on the look-back in respect of claims for tax credits.</P>

       <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the past few years many of the more significant reliefs have been made virtually automatic either through the introduction of tax relief at source, TRS, or through the automatic carry forward of the reliefs.  Mortgage interest and medical insurance reliefs, for example, are provided at source through the taxpayer obtaining a reduction in repayments or premia equivalent to the tax relief.  Recurring reliefs, such as those for trade union subscriptions, once claimed are allowed on an ongoing basis and reappear each year in the taxpayer&rsquo;s certificate of tax credits.  With refuse charges, the Revenue Commissioners use whatever information is available from local authorities via tape exchange to ensure as many people as possible get their relief automatically without claiming it.</P>
        <P>The other main reliefs relate to medical expenses, certain dental expenses, age credits for people over 65 years, third level tuition fees and rent relief.  In the case of these reliefs and the first claims for trade union subscriptions, it is generally up to the individual taxpayer to claim his or her entitlements as the Revenue Commissioners have no other way of ascertaining what these involve.  In so far as they can and do ascertain what people are entitled to, they allow it to remain on the certificates in future years.  They also have increased the number who can get tax relief at source.</P>
        <P>There are improvements.  A proactive effort is being made at every level in terms of information for the taxpayer and improving the computer systems to ensure that taxpayers get as fair a deal as possible.  However, the primary responsibility is on the taxpayer to ensure their tax credits are in order.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the recent financial stability report from the Central Bank and its warning that <Col N="68"/>Ireland is more indebted than in 2005, more exposed to interest rates and that house prices have reached unreal levels with a high risk of investors destabilising the market as they exit the market at short notice; the measures he is taking to address these risks; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[39327/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the publication by the Central Bank of its Financial Stability Report 2006 which reflects the bank&rsquo;s mandate to contribute to the stability of the financial system in Ireland.  I note the report&rsquo;s main conclusion that Ireland&rsquo;s financial system continues to be in a good state of health.  This is based on a detailed assessment of the risks facing borrowers, the financial position of the banking sector as well as recent stress testing of the system.</P>
        <P>The bank&rsquo;s central expectation, based on an assessment of the risks facing borrowers, the financial position of the banking sector as well as the results of recent stress testing of the system, is that the current shock absorption capacity of the banking system leaves it well placed to withstand possible pressures.  The report also highlights that the strength of the economy continues to support the stability of the financial sector.</P>
        <P>The bank&rsquo;s report identifies vulnerabilities facing the financial system, including those arising from credit growth and house price inflation.  Within the implementation of the overall legislative framework, private sector credit growth and debt levels are, in the first instance, a matter for the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  While the strong increase in borrowing is a sign of a healthy economy and a positive economic outlook on the part of borrowers, I fully support the vigilance of the Central Bank and the financial regulator on the issue of personal credit and mortgage debt and in reminding both borrowers and lenders of the need for responsible behaviour.  The Government, for its part, will continue to contribute to economic and financial stability by pursuing a prudent fiscal policy.</P>
        <P>Recent indicators point to continued moderation in house price inflation in line with increased housing supply and higher ECB interest rates.  The consensus among commentators is for this trend to continue, resulting in a gradual cooling and soft landing for property prices in Ireland.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s report shares the view that this is the most likely outcome.</P>
        <P>In terms of the general economic implications of the rise in house prices and the associated increase in indebtedness in recent years, both borrowers and lenders need to be aware that interest rates are currently still low by historical standards.  The Central Bank has highlighted the need for borrowers and lenders to factor into their financial decision making the prospective impact of potential changes in the future economic and financial environment.  This also con<Col N="69"/>firms the need for responsible budgetary policy to provide room for manoeuvre in the event of any unexpected sharp slowdown in economic growth.</P>
        <P>The major element of household outstanding indebtedness is accounted for by residential mortgages.  Demand for residential mortgages is underpinned by a number of factors, including strong new housing output, the growth in the economy, the accompanying pickup in employment creation and wages, the increases in household formation, significant net immigration and lower public sector indebtedness which facilitates the maintenance of low levels of taxation.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s point regarding investors, the financial stability report states clearly that property remains a popular asset for investors as it continues to outperform other asset classes in the short to medium term.  My overall view is that the report, with its main conclusion and its assessment of risks, makes a valuable contribution to the assessment and maintenance of financial stability in our economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Has the Minister seen a report in the October 2006 issue of the <i>Irish Property Buyer</i> which includes an analysis of the impact of interest rate increases on average mortgage repayments?  Between July 2005 and December 2006 the average monthly mortgage repayment, due to interest rate increases, will have risen by over 50%.  The figures show average repayments increasing from &euro;1,057 to &euro;1,573 for all buyers nationally, from &euro;926 to &euro;1,390 for all first-time buyers and from &euro;1,453 to &euro;2,167 for all Dublin buyers, who comprise approximately 49% of the total mortgage market.  In view of the outlook from the European Central Bank and given that people also have financial commitments regarding child care and high commuting costs, does the Minister believe such figures are sustainable?  Is the Minister concerned about the type of monthly bills sustained by people trying to provide a home for their families?</P>
        <P>The Central Bank referred to investors in its report.  It said that investors, unlike owner occupiers, pose a risk to the stability of the market in so far as they might attempt to exit the market at short notice.  The CSO and property economists have suggested that between 8% and 15% of Irish houses are unoccupied.  Is that not a worrying trend?</P>
        <P>Our total indebtedness has reached &euro;300 billion.  That is equivalent to 205% of GNP.  It is extremely high in comparison to other countries and it is growing all the time.  Do any of these issues concern the Minister as he frames the budget?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course one keeps a close eye on these matters, as one must and should.  Interest rate policy, as a result of our euro membership, is a matter for the ECB in the first instance.  Ireland is represented on the ECB by the Gov<Col N="70"/>ernor of the Central Bank.  Mr. Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, when addressing the European Parliament&rsquo;s economic and monetary affairs committee &mdash; his comments were not confined to Ireland but related to a number of European countries &mdash; said that the housing market in a number of European countries has been considerably buoyant but monetary policy decisions are taken with regard to the euro area as a whole and cannot be taken with regard to individual conditions in specific countries.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank has been consistently pointing to the requirement for prudence on the part of both borrowers and lenders in the housing market here.  The prime emphasis in its comments is that people should focus on affordability both in the present and in situations that might not be as benign as in the recent past.  This has been done through its economic bulletins and its financial stability reports.  In addition, it continues to have ongoing dialogue with the banks and conducts stress testing exercises.  The financial regulator also recently increased the risk weighting on all new mortgages with a loan to value ratio of more than 80% and its consumer division has been active in informing consumers of the various options and factors they must consider when borrowing.</P>
        <P>Prudent and responsible fiscal policy clearly also has an important role in contributing to financial stability and balanced economic performance overall.  One of the issues when preparing the Estimates was ensuring that an increase in spending would not add to inflationary pressures already in the system, due to the fact that we are reaching our potential growth in tight labour market conditions.</P>
        <P>With the implementation of the overall legislative framework, private sector credit growth and debt levels are, in the first instance, matters for the Central Bank and the Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  That follows from the Central Bank&rsquo;s role as part of the European system of central banks and its functions as a financial regulator with regard to the prudential supervision of financial institutions and the protection of consumers of those firms.</P>
        <P>The recent growth in credit requires us to recognise that while we have reduced public sector credit, there has been a growth in credit in the private sector.  People need to be mindful of that issue.  The financial stability report to which Question No. 57 refers indicates that while estimated mortgage repayments as a percentage of disposable income have varied over the past 16 years, the current mortgage repayment level on a national basis is less than the 35% level which obtained during the early 1990s.  Irish house buyers benefit from a range of supporting factors, including healthy income growth, low income tax rates and relatively low interest rates by historic standards.</P>
        <P>Affordability is also supported by the strength of the economy, record employment levels and <Col N="71"/>relatively high savings rates.  Recent indications of an increase in the private sector debt to income ratio require us to recognise that borrowing has to be taken into account on the basis of all the relevant criteria and we are now entering a slightly higher interest rate regime than was the case 18 months ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister spoke about his desire for a soft landing but, with a 50% increase in the average mortgage repayment over the past 18 months, how soft will that landing be?  The softest arrangements for people in the property market are geared towards investors rather than owner occupiers.  The Minister did not address the issue of empty houses, which in a number of economies are taken as a signal of stress in the market when their numbers rise above a certain threshold.  What is being done to ensure a soft landing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>A soft landing is being encouraged by the continuing supply of houses to a market which continues to have strong fundamentals.  Anecdotal evidence suggests the market is softening but we will not be able to ascertain until spring of next year whether interest rate increases are contributing to that situation.  The important point is that we should not be predicting a hard landing when the Central Bank and all the evidence of continuing high income growth and low unemployment rates indicate otherwise.  When people saw problems in the housing market across the water, it was against a background of rising unemployment and much higher interest rates.  Taking nominal inflation into account, real interest rates are significantly lower at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>However, 5.5% is a significant increase compared to the rate that obtained when people took out their mortgages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are no longer facing the difficulties of the early and mid-1990s, when the real interest rate was as high as 7% above nominal inflation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>People have borrowed based on low interest rates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I recognise that affordability is now an issue for people.  Clearly, the repayment of the mortgage is the first charge on disposable income and the resulting impact in terms of less spending power for other activities can ultimately affect economic growth and revenues.  However, we should remind ourselves that interest rates remain at historically low levels.  The Central Bank has made it clear that price stability will be the determining factor in how it applies interest rate policies not only at next month&rsquo;s meeting, but throughout 2007.  That needs to be taken into <Col N="72"/>account, as the Financial Regulator insists, by borrowers and lenders alike.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if he supports the establishment of a tax advocate with powers to monitor fair treatment of taxpayers. </Quest>
        <QRef>[39142/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question is related to the calls made on occasion for the establishment of an independent individual or entity whose proposed role would include acting as an advocate for taxpayers who feel unfairly treated by the system.  The statutory remit of the Ombudsman already incorporates both of the roles proposed for a taxpayer advocate, namely, acting for taxpayers and investigating actions which are contrary to fair or sound administration.</P>
        <P>Since the inception of the Office of the Ombudsman, significant numbers of taxpayers have exercised their right to make complaints to that office.  Furthermore, the Ombudsman has carried out a number of special investigations on her own initiative under the Ombudsman Act 1980, such as into the operation of schemes for disabled drivers and the repayment of tax to certain widows.  When calls were previously made for the establishment of a taxpayer advocate, the then Ombudsman drew attention to the duplication of role and responsibilities that such a development would involve.</P>
        <P>Apart from the statutory role and responsibility of the Ombudsman, other avenues are also open for taxpayers to make their complaints and to seek satisfaction for perceived unfair treatment.  They can lodge a customer service complaint about the standard of service received in their personal contact with the Revenue Commissioners by telephone, correspondence, fax, e-mail or in person to a Revenue public office.  They can request a review by Revenue of any aspect of the way in which their tax affairs have been handled.  Such reviews are undertaken by a senior Revenue official who was not involved in the original decision or, at the taxpayer&rsquo;s request, jointly by an external reviewer and a senior official.  Taxpayers who are dissatisfied with specific treatments by Revenue can also make an appeal under statutory provisions which grant access to the appeal commissioners.  The appeal commissioners are completely independent of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The fact that few people are enthusiastic about paying taxes is all the more reason for effective channels of complaint and appeal by taxpayers against poor service or unfairness.  However, given the comprehensive and accessible system <Col N="73"/>already in place for complaints or appeals by any taxpayer who feels unfairly treated by the tax system, it is not obvious to me that there is a case for putting in place the additional layer of a tax advocate&rsquo;s office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>While I understand the Minister&rsquo;s arguments, I draw his attention to the fact that, until comparatively recently, the Revenue Commissioners have had limited interest in refunding overpayments.  It was only after the political attention increased that Revenue became conscious of refunds.  The perception exists that, while Revenue&rsquo;s systems are highly geared for collecting taxes, as is proper, they are not as good at returning money.</P>
        <P>A recent survey conducted among tax advisers revealed an alarming level of discontent with delays in processing and I know from my constituents that the entire system comes close to implosion during January and February, when offices stop taking calls and queues grow lengthy.  These issues are not routinely investigated by the Ombudsman because they do not come under the definition of unfairness in her code.  No advocate seems to be employed to demand that Revenue, like any other service provider, must be ready to meet demand at peak times.</P>
        <P>Situations should not arise in which people are told the telephone lines are closed or that they will have to queue for several hours.  I understand why the Minister does not want to duplicate the duties of the Ombudsman, but a role is being missed in that regard.  Perhaps if the Minister set out standards for matters such as unacceptable delays and asked the Revenue Commissioners to report on whether they were being met, that process could be begun.  A vacuum currently exists and, while Revenue is moving to fill it, the needs of customers are not yet being met.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is nothing to prevent the Ombudsman from making general remarks about the efficiency and fairness of the system and such remarks have been made in the past.  In regard to the general evaluation of tax administration, it is not clear what role a tax advocate could play that is not already provided in the existing political and administrative structures.  In countries which have independent taxpayer advocates, the role of the office is to deal with complaints by individuals about administrative matters and does not include addressing system or policy issues.</P>
        <P>Apart from the role of the Ombudsman, existing customer complaint and review procedures and the statutory appeals process to the appeals commissioner, the working of the tax system can be discussed at various fora, including the partnership process.  In addition to being required to formally report to my office, Revenue is subject to an annual audit examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who reports on taxes collected and systems, procedures and practices.  The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners is <Col N="74"/>also examined at length by the Committee of Public Accounts with regard to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  At times there may well be service pressures, such as a computer breakdown.  However, the amount of work in which the Revenue Commissioners are involved, the legislative reforms concerning self-assessment enacted in this House, the much improved relationship between tax professionals and the Revenue Commissioners, and the tax compliance culture that now pertains indicate a sea change compared to the position 20 years ago.  I read a report recently that indicated the level of arrears is only 2%.</P>
        <P>It may be true that the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; effort to modernise, computerise and have a system working to a standard deemed efficient by international criteria has necessitated a consumer focus.  I assure the Deputy that the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners will seek, in every way possible, to ensure taxpayers generally receive a fair hearing and assessment and that their credits and entitlements are paid in good time.  On foot of service pressures, the chairman sometimes contacts me and departmental officials seeking an increase in staff.  We often try to provide for this given the nature of the work done by his office.  While there is always room for improvement, there is certainly no institutional reluctance to advance this aspect of the office&rsquo;s work to a greater extent than might traditionally have been the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I proposed the establishment of a taxpayer advocacy office about three years ago following a visit I made to the equivalent office in the United States.  Despite what the Minister said about an improvement in the revenue system, which improvement I acknowledge, the ordinary taxpayer is not sufficiently empowered and does not have sufficient entitlements <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the Revenue Commissioners.  In the past three or four weeks, when taxpayers were filling in self-assessment tax forms and making payments through the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; on-line service, it was impossible for them to get through to the office over the telephone.  Did the Minister try to call the Revenue Commissioners to experience what PAYE and self-employed taxpayers were experiencing?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware that the survey by the Irish Taxation Institute, which supports the Labour Party&rsquo;s call for a taxpayer advocacy office, found that the processing time for tax returns now exceeds three months and that 72% of the institute&rsquo;s tax practitioners consider the Revenue&rsquo;s service negative and unsatisfactory.  While the Revenue Commissioners have made much progress due to prodding from Opposition parties and have improved their advertising in respect of tax allowances and tax credits, these steps are not enough.  Figures will indicate that in excess of &euro;200 million, which taxpayers are entitled to reclaim, will remain unclaimed at the <Col N="75"/>end of this year.  Did the Minister telephone the Revenue Commissioners to check what conditions have been like over the past month?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>A taxpayer advocacy office is necessary and its remit should be broader than proposed.  There is a need for a stand-alone agency to analyse more critically whether tax reliefs are being claimed in a proportionate way.  Even the Minister might be prepared to accept that they have been claimed in a disproportionate way in that those with more disposable income have benefited most from the reliefs available.  The proposed advocacy office would be in a position to argue this point and analyse the system in a way the Revenue Commissioners could not.  The job of the latter is to honour the tax code as decided by the House and determined by the Minister.  The Committee of Public Accounts and Comptroller and Auditor General could not carry out the analysis because they consider foregone expenditure accounted for in this House.</P>
        <P>Not only is there a taxpayer advocacy office in the United States, there are also relevant NGOs, such as the body of taxpayers that advocates responsible expenditure.  It would be in the interest of the Minister and political system in general to establish such an infrastructure because it would allow us all to benefit from improved critical examination of tax expenditure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The relationship in question is not one of equals.  If one&rsquo;s britches are down around one&rsquo;s ankles, one will not argue about the price of treatment with the consultant.  Similarly, if the Office of the Revenue Commissioners has many powers in its armoury and the taxpayer has none, it is difficult for the latter to assert his or her rights.  The issue of advocacy therefore needs to be addressed in some fashion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>On Deputy Boyle&rsquo;s point, we have enough bureaucracy in the system and I do not believe we need more independent NGOs telling us what to do.  The decisions on our tax system and the laws we pass are matters for the Oireachtas, the Members of which are accountable to the people.  I do not buy into the concept that we must appoint someone who is answerable to nobody to tell us what to do.  The decisions in question involve political judgments.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Taxation is a political matter.</P>
        <P>I am making this general point because I am always amazed at the desire to set up more offices that are answerable to nobody in the view that they would be far wiser than the rest of us, even though the Parliament has been given a job to do.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="76"/>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the questions we asked were answered, we would not have to appoint anybody.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am often bemused by this sort of thinking.</P>
        <P>The Internal Revenue Service in the United States operates a taxpayer advocacy service headed by a national taxpayer advocate.  However, the taxpayer advocate service is not external to the Internal Revenue Service.  It deals with both individual taxpayers&rsquo; problems and problems attracting multiple taxpayers, and with flaws in the tax code.  The latter role is referred to as systemic advocacy.  The service is not a substitute for established Internal Revenue Service procedure or a formal appeals process.</P>
        <P>We have an ombudsman with the power to do precisely what the Deputies believe should be done, that is, make general comments on practice, efficiency, policy and individual failings.  There is a tremendous desire to set up more structures and quangos.  Given that we have set up the Office of the Ombudsman, there is no need to duplicate its functions.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have arrangements whereby an external official can operate in conjunction with a senior Revenue official if a taxpayer feels he or she is being treated unfairly.  We therefore have systems of redress in place.  It is not just a question of politicians talking on behalf of taxpayers as there are tax professionals within the Revenue Commissioners who want the system to work better also.</P>
        <P>If many practitioners in the Irish Taxation Institute feel dissatisfied with the Revenue Commissioners, that is their prerogative, but, having spoken to tax professionals, I honestly believe there has been a sea change over the past ten or 15 years by way of qualitative improvements in the relationship between taxpayers, tax professionals and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The modernisation of the service is one reason we have an efficient tax collection and administration system.  It is generating revenue and allowing us to debate and decide on spending plans in the order of billions of euro.</P>
        <P>It would be no harm to stand up for the system now and again.  The Revenue Commissioners are doing a good job.  If specific problems exist, they should be dealt with but in the knowledge that we have a good, independent service staffed by people of integrity who do their jobs conscientiously and well.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the review of approval conditions attached to licensed aerodromes is being dealt with as a priority.  I outlined to the House on 18 October last in response to an earlier question that the review was likely to take approximately six weeks.  The Revenue Commissioners now inform me the review is on target and should be completed within Revenue around the end of November.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised this issue with the Minister before.  The country is being swamped by drugs, particularly my constituency, which is adjacent to Weston Aerodrome.  It is unfortunate that such remarkable loss of life is associated with drug crime and the easy availability of drugs.  Has the Minister for Finance given any thought to what the reform might entail?  He previously told us there had been 12 scheduled and six unscheduled visits to Weston Aerodrome in a year.  Will he make them all unscheduled?  As matters stand, the strong suggestion is that one could smuggle anything through certain of Ireland&rsquo;s private airports, be it drugs, guns or even human beings.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister not feel, given the threat the country faces from drug crime, which is fuelling gun crime, that the Revenue Commissioners must act more expeditiously?  For instance, have they initiated any additional visits to Weston Aerodrome since a significant drugs haul was made on a flight originating there?  In the course of the Revenue&rsquo;s review, has it carried out any additional checks or visits to private airports around the country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>This incident heightened sensitivity on the part of Revenue, and I am sure it has acted accordingly, although I do not have that information.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are conducting a review of approval conditions attached to licensed aerodromes, and they are also concentrating on risks in the operation of, and procedures at, such aerodromes.  They are focusing mainly on smaller licensed aerodromes such as Weston, and those regional aerodromes where controls are currently being carried out by special compliance teams that, as part of their duties, deal with the smuggling of prohibited goods such as drugs.</P><Col N="78"/>
        <P Just="Left">All the available evidence from customs administrations worldwide indicates the most effective means of detecting drug smuggling is concentrating on the development and gathering of information and intelligence and employing targeted interventions as a consequence.  As soon as we have the conclusions of the report, I am sure they can be acted on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister passes through Dublin Airport from time to time.  People routinely arrive two or three hours before their flight to go through wide-ranging and intensive security checks.  However, the situation at small aerodromes seems extraordinarily lax.  I understand the Weston issue first came to attention because of the Ryder Cup.  Some of the Americans using the airport were shocked, given their own security profiling, at the complete absence of suitable measures.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister have figures on how many times since the episode Customs and Excise have set up a service and examined passengers disembarking from flights in private aerodromes?  There is a risk from drugs, and the Minister must also be aware of what is happening in Limerick and on the west side of Dublin.  Many Members represent such areas, and the death rate among young people as a result of drugs and guns is genuinely terrifying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that drugs are a menace and a serious danger to the functioning of society, and we must do all that we can.  Increased resources are being deployed to deal with them, by the garda&iacute;, Customs and Excise and everyone else.  The Deputy has asked whether the promised review has been completed and if I would make a statement on the matter.  That review has not yet been completed, although that will have happened by the end of November.</P>
        <P>The supplementary information I can give is of the same nature as what I have said already, confirming what the review covers, such as procedures, what types of aerodromes it is examining, and what best practice is from a customs administration perspective, including the development of information and intelligence critical to detecting drug-smuggling.  If there are any further specific questions regarding flight numbers and so on, I am sure we will find the answers.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to reports that more lenders plan to launch sub-prime mortgages in 2007 in addition to the existing packages offered by a company (details supplied); if the Financial Regulator is in discussion with these banks to ensure that charges such as arrangement fees and rates are set at reasonable levels and <Col N="79"/>remain at reasonable levels; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[39238/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the reports referred to by the Deputy.  The sub-prime market exists to provide finance to those who have difficulty accessing mainstream credit, usually owing to an adverse credit history or difficulties proving income.  Consequently, interest on such loans is normally higher than in the case of mainstream credit, as the lender must allow for a greater degree of credit risk.  As the Deputy may be aware, the level of lending in the sub-prime market is currently extremely small.</P>
        <P>Sub-prime lenders are regulated in Ireland in respect of their lending activities under the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  The Act makes detailed provision for the form and content of the various loan agreements and advertising of consumer credit.  The Financial Regulator has powers of investigation, review and enforcement regarding matters covered by the Act.  The Act also provides for a procedure whereby lenders not otherwise authorised by the Financial Regulator may be prescribed as a credit institution by the consumer director of the Financial Regulator for the purposes of compliance with the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  If so prescribed, the lender in question is then required, under section 149 of the Act, to notify the Financial Regulator for approval of the non-interest charges and arrangement fees that it imposes on its customers.  Failure to notify the consumer director in the Office of the Financial Regulator of new charges or changes to existing charges is now an offence.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that, as part of its consumer protection remit, the Financial Regulator continuously monitors new and developing financial products in the marketplace.  In view of my role as Minister for Finance, I will give full consideration to any recommendation from the Financial Regulator that may require a legislative response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I have previously raised sub-prime lending with the Minister for Finance and the Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  I find it paradoxical that the Financial Regulator takes, no doubt correctly, a reasonably tough attitude to building societies, which are the people&rsquo;s banks, particularly for those with whom ordinary banks will not deal.  He is even stalling on facilitating very well endowed credit unions to offer more home products.  However, at the same time people go from door to door through housing estates, particularly local authority housing estates &mdash; not to mention afternoon television &mdash; offering sub-prime mortgages.</P>
        <P>The subtext in sub-prime mortgages is that they can solve one&rsquo;s financial problems by consolidating one&rsquo;s loans, meaning one could be better off.  The hidden part is that there are arrangement fees, and I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views <Col N="80"/>in that regard.  Some are as high as 1% of the price of the property, meaning that one could pay &euro;4,000 in arrangement or start-up fees on a &euro;400,000 property.  With certain products, if one fails to meet the loan conditions, the provision for penalties is extortionate.</P>
        <P>Many people who are less well informed financially lack access to the normal banking system and cannot go to a credit union.  They are being pressurised by sub-prime lenders who will make a fortune from them.  We spoke earlier of mortgage interest rates crossing the 5% threshold some time next month.  Is the Minister concerned that sub-prime lenders may be preying on the vulnerable?  People must take responsibility for their financial decisions, but the sub-prime lending market is very much unregulated compared with building societies, ordinary banks and credit unions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the company to which the Deputy referred is one of a handful of companies operating in this sector, but I have no information on the intentions of such companies in what is essentially a commercial matter for themselves.  In regard to the procedures used by the Financial Regulator to determine what charges it will allow a lender to impose, section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 sets out as criteria the promotion of fair competition, the statement of commercial justification, a credit institution passing any costs onto its customers and the effect on customers of any proposal to impose any charge in regard to the provision of such services.  In the case of housing loans, the Act specifically obliges mortgage lenders to inform borrowers of the effect on the amount of their repayment instalments of a 1% increase in interest rates in the first year of their mortgage.</P>
        <P>The issue to which the Deputy referred is, therefore, covered by the 1995 Act.  If the Deputy is concerned that these companies are not operating within the remit of the Act, she should bring her concerns to the attention of the Financial Regulator for investigation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister for Finance send out a message to some of those entering this potentially hugely profitable market that he will seek to protect consumers?  He is passing all responsibility for this issue to the Financial Regulator as though it is nothing to do with him.  Will he let it be known that he will not let some of the poorest people in our society be completely ripped off by companies that may operate at a level not many degrees above that of loan sharks?</P>
        <P>Moreover, many of these companies are offering roll-up products.  Not only can customers get a new mortgage or transfer an existing one but they can also amalgamate car loans and credit card debt and even have something left over to go on holiday.  We have spoken about the Central Bank&rsquo;s financial stability report.  This is dangerous territory.  Has the Minister written to the Fin<Col N="81"/>ancial Regulator and requested a meeting to discuss this issue?  Will those vulnerable people who may be ripped off by these companies be left simply to pick up the pieces?  Sub-prime lending does not represent a soft lending for the housing market.</P>

	<P>A 2% stamp duty is charged on most non-life insurance premiums and this is part of the normal stamp duty system.  The exceptions are re-insurance, voluntary health insurance, marine, aviation and transit insurance and export credit insurance.  This duty was introduced in 1982 and it yielded &euro;90 million in 2006.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to distinguish between the different types of insurance business within the yield from the non-life levy.  The purpose of the non-life levy is to broaden the stamp duty base while maintaining low direct tax rates.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann commends the 2007 Estimates for Public Services (Abridged) published by the Minister for Finance on 16 November 2006.</P>
  
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said at the outset, we are debating a Book of Estimates that shows an enormous improvement in the funding being provided under the various heads.  The Department of Education and Science Vote, for example, indicates a 30% increase under the special education subhead.  There is a perception that those with special educational needs have been neglected for years.  This increase will be of major benefit to such persons.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;730 million is allocated under the Department of Education and Science Vote to tackle disadvantage, an increase of 15% over the 2006 allocation.  We could not have dreamed some years ago that we would be able to increase expenditure by 15% in any area.  The Minister for Finance and his Department are to be complimented on the way in which the economy has been run for the last several years.  It is this management that has ensured the funds are available <Col N="83"/>to improve the education system.  I hope the proposals in regard to school buildings will be sufficient to ensure that many of the projects for which Members have pressed will be brought to fruition in the coming year.</P>
        <P>The Department of Transport Vote represents a phenomenal increase of 58% on the 2006 allocation.  More than &euro;1.5 billion will be provided for national roads development, &euro;45 million for coastguard and marine safety, &euro;10 million for the Road Safety Authority and &euro;9 million for the rural transport initiative.  Improved transport services have been of enormous benefit in rural areas and I am pleased that such provision is being established as a fully fledged programme.  I hope to see the continued expansion of the Rural Lift schemes and other schemes which seek to assist those who are marginalised because of difficulties with public transport availability.</P>
        <P>Expenditure on rural roads is phenomenal and we can see the improvements it is making throughout the State.  Areas that were seen only recently as peripheral are now considered within easy reach of Dublin and other cities.  The development of the M4 motorway, in particular, has been of great benefit to the north and north west.</P>
        <P>The provision of &euro;14 billion for social welfare services is an enormous amount and is similar to the allocation for the health service.  I hope that both expenditures will lead to further improvements in the carer&rsquo;s allowance and other benefits for those who provide long-term care and attention to the ill and aged.  I have encouraged the Minister for Finance to consider what may be done to make it more attractive for people to look after elderly or invalid relatives at home rather than putting them in institutional care.  I hope further such supports will be put in place by the Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Health and Children.</P>
        <P>We have seen the significant benefits arising from the improvements in pension rates in recent years.  I hope there will be similar increases for those who are marginalised and less well off.</P>
        <P>I welcome the significant increase in the allocation for sport.  Some will argue as to why money should be spent on sports funding.  Those who have become involved in sport have benefitted in later life, particularly regarding their long-term health.  This expenditure is to be welcomed.  Grants available to local clubs under the sports capital programme should be allocated to smaller communities.  It is harder for a small GAA club in the west to raise funds than it is for a club in a large town or city.  It has been shown that these grants have been more beneficial to smaller communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Estimates propose large increases in the grants for the agricultural sector.  Disadvantaged areas payments will be increased by 8%, following the partnership negotiations.  REPS payments will increase by 17%, a significant amount for <Col N="84"/>those benefiting from the scheme.  The early retirement scheme for farmers will be increased to a maximum of &euro;15,000.  This will encourage older farmers to hand over to younger ones at an earlier stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>They are gone from farming anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>We will leave that to another day.  Increases will be made in the forestry programme.  The most important increase in agriculture payments is the proposed scheme of grant aid for suckler farmers.  If Ireland wants to maintain its agricultural sector, it will have to be in the high-quality and high-value produce market.  The day of the mass markets is over.  They have been taken over by other economies which can produce agricultural produce at low costs.  However, the consistency and quality of such produce leaves much to be desired.  We must encourage our agricultural sector to develop the high-quality produce end of the market.</P>
        <P>The CL&Aacute;R and Leader programmes will receive more funding.  Those in CL&Aacute;R areas find the benefit when topping up various Government schemes to ensure they come to be completed by local authorities and State agencies.  Some schemes are not priced outside of the local contribution, which must be welcomed.  I hope those under the Leader scheme will receive more assistance than some of the other schemes.  In the past, some felt they had been left in the margins under the Leader programme.</P>
        <P>The increase in funding for the Western Development Commission is also to be welcomed.  I hope, however, the commission will be easier to deal with and there is less red tape.  While I accept the commission must do its job with due diligence, many voluntary organisations are frustrated by its red tape and unnecessary documentation being sought in some cases.  Some of this is beyond what one would expect from any lending institution.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the Estimates, when the budget is announced I hope many projects Members have promoted will be included in it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The spending of public moneys forecast in the Estimates shows how much every taxpayer is forced to put into the Government&rsquo;s slush fund.  The Minister for Finance has stated that an extra &euro;6,700 will be spent for every man, woman and child.  The question is, how effective is the spending?  One needs only look at the health services and the vast amounts of money spent on it to see that throwing money at a problem does not solve it.  The solutions to the many problems afflicting our public services require more than money.</P>
        <P>From 2000 to 2007, current spending by the Government increased by an astonishing 120%.  How has this spending transformed our public services?  Do we have a first class health service? <Col N="85"/> Do we have an enviable road transport network?  This week, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources admitted some parts of the country will never have broadband services.  The Government has presided over a First World tax haul but left the people with a Third World level of public service.</P>
        <P>This morning, a constituent contacted me to express her dismay at the Government&rsquo;s ineffectiveness in tackling the prohibitive cost of child care.  She likened paying for cr&egrave;che care for her three children to a large second mortgage.  The Government encourages women to enter the workforce to feed economic growth.  Their taxes allow the Government to spend money like it is going out of fashion.  What do they receive in return?  Anecdotal evidence suggests the Government&rsquo;s &euro;1,000 per child under six years scheme merely resulted in a corresponding rise in child care costs, meaning the working mother loses out again.</P>
        <P>For many women, almost their entire salary goes to the cr&egrave;che every week, a ridiculous situation.  If the Government wants women to play a part in economic growth, it must invest those taxes it gains from mothers into child care.  It is time to tackle this issue in a structured and systematic way.  We can no longer make excuses for failing working mothers who make a vital contribution to the strong economy.</P>
        <P>I welcome the plans to introduce more teachers at primary level.  The Minister for Finance claims the pupil-teacher ratio will be reduced to 17:1 as a result of next year&rsquo;s investments.  However, few classes will enjoy such a ratio. The Minister for Education and Science claims the pupil-teacher ratio stands at 22:1, yet all Members know of schools with class sizes of 30 or more.  These pupils are at a serious disadvantage and their teachers&rsquo; working day is exhausting.  With this allocated funding, it is up to the Minister for Education and Science to ensure the additional allocation of teachers alleviates the problem of ridiculously large classes.  The criteria for allocating teachers needs to be re-examined as a matter of urgency.  I urge the Government to tackle these two important issues.</P>

	<P>As the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, is in the Chamber, I take this opportunity to wish her well on her retirement on 8 December.  The Minister of State was always pleasant and nice in the House.  She is not as arrogant as many of her colleagues on the Front Bench.  I wish her well on her retirement.  She never allowed having a ministerial Mercedes go to her head as so many of her colleagues did. <Col N="86"/> They are now so arrogant and big-headed that it is time to rid Government of them.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister of State to do one job before she leaves the Department.  Some of my constituents depend totally on social welfare.  One who came to my clinic last Monday receives &euro;12,000 or &euro;13,000 a year in social welfare.  His wife works outside the home and earns &euro;5,000 a year.  Their total annual income is approximately &euro;18,000.  If one&rsquo;s income exceeds &euro;16,500 one does not receive the top-up grant.  This couple have two children in third level education but do not qualify for the top-up grant from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>For someone who has two or three children in third level education the grant guidelines increase in proportion with the number of children for the top-up scheme.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has achieved some good in social welfare payments but he needs to examine this top-up grant immediately.  There is something very wrong with the system when someone on social welfare whose annual income is &euro;18,000 cannot receive the top-up grant for two children in third level education.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to investigate that and to ask her colleague to change the guidelines to the effect that if someone has more than one child in third level education, the limit rises to &euro;18,000, &euro;20,000 or &euro;25,000.  Leaving it at &euro;16,500 does not make sense.  I want the Minister of State to investigate that before she leaves office.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In respect of the Estimates never has there been so much money in the country, and never so many unhappy people feeling let down by public services.

That will be eaten up by benchmarking and increases in inflation.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Ring for sharing time.  The two minutes in which I must say everything that needs to be said about road safety is about as much time as has been spent on the subject over the past ten years.</P>
        <P>It is great to see an increase of 75% to &euro;33 million being given to the Road Safety Authority.  It will be money well spent although unfortunately two thirds of it will go on administration and wages.  I have spoken to the Road Safety Authority about providing driving centres <Col N="87"/>throughout the country.  No doubt it would cost another &euro;33 million or &euro;70 million.  There are 41 such centres across Europe where people can learn to drive properly.</P>
        <P>On Monday I was in Kerry where I learnt about a company that wants to provide a centre, free of charge, and put up a proper circuit.  I visited a centre in Oldcastle yesterday where young people of Oldcastle and Kells can go with their parents, day or night, to learn the rules of the road on an off-course track.</P>
        <P>These centres exist in Austria, England and Germany.  There are 41 top class centres throughout Europe but nothing here.  Space, not a theory test, is necessary to learn how to drive.  The penalties we impose on young people are not fair if we do not provide them with learning centres.</P>
        <P>The centre in Oldcastle is run by someone involved in the car industry.  He would love to see every young person brought to a centre for 70 or 100 hours.  In America 15 year olds, as part of their curriculum are brought to centres where there are 17 to 20 used cars.  The students are brought onto the course and must learn how to drive.</P>
        <P>I welcome the &euro;33 million provision for the Road Safety Authority.  I have spoken to the authority and it intends providing centres for learning how to drive a motorbike.  Unfortunately, this morning I witnessed a horrific motorbike accident, caused by a combination of speed and slippery roads.  We must address driver education for young people through local authorities, with help from the Government and the private sector.</P>

        <P>Following the Government decision of 7 December 2005, I announced that staff working on child care from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on child welfare and protection from the Department of Health and Children, and from the National Children&rsquo;s Office would combine to form the Office of the Minister for Children.</P>
        <P>The Government also decided that staff working in the areas of youth justice in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and education for early years in the Department of Education and Science, would be based together in the Office of the Minister for Children but continue to work for their parent Departments.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the office has ensured that all policies and services for children are being developed in a new strategic framework of joined-up Government.  I do not know what alternative Deputy Hayes proposed in the course of his contribution this afternoon or what policy Fine Gael has adopted in this matter but this <Col N="88"/>Government has established a framework of joined-up Government for strategic planning of services for children.</P>
        <P>In the context of the 2007 Estimates, announcements in respect of the areas of work which come within the remit of staff co-locating in the office are handled by the parent Department&rsquo;s Minister.  I am satisfied that &euro;16.2 million, of which &euro;12.6 million is for capital purposes, is being allocated to the Irish youth justice service for this year.  This will be supplemented by a further tranche of funding early in the new year which is being transferred from the Department of Education and Science.  This funding will enable a programme of rejuvenation of youth detention and training and community facilities to begin in 2007.</P>
        <P>In addition, a total of &euro;16.8 million from other areas of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform Vote and the Garda Vote is being allocated to youth justice programmes, mentoring programmes and other initiatives comprehended by the Children Act.  This includes &euro;9.8 million for the expansion of Garda youth diversion projects by a further 16, bringing the total in operation nationwide to 100 by the end of 2007.  This will facilitate the rapid and final implementation of the Children Act ahead of schedule.</P>
        <P>I will outline the 2007 Estimates allocation being made available directly to the Office of the Minister for Children.  An additional allocation of &euro;143.083 million of current funding is being made available in 2007 in Vote 41.  This, together with additional capital investment of over &euro;76 million in 2007, represents a 46% increase<b> </b>on existing funding and is clear evidence of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to children.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight the areas which will benefit from this increased investment.  In budget 2006, the Government announced a major new Exchequer funded child care investment programme, the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010, NCIP, with a budget of &euro;575 million over five years and a target of creating 50,000 additional child care places.  New capital grant schemes under the programme were introduced in the early part of this year and there has been a strong public response by way of applications from the child care sector.  To date, over 900 capital grant applications, to a value of more than &euro;170 million, have been received and funding of just under &euro;15 million approved.</P>
        <P>It is necessary to manage the annual allocation of funding over the course of the programme in a way that matches the timing of expenditure demand.  For this reason, the intention is to increase incrementally the annual allocation to the NCIP, to maximise the programme&rsquo;s value to the sector.  In 2007, the NCIP allocation is being increased substantially with a doubling of the capital allocation from &euro;10.3 million to &euro;20 million.</P>
        <P>In addition to the new NCIP, the EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Childcare Prog<Col N="89"/>ramme 2000-2006, EOCP, is continuing in place and &euro;113.346 million has been allocated to the programme in 2007, the final year in which funding will be available under this programme.  In total, &euro;499 million has been allocated to the EOCP over the course of the programme.  This has resulted in support being provided for 56,500 child care places including 32,000 new child care places.  The quality measures under the EOCP have also supported the development of national child care infrastructure, including the development of the network of 33 city and county child care committees, in addition to measures to enhance standards and training and to support childminders who play a crucial role in child care provision in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The work of the EOCP, made possible by the significant level of Government and EU investment, paved the way for the new programme.  In effect, the groundwork that has been laid by the EOCP has enabled the new programme to take a proactive approach to the further development of child care provision and to target identified unmet local needs.  In addition, the new programme will target child care places with an educational focus for children aged three to four years and out-of-school child care for school age children.  The new programme is accompanied by the National Childcare Training Strategy 2006-2010 which is expected to deliver 17,000 additional child care training places over this period.  The training strategy is key to the promotion of quality in early education and child care provision in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Another important element of the National Childcare Strategy 2006-2010, is the early childhood supplement, which came into effect last April and comes within the remit of my office.  This is a direct, non-taxable payment of &euro;1,000 per annum paid to parents of children aged under six years in quarterly instalments of &euro;250.  The final payment in 2006 is due to be paid on 11 December and some 275,000 families are benefiting.  Taken together with child benefit, parents with two children aged under six years are now in receipt of a direct payment of &euro;5,600 per annum.  These payments are regardless of employment status and are intended to assist parents in whatever choices they make for the care of their children in their early years.  The 2007 full year funding for the early childhood supplement is &euro;381 million.  This significant level of funding reflects factors such as the increasing birth rate and, therefore, an increase in the number of children aged under six years, and the fact that, to maximise the benefit to parents of young children, the supplement is being paid to parents for each quarter in which their child is under six years and in respect of the quarter in which the child reaches six years, effectively giving parents an additional quarterly payment.</P>
        <P>Additional funding is being made available to cover projects relating to the national children&rsquo;s strategy.  Under subhead D of Vote 41, the <Col N="90"/>national children&rsquo;s strategy unit had a budget allocation in 2006 of &euro;3.53 million.  This is being increased substantially in 2007 to &euro;9.652 million.  Much of this additional funding is being allocated to the national longitudinal study of children in Ireland, NLSCI, which was launched in April 2006.  This level of investment firmly commits the Government to improving our understanding of children&rsquo;s lives.</P>
        <P>The aim of this study is to examine the factors that contribute to or undermine the well-being of children in contemporary Irish families, and thereby contribute to the development of effective and responsive policies and services for children and families.  The study will monitor the development of 18,000 children &mdash; a cohort of 10,000 infants aged nine months and one of 8,000 nine-year olds.  The contract will run for a period of six years and nine months.  During this period there will be two data collection sweeps of the birth cohort &mdash; at age nine months and three years &mdash; and two data collection sweeps of the nine year cohort &mdash; at age nine and age 13.  An additional &euro;4.01 million is being made available for the study in 2007, giving a total of &euro;6.38 million for this purpose next year.</P>
        <P>I am determined that we continue with our efforts to ensure children have a voice in matters which affect them.  We will continue to support the development of vibrant local Comhairle structures.  We will also continue to invest in educational resources for children themselves so that they know and understand they have a voice in matters that affect their lives under the national children&rsquo;s strategy and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  This includes the development of student councils &mdash; giving students a voice in a domain of their lives which is so important to them.  We will continue to ensure that hard-to-reach children and young people are included in participation structures and projects.</P>
        <P>One of the key strengths to date of the Office of the Minister for Children has been its cross-cutting function, which allows it to work with Departments and other agencies in an innovative way.  Time and again, we are finding that in the area of children&rsquo;s services, the biggest need is to get our services working in a complementary way so that children and their families experience services which are focused on their needs in an holistic way, which shows continuity and consistency of effort across services.  In 2007 I will be using some of the additional funding to devise and support innovative programmes which bring together policy makers and providers with a focus on improved implementation of service delivery.</P>
        <P>It is almost a year since the Office of the Minister for Children was established.  The additional investment being made in the Estimates not only demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving children&rsquo;s lives but also the confidence of the Government in the work of my office in the first year of its existence.  There is no doubt that the establishment of the office and the set<Col N="91"/>ting up of a dedicated Vote with significant additional funding this year will improve outcomes for children and young people throughout the country.  The additional funding for this year is also a clear signal of the Government&rsquo;s belief that investing in children and young people is the key to Ireland&rsquo;s future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>The net total Estimate for the Health Service Executive in 2007 is &euro;11.183 billion.  My confidence in the executive and in its relationship with the Minister for Health and Children has been shaken in recent times.  On 26 October 2006 I raised the issue on the Adjournment of the urgent need for the State to provide for the treatment of public cancer patients at the Whitfield Clinic, Waterford.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The final sentence in the reply of the Minister for Health and Children was, &ldquo;I share Deputy O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s view that we will be able to procure services at the Whitfield centre for patients from the Waterford region in advance of our investment opening there in 2011.&rdquo;  The assistant national director of the HSE&rsquo;s hospitals office stated last Monday that public patients from the south east should be able to access radiotherapy in Waterford early in the new year.  I cannot reconcile these two statements.</P>
        <P>On 25 July 2005 the Minister for Health and Children announced the Government&rsquo;s approval for a national network of radiation oncology services to be put in place by 2011.  Part of the network was an integrated satellite centre in Waterford.  The capital cost of the national network for radiation oncology will be in excess of &euro;400 million approximately, most of which, according to the Minister, will be funded through public private partnerships.</P>
        <P>The Minister also stated at the time that one third of the population will suffer some form of cancer at some stage in their lives.  Over half of all cancer patients should receive radiation oncology as an integral part of their treatment.  The national network will achieve that objective by 2011.  The Minister further stated in reply to the matter I raised in the D&aacute;il on 26 October 2006 that the HSE has her full support in procuring quality services for patients from private not-for-profit independent providers or from the public sector.  What all that boils down to is that treatment for public patients can be provided in Waterford once there is a service agreement with the HSE.</P>
        <P>In reply to a letter which I sent to the Minister on my own behalf and that of the Labour Party councillors in the Waterford constituency regarding the provision of radiotherapy services for public patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center at the Whitfield Clinic in Waterford, I was informed that the Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive and, under the Act, the executive was required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered <Col N="92"/>on its behalf, health and personal social services.  The reply further stated that responsibility for the provision of funding rested with the executive and that a copy of my correspondence had been referred to the chief executive officer of the HSE who would arrange for the matters raised to be investigated and a reply would be sent to me directly.</P>
        <P>On Monday morning the assistant national director of the HSE&rsquo;s hospitals office announced on national radio that he needed to clarify that up until the middle of September the National Hospitals Office had received no contact from the Whitfield Clinic and that the HSE did initiate the contact themselves.  In response to this, the University of Pittsburgh Whitfield Cancer Center issued a press statement qualifying the situation in regard to access to radiotherapy for public patients.  Mr. Michael Costelloe, managing director of UPMC Cancer Centres International, operators of the cancer centre developed in partnership with the Irish health care firm Euro Care International said on Monday that there had been a clear commitment from the outset that the facility in Waterford would be open on an equal basis to all patients from the south-east region who needed it, irrespective of whether their treatment was funded by private health insurers or the HSE, and that contrary to what had been stated by the assistant director of the National Hospitals Office there had been repeated contacts between the project team at UPMC Whitfield Cancer Center and various HSE personnel from 2004 onwards.  While Mr. Costello was not involved at that stage there may well have been initial contacts in 2003 when details of the project were first outlined by the original proposers<b>.  </b>The then CEO of the South Eastern Health Board, Mr. Pat McLoughlin, visited the UPMC headquarters in Pittsburgh in October 2004 on a fact finding mission.  Senior personnel from UPMC met the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, in Dublin in February 2005 to discuss the issue of how public patients could access treatments that were not available in Waterford and the south east.</P>
        <P>In April 2005 a medical and technical group from the HSE south-east region visited Pittsburgh to view the UPMC facilities.  In May 2005 at the sod turning at the Whitfield clinic it was emphasised again that the facility would be open to all.  This was confirmed to the Taoiseach and the then T&aacute;naiste at meetings in September 2005.  Mr. Costello wrote to Professor Brendan Drumm, chief executive, Health Service Executive, on 14 February 2006, officially advising Professor Drumm that the centre would open later this year and stating the eagerness of UPMC to treat public patients.  Even though Professor Drumm&rsquo;s office responded shortly afterwards stating the matter had been referred to the director of the HSE national hospitals office, there was no contact from the national hospitals office with UPMC.  On 15 March 2006 Mr. Costello met with <Col N="93"/>the HSE south-east network manager in Waterford and presented him with a copy of his proposal which had already been delivered.  This was followed up by a letter a fortnight later.</P>
        <P>What I find absolutely incredible is the apparent massive lack of communication within the HSE on major health issues.  That this could occur within a very large organisation charged with delivering health and personal social services to the citizens that is to receive &euro;13 billion gross in 2007 is a major indictment of the Minister for Health and Children and of the HSE.</P>
        <P>How is it possible to have confidence in either the stewardship of the Minister or of the HSE in regard to the provision of vital services for up to 1,000 patients per annum in the south-east region, many of them extremely ill?  I demand to know what the Minister intends to do urgently about acquiring radiotherapy in Waterford for public patients in the south east.  Excuses are raised about national guidelines for radiotherapy services but it is the lack of response by the HSE to UPMC and the non-provision of funding that is really to blame.  I trust there is sufficient funding in the 2007 HSE south-east region budget.</P>
        <P>I shall refer to some of the areas surrounding my brief, particularly community affairs.  Under the heading of improved co-ordination of local and community development services there is a cut of 49% in this year&rsquo;s Estimate from &euro;4.2 million last year to &euro;2.2 million this year.  The improved co-ordination of local and community development services was a much heralded aspect of this new department.  I see no evidence that objective has been achieved.  Is the Government giving up on this issue by reducing the budget and moving away from it?</P>
        <P>On the drugs initiative, the young peoples facilities and services fund has not been increased this year, which an allocation of &euro;43 million this year and &euro;43 million next year.  Given the funding is at a standstill and not keeping pace with inflation, one would think the drugs problem had reached a point where the solution is at hand.  Members on all sides know that is far from the position.  A television programme last night indicated there is a need for a great deal more spending on prevention, medical services and so on.  The country is awash with heroin.  There is a culture out there that believes that cannabis, which is widely used, is not a harmful drug.  There are similar views in regard to the use of cocaine.  A worrying trend is the use of cocaine for leisure purposes by the middle class.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the oppor<Col N="94"/>tunity to speak about the 2007 Abridged Estimates and the Office of Public Works&rsquo; programme for next year.  I am glad to report the published allocation of &euro;612 million represents an increase of 10% over the 2006 provision.  Through the allocation of considerable additional resources amounting to &euro;170 million to the Office of Public Works Vote, the Government has once again demonstrated its total support for the rollout of the decentralisation programme.</P>
        <P>As one of the biggest infrastructural projects undertaken by the State in recent times, this programme represents a major undertaking for the OPW.  It involves the relocation of more than 10,000 civil and public servants, 50 Government Departments and offices and more than 50 different locations in 23 counties.  From OPW&rsquo;s point of view there are two main aspects to the programme, one being the identification and procurement of suitable sites and the other being the construction and fitting out of buildings on these sites.  I am happy to report that real progress is being made on both fronts.</P>
        <P>To date, property acquisition negotiations have been completed or significantly advanced in 36 locations and 2007 will see the acceleration of the programme with a number of site acquisitions to be finalised in the coming months.  To date, decentralising organisations have established a presence in 12 new locations with moves already having taken place to Sligo, Portlaoise, Thurles, Tipperary town and Na Forbacha in Galway.</P>
        <P>In parallel with the acquisition of permanent accommodation solutions, the Office of Public Works has been involved in sourcing temporary solutions in 18 locations to accommodate advance parties.  These temporary solutions will allow the early movement of staff to their desired locations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The decentralisation implementation group in its most recent report expressed its satisfaction on progress to date in terms of property acquisition.  The group noted that significant progress has been made as is evidenced by the fact that approximately 500 staff are currently in new locations and that more than 2,100 staff have already been reassigned to decentralising posts.</P>
        <P>In providing accommodation, a number of procurement methods are being employed including client led design build, design build, and design build finance maintain.  Although property solutions will include leasing and fitting-out of existing buildings, construction of new buildings is the preferred option in terms of providing accommodation for decentralising Government Departments and offices.</P>
        <P>The public private partnership approach recommended by the decentralisation implementation group will see the construction of new offices for the Departments of Agriculture and Food, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Education and Science in Portlaoise, Carlow and Mullingar, respectively.  This project will be moved forward to the tender stage at the earliest <Col N="95"/>possible date with a view to the buildings being in place in the first half of 2009.</P>
        <P>During 2007 considerable progress will be made in establishing a number of new departmental headquarters buildings such as the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in Wexford, the Department of Defence in Newbridge and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in Knock.  Planning permission has been obtained and contracts are expected to be placed in the near future for a new headquarters building for the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism in Killarney and a new facility for the Department of Education and Science in Athlone.  In respect of my Department, a preferred tenderer has been selected and a planning application has been lodged for the new OPW headquarters in Trim.  It is estimated that approximately 210,000 sq. m of office space will be required to accommodate the total numbers included in the programme.  The cost of providing accommodation in provincial locations compared with central Dublin locations should yield considerable cost savings to the State over time in terms of site costs, capital build costs and maintenance costs.</P>
        <P>As I have stated previously it is one of my principal objectives as Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works to transform underutilised State properties and turn them into realisable assets.  This rationalisation and consolidation of office accommodation in Dublin has resulted in the release and sale of surplus office accommodation in Dublin.  To date this year alone &euro;221 million has been surrendered to the Exchequer following such sales and since the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation announcement OPW has realised &euro;362 million on the sale of properties.</P>
        <P>OPW will continue to be fully engaged across the entire range of its activities in 2007 and next year will see an increased emphasis on the capital element of the flood risk management programme.  In 2004, following the review of flood policy that I initiated, the Government adopted a new policy on flood management in line with internationally changing perspectives.  Lead responsibility for the implementation of that policy was assigned to the Office of Public Works.  In acknowledging that information is critical to the process of sustainable development, additional resources were made available in 2006 on the engineering group of subheads to facilitate the studies required for the implementation of the policy on flood risk management.  This has allowed and will allow for the development of comprehensive information databases, understanding and expertise in the areas of river engineering and hydrology that can only be secured with the most up-to-date gauging equipment.</P>
        <P>A tangible measure of the progress in this area has been evident in recent months which saw the launch of the new flood mapping website.  It is <Col N="96"/>widely accepted that the availability of such maps is the essential foundation on which to build a comprehensive flood prevention policy.  My officials examined best practice in other jurisdictions and availed of the experience gathered to launch <i>www.floodmaps.ie</i>.  The flood hazard mapping website has been well received by all and has certainly raised debate and interest in many areas.  The availability of these maps is the essential foundation on which to build a comprehensive flood prevention policy.  OPW is also working with local authorities and other agencies in the preparation of flood studies for a number of urban areas and where necessary they will provide a basis for the design of flood relief schemes.</P>
        <P>The increase in the 2007 flood relief capital allocation to &euro;32 million will allow the office to accelerate the regenerated flood relief programme in 2007 and it is anticipated that major schemes at Clonmel, Waterford and Mallow will all soon start.  This will provide much needed reassurance for the people and communities concerned, as is evident following the success of schemes in Kilkenny and along the River Tolka.</P>
        <P>An allocation of &euro;141.35 million is included on Vote 10 for new works, alterations and additions to Government accommodation.  In recent years we have seen the successful provision of 400,000 sq. ft. of new accommodation for the State Laboratory, and Department of Agriculture and Food laboratories, and the relocation of the Marine Institute to Galway under this subhead.  The emphasis in 2007 will switch to the Department of Agriculture and Food farm located in Abbotstown which will be relocated to a 350-acre farm in Longtown, Clane, County Kildare.  The new facility will include animal compounds, an administration building and an experimental challenge building.</P>
        <P>Other examples of the major projects to be managed in 2007 include the provision of accommodation for the Department of Finance at Merrion Row, a new Garda and Department of Social and Family Affairs building in Ballymun, and the refurbishment and additions to the Assay Office in Dublin Castle.  The Merrion Row accommodation, for example, will comprise 46,000 sq. ft. at 7 to 9 Merrion Row with an underground pedestrian link to Government Buildings.  It will be a signature landmark building adjacent to St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and will account for &euro;18 million of the allocation in 2007.</P>
        <P>The OPW will continue its major programmes of refurbishment of Garda stations, cultural institutions and general office accommodation in 2007.  The Office of Public Works will continue to implement the most up-to-date measures required under the recent Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act for all Government office accommodation.  The Government and OPW are committed to the principle that all building environments should be accessible to everyone and an allocation of &euro;5 million has been ring fenced <Col N="97"/>specifically for the universal access programme in the new works subhead.  However, this does not represent the full extent of OPW expenditure on disabled access, as all our major new construction projects, including the decentralisation programme, are accessible to all.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works continues to manage more than 1 million sq. m of Government accommodation consisting of almost 2,000 buildings of which 41% is leased.  Although a considerable allocation of &euro;124 million has been provided in the Abridged Estimates for rents and rates in 2007, this represents only a minor increase on the 2006 allocation.  Rented accommodation, however, is essential as it affords the office the necessary flexibility to respond to urgent requirements for Departments and is provided for under subhead F3 rents and rates.</P>
        <P>The national monuments and historic properties service has responsibility for some 775 sites and will account for &euro;42.7 million of the OPW Vote in 2007, a significant proportion of the overall Estimate.  The management of national monuments and historic properties, including the provision of visitor services for the public has been successfully merged into the day-to-day operations of the office in recent years, which has led to a more coherent approach to protection and maintenance of our natural heritage and historic built environment.</P>
        <P>The members of this House and the public can be assured that I have secured sufficient funding to enable the Office of Public Works to continue and advance its activities in all areas of responsibility entrusted to it by Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Allen.  I understand he is sharing time with Deputies Olivia Mitchell and Crawford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>We will share as equally as we can.  While I welcome the increase in overseas aid, I remind the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, that the target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012 represents a major shortfall in the promise made by the Taoiseach at the United Nations General Assembly, when he stated we would reach the 0.7% target by 2007.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment to enshrine the 0.7% target in legislation?  I know he will answer that it is a risky policy.  However, if the 0.7% target is enshrined in legislation, at least there would be certainty and it would not be seen as just a pre-election promise.  The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, need not reply now &mdash; he will have ten minutes to answer later.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, has left.  I wish he had stayed a little longer.  He spoke about decentralisation in terms of offices and buildings.  It is far more important than that.  We should be talking about devolution of power to the regions.  With the increase in funding for overseas development, we will have a major problem with the decentralisation of Irish Aid.  The last <Col N="98"/>figures I got from the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, indicated that of three principal development specialists serving in Irish Aid headquarters, none wanted to decentralise and of the 12 senior development specialists at Irish Aid headquarters none had applied to decentralise.  How is the Minister of State dealing with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding the looseness in how moneys are spent?</P>
        <P>At a time when the Minister of State is telling us about the increase in overseas development aid the Cork office of Comhl&aacute;mh, the Irish association of development workers, is threatened with closure because of technicalities regarding aid applications with the EU and the Government.  I ask the Minister of State to investigate immediately the proposal to close that office in Cork.  It has a backup of approximately 500 volunteers and supporters and deals with a number of development issues and projects.  To hear it is closing in a year when the Minister of State is announcing a major increase in funding is a total contradiction.</P>
        <P>I welcome next Tuesday evening&rsquo;s debate on the situation in Darfur.  I hope we will have some influence on what is not only one of the most catastrophic humanitarian disasters of our time, but is also a security disaster.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to tell us what is happening on the decentralisation programme of Irish Aid and the effect it will have on the institutional memory of that organisation.  People are genuinely concerned about what is happening and indeed what is not happening.  The matter has been dealt with in a ham-fisted way.  The comments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who threatened people with certain measures unless they toed the line, in that regard were not helpful at a vital juncture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute, however briefly, to the debate on the Estimates.  It is timely that we should be discussing the transport Estimate when the number of calls to my office from people who are desperate regarding the level of congestion in Dublin city and other areas throughout the country continues to grow.  People are at their wits&rsquo; end because it takes them two hours to commute six or seven miles into Dublin city.  Such commutes used to be occasional in nature, now they are a regular occurrence.</P>
        <P>This debate is also timely because it coincides with the figures published today by the Dublin Transportation Office, which illustrate what we have already come to know through bitter experience, namely, that the level of traffic on the M50 increased by 11% in the past two years.  Just when we thought that it would not be possible to fit 11 additional cars on the M50, we discover that the level of traffic has increased by 11%.  The latter is occurring on a year-by-year basis, with no commensurate improvement in public transport.  There has also been a 16% increase in the <Col N="99"/>number of cars trying to cross the wall around the city that is the M50.  When one considers that the M50 actually comprises the two major routes around the city, it is no wonder that people get up at 5 a.m. in order to try to make their short journeys to work.</P>
        <P>To discuss the transport Estimate is really to discuss a fairy tale because the figures provided are purely notional.  Last year&rsquo;s Estimate bears no resemblance to what happened on the ground.  We have no reason to assume that this year will be any different.</P>
        <P>There will be no improvement in public transport in the immediate future.  The king of promises and press conferences, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, refers to things that will happen in 15 or 20 years time.  There is nothing that will happen in the immediate future that will offer any relief.  Each year the number of cars on our roads increases, while Dublin Bus carries fewer passengers than it used to during the morning peak hours.  The number of cars crossing the canals is growing, squeezing an ever-increasing number of people into that small space.  The increase in the subvention of 5% will not even cover inflation.  This means there will be no increase in the number of passengers carried by Dublin Bus in the coming year.</P>
        <P>At yet another press conference, the Minister promised that private buses would be introduced onto particular routes and that subventions would be paid in respect of them.  Not only are there no private buses, there is no one in place to pay the subvention.  The Dublin transportation authority was supposed to be established but money has not been provided in the Estimates to facilitate this.  The authority has no board, chairman or budget at a time when the city is in chaos.  There is no co-ordination and nothing is operating as it should.  Even though Transport 21 was only introduced a year ago, slippage has already occurred.</P>
        <P>There is nothing in the Estimates that will give relief in the short term to people living in our cities, particularly Dublin where conditions have reached an all-time low.  The Estimates represent the worst possible Christmas present for Dubliners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The Estimates are brilliant and outline the allocation of &euro;54.3 billion.  A total of &euro;14.6 billion will be spent on health.  This compares very favourably to the &euro;3 billion allocated in this area ten years ago.  However, where are the benefits and where has the money gone?  How have the people of County Monaghan benefited?  Monaghan General Hospital has half the number of beds it had ten years ago.  It also has approximately half the services it possessed at that time.  The major difficulty is that alternatives have not been forthcoming.</P>
        <P>We are continually informed that nothing will be taken away unless an alternative is available <Col N="100"/>but that has not proved to be the case.  According to a senior executive in the HSE, it takes two years to get onto a waiting list for a first appointment relating to orthopaedic services.  People are then obliged to endure a further wait following that appointment.  We have been informed that the position relating to the provision of cancer services has improved.  A lady to whom I spoke yesterday was informed that the bed set aside for her in the Mater Hospital would not be available until at least the middle of next month.</P>
        <P>The actual increase in the allocation relating to agriculture is 10%, although the Book of Estimates appears to make out that it is 14.4%.  There have been cutbacks in research and training and in forestry, two of the areas in respect of which assistance is most required if we are to maintain our place in international markets and do something similar to what was achieved 25 years ago when there was no funding available.  The allocation in respect of farm buildings is quite small, particularly when one considers that very little money has been provided in the past nine years.  I doubt that the funding provided will be sufficient.  I welcome the increase in respect of rural development but I wonder what will happen to the Leader group.  Perhaps the Minister will, as was the case with Dingle, do a U-turn.</P>
        <P>The final issue to which I wish to refer is the fact that there does not appear to be any funding, in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office or anywhere else, for Northern Ireland.  A clear announcement was made by the UK Government &mdash; perhaps this was not adequate &mdash; in respect of the St. Andrews Agreement.  However, funding does not appear to have been provided in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s commitments in that regard.  Friday is the deadline for what we hope will be a new beginning.  My party believes it is essential that the Taoiseach and the Government make their position clear to people in the Six Counties and the other Border counties who suffered so much during the past 30 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am in a rather privileged position because, in the two years I have held this portfolio, I have achieved something unique in the history of the State, namely, a seven-year multi-annual agreement in respect of the funding of Irish Aid.  That agreement stretches to 2012 and is being backed by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and his Department, and not merely with hard cash increases.  For perhaps the first time in the area of overseas aid, the Department is tracking percentage increases year on year.  In effect, I do not have a serious negotiation process in which to engage in respect of the Estimates.  I spoke to the Minister moments ago and he asked me what will be the percentage, and I indicated what we are going to deliver this year.</P>
        <P>The total allocation for Irish Aid this year under Vote 29 &mdash; International Co-operation &mdash; will be &euro;728 million.  This is a significant increase <Col N="101"/>of &euro;128.2 million, or 21%, on the 2006 Vote.  A further &euro;85 million will be allocated through other Departments, making a total allocation in 2007 in respect of overseas development assistance, ODA, of &euro;813 million.  This is a unique challenge and represents the greatest ever expansion in our aid programme efforts.  It is a genuinely historic development.  Deputy Allen referred to the need to legislate in respect of this commitment on the part of the Government.  In the history of the State, there has never been a commitment as definite or for as long a duration as the seven-year multi-annual package to which I refer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>A similar commitment was made in the past but it fell by the wayside.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>When I took up office, people were criticising the Government and stating that it had not maintained the three-year multi-annual package.  Not only did I restore that package prior to making a commitment to reach the 0.7% target by 2012, but I have now secured a seven-year multi-annual package.  I know that this Government and that which succeeds it will honour this commitment.</P>
        <P>The Government is fulfilling its pledge to reach the 0.7% target by 2012.  I predict that by 2008 spending on ODA by Irish Aid will probably exceed the &euro;1 billion mark.  Again, that will be a truly historic development because it will represent a huge increase in funding.  That increase will also ensure that Ireland continues to be one of the most generous EU or OECD donors in terms of its contribution as a percentage of GNP.  In 2007, our ODA will stand at 0.5%.  Deputy Allen and others who listened carefully to what I said when I took office will be aware that I said that we needed to achieve 0.5% by 2007 if we are to have a realistic opportunity of reaching the 0.7% target.  As I predicted, we will achieve the figure of 0.5% next year.  That is hugely important because it will make it much easier to reach the 0.7% target.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Five years late.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>With the recently published White Paper on Irish Aid as our guide, the programme is entering into a period of considerable growth.  The White Paper is a road map rather than a blueprint and it can be added to and improved as the major expansion of the programme is rolled out.  Irish NGOs will remain key partners in this expansion.  Increases in the Irish Aid budget will allow us to allocate greater funds to NGOs.  In 2005, multiannual Irish Aid funding allocated to the five largest NGOs in Ireland was &euro;46.2 million.  This funding increased by 15% to &euro;52 million this year.</P>
        <P>Based on the Estimates for 2007, I expect to provide significant increases in allocations to Irish and international NGOs.  These increases will be of a magnitude never seen previously and they <Col N="102"/>will require careful monitoring by the NGOs and ourselves.  During the recent Estimates process, I secured a strong commitment from the Minister for Finance to fund the recruitment of 20 additional staff by Irish Aid to monitor, evaluate and audit the money pouring into the organisation.</P>
        <P>I anticipate the total allocation to NGOs will be in excess of &euro;100 million annually over the coming years.  I plan to give increased funding to the Irish Missionary Resource Service in 2007 to fund development work in more than 80 missionary organisations overseas.  Irish Aid supports up to 1,500 missionaries in the field.  This is an extraordinary task and we are delighted to recognise the valuable work that continues to be done by missionaries of all persuasions.  This funding will be in addition to the allocation to the NGOs.</P>
        <P>An area of considerable expansion for Irish Aid in 2007 will be emergency and humanitarian assistance.  The organisation will increase its emergency budget line by 50% from &euro;60 million to &euro;90 million.  The figure has increased from &euro;20 million prior to the Asian tsunami to &euro;90 million during my time in office, which is extraordinary.  This increase reflects the fact that humanitarian crises, triggered by natural or man made events, pose an ever greater threat to human life and development.  Over the past 30 years, natural disasters have affected five times more people than they did a generation ago.  Increased funding in this area will substantially enhance Ireland&rsquo;s response to humanitarian emergencies globally, whether they are sudden onset emergencies such as the recent flooding in North Korea or more protracted situations such as the food crisis in Southern Africa.</P>
        <P>As announced during the recent visit to Dublin by UN Under Secretary Jan Egeland, I am doubling this year&rsquo;s contribution to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, CERF.  In 2007, this important fund will receive &euro;20 million from Irish Aid.  In the next few weeks I will travel to New York to examine how we can make a stronger commitment to that fund to make it effective.  I will seek to forge a five-year partnership with CERF, which would amount, on current projections, to approximately &euro;100 million.  This will be done because a quick response in the first 48 hours after disasters saves lives.  At international level, we need the capability to deploy funding quickly so that intervention is possible.  CERF also plays a valuable role in providing relief in so-called &ldquo;forgotten crises&rdquo;, where the crisis continues after international attention has moved on.  It is important that we do not forget about people who were in the spotlight in the past.</P>
        <P>Other areas that will likely receive emergency assistance from Irish Aid in 2007 are the Darfur region of Sudan and Somalia.  We have not neglected Darfur and I pledged &euro;16 million to the region when I took up office.  We remain committed, as a Government, to assist in this dreadful crisis, which nobody with a conscience could <Col N="103"/>countenance in the medium term.  Irish Aid will also support a variety of longer term recovery interventions, including those aimed at stabilising post-conflict conditions in Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and Liberia.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid provides considerable support for development through UN structures.  Ireland has been to the forefront of efforts to support reform in the UN system.  Irish Aid&rsquo;s preoccupations throughout the process have been the need to maximise the effectiveness of UN development agencies, to ensure coherence between UN bodies, both in the field and at headquarters level, and to secure value for money for member states and, thus, the taxpayer.  As Deputy Allen stated, it must be ensured, as the programme expands, that the NGOs, the UN, our six partner countries in Africa and two partner countries in Asia achieve value for money.</P>
        <P>The public must also be assured the money is being expended appropriately and properly and that we live up to the stellar recommendations, reports and assessments of international organisations such as the OECD and Action Aid, London, which recently stated Irish aid was among the best quality in the world.  Ireland has developed a great reputation for the quality of assistance it provides.  It is untied, uncomplicated and virtuously given and it is not strangled by ulterior motives of a geopolitical, strategic nature or relating to the exercise of diplomacy or military power.</P>
        <P>For that reason, Ireland is a leader in development aid and we put spending in this area at the heart of our foreign policy.  That is the purpose of the White Paper and of meeting the ODA target by 2012.  Ireland will become a demonstrable, clear leader in this field.  Funding has been earmarked and it is ready.  The percentages are being tracked faithfully by the Minister and Department of Finance to achieve that target.  I am proud we have set those goals and objectives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would prefer to return to the Deputy with a more detailed response on Comhl&aacute;mh, as we fund a range of activities carried out by the organisation.</P>
        <P>On 9 November, the UN high-level panel on system wide coherence presented a series of recommendations designed to improve the UN&rsquo;s ability to deliver development assistance.  We will not countenance the diversion or corruption of Irish Aid funding and we will ensure value for money is achieved on behalf of the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>The decentralisation programme will be implemented appropriately and correctly.  A total of 69% of the staff, or 84 out of a total of 123, is in place in Limerick.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Neville.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should be appointed Taoiseach because other areas of responsibility are coming to a full stop.  Nothing is happening in the health area.  Fianna F&aacute;il is dragging the country back to where it was when Charlie Haughey was Taoiseach and Alan Dukes had to bail them out through the Tallaght strategy.  What respect could one have for a Government that generates headlines such as &ldquo;Overheated Economy Fear&rdquo;?  The article states: &ldquo;The Central Bank warns that rising house prices allied with tax cuts and the stock market boom are beginning to overheat the economy&rdquo;.  The same headlines, while pointing out the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s budget put an additional &euro;800 million in people&rsquo;s pockets through tax cuts, highlight that spiralling prices for new houses are making builders rich and happy.  Is that the type of Government people, other than builders, want for this country?  I would welcome it if Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies explained these headlines to people like me on this side of the House.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Events in the health service are important.  Taxpayers will need every euro they have to get the health services they need.  Due to the Government&rsquo;s failure to reform services, we continue to spend significant amounts on them, but considerable gaps in their delivery remain.  Failure to deliver on the health or primary care strategies means that the only alternative to paying &euro;65 to an accident and emergency department or between &euro;40 and &euro;60 to a local general practitioner is to pay <Col N="105"/>between &euro;85 and &euro;260 to a private clinic.  That is only the beginning of people&rsquo;s problems.  Instead of getting a home help service, one is asked to pay between 13.5% and 21% in VAT on home care packages.</P>
        <P>Compared to the preceding situation, Fianna F&aacute;il has spent more than &euro;10 billion extra on health every year since entering power, but it aims to force old people to sell their homes if they need private nursing home care.  This contradicts some of the headlines about this great social, caring Government.  Last year&rsquo;s surplus will go to the same elderly patients to whom the Minister could not repay money stolen from them via illegal nursing homes charges.  Today, representatives of the Health Service Executive told the Joint Committee on Health and Children that there was a deficit in legislation protecting elderly patients, but it also admitted that no resources are available.</P>
        <P>County Wexford is like any other part of the country in that there are not enough public health nurses, occupational therapists, community physiotherapists or counsellors.  Wexford General Hospital, which operates on patients with bowel cancer, an illness the incidence of which is increasing, does not have a specialist nurse to look after patients with colostomy bags.  That is the type of disjointed thinking the Government passes off as a reforming health service.</P>
        <P>Not only is the Leas Cross report a live issue, and there are a number of similar nursing homes, but the HSE admitted that it does not have enough doctors and nurses to carry out inspections of nursing homes.  This is a disgrace for the Government.  Its overreliance on the private sector is to the detriment of elderly patients.  While the private sector has a role to play in respect of low dependency and intermediate dependency patients, the public sector must be built up to look after high dependency patients.  Phase 1 of St. John&rsquo;s Hospital in Enniscorthy, which looks after elderly patients in County Wexford, has taken more than ten years to build, but phases 2 and 3 remain to be completed.  This is the slow pace at which the Government delivers service in the health sector and the reason people are losing confidence.  A great deal of trust in the HSE has been lost.</P>
        <P>The Government is in for a rude awakening because many people do not believe the headlines they read about it or that it is capable of protecting the economy.  The Minister of State might give the impression that he is capable of taking over for the Taoiseach because he is doing his job so well, but there are many duds above him in the Cabinet.  Some &euro;160 million was thrown away on a computer system with an uncertain future; the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, is storing half that amount in perpetuity to see if he can get electronic voting machines working; and the T&aacute;naiste is paying twice the market value of land to have a new prison built in his honour, epitomising the <Col N="106"/>Ceausescu-like complex of the boss of the Progressive Democrats.  This is the type of governance being delivered.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  There is not much else to say on the health service because the Government has done little for it.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate because I also wish to raise issues concerning the health service, particularly its Cinderella, namely, psychiatric services.  It is a disgrace that in the Administration&rsquo;s lifetime, the contribution to psychiatric health services has fallen from 11% to 7% of the total health budget this year.  Bearing in mind that at some stage in his or her life, one in four people will suffer psychiatric or emotional difficulties requiring assistance, the Government is neglecting an important issue.  The Government is protected by the stigma surrounding the matter because people are slow to talk and complain about the treatment of the psychiatric health service.</P>
        <P>In the past week, the debate between various psychiatrists and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for disability and mental health services, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, epitomised how little has been done because the same debate took place 20 years ago when a report was published.  It was accepted as Government policy that there would be multidisciplinary psychiatric services with a significant input from the psychotherapy sector.</P>
        <P>Despite an agreement to deal with the matter some 22 years ago, a Minister of State is today saying that we should debate it.  Every Government since that time has accepted that psychotherapy and multidisciplinary teams, including family therapy, occupational therapy and clinical nursing, should be part of an holistic approach to psychiatric services, but the neglect in building those teams has created a neglect in developing the services.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to change the reduction and increase substantially the percentage of funding needed to develop psychiatric services.  Last January, a new report entitled A <Col N="107"/>Vision for Change, which included 50% of the earlier report&rsquo;s recommendations, also accepted all of the recommendations.  It was <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>.  This time, we urge the Government to invest seriously in psychiatric services to bring them to at least the level found in neighbouring countries, namely, 12% of the total health budget.</P>
        <P>In 2004, the Mental Health Commission, a State agency, stated: &ldquo;Under funding is reflective of the prevalence of mental disorder and generally negative and stigmatised attitudes towards mental illness generally.&rdquo;  It also stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The provision of and quality of mental health services have received a low priority over decades.  Despite report after report on the need to properly resource, refocus and reorganise the mental health services to make them patient-centred, community based and comprehensively available, the services remain below par for many of those who need them.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It went on to state:</P>
        <P LI="1">The standard of care for patients in large psychiatric institutions has been severely criticised by the Inspector of Mental Health Services in his 2005 report.  Despite repeated Government pledges to close these institutions, just four have closed over the past 20 years and patients continue to be admitted to long-stay wards.  Many of these wards have little or no therapeutic activity, multidisciplinary input, regular physical or psychiatric assessments or care plans for patients.  Community residences for former long-stay patients were found by the inspector to be an &ldquo;exercise in relocation rather than part of a rehabilitation programme&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Approximately 5% of people over 65 years of age suffer from some form of dementia and a further 15% to 20% suffer from other mental problems, such as depression and anxiety.  These problems are normally of a mild severity but a significant proportion require specialist intervention, which is not happening.  I urge the Government to address the needs of those people.  Homeless people are far more likely than the general population to be mentally ill and very little is done to treat mental illness among the homeless and prisoners.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Earlier today I attended, with some of my colleagues, the launch of the consultation on metro west, the last major project of Transport 21 to be announced.  In the Estimates this year the Minister has allocated &euro;770 million for investment in public transport, a 58% increase on last year&rsquo;s Estimate.  This time last year, when Transport 21 was announced, people said it would never see the light of day.  Ironically, because of the speed at which the Railway Procurement Agency has worked, and the speed at which it has managed to engage with the public, I now hear complaints from Members opposite that we are <Col N="108"/>moving too fast.  The line has been identified for metro north, which will provide a transport link from St. Stephens Green to Parnell Square, Drumcondra, Griffith Avenue, Dublin City University, Ballymun and to Dublin Airport and beyond.  Most of the route will be tunnelled and discussions are being held currently on that matter.</P>
        <P>I do not look at these projects through rose-tinted glasses.  As public representatives we have engaged with the Ballymun community to see how best metro north can traverse the new town of Ballymun.  It is important the RPA receives a clear message that, for the sake of one kilometre, it would be foolhardy in the extreme to insist that metro north travel either at grade level or at elevated level through Ballymun.  We seek a fully-bored section through Ballymun, which the community deserves and which is a necessity for the commuters using metro north.  We are aware the line must be elevated to traverse the M50 to reach Metropark and travel onwards to the station below Dublin Airport.</P>
        <P>We will have further discussions with the RPA later this week and I call on it to seriously examine the huge severance to Ballymun, a new town which is the largest refurbishment project in the history of the State and currently one of the largest in Europe, which will involve investment of several billion euro by the time it is completed.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with special responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern, handed over the keys to the 1,000th new house to be occupied as part of the project and we are more than half way there.  Huge infrastructure has been delivered to Ballymun and it would be a great shame if we allowed a high-speed train through the town every 90 seconds.  If it had to stop at two or three sets of traffic lights the number of commuters would drop significantly.  The disruption to the residential and commercial life of Ballymun would be too much to contemplate and counterproductive and the costs of the alternatives proposed by the RPA are unrealistic.</P>
        <P>I will turn to the area of justice, equality and law reform.  This Government has ensured investment to tackle not just crime but also the causes of crime.  That is a common clich&eacute; but this Government is putting its money where its mouth is.  I was appalled yesterday, or the day before, to read of some of the proposals the Fine Gael Party has for dealing with law and order.</P>

I hope Fine Gael is simply being facetious because if that is a real policy we are in serious trouble.</P>
        <P>This year the Government is to introduce youth justice divisions in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and in the Department of Health and Children.  Those Departments run programmes, such as crime diversion programmes, which are hugely important and should not be derided.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are underfunded, at least in my constituency. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an increase of &euro;16 million in funding for the youth justice service.  The crime diversion programmes, as Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan knows better than I, thrive throughout the country.  I have been critical of some and repeat that each should have two workers because employing a single worker is insufficient and represents bad practice.  It is important to place young people in the care of such schemes because it will bring home the reality to them that opportunities will arise if they stay out of trouble, remain at school, participate in a Youthreach programme or attend a community training centre.  I welcome the fact the probation and welfare service produces an extremely enlightened programme.</P>
        <P>We are inclined to overlook small things.  The graffiti removal programme, run jointly by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, is an important initiative because there is nothing worse for a community than to see walls daubed with graffiti.</P>
        <P>I have often been critical of the lack of modern IT in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and am pleased to note that &euro;38.4 million has been allocated for IT infrastructure to enable the Garda to combat crime.  Very often the equipment garda&iacute; used was non-digital, i.e. analog, and gang lords were well able to listen in to what garda&iacute; said to each other.  I welcome the fact the national digital radio programme is to be enhanced, as I do the introduction and expansion of the Garda traffic corps.  I have to use some of the clogged roads in and around the city and the traffic corps will make a significant difference.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to all associated with the construction of the Dublin Port tunnel, which is probably the most significant engineering project this country has ever seen.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the amount allocated in the justice, equality and law reform Estimate for expenditure on Garda stations.  I particularly welcome the fact that construction has begun on a new Ballymun Garda station, for which we have been awaiting a long time.  Tenders have been accepted for a new Garda station in Finglas, also in my constituency, and construction will begin <Col N="110"/>later in December.  It will provide fine, suitable accommodation for the Garda in that area.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has signed a contract for a new electronic fingerprint system.  Again, one of the ways to combat crime is to keep up with the most modern technology so garda&iacute; are equipped to stay ahead of the criminal.</P>
        <P>There is unprecedented expenditure on education, in which I have a particular interest.  The 800 additional teachers coming on stream at primary level this year, the enhancement of school buildings, provision of new buildings and the delivery of upgrading schemes through the summer works scheme are particularly important.</P>
        <P>I welcome the emphasis on expanding the National Educational Psychological Service.  That is an increasingly important service for which there is great demand.  It started from a low base and is now being rolled out to approach a level where, by networking with the other services available such as home-school and community liaison teachers and the National Educational Welfare Board, it will make a difference.  There is no doubt that the needs of some schoolchildren are being addressed at too late a date.</P>
        <P>I have a particular interest in adult literacy.  There is a huge increase in the Estimates for that sector and I hope a new drive will be undertaken by the Department of Education and Science to address the serious deficiencies in that area.  I commend the Estimates to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy McManus.  In the short time available to me I will address the Estimates for the education sector.  Deputy Carey said there is an increase in provision and I welcome that.  However, Ireland is still far below other European countries and OECD norms in terms of the amount of its national wealth that is spent on education.  Ireland is 29th out of 31 countries in a recent OECD report.</P>
        <P>There must be a substantial increase in spending on education if needs are to be addressed.  There is a need for school placements for children.  It has been estimated by the ESRI that the number of schoolgoing children will increase by 20% over the next decade.  Obviously many of those children will live in the developing areas around cities, particularly Dublin.  However, there is no evidence in the Estimates that this issue will be addressed either next year or in the future.  I urge the Minister for Education and Science and the Government to address this problem seriously and ensure that schools are in place for children when they are needed.</P>
        <P>A specific example of this, which has been highlighted in the media, is the problem in the Laytown and Bettystown areas.  School places were not available for children in those areas this year and some of the children had to go to schools far from their homes.  Others had to go to school in the afternoon.  Despite the fact that I <Col N="111"/>raised the need for a new school in that area in 2004 by way of parliamentary questions in March and May, there was no effective response by the Department.  To judge from information given to the education committee recently, that continues to be the case.  In fact, the public consultation process on the area development plan for north Dublin, south Louth and east Meath is only commencing in December this year even though the need already obviously exists.</P>
        <P>The Government must change the system and purchase land for schools, rather than simply identifying sites, at an early stage in the planning process.  That will save money.  At present, developers can name their price when they know a school is urgently needed in a developing area.  In my constituency Gaelscoil Sairs&eacute;il has been in temporary and totally unsuitable accommodation for more than a decade.  It urgently needs a site so the developers can simply name their price.  That is a waste of public money and does not provide for the basic educational needs of children.  This issue must be urgently addressed.</P>
        <P>Educate Together is the body that deals with multidenominational schools.  It has had to stop supporting parents seeking multidenominational education in new areas, even though that is the parents&rsquo; constitutional right.  The Council of Europe recently again made a statement about Ireland&rsquo;s need to support the provision of multidenominational education.  I had a telephone call from a parent in Carlow last week about this.  The parents are ready to make an application for a new school but Educate Together cannot provide the patronage for them or for parents in three other areas in the country that are ready to make these applications.  It cannot establish the school and provide for the rights of parents in those areas who want a multidenominational school.  I call on the Government to provide appropriate funding for Educate Together in the budget so it can be the patron body for the new schools in these areas where they are urgently needed.  This is a crisis that must be addressed.</P>
        <P>There are many other areas in education I could mention but time is limited.  Deputy Carey referred to the problem of young people dropping out of school and the need to support them.  He was speaking in the context of the justice area.  I welcome the fact that the National Educational Welfare Board has been allocated an increase of resources from &euro;8.1 million to &euro;9.8 million, but it still does not have the money to carry out some of the functions for which it is responsible under the legislation.  One of those functions is to track early school leavers and ensure they are appropriately directed to education, training or whatever course suits and interests them.  The board does not have the funding to do that; it barely has the funding to deal with crisis situations where children are missing school.</P>
        <P>It cannot deal with cases where children are missing for fewer than the 20 days that must be <Col N="112"/>reported, even where parents request it to do so.  I am aware of a parent whose son is not going to school when she sends him there.  She has been told that until it reaches a crisis the board cannot deal with the problem.  It cannot pre-empt these problems and deal with them when they can be dealt with.</P>
        <P>Capitation is another issue.  It is not keeping pace with the increased cost of electricity, gas and so forth.  I could say more on this subject but I will have an opportunity to do so at a later stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan for sharing time with me.  It is welcome that there is additional money this year to fund public services.  The taxpayers are ensuring that we are in a position to provide for increases in the Estimates.  Frankly, the big concern among many people is how the money is spent and how it is wasted due to incompetence.  There is a litany of incompetence on the part of the Department of Health and Children and, indeed, the Minister for Health and Children in recent times.  Whether it is nursing home charges or PPARS there are significant milestones of incompetence and waste that are disturbing.</P>
        <P>Given that it is taxpayers who pay the bills for the health service, the general expectation would be that their needs should be met.  However, these Estimates simply reinforce the <i>status quo</i> and, indeed, will deepen the two tier nature of the health service rather than alleviate it.  That deliberate, ideological imprint has been put on the Estimates by the Minister for Health and Children.  The Labour Party opposes this and will highlight it in every way possible.  The 5% increase in the allocation for medical cards, for example, shows that the Government has no interest in providing for people on low and modest incomes who cannot afford to go to the family doctor.  They do not have a medical card because they are just above the income thresholds and are being crucified for the cost of medication when they get a prescription.  That is one of the great scandals with regard to Government promises and the actual outcome of those promises.</P>
        <P>The other issue that must be highlighted relates to the Minister&rsquo;s agenda of privatisation.  This idea came, presumably, from her political advisers.  It will certainly increase the number of private beds but will not necessarily increase the number of public beds.  The policy is costly, wasteful and will deepen the divide in the health service.  Frankly, nobody outside the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; coterie of ideologues sees the point of the venture other than those who will make a great deal of money from it.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that 2,200 beds are required in the acute hospital sector.  We will not get them.  In fact, the capital fund has been cut this year.  On radio last Saturday I had an argument about the matter with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, but it is clear that I am making a valid point.  We need to see an expan<Col N="113"/>sion of the capital programme but instead we are seeing an unnecessary and undesirable shift towards private hospitals which will not deliver the results the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, claims for them.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that the accident and emergency task force will now produce a report which will include a reference to the issue of acute beds, even though that was not the original intention.  Acute bed capacity is a significant issue among a population which is expanding and growing older.  It is time for action by the Government, yet the only clear signal coming from the health Estimates is that we will not have the additional capacity we need.</P>
        <P>A curious series of allocations has been made to the HSE area boards which are essentially the former health boards in a new guise.  An explanation is needed regarding why certain HSE areas receive so much more than others.  For example, the mid-western area will receive a 3% increase, whereas the north east will receive<?oasys _jy ?>12%.  It is not good enough to allow such disparities, given that a figure of 3% represents a cut in real terms once one allows for medical inflation.  We need to know why there are disparities.  In view of the fact that the north east has experienced a number of problems, is it the case that more aid is given to such areas, whereas more efficient areas find their budgets cut?</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that the opportunity was not taken to address people&rsquo;s needs rather than exacerbate the two-tier system.  Unfortunately, we have a Minister who has a certain ideology, although the time when we can replace her is, one hopes, approaching.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the 2007 abridged Estimates.  The provision of more than &euro;54 billion for supply services reflects an ongoing commitment to strategic infrastructural development and the improvement of critical public services within the overall context of responsible government and good governance.  Within this context, it is clear that support for the agrifood sector continues to form a vital part of the strategic development framework.  When capital carryover is taken into account, the 2007 provision for the Department of Agriculture and Food will be &euro;1.658 billion.  This represents the highest ever allocation for the Department and reflects the fact that agriculture remains a central part of economic, social and cultural life.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has outlined the dramatic expansion in the economy in the past eight years.  Between 1997 and 2005 the economy grew at an average annual rate of 7%, the rate of unemployment fell from 10% to around 4.25%, while the number in employment expanded to more than 2 million.  Even in the context of such a rapidly expanding economy, the agrifood sector contributes 8.5% of employment <Col N="114"/>and some 8.5% of exports.  However, while I am confident that agriculture will continue to make a vital contribution to the economy, that does not mean the future will be free from challenges.  Greater competition than ever before, increasing consumer expectations and a heightened awareness of the environmental consequences of all economic activities, including agriculture, mean that public investment in the sector must be more focused and discerning than heretofore if it is to contribute to the long-term viability and profitability of the sector.</P>
        <P>The 2015 action plan outlined a path for the future development of the agrifood sector.  Recognising that we are entering into a period of lower EU subsidies and increased competition, it set out a programme based around the three themes of innovation to meet the demands of a fast changing food market, competitiveness at farm and processor level with high value EU and world markets and a focus on what consumers in high value markets want in terms of food safety, animal welfare and environmental responsibility.  The 2007 Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food is consistent with these aims.</P>
        <P>Under the heading of innovation, we want to encourage investment in research and development.  The food industry has become a high technology sector and we need to be at the forefront of developments if we are to compete in sophisticated markets.  Some &euro;13 million has been provided for the food institutional research measure which funds pre-commercial research by public research institutes to support innovation in the food industry and underpin food safety.  In addition, &euro;6 million has been provided for the research stimulus fund programme which provides grant assistance on a competitive basis for agri-production research, including agri-environment, non-food crops and agrifood economics, and which fosters inter-institutional collaboration.  Funding for the kind of research that represents an investment in the future competitiveness of the industry simply could not be provided without the public support offered through the Department of Agriculture and Food.  These funds come in addition to the more than &euro;128 million provided in grant aid for Teagasc to fund its research, training and advisory activities in 2007.</P>
        <P>In terms of competitiveness, the &euro;42 million for an expanded marketing and processing scheme includes provision for new and vitally important investment programmes for the dairy, beef and sheepmeat processing industries.  Together, these schemes will involve &euro;150 million in State support and are intended to stimulate some &euro;420 million in gross capital investment necessary to equip processors to develop their strengths and ensure their long-term viability.  It is essential these key sectors set standards internationally if they are to survive the full blast of global competition in the coming years.</P><Col N="115"/>
        <P>Similarly, we need to put in place the necessary incentives at farm level to encourage structural change and promote investment among the most progressive farmers who will become increasingly important in the future.  Our draft rural development programme 2007-13 which provides for public investments of &euro;6.8 billion contains important actions on farm structures, on-farm investment and a new suckler cow measure.  The abridged Estimate for 2007 includes almost &euro;900 million for rural development and farm waste management measures.  This total includes more than &euro;9 million for capital investment in the horticulture, organics and potato sectors.</P>
        <P>While generous supports are in place for organic farmers in REPS, it will be possible from 2007 for registered organic farmers to obtain organic support payments without having to be members of REPS.  With regard to consumer focus, it is important to understand that schemes such as REPS and the animal welfare dimension of the proposed suckler scheme not only deliver real environmental benefits but also underpin production systems that deliver the kind of products our customers in Europe are demanding.  We are also providing an additional &euro;4.1million to assist Bord Bia in delivering its strategic vision plan to develop strategic market intelligence and more focused marketing activities in high value EU markets and the emerging markets of the Far East so as to ensure we not only produce the right products but that we also sell them successfully in a crowded market place.</P>
        <P>The contribution of the Department of Agriculture and Food to the World Food Programme has been increased to &euro;8.5 million.  This contribution is an important part of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development aid commitment and helps to provide food in the most efficient and direct manner possible to some of the neediest people in the world.</P>
        <P>In summary, this is a well thought out and integrated package which flows from our in-depth consideration of future strategies in the 2015 plan.  It provides support for the agrifood sector that exacts a price in terms of increased research and development, investment in improved facilities at farm and processing levels, the maintenance of food quality and safety standards and an improved environment.  This is the kind of strategic focus required to further the evolution of the agrifood sector at this critical time.  I am satisfied that the 2007 Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food maintains this focus and will make a significant contribution to the delivery of these strategic aims in the coming year.</P>
        <P>The themes in the Agri Vision 2015 action plan include innovation, competitiveness and a focus on consumers.  We are implementing the commitments laid out in the plan.  Given the very substantial funding committed for the next year and that committed in the rural development plan for the period 2007 to 2013, we are satisfied we are <Col N="116"/>providing resources sufficient not only for the food industry to maintain its market share but also to grow that share in the EU and Asian markets.  Bord Bia is opening new outlets for the top-quality food products of companies throughout the country.  All Members are particularly aware of the contribution the food industry is making to development in all the regions.  Approximately 600 food companies, mostly of small to medium size, are contributing not only to the national economy but are also providing jobs throughout the regions.  It gives me great pleasure to commend the Estimates to the House.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is trying to sell the Estimates package and the Opposition is trying to determine whether it will bring about substantial change for the people.  The Government has been in a position to eradicate poverty on foot of the unprecedented generation of wealth over the past decade but it has failed miserably in this regard.  While Ireland is one of the richest states in the world <i>per capita</i>, OECD figures indicate our poverty levels are shameful.</P>
        <P>Families on low incomes are finding circumstances more difficult and these are the people on whom the Government, through the Estimates, needs to focus.  It is true that the gap between rich and poor has widened to an unprecedented level since the Government came to power.</P>
        <P>A recent report on homelessness in my area indicates there has been a 3% increase in the number of people entering the Tallaght unit for the homeless.  Some 5,500 people are homeless in the State, representing an increase of 375% since 1989.  This demonstrates how many have been left behind in spite of our unprecedented wealth and economic growth.  What is the economy for if not to bring about positive change?</P>
        <P>Reference was made to investing in disadvantaged areas where people have missed out on education.  The Book of Estimates alludes to breakfast clubs.  Government statistics concern the RAPID and CL&Aacute;R areas, which experience the most disadvantage, but there is only one breakfast club in many of these areas and the groups running them are not funded by the State.  Rather, they are funded by organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The lack of State funding is crazy.  In some areas, such as Blanchardstown, the breakfast clubs operate perhaps two days per week, implying that children go to school hungry on the other three.  That children go to school hungry in this Ireland of plenty needs to be borne in mind.  My area has experienced population growth and schools are therefore using their PE halls and libraries as classrooms.  Is this acceptable in this wealthy <Col N="117"/>Ireland?  We have enough economic growth to address this.</P>
        <P>Mention was made of the high employment rate but having a job does not guarantee freedom from poverty.  The Estimates will be judged on how they transform people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me refer to the speech made by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, who referred to the additional money being allocated for flood protection measures.  He spoke glowingly of the flood maps.  While the flood maps are fine and indicate to people that they are in a vulnerable area, they do very little to protect people.  Deputy Parlon is the Minister of State who told people that if they lived in a vulnerable area, they should ensure they did not put an expensive carpet on the ground floor and that they should put their valuables upstairs.  This is of very little consolation to my constituents in Ringsend, Irishtown, Ballsbridge and Sandymount, in addition to those living along the Dodder, because they are not receiving any extra money to implement flood protection measures.  They want to know what the Government is doing.</P>
        <P>Members have referred to the &euro;14 billion allocated for the health service.  I agree that we require more money for the health service but it should be spent on an efficient one.  Many measures that could be taken in respect of health cost absolutely nothing.  In this regard, I applaud the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, who decided quite courageously to introduce a smoking ban in pubs.  I gave him my full support.  The ban cost absolutely nothing and will save money in the longer term.</P>
        <P>What is the Government doing about alcohol?  There is nothing of significance in the Book of Estimates to address this very serious problem, which costs us &euro;2.6 billion every year.  Alcohol poisoning is causing considerable health problems, including chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.  Alcohol is also related to suicide.  The number of admissions to accident and emergency units as a result of alcohol is astounding.  Some 40% of road deaths, 30% of road accidents and 37% of all drownings are related to alcohol.</P>
        <P>The breakdown of health care costs reveals that those pertaining to alcohol amount to &euro;433 million.  Road accidents cost &euro;322 million and alcohol-related crime costs &euro;147 million.  Given that the Government has refused to tackle the problem of alcohol abuse, this represents money down the drain.  The alcohol products Bill, to which I referred time and again in this House, was shelved at the behest of the alcohol industry.  It is disgraceful that a powerful lobby can affect legislation in that way.  It is about time the Government got real on the alcohol problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the publication of the Estimates.  The amount of money to be spent in this country next year is enormous by any stan<Col N="118"/>dards, but there is an imbalance in spending between the east and west.  As a Member from the west, who represents East Galway, I must reiterate that my constituency is not getting its fair share of the national cake.  I can instance the inadequate investment in roads, water and sewerage schemes, schools, broadband and rail.  These are but a few infrastructural areas that have been neglected by successive Governments down the years.  In County Galway there is now the scandalous situation where work on 20% of the 25 water and sewerage schemes due to start construction in 2007 will not now commence.  There are several reasons for this, many of which are grounded in red tape, which is farcical.</P>
        <P>The Department grants initial approval in principle for a project to proceed, after which the local authority concerned must set about employing private consultants to design the scheme.  When their preliminary report is complete, they forward it to the local authority, whose officials must vet it.  If they are not satisfied, they return it to the consultants who, after correcting any deficiencies, return the documents to the local authority which once again vets them.  If they are satisfactory, it passes them on to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government which vets them and inevitably seeks further information from the local authority which must revert to the consultants to elicit the information sought.  The consultants must provide it with the information sought in order that it can vet the documents again.  If they are all right, the local authority forwards them to the Department which also vets them once again, inevitably seeking clarification from the local authority.</P>
        <P>Time does not allow me to complete the hazardous journey that a sewerage scheme must make between the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the local authority and the consultants, but what I have outlined clearly shows our bureaucratic wasteland.  It is an absolute joke that, in the scenario I have described, at consultant, local authority and departmental level the officials vetting the documents for the three bodies are equally qualified.  This does not make sense and the Government should sort it out, since it is a waste of time and resources.</P>
        <P>I also record my absolute dissatisfaction with the lack of progress on construction of the new N17 and N18 and the long-fingered approach to restoration of the western rail corridor and the delivery of broadband to east Galway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>With the permission of the House, I would like to share time with Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l.</P>
        <P>Last week I was delighted to be able to announce a 12% increase in 2007 in the financial provision for the adult and further education sector, compared with an increase of roughly 8% for <Col N="119"/>the Department of Education and Science as a whole.  Adult and further education expenditure will rise to approximately &euro;169 million in 2007.  Since taking responsibility for adult and further education, I have increased the budget by 56%, or 50% since 2002.</P>
        <P>The additional funding for 2007 provides for a 21% increase in the budget for adult literacy and community education which will allow for 3,000 additional literacy places.  That will bring the total number of such places to 38,000, compared with 28,000 in 2002.  The increased literacy provision includes &euro;1 million to allow a doubling of the fund for intensive literacy tuition as a result of the very positive evaluation of an intensive literacy project piloted last spring.  That project enabled literacy and numeracy learners to participate in a programme of six hours per week for 14 weeks, compared with the current provision of two hours.</P>
        <P>The increase of &euro;3.5 million for Youthreach in 2007 will allow an expansion in the number of places by 400, bringing the total to approximately 3,700.  An increase of &euro;1.35 million for the expansion of part-time options under the back to education initiative in 2007 will allow the number of training places to increase by 1,000 to 9,000, catering for in excess of 24,000 participants.  This year for the first time child care assistance which is already provided in VTOS, Youthreach and senior Traveller centres will also be provided for those participating in the back to education initiative.  A sum of &euro;1 million has also been provided for the further roll-out of the adult educational guidance initiative which is now almost nationwide.</P>
        <P>Looking to the future of the PLC sector specifically, I announced last week, in parallel with publication of the 2007 Estimates, that provision would be made to enable my officials to table proposals and enter into negotiations with management and unions.  The aim of the negotiations will be to arrive at an agreement that will enhance the programmes and services provided for those attending post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
        <P>Funding for youth work has increased by 14% on the figure for 2006.  Since I took responsibility for the sector in 2002, there has been a 123% increase in funding.  This means an increase of &euro;6.2 million on the figure for 2006.  The 2007 Estimate is therefore &euro;51.2 million.  There has been an increase of nearly &euro;5.9 million, or 16%, on the figure for 2006 for the main funding line that supports the 31 national and major regional youth work organisations, the special projects for youth scheme, a network of 32 youth information centres, as well as other youth initiatives.  The 2007 provision will now be &euro;42.6 million.  There will also be an increase of &euro;336,000 on the figure for 2006 for the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund, bringing the total to over &euro;8.5 mil<Col N="120"/>lion.  This refers specifically to young people at risk.</P>
        <P>Increased funding for 2007 will enable continued delivery on the following priorities: increased support and baseline funding for organisations funded under the youth services grants scheme; the continuing development of special projects for youth to two-worker projects, as well as increased support in baseline funding; extra financial support to meet the costs arising from the newly introduced Garda vetting procedures for the youth work sector; and the further roll-out of the Youth Work Act 2001 and the national youth work development plan as set out in Towards 2016.  There is also increased provision to support the national youth work development unit in its remit to research and develop guidelines for youth work, manage and co-ordinate research, and plan innovative initiatives.</P>
        <P>Since 2002 there has been an increase of over 50% in spending on school transport and I secured a 9% increase in the 2007 Estimates.  Funding will increase from &euro;152 million this year to &euro;165 million in 2007.  The overall increase since 2002 is &euro;69 million.  In the past 15 months more than 300 additional vehicles have been hired from private contractors to address capacity shortfalls arising from the phasing out of the three-for-two seating arrangements.  It is expected that three-for-two seating will have been eliminated by the end of the year.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has given approval to purchase 111 modern second-hand coaches and 50 new dedicated school buses, many of which are already in service.  It is expected that the target date of the end of December for one seat with a seatbelt for all eligible students will be met and that the extra funding will increase safety measures such as the extension of the pilot warning flashing lights scheme to school buses in several areas in 2007, with arrangements also being made for advanced training for drivers.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State has done such a good job that she should remain for another 12 months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for his endorsement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF"><NameTxt>Mr. &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, for sharing time with me and congratulate her on the major contribution she has made to the Department&rsquo;s work.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute briefly to this important debate on the 2007 Estimates.</P>
        <P>It is important for me to acknowledge the outstanding work of my fellow Kildare man, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, during his tenure at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the nation&rsquo;s finances.  I congratulate the current Minister, Deputy Cowen, on the manner in which he has built on the successes of his predecessor and the exceptionally effective manner in which he <Col N="121"/>has managed the nation&rsquo;s finances in the past two years leading to the compilation of this well crafted, properly balanced and well targeted Book of Estimates.</P>
        <P>While other major economies across the developed world continue to endure high levels of unemployment, inflation and taxation, ours has seen phenomenal levels of growth, moderate rates of inflation, decreasing levels of personal taxation and a daily increase in the national workforce.  With over 2 million people now at work, the challenge is to sustain the progress achieved and continue to create the environment which will facilitate economic growth and a consequential improvement in social services.  This Book of Estimates represents an important element in the continuing Government drive to achieve these objectives.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>County Kildare is experiencing extraordinary levels of growth and the areas of health care and policing are uppermost in residents&rsquo; minds.  To that end, I welcome the significant increases provided by the Minister for Finance to the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  There must be ongoing investment at Naas General Hospital and St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Athy.  In particular, the HSE must make additional public nursing home beds available to our growing elderly population.</P>
        <P>The increase of 9% in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform Vote is welcome.  The increase of 10% in the allocation to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must result in a greater Garda presence and significantly higher Garda visibility on the streets of towns and villages in Kildare and throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In the education area, the Estimates provide some &euro;742 million of additional funding.  In County Kildare in the last several years, the emphasis has been on capital funding, with the provision of new schools, additional classrooms and refurbishment of buildings.  Major progress has been achieved, particularly across south County Kildare, not least in the last two years.</P>
        <P>While there will continue to be demand for ongoing capital provision to facilitate local population growth and the continuing reduction in class sizes, it is important that emphasis has also been placed on providing additional funding for the day-to-day operation of primary and secondary schools.  As a member of several boards of management in my constituency and as a parent, I say with certainty that the increased capitation allowances, together with the increased ancillary services grant, will reduce substantially the pressures which some boards of management and parents&rsquo; associations are under to fundraise locally.</P>
        <P>The agriculture sector has been struggling for some time to cope with massive changes brought about largely by decisions at European Union and World Trade Organisation level.  One of the aspects that attracted me to Fianna F&aacute;il in the <Col N="122"/>1970s was the party&rsquo;s commitment to establish as many families as practicable on the land.  Although we are unfortunately living through a period where the number of full-time farmers is declining throughout the developed world, it is reassuring to note that Fianna F&aacute;il in Government retains its strong commitment to the farming community.  I pay particular tribute to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, on the highly effective manner in which she has managed her portfolio and her success in securing a 16% increase in her Department&rsquo;s Estimate for 2007.</P>
        <P>We must strive to ensure that farming represents an attractive career option for young people and that they can look to the future with confidence.  Our key objective must be to maintain as many families as possible on the land and to ensure that those committed to full-time farming can enjoy a standard of living and income comparable to those enjoyed by workers in other sectors.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on what he has achieved.  The increased allocation for his Department brings with it a major onus on local authorities to take ownership of their own budgetary situations and to ensure that they deliver, for the citizen and the State, the value for money that is required.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the Indecon report, &euro;1.5 billion is required by 2010 to give local authorities the freedom to do the work they aspire to do.  That funding will not be achieved unless the Government provides it.  Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l is correct; the Government has failed absolutely to support the local government fund.  The 2% increase for local authorities is below the rate of inflation.  The Government is engaged in doublespeak when it says that local authorities must increase taxation locally.  Its purpose in saying this is to wash its hands of responsibility for local government funding.</P>
        <P>It is inevitable that development and local charges will increase as a result of this deficiency in funding.  I received a letter some days ago informing me that development charges in County Louth are to increase by more than 7%.  Local government is being crucified by the Government.  Local authorities are not being provided with sufficient funding even to keep pace with inflation.  The Government is telling county <Col N="123"/>councillors they must increase charges but is abdicating its own responsibility by failing to provide adequate funding.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, is failing to collect the tax that is due for local government.  He has ignored a report which indicated that funding for local, regional and county roads is deficient.  Some &euro;50 million is needed to keep them in a safe state of repair but only &euro;31 million was allocated last year.</P>
        <P>It is unacceptable for the Government to speak out of two sides of its mouth in this way.  The State has never been better off and the coffers never so full, yet never has so little been given to local government.  The Government&rsquo;s policy in this regard is unacceptable and a charade.  The reality is that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is not doing his job.  I estimate that he is failing to collect &euro;40 million per year that is due from car tax dodgers.  He will make up his sums by letting these people off the hook and increasing motor tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is impossible in the short time available to describe comprehensively my reaction to the Book of Estimates.  Government press releases in recent days have described it as wonderful and have observed that more money is being spent than ever before.  Are we expected to believe that the Government might reasonably spend less in the current climate?  Frequent reference is made to the percentage increases in funding since 1997 in various areas.  Why does the Government not go back to 1947 or 1847 and pat itself on the back for the changes that have taken place since then?  The reality is that the price of a house in 1997, an average humble domestic dwelling, was approximately one sixth of what it is today.  All this fuss and bluff about the Estimates means absolutely nothing.</P>
        <P>I do not have time to go through the Estimates in detail.  In regard to energy and communications, which is my own area of responsibility, it is sufficient to appeal for divine help.  A target of 100% broadband provision throughout the State has been set.  Everybody on the Government side of the House is praying that will be achieved, but there is no possibility of it happening in the next several years.  As the Wicklow man said, they started from the wrong spot.  The longer it goes on the more ridiculous it becomes.  The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is a nice guy and I am fond of him, but he has made a mess of this area.</P>
        <P>Energy provision is currently a sore subject because we must, for a variety of reasons, reduce our dependence on imported energy.  If we do not do so in the short term, we will be obliged to purchase carbon credits, which are harmful to the environment, and we will be subject to fines from the European Union.  The major increase in funding in this area only points to the appalling <Col N="124"/>deficiency of last year&rsquo;s allocation.  The &euro;10 million or &euro;14 million proposed in the current year is entirely insufficient to meet the necessary targets in the given timeframe.</P>
        <P>What is needed is adequate investment not only in research and development but also in assisting the fledgling industries that are trying to generate energy by way of biofuels, wind energy and so on.  The proposed funding for growers &mdash; those who are involved already on their own volition &mdash; is seriously deficient.  There must be a far greater injection of funding in this area.</P>
        <P>Changes in broadcasting regulations will be handed down from the European Union in the near future and TG4 will be separated from RTE.  This is an area that will require monitoring and an ability to change with the times.</P>
        <P>Serious efforts must be made to develop our natural resources extraction industries, be it oil, gas, tin, lead or zinc.  These industries must be encouraged to provide the wherewithal to process their products to the highest possible standards and be of direct benefit to the economy.</P>
        <P>It is a pity Government Members easily delude themselves every year, admiring their own budget, saying it is marvellous.  They are the only ones who do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Sadly, the Estimates are nothing more than a paper exercise.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food has underspent by &euro;2,500 per farmer in the past three years, at a time when investment in the agrifood sector is desperately needed.  This is a clear indication of how low a priority this important economic sector is for the Government.</P>
        <P>In the past three years nearly &euro;316 million has been left unspent by the Department of Agriculture and Food, money vital to the development and modernisation of our agrifood industry which is the country&rsquo;s most important manufacturing industry, accounting for more than 8% of economic activity.  This is further compounded by the agriculture Estimate, with its welcome headline increase but a 3% cut in the allocation for research and development and forestry.  When inflation is taken into account, it is a significant cut in the available funding for the two most important growth areas in agriculture.  These are key areas for the development of agriculture, particularly for the food and biofuels industries.  Their neglect indicates the Government has no grand plan for agriculture and lacks commitment to farming.</P>
        <P>The cutbacks in the research and development budget are further evidence that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is failing to understand farmers will have no future, unless funding to develop and promote the food industry is significantly increased.  The aim must be to make Ireland the world leader in food production.  These cutbacks make the achievement of such an aim remote.  The Fine Gael Party wants the same priority to be given to investment in research and <Col N="125"/>development for the food industry as has been given to other high-tech industries.  The agrifood sector should no longer be the poor relation.</P>
        <P>Despite all the talk at Government level about meeting our Kyoto Protocol commitments and developing a sustainable energy sector, it has decided to scale back its investment in forestry.  This is an acknowledgement by the Government that its own ambitious plans for the forestry sector have failed.  The existing sector is worth over &euro;700 million annually and has the potential to meet 30% of Ireland&rsquo;s total renewable heat and power requirements.  The Government&rsquo;s ambitious plan for the sector has failed.  It must review its forestry policy, setting clear targets for the wood energy sector.  The existing forestry grant aid schemes must be better integrated with REPS, as the two are currently in competition.  Forestry grants must be repositioned to promote and develop sustainable forestry, with a greater emphasis on short rotation coppice forestry such as willow.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s agriculture policy lacks direction.  Earlier this year the Minister for Agriculture and Food announced a &euro;300 million fund for the development of the dairy industry, a welcome development if properly focused.  However, the Minister&rsquo;s failure to set down any direction for the fund or a plan on its objectives means it will become nothing more than another lost opportunity.  This is not the first time the Minister has taken a back seat on such critical issues.  The nitrates directive mess is a prime example of bureaucrats taking the upper hand over practical farming as the Minister sat idly by.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2007 gross Estimate for the Department of Transport at &euro;2.8 billion is an increase of 17%, or &euro;415 million, on the 2006 Revised Estimate.  It allows for the continued high level of investment in the development of an integrated transport infrastructure as envisaged by Transport 21 in 2007.</P>
        <P>There will be significant further improvements in public transport in 2007.  The additional capacity and increased frequency of services already in evidence as a result of the massive investment of almost &euro;2.8 billion since 1999 will be further augmented by an investment of &euro;777 million in 2007.  Over &euro;1.5 billion will be invested in the national roads development programme, while &euro;28 million will go towards the support of regional airports.  Funding of &euro;45 million will be provided to support the vital work of the Irish Coast Guard and marine safety.</P>
        <P>In 2007 the Government will invest &euro;777 million in public transport, an increase of 58% on the 2006 Estimate.  This is an unambiguous signal that Transport 21 is gaining real traction and evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the development of a world-class public transport system.  These are exciting times for the development of the rail network.  Ireland will soon have the newest intercity rail service in Europe, with a <Col N="126"/>total of 217 new intercity carriages arriving between 2006 and 2009.</P>
        <P>In recent years the rail network has been virtually rebuilt and saved from decline and extinction.  Passenger numbers have increased substantially as a result.  Last year Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann carried nearly 38 million passengers, making it the fastest growing rail network in Europe.  Over &euro;2 billion has been invested in CIE-operated transport services since 2000 under the national development plan and Transport 21.</P>
        <P>The &euro;450 million provision for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s capital envelope in 2007 will fund the completion of the Portlaoise train care depot in time for the 150 new intercity carriages costing &euro;324 million.  These will start to arrive next year for service on the other intercity routes between Dublin, Westport, Ballina, Sligo, Galway, Tralee, Waterford and Rosslare.  They will provide for a consistent standard of service across the intercity network and improvements in time-savings, reliability, service frequencies and comfort.  The 2007 provisions will also enable Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to proceed with the construction of the first phase of the western rail corridor which will have immense social and economic benefits for the region and promote balanced development.</P>
        <P>In the Dublin area the new Docklands station will the first station to be built in the city centre in over 100 years.  Other projects to be funded in 2007 include the DART refurbishment programme, the planning and design of Dublin city centre resignalling programme and the Clonsilla to Dunboyne section of the old Navan rail line.  Work will also begin on the Kildare route project which will transform commuter services, with service frequency set to double.  The project will allow the separation of intercity and commuter services and improve speed and capacity for commuter, regional and intercity services.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the Cork commuter rail project, expected to get under way subject to a satisfactory outcome to the railway order process, will provide a new and regular commuter service between Cork city and Midleton.  It will also provide a greatly enhanced commuter service from Mallow to Cork city and new stations at Blarney, Dunkettle and Kilbarry, with extensive park and ride facilities.  The 2007 provisions will fund the new 67 intercity carriages on the flagship Cork to Dublin route.</P>
        <P>The 2007 Estimates provide for payments due in respect of additional buses for Dublin Bus and &euro;12 million towards the cost of replacement buses in 2007.  Exchequer funding of &euro;30 million was approved in the last quarter of this year for the purchase by Dublin Bus of 100 additional buses, delivery of which will be completed by the end of January 2007.  Exchequer funding of up to &euro;50 million, including &euro;25 million in 2007, is to be provided for up to 160 additional buses for Bus &Eacute;ireann commencing in 2007. The provision for the annual subvention to CIE in respect of its public service obligations at over &euro;306 million is <Col N="127"/>a 7% increase on the expected 2006 out-turn of &euro;285 million.  The increase reflects the policy in recent years of giving annual increases in the subvention taking account of increased operational costs.  The increased provision for 2007 also takes account of the additional costs associated with the extra buses, which were approved in September.  The increased capital and current funding for rail and bus services will enable the CIE companies to further improve services throughout the country.</P>
<HtmlBk SectId="6" />
        <P>The 2007 provision will facilitate the continuation of progress on the Luas and metro elements of Transport 21, including the commencement of construction on the Luas extension to Cherrywood and the Point Depot; increased tram capacity with a 10 m extension of the Tallaght line trams and continued work on metro north.  Planning of the remaining Luas and metro lines will also continue.  Today we launched the public consultation on the route selection process for metro west.</P>
        <P>In line with Transport 21 and Towards 2016, &euro;9 million is provided to bring the rural transport initiative into the mainstream from 2007.  The pilot phase of the initiative will conclude at the end of 2006 and preparations are now being made to focus on the provision of rural transport from 2007 onwards.  The programme will build on local community and voluntary commitment in providing rural community transport services in areas where there are unmet transport needs.  Further details of the development of rural transport will be announced in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Continued funding will be provided in 2007 for Transport Access for All, my Department&rsquo;s sectoral plan under the Disability Act 2005.  I am pleased to say that considerable progress has already been achieved towards improving access to public transport for people with mobility, sensory and cognitive impairments.</P>
        <P>The improved project management and cost estimation and control arrangements, which have been put in place by the National Roads Authority, NRA, in recent years, have resulted in a very welcome trend of projects being delivered on time and within budget.  For example, up to the end of October this year, ten of the 12 projects delivered have been on time and within budget.  The N8 Rathcormac-Fermoy project came in eight months ahead of time, the N25 Kinsale Road interchange six months ahead and the N8-73 Mitchelstown relief road four months ahead.  These projects all opened well in advance of their original scheduled dates.  We are delivering on time and on budget and we will continue to do so.</P>
        <P>In the early years of Transport 21, investment in the national road network will focus on the completion of the five major inter-urban routes by 2010.  After that we will concentrate on upgrading the remainder of the national primary network with particular emphasis on the routes <Col N="128"/>to the west and north west of the country and on the Atlantic corridor route.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a great deal going into the north west as the Deputy knows.  Under Transport 21, the total spend on the national roads development programme in 2007 will be &euro;1.543 billion.  This, together with private sector funding of some &euro;540 million will maintain the high level of investment in this major infrastructural programme. </P>
        <P>The level of funding being provided will allow the pace and momentum of the programme to be maintained during 2007.  Several roads projects will be completed next year, including the N1 Border to Dundalk, the N6 Kinnegad-Tyrellspass-Kilbeggan and the bypasses of Castleblayney and Gorey.  Six projects, with a combined total length of more than 200 km will begin construction during the year.  These are the public private partnerships, the N3 Clonee-Kells, phase 2 of the M50 upgrade, the N7-N8 Portlaoise-Cullahill bypass, the N9 Knocktopher to Waterford, and the N6 Galway-East Ballinasloe.  The N4 Leixlip-M50 junction will also begin next year.  A further 12 projects will continue in construction including the N6 Kilbeggan-Athlone, the N8 Cashel-Mitchelstown and bypasses of Charlestown, Carlow and Waterford City.</P>
        <P>The 2007 Estimates will continue to provide for regional airports, aviation consultancies, air accident investigation insurance and payments to the Irish Aviation Authority.  Regional airports provide a significant level of access to their catchment areas for tourist and business traffic and thereby contribute to balanced regional development.  During 2007, my Department will contribute &euro;15 million to support public service obligation flights between Dublin and the regional airports to underpin this role.</P>
        <P>An important development during 2006 was the launch of a capital expenditure grant scheme for these airports.  The proposals received under the scheme from the regional airports are being assessed and I hope to announce the allocations to the individual airports by the end of the month.  A sum of &euro;11 million is being provided in 2007.</P>
        <P>I also envisage that at the same time, I will be in a position to announce the allocation available under a separate scheme, which I launched this year to provide for annual subvention of the operational expenditure incurred by these airports in providing core airport services.</P>
        <P>In 2006, funding associated with the Department&rsquo;s marine sector ensured the continuation of vital work related to the Irish Coastguard and maritime safety generally.  Almost &euro;45 million in 2007 will be allocated to the marine sector to enhance these functions.  The Irish Coast Guard has responsibility for search and rescue in addition to marine pollution and salvage <Col N="129"/>response.  The 2007 capital allocation of over &euro;2.8 million provides for continued investment in this building programme in addition to providing for the upgrading and expansion of the Irish Coast Guard&rsquo;s radio communications network.  The total funding provision for the Irish Coast Guard in 2007 is almost &euro;33 million.</P>
        <P>One of the key aspects of the maritime safety function is accident prevention through an appropriate combination of regulation, heightening of safety awareness and enforcement.  The 2007 Estimates will provide for a grant to the Commissioners of Irish Lights and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  It also provides for funding towards the new aids to navigation vessel, <i>The Granuaile</i>, the national network of marine data buoys and the redevelopment of the headquarters of the Commissioners of Irish Lights in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</P>
        <P>For over two years, the Department has also been funding works to protect the fabric of our regional harbours.  The resources available have been concentrated on essential remedial works pending the transfer of the harbours to local control.  In 2006, funding was allocated to harbour works at Sligo, Westport, River Moy, Tralee and Fenit.  The funding of &euro;4.2 million for 2007 will ensure the continuation of a similar programme of works.</P>
        <P>An increase of 21% in the capital investment in transport is a major commitment by the Government to bringing Transport 21 to life, upscaling and taking a quantum leap into the future.</P>

	<P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Book of Estimates 2007.  The finance spokespersons for all the parties have dealt with the global figures and macro-economic issues but like any Member of this House, I am examining the Book of Estimates from the point of view of my constituents in Kerry South and the projects and services which are in need of funding.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal in particular with the health Estimates.  The most notable exclusion from the list of capital project priorities for 2007 is the long-promised 14-bed extension to Kenmare Community Hospital.  Members have heard me refer to this matter for many years now and I have no intention of giving up.</P>
        <P>The extension to Kenmare Community Hospital was top of the list of priorities for the then Southern Health Board in 1999-2000.  After a long campaign, dating back to the 1970s, the people of Kenmare hoped that the extension to their hospital would finally be delivered.  Unfortunately, and for reasons that have never been explained, this project has not advanced one inch in the past six or seven years.  The health board<b> </b>had allocated &pound;2 million in 2000 but suddenly the project disappeared from the radar and yet again, despite repeated promises, the people of Kenmare remain in limbo.  What happened to the <Col N="130"/>&pound;2 million that was promised in 2000 for the Kenmare hospital?</P>
        <P>The project was included in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.  We are almost at the end of 2006 but still there is no sign of the 14 bed extension to the hospital.  The hospital provides a valuable service in the area.  It has 300 admissions per annum for 24 beds.  Ten patients occupy one ward, which is totally unacceptable.  There are fewer beds in the hospital than there were a decade ago.  The matron and the staff are second to none but are not being provided with the optimum nursing conditions or support from the Government.</P>
        <P>I recently attended a public meeting on the matter in Kenmare.  There is very deep anger and frustration among the residents of Kenmare.  Despite many flowery promises from their local Minister and others not one sod has been turned or block laid.  Many of the people at the public meeting were elderly and expressed concern that despite the Government&rsquo;s stated commitments to care of the elderly and the health services, they may not have a bed in the hospital when they need it.  It is apparent from this Book of Estimates that the people of Kenmare must wait again.</P>
        <P>The population of Kenmare has increased by 33% in recent years.  In a recent worldwide survey, Kenmare was among the top five places to where people wished to retire.  At a time when the population is increasing the number of hospital beds is decreasing.  I would warn Ministers against going near Kenmare between now and the general election because if they do they will need proper answers for the people there on why the hospital extension has not been delivered after a decade of Fianna F&aacute;il Government.</P>

	<P>That is correct.  The people of Kenmare are still waiting.  There is an urgent need to provide funding for a sexual assault treatment unit, SATU, at Kerry General Hospital.  I pay tribute to the leaders and staff of the Kerry Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre in Kerry for their tenacious campaign on this issue.  These people are now at the end of their tether.  The sexual assault treatment unit was run previously on a pilot basis at Kerry General Hospital.  It was a major success in tending to the needs of the victims of rape and sexual assault.  However, due to a lack of space and funding commitments, the pilot scheme was discontinued and since then there have been calls for a sexual assault unit to be reinstated in Kerry General Hospital.  Currently, there is no local service to support victims of sexual assault in Kerry.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, may be aware that if a man or woman is raped or sexually abused in Kerry at present, he or she has to be transported to Cork, and sometimes Waterford, for forensic examination.  One can only imagine <Col N="131"/>the trauma and psychological pain caused by having to ask a victim to endure a three to five hour round trip in a car or taxi in the immediate aftermath of an assault.  In some cases, victims may not be medically fit to be sent to Cork or Waterford and this further adds to their trauma.  It is estimated that approximately &euro;250,000 would be required to get the SATU in Kerry up and running.  The sum of &euro;250,000 out of the &euro;12 billion allocated to the health service in 2007 is not too much to ask.  The National Crime Council stated that such local centres are needed to increase the low reportage of sexual crimes.  This is most worrying.  We must support victims of sexual assault and encourage them to report crimes, otherwise the perpetrators will get off scot free to reoffend.  The Book of Estimates does not provide funding for a SATU for Kerry despite all of the promises and the long campaign for the service by many dedicated people.  I appeal to the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance to bring in a Supplementary Estimate to address this matter.  This is a human rights issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Approximately 1,200 people in my constituency are waiting for houses.  My philosophy is that the least to which our citizens are entitled is a comfortable home.  Approximately 400 people in my constituency are waiting for enhanced nursing home subventions.  Although C&uacute;ram home care grants were promised, people did not receive anything.  Almost 1,000 people are waiting for orthodontic treatment.  Children in my constituency with an intellectual disability have had their classes discontinued indefinitely.</P>
        <P>I have listened all day to Ministers and Government backbenchers hailing the great successes of the Government.  These are our most needy people and they have been let down by the Government.  After the next election we will have a change of Government and these people will be top of our priorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the 2007 Estimates recently published by the Minister for Finance.  The 2007 Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to the development of the Irish agrifood sector.  Over the past ten years, the gross provision for the Department has grown from approximately &euro;990 million in 1997 to &euro;1.638 billion in 2007.  The 2007 provision will be augmented by a further &euro;20.2 million of capital savings carried over from 2006, bringing the total funding available next year to &euro;1.658<b></b>billion.  This is an increase of &euro;227 million, or 16%, over the projected gross outturn in 2006.</P>
        <P>The 2007 abridged Estimate is a milestone, in that it includes the first year&rsquo;s funding for a significantly enhanced package of rural development and farm waste management measures, fol<Col N="132"/>lowing the recent conclusion of partnership discussions with the farm organisations.  The measures finalised in the partnership process involve agriculture related schemes worth &euro;6.8 billion over the period 2007 to 2013, including Exchequer funding of &euro;4.7 billion, compared to &euro;2 billion in the current round.  This is an increase of 135% in the Exchequer contribution to agriculture-related rural development measures, compared to the previous programme.  The agriculture measures in the new rural development programme will also attract &euro;2.1 billion from the EU.</P>
        <P>In 2007, we are making provision, as part of the rural development programme, for an important initiative aimed at improving welfare and quality in the suckler herd.  The suckler cow herd welfare and quality scheme will, subject to EU approval, involve an Exchequer provision of some &euro;250 million over the next seven years.  This measure is part of a structured and coherent approach to the beef sector, designed to enable it to meet the significant challenges that exist and to exploit the opportunities available over the coming decade.</P>
        <P>Substantial provision is also made for the main rural development schemes.  This includes &euro;257 million in income supports for disadvantages areas, the rates for which are being increased by 8%, &euro;328 million for REPS, for which a 17% increase in rates has been agreed, &euro;79 million for the early retirement and installation aid schemes which, under the new rural development programme, will involve a maximum payment of &euro;15,000 under each scheme and &euro;114 million in subhead L for the forestry programme, for which a 15% increase in premium rates has been agreed.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s forestry cover is approximately 10% of total land area, compared to an EU average of approximately 38%.  It is clear that the sector has significant potential for growth.  We are making the funds available through the afforestation provision in the Department&rsquo;s Estimate for the continued development of the sector.  Almost &euro;1 billion will be provided over the seven-year life of the rural development programme.  Forestry can be a major player in the development of the rural economy.  It currently generates employment for 16,000 people, while another 16,000 people are established as forest owners in their own right.</P>
        <P>Forestry also has the potential to contribute towards a wide range of environmental issues, including climate change.  Over the period of the first Kyoto commitment, our forests will sequester some 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year.  Our forests will also supply a sustainable source of timber for building as an alternative to steel and concrete, and for the growing energy market.  This is an area which we wish to develop further, and one which is being examined carefully in the context of the national bioenergy action plan.  In addition, forests provide wonderful opportunities for recreation and amenity.  This <Col N="133"/>is an aspect of the forestry investment which we are at last beginning to value properly.  The new rural development programme will, subject to approval at EU level, increase the forestry premium by 15%, maintain premium payments for the full 20-year term currently enjoyed by farmers, and retain the 100% establishment grant for new planting.</P>
        <P>Reference has been made in recent days to the Department&rsquo;s projected savings in 2006.  Savings are likely to occur in schemes which are subject to variables, such as farmer demand, animal disease trends, the pace of progress on approved projects and market conditions.  In recent years, the effect of these variables was further exacerbated by considerable uncertainty in regard to the introduction of the decoupled single farm payment, the impact of the nitrates directive and question marks over derogation and, in the case of some rural development schemes, the relative proximity of a new rural development programme.  In the case of forestry, issues such as the price of land, and competing alternative uses for it, were also a factor.  It was, nonetheless, absolutely necessary to make provision for potential demand for these schemes in recent years, for which we make no apology.  While estimation of the expenditure under these headings will always be subject to uncertainty, there has been considerable clarification of the nitrates directive and the probable shape of the new rural development programme.  In addition, the single farm payment is beginning to bed down.  We will see the impact of this in demand for a number of our schemes in the future.  We will continue to make the necessary funding available for the agrifood sector in the coming years.</P>
        <P>There are significant opportunities for all those involved in the agrifood sector to avail of the generous schemes administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I urge all those involved in the sector to avail of these opportunities to secure the future of their businesses and for the sector generally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Finian McGrath and Gogarty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the indications that the Government is focusing on ways of increasing the use of renewable energy.  Hopefully, this will lead to increases in tax incentives to use biofuels and to improving the take-up of grants for the growers of energy crops, and to improved energy efficiency in homes.  Perhaps the Government would consider including all recipients of fuel allowances in grant schemes, such as the greener home schemes and that covering installation costs.  Both involve considerable initial outlay but would prove cost effective in the long run in terms of savings on energy and in savings for many of those caught in the fuel poverty trap as <Col N="134"/>a result of illness which imposes a considerable cost on the health services.  </P>
        <P>On the issue of biofuels I refer to the loss of the massive potential represented by former sugar factories at Carlow and Mallow.  The beet crop and the facilities being destroyed could have been redirected towards this end.  Instead Greencore has chosen to go into property development while leaving its formers workers, growers and contractors high and dry.  I propose that the State make a compulsory purchase order on the former Carlow and Mallow sites.  By doing so the State would recoup the public interest in what was a successful public enterprise before being handed over to Greencore which stands to make a massive profit through asset stripping.  The State could buy the sites at agricultural value and ensure they are used in the best interests of the people of Carlow and Mallow in terms of attracting employment, including biofuel processing to Mallow, affordable housing and all round balanced development.</P>
        <P>Today I was contacted by a farmer in the Mallow area who told me that along with other business people he could guarantee to raise an investment of &euro;150 million if the Government or Greencore was prepared to do likewise and convert the factory at Mallow and, by extension, the factory at Carlow into biofuel production sites.  I ask the Minister to consider that proposal.</P>
        <P>I welcome the indications in the Estimates on renewable energy and I hope we will see concrete measures in the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  Let me knock the current myth about spending on education and health and the hype from the Government on this matter.  I challenge the waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money by different Ministers.  On the projected figures for spending on education let us have a reality check and look at the facts.  We need investment in education.  The OECD education indicators have shown that individuals and countries that invest in education and skills benefit economically and socially from that choice.  At each level of education &mdash; pre, primary, secondary and tertiary &mdash; Irish spending per student is below that of the OECD average, most notably for primary and second-level schools.  </P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s level of expenditure on education, whether expressed as a percentage of GDP or GNP, fell in the period 1995 to 2003.  In spite of Ireland being one of the wealthiest countries, our expenditure on education at 5.2% of GNP in 2005 leaves us languishing in the bottom half of the OECD countries, ranking 24th out of 30 countries.  Spending initiatives to combat educational disadvantage must be refocused to benefit children when they are young.  Government reports emphasise the importance of early intervention to help tackle disadvantage but this does not apply to the funding initiatives.  Only a fraction of disad<Col N="135"/>vantage spending benefits primary school children.  Spending on primary school and disadvantage initiatives amounts to &euro;60 million compared to &euro;300 million at third level.  The result of this policy is that many children experience failure and drop out early because the Government refuses to provide adequate support where it is needed most.  Disadvantaged children and those with special educational needs must be given priority.</P>
        <P>Given that the Minister was positive a number of years ago I ask him to focus spending on services for adults with an intellectual disability.  Some 1,906 people require a residential service, 1,877 require a respite service, 296 are on a waiting list for the services of St. Michael&rsquo;s House on Dublin&rsquo;s north side, 74% of whom are from the north side.  To reduce the waiting list in St. Michael&rsquo;s House all that is needed is 70 places per year.</P>
        <P>I raise these issues because it is important that the Minister and the Government focus on two priorities in the budget.  I urge the Minister to focus on education, the poorer sections of society and children with disabilities.  There is a need to fund children with disabilities particularly at second-level education because a gap is emerging.  It is important that the Minister introduce a caring budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish I had the same amount of time to debate the Estimates as the Minister has for his annual budget speech.  Unfortunately we on the Opposition benches do not have that opportunity.  I reiterate what my colleagues have said, particularly in regard to education.  I have constantly harped on about the need to fund education because it pays in the long term.  Borrowing from Progressive Democrats speak and Charlie McCreevy speak, I argue that investing in education and frontloading it will cost the taxpayer less.  That has not happened, instead we have had incremental increases, welcome as they may be.  </P>
        <P>Three weeks ago during Question Time with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, I dared to table a question about the need for additional teaching places in second level; I had raised a similar need for primary level previously.  I asked, notwithstanding the welcome investment in special needs, the reason she was not investing in education given that we ranked 24th or 29th in the OECD league tables depending on which way one looks at them.  She stood up and said, &ldquo;How dare the Deputy criticise me for prioritising special needs.&rdquo;  I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this matter further with her next week.  It is not a case of either-or, it is a case of funding education.</P>
        <P>We have talked about class sizes and the McIver report in the past, I now wish to speak about the National Educational Welfare Board.  Since I was elected as a Deputy, the board has <Col N="136"/>consistently called for the full roll-out of educational welfare officers.  Time and again we get a measly amount from the Government.  This time the increase is 20%, and laudable as that may be it comes nowhere near implementing the full roll-out of the board.  The Rochford report which envisaged the funding requirements when the Education (Welfare) Bill came before the House suggested a spend of approximately &euro;25 million.  In modern day funding &euro;28 million would be required to roll out the National Educational Welfare Board.  It needs 300 people on the group but has fewer than 100.  As I said in the committee approximately 1,000 children in classrooms are absent more than 40 days per year.   The statutory amount that requires reporting is 20 days per year.  Why are those children absent?  What is happening to them and their education?  That is a central issue from a social justice point of view.</P>
        <P>From the Progressive Democrat-Fianna F&aacute;il economic point of view those children who are absent from school for that length of time will end up costing the State money.  They will lose out and end up on social welfare, in prison and not paying into the taxation system, all because of a lack of investment in education.  To frontload it now will cost the people, the taxpayers and voters.  It is short-sighted voodoo economics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>During the course of this debate on the 2007 Estimates the Opposition sought to deny reality and claimed that this is more of the same and that there is no indication of how the money will be spent, no strategy, no coherent approach to value for money and no proper scrutiny by the D&aacute;il of the Estimates.  The reality is that in its contribution to this debate the Government side has clearly set out the main outputs that will be delivered across the sectors in the provision for 2007.</P>
        <P>In transport we indicated that the &euro;1.5 billion capital for roads will fund the continuing upgrade of the major interurban routes to motorway or high quality dual carriageway standard and fund some eight roads projects involving more than 84 km in length which are scheduled for completion in 2007 and some six projects amounting to 212 km in length which will commence next year.  We spoke about the &euro;1.3 billion capital for housing that will fund the Government commitments under Towards 2016 of planned increases in social housing output to the target of 27,000 social housing starts and 17,000 affordable housing starts over the next three years.  There will be a &euro;7.9 billion current provision in 2007 for education that will fund service improvements in a number of key areas, including 800 additional teachers, which will bring to almost 1,900 the number of new teachers provided since last year in order to reduce class size and help tackle problems of disability and disadvantage; more than 1,400 additional special needs assistants to significantly improve the experience of education for people with special needs; and the 13% increase <Col N="137"/>in capitation grants for schools.  I could go on and repeat the outputs cited by my colleagues in the debate.</P>
        <P>I reiterate my personal commitment to getting value for money and better accountability.  In last year&rsquo;s budget, I introduced significant reforms of the Estimates process.  Under these reforms, consideration of the 2007 Estimates will be better informed than in previous years.  After the Revised Estimates Volume for next year is presented to the D&aacute;il in February and referred to the various select committees for detailed consideration of the 2007 Estimates, each Minister will be tabling with his or her Estimate an annual output statement covering the Departments and offices under his or her aegis.  The output statement will set out the high-level goals of the Departments and offices as contained in their strategy statements.  It will set out for each goal the programmes and the key strategies being followed to achieve them.  For each programme, it will outline the financial resources contained in the Estimates and the human resources deployed and, on the outputs side, it will give the key output targets to be achieved next year.</P>
        <P>Under the improved value for money and policy review arrangements announced last June, some 90 value for money reviews, with an indicative minimum coverage of 10% to 15% of each Department&rsquo;s budget, will be carried out in the period 2006 to 2008.  Contrary to claims, neither the health area nor the Office of Public Works is excluded from these arrangements.  These reviews and other general reviews that impact on value for money carried out by Departments and agencies must be sent by them to the relevant select committees.  This will complement the information that will be available in the new annual outputs statement.  When the select committees consider the Estimates in detail in 2007 and in future years the quality of the information, which will be available to them to assist their consideration, will be far more comprehensive.</P>
        <P>I reject claims that the 2007 Estimates are based on stealth taxes or that the significantly increased levels of public expenditure under this Government have been funded through increased taxation.  Aside from a technical increase in the employees&rsquo; annual ceiling for PRSI purposes in line with normal practice, these Estimates are not based on increases in charges nor did increases in charges form part of the discussions with my ministerial colleagues on the Estimates.</P>
        <P>The money available for local authorities through the local government fund will amount to approximately &euro;1.5 billion in 2007.  The Exchequer contribution to the fund continues to be in excess of the statutory minimum set out in the 1998 Act establishing the fund.  Since 2000, nominal GNP has grown by an average of just under 9% per annum, while the increase in Exchequer total expenditure, which includes infrastructural investment, has averaged approximately 9.75% per annum in the same period, <Col N="138"/>which is broadly in line with GNP.  For every year in the period with the exception of 2002, we have run a general Government surplus and by the end of this year our debt ratio will have fallen from approximately 38% to approximately 25% per cent, which shows that the public finances are in a very sound position indeed.</P>
        <P>Claims about increased taxation are simply not supported by the facts.  The average tax rates have fallen for all categories of taxpayer since 1997.  All employees have seen their average tax rates fall since 2002.  People are earning more and paying proportionately less tax.  There is greater equity in the tax system and more people are paying no income tax at all.  Approximately 80% of people pay less than 20% of their wages in income tax.  This year, more than 750,000 people on low incomes will pay no tax at all compared with fewer than 400,000 in 1997.  For a married one-earner family with children on 150% of the average industrial wage, the reduction has been from 24.4% to 16.8% of gross income.</P>
        <P>I refute the accusation that the Government has adopted an approach to health care that is driven by profit rather than care.  The approach of seeking to meet priority health care needs though an appropriate combination of public and private provision of services on a value for money basis means that greater progress can be made in meeting those needs than would otherwise be the case.  Health has consistently been a key priority for the Government.  On a pre-budget basis, we will be spending some &euro;14.6 billion on health next year.  Health spending is set to reach 7.7% of GDP next year, which is 9% of GNP.  This compares favourably with international trends and is above the EU average.</P>
        <P>The major improvements in health services outlined in my opening statement in this debate have been made possible by the significant increases in front-line staff provided for by the Government, with almost 2,400 additional medical and dental personnel, almost 8,400 additional nurses, more than 750 additional consultant posts bringing the total to more than 2,000 and more than 8,000 other health professionals, such as speech and language therapists, physiotherapists; social care and social workers; psychologists and environmental health officers.  The Government has undertaken radical reform of health services through the establishment of the Health Services Executive to improve the management of the health services.  The Health Bill 2006 is continuing this process of reform and will set up an independent statutory body, as part of the Health Information and Quality Authority to establish standards and inspect all nursing home places, both public and private.</P>
        <P>I wish to address claims that no provision has been made in the Estimates for environmental issues arising from energy use.  As indicated in the recently published Green Paper on energy, the overall aim of our energy policy is to ensure that Ireland can develop sustainable sources of <Col N="139"/>energy, increase our energy efficiency and improve the security of our energy supply.  Investment in research is vital in order to support national energy policies.  Some &euro;14.7 million has been provided for energy research next year, which represents an increase of more than &euro;10 million over the amount provided for energy research in the 2006 Estimates.  Some &euro;2.5 million has also been provided for energy efficiency initiatives, including the continuation of the national advertisement campaign designed to highlight the changes that individuals can make in order to reduce wasteful energy consumption.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the environment is further demonstrated by the substantial investment in the environment across a number of Votes.  More than &euro;81 million has been provided for the farm waste management scheme to help farmers meet requirements of nitrates directive while the allocation for forestry is &euro;114 million.  An additional &euro;28 million, bringing the total capital provision to &euro;427 million in 2007, is provided to support enhanced investment in water and sewerage services.  An additional &euro;7 million in current expenditure is being allocated to the Environmental Protection Agency to support its ongoing work and in particular the new demands of monitoring the EU water framework directive.</P>
        <P>On the issue of the purchase of carbon credits raised by Deputy Boyle, the Government is <Col N="140"/>strengthening arrangements in this regard.  Under legislation to be introduced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the National Treasury Management Agency will purchase the carbon allowances by making a drawdown, as and when required, from the central fund.  This will give the NTMA the flexibility it requires to purchase the credits.  There will be an Estimates provision in the Environment Vote the following year and subsequent years to repay the central fund, which will ensure full accountability and transparency in the purchase of the carbon credits.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Through the robust value for money framework now in place and our reform of the Estimates, the Government is determined to ensure full value for money and accountability in the delivery of public services.  Before the budget, we are providing an extra &euro;4 billion for spending on public services, an 8.1% increase.  Of this, more than &euro;3 billion is for current spending on day to day services and almost &euro;1 billion is for capital purposes.</P>
        <P>We remain committed to pursuing the sound fiscal and economic policies which have provided the resources to fund real improvements in public services and to target priority social needs.  On budget day I will provide for a social welfare package and some additional expenditure on health.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

        <P Just="Right" el="0">(Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. N. Ahern.)</P>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the call by the Labour Party for a new housing policy to ensure everyone has access to a good quality home in a sustainable community at a price they can afford.  The Government&rsquo;s overall strategy is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first-time buyers.  The record housing output achieved as a result of Government policy speaks for itself and we will continue to build on that success.  I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, who has done tremendous work in this area, particularly on affordable housing and shared ownership.  Last year was another record year with almost 81,000 units completed, of which 18,000 were in Dublin.  This was double the output achieved in the city in 2001.  It is expected 90,000 new homes will be completed this year compared to 34,000 in 1996.</P>
        <P>One third of Ireland&rsquo;s houses have been built in the past decade.  The rate of house completions in Ireland is the highest in Europe at 20 units per 1,000 people, which is five times the rate of our nearest neighbours, the UK.  Investment in servicing has led to much greater availability of serviced land to underpin future housing supply.  The serviced land initiative has provided services for more than 81,000 units on 164 completed schemes with an additional 95,300 housing units being serviced for a further 59 schemes.  The Labour Party has picked up on many statements in our housing policy but it has also made proposals, which are more aspirational than practical or achievable.  Policies are worthless if they are not viable.</P>
        <P>The seventh voluntary housing land survey undertaken in June 2005 indicated 14,800 hectares of zoned land was serviced nationally with <Col N="146"/>an estimated yield of 460,000 housing units.  This equates to sufficient capacity for residential development for more than five years, based on recent average housing output.  However, developers and estate agents are responsible for something that is nothing short of extortion.  I have raised the issue previously of a developer buying, for example, 100 acres and building on it.  The first week units go on sale, the price of a house is &euro;350,000 while the following week a similar house is &euro;380,000.  This cannot be justified and it is a disgrace that this practice is allowed to continue.  However, while it is not possible to legislate to control the market, we should meet representatives of the CIF and other industry organisations so that they can explain how this can be justified.  If they have a valid reason for this, we would all like to hear it.</P>
        <P>It is high time they were consulted because, at the end of the day, young people will queue at 6 a.m. on a Sunday to buy an expensive house because they are conditioned into believing that if they do not so, there will be no houses.  This is wrong because buyers are being exploited and it amounts to unfair trading.  This practice does not apply in other industries.  For example, if one puts a deposit on a car and returns to collect it the following day, the salesman will not say the price has increased by &euro;20,000 because there is demand for that model.  It is time a clear message was sent to people involved in the construction business that this practice is not on and it must cease.</P>
        <P>Growth in incomes and employment, lower taxes, favourable interest rates and availability of finance have largely contributed to improved affordability.  Typically average outgoings as a percentage of incomes are higher than in 1994 but people are generally taking out longer term mortgages to reduce their annual outgoings.  The 100% mortgages that are available also broaden access.</P>
        <P>The Department maintains the index of housing affordability measured by reference to the cost of servicing a mortgage.  This index is based on an affordability ratio that shows how much income is observed servicing the mortgage.  Due to trends in families and work situations, there has been a steady increase in the female population in the workplace in recent years and it is more relevant to examine trends in affordability for two-earner married households.  The index also assumes a loan period of 20 years because this is the traditional loan period.  The availability of longer term loans has impacted positively on the outgoings of first-time buyers.</P>
        <P>In 2005, some 2,900 affordable homes were produced mainly in the &euro;150,000 to &euro;200,000 bracket.  In my constituency, affordable homes are being built and people do not wait on the waiting lists for long.  One can get an affordable house or apartment within five or six months, which is a significant improvement on the initial situation.  There has been a considerable take-up of the shared ownership scheme.</P><Col N="147"/>
        <P>I welcome these aspects, but we must protect consumers and ensure that they are not ripped off by greedy builders.  Between 2007 and 2009, it is estimated that 17,000 units will be delivered by affordable schemes.  Earlier this year, the Government improved some of the schemes by increasing the income eligibility limits and subsidy levels.</P>
        <P>People have been refused entry to the affordable housing list because they are regarded as being employed on a contract basis rather than being in full-time employment, including school teachers.  They will not be approved for loans.  Every Deputy knows that 60% of workers are on contracts in semi-State bodies and elsewhere, which is a matter we must examine because it is unfair.  It is not the person&rsquo;s fault that he or she is in that situation.  Few jobs are for life.  There should be cross-party support in this regard.</P>
        <P>Local authorities can avail of site subsidies to make houses affordable and almost &euro;13 million was paid by the Department for this purpose in 2005.  The maximum subsidy is &euro;31,800, but in the Dublin metropolitan area, counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow and in the cities of Cork, Limerick, Waterford and so on, the maximum amount is &euro;50,000 per dwelling.</P>
        <P>In 2006, some &euro;7.7 million for mortgage allowance and mortgage subsidy schemes was made available.  The former assist local authority tenants to move to private housing while the rent and mortgage subsidies help lower income households to access shared ownership and affordable housing schemes by giving them annual subventions towards the repayment costs.  Many people in receipt of social welfare benefits or Health Service Executive subsidies will never get affordable housing because they do not meet the criteria, but if they get jobs, they will lose everything.  We should examine this anomaly.</P>
        <P>More than 70 projects have been identified that, with Part V output, will yield the 10,000 affordable housing units proposed by the parties under Sustaining Progress.  By June 2006, some 2,115 affordable housing units were delivered under the initiative, 1,791 through Part V affordable arrangements and 324 through developments on State and local authority lands.</P>
        <P>Last year, the Government established the Affordable Homes Partnership to co-ordinate the delivery of affordable housing in the greater Dublin area, where affordable pressures are greatest.  I wish to acknowledge the good work of Mr. Des Geraghty in this regard because it was important for us to bring on board someone who knows what the real world is about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  In recent years, housing has not only been topical in public forums such as the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, but in homes and at firesides.  For people, ensuring that their loved ones were going to college or to find homes for them<Col N="148"/>selves was challenging.  There were considerable difficulties.  Any political party or public forum that did not acknowledge this challenge would have been disingenuous.</P>
        <P>Upon examination, the demographic changes, including the influx of immigrants, the dynamics of our progressive economy and low interest rates and taxation, occurred during a short period.  We needed to react to the changes.  Most people would acknowledge that the Government has done its best to try to address the fundamental problems in respect of affordable housing.</P>
        <P>The demographic changes, including young people who are reaching family-formation age, returning emigrants and migrating EU citizens seeking to reap the fruits of our vibrant economy, placed significant pressures on housing.  Tribute should not only be paid to the Government and local authorities, but also to the construction industry because it raised the bar, increased productivity to a phenomenal number of units &mdash; 81,000 in 2005 &mdash; and will step up on that mark by another 8% or 10% next year.</P>
        <P>However, problems remain and it would be remiss of us to ignore the fact that, for many people, buying a house and starting a family is a distant dream.  Parents are remortgaging and capitalising their assets to provide large deposits for their children to purchase homes, which is a challenge we must address.  Part V should be explored further.  The Opposition would claim that we rowed back on our Part V commitments, but the principle therein is positive.  As someone who proposed something similar in 1992 and 1993, it was obvious from the incremental annual increases in house price inflation that young people would find it difficult to purchase homes.</P>
        <P>In principle, Part V is an important factor in society.  I do not say this because it helps people to buy homes.  Rather, it relates to the formation of society and how we live with one another, which is a fundamental bedrock of the Government&rsquo;s intention in terms of housing policy.  Historically, public housing programmes were mainly reactionary, including during the TB crisis.  For example, Dr. Noel Browne&rsquo;s decision regarding the demolition of tenements in inner city areas and the building of large-scale housing schemes in the suburbs were primarily required from a health point of view, but there were considerable social implications.  There was no cohesion among the communities and there were no supports or education facilities.  The basic requirements of communities were not in place.</P>
        <P>Regarding social housing, the opposite is now the case.  As Part V is in place and local authorities can decide on what portion of the 20% of housing should be affordable or social, we are bringing people together as opposed to drawing significant lines of divergence between those that have and can afford to assist themselves and those that have not and need assistance.</P>
        <P>Many local authorities are abdicating their responsibilities under Part V.  Nothing is wrong <Col N="149"/>with local authorities addressing social and affordable housing needs, putting responsible tenants into social housing and ensuring that those areas are managed in a way that encourages this type of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I ask the Deputy to conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>Local authorities have an obligation to address this issue to ensure we have a more cohesive society.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address this issue.  There is no doubt that it has occupied more talking time in the House than almost any other topic.  Before I came into the House I saw the Labour Party as the party of fresh, new and ambitious ideas but the motion tabled tonight lacks ambition, fresh ideas and vision, though I do not disagree with a lot of it.</P>
        <P>I will raise a few points that Deputy Gilmore and others might like to address.  There is no point repeating the facts.  Undoubtedly there has been a massive housing construction programme in this State in recent years.  It has been driven by a variety of factors, as Deputy Kelleher said, such as changes in demographics and in incomes and the wish of people to own their homes is of great importance.  The variety of initiatives taken by the Government are undoubtedly beginning to play a part.</P>
        <P>We do not need to clap ourselves on the back for the promotion of the affordable housing initiative.  However, Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Shortall, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with special responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern, and I can claim some credit for pioneering initiatives in Dublin North-West to identify, in co-operation with Dublin City Council, untended and unused sites which we encouraged the council to develop for housing for young families.  I saw a brochure circulated by Dublin City Council to applicants for affordable housing and it compares favourably with any brochure an estate agent might produce.  It has quite a number of houses on the market from Dublin 8, Dublin 3, Dublin 1 and Dublin 11 in our constituency at very affordable prices of between &euro;220,000 and &euro;275,000.</P>
        <P>I wish to address the reluctance on the part of many people in the affordable bracket to live in apartments.  We still need to sell the idea that apartment living is good and can afford people the opportunities for a full family life provided the facilities necessary for a community are provided.  There have been some mistakes and there is no point saying everything is right.  I have concerns about the way management companies have often been used by developers as vehicles to cream off additional income from buyers.  We are beginning to see what Deputy Kelleher talked about, namely teachers, garda&iacute;, office workers <Col N="150"/>and young professionals opting for the affordable housing market in commuter areas close to the centre of town.  I was heartened by a recent consultation meeting in my constituency with the RPA on metro north.  We detected interest in affordable housing schemes along the metro line, showing that public transport and good housing go together.</P>
        <P>One proposal in the Labour Party motion is to &ldquo;compulsorily purchase all residential development land in areas where housing is unaffordable, in order to increase the supply of affordable homes&rdquo;.  Is the Labour Party suggesting compulsory purchase of land?  Has the Labour Party thought through the whole process of compulsory purchase?  If so, why do local authorities, which currently are dominated by Labour Party and Fine Gael councillors, not pursue such a policy?  In Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s local authority, 175 homes were delivered under Part V up to 30 June 2006 but &euro;5.521 million has been taken by the authority as payment in lieu of land transfer.  We cannot have it both ways.  We must grasp the nettle of affordability by being brave, taking strong positions and confronting vested interests.  The &ldquo;not in my back yard&rdquo; syndrome happens in my constituency and my party is as guilty of it as anybody but it needs to be addressed.</P>

	<P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I will concentrate on voluntary and co-operative housing, Traveller accommodation and accommodation for Irish emigrants living abroad.  The combination of Government policies is working well, particularly in my constituency.</P>
        <P>The voluntary housing for the elderly scheme is worth mentioning.  The money allocated under this heading does not reduce the capital allocated to local authorities.  The scheme is an ideal opportunity to provide for the elderly and to ensure that we maintain capital investment in local authority housing.  I hope we will examine ways of improving the voluntary housing for the elderly sector.  Two years ago I sponsored a scheme of housing for the elderly in my home town, Mountmellick.  I and my constituency secretary undertook the task of involving the community in the project.  It was clear from that experience that providing for the elderly is an important way of adding to one&rsquo;s local area.</P>
        <P>We made our application to the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern.  The scheme cost &euro;3.2 million and the local contribution was &euro;185,000.  The scheme was opened officially by the Minister some weeks ago and Mountmellick now has 25 state-of-the-art housing units as well as a com<Col N="152"/>munity centre.  The project brought the community together and encouraged people to become involved in a voluntary capacity.  The spin-off effect is that we have ideal, top class accommodation for the elderly.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>I hope that as we proceed with such schemes throughout most towns and villages we will examine ways of making the venture more attractive for voluntary groups who might wish to participate.  At present, 95% grant assistance is available under the capital assist schemes.  In view of the fact that these schemes depend on voluntary effort, perhaps the grant assistance could be increased to 97% or 98%.  It should be considered.  The fact that Mountmellick could provide that scheme meant that demand was reduced on the local authority to provide maisonette accommodation, which is traditionally given to people in the over 65 age group.  We are in the happy position of being able to offer accommodation to the age group that is often left behind, that is, the 55 to 65 year olds.</P>
        <P>If this scheme was copied throughout the country, it would reduce demands on the capital programme for local authorities and provide sheltered and secure accommodation.  I also believe that if demand in local authority areas is being met, we could turn our attention to bringing home Irish people who are retired and living abroad and who might be in need of housing accommodation.  Provided these people meet criteria such as those set down by Safe Home, they should be entitled to transfer without having to put their names on a local authority housing list.  This is important.</P>
        <P>I have always been a supporter of the local authority when it undertook to provide Traveller accommodation.  If people doubt that, they can check my record as a member of Laois County Council.  I have always believed we should take as many people off the roadside as possible.  The local authority in Laois has been the top local authority in providing Traveller accommodation.  However, I wish to make an appeal.  There are a number of schemes in Laois where, unfortunately, the Traveller community would not take the accommodation offered.  We should encourage Travellers to accept accommodation, particularly where new houses in new schemes are being offered.  We should be more proactive in this regard, especially in view of the recent reports about mortality rates among Traveller women.  There should be more emphasis on ensuring that as many people as possible accept such accommodation.</P>
        <P>I support what the Minister is doing in the housing sector.  I believe the combination of policies is working well and is doing a great deal to house as many people as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this motion from the Labour Party and am glad it echoes many of the proposals that were set out in Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion at the beginning of this month.  These are progressive proposals designed to help solve the housing crisis for many individuals and families.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has called for an all-lreland housing strategy to tackle the crisis.  We believe that the right to a roof over one&rsquo;s head is a fundamental human right.  Many people believe the State&rsquo;s housing policy is being written at the behest of wealthy property developers and their speculator friends.  Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, seen as a progressive step at the time to ensure a social mix in housing and to deliver additional local authority housing, was diluted just two years later as a result of lobbying by property developers.</P>
        <P>It is abundantly clear that the majority of developers wish to literally buy their way out of social and affordable housing commitments to prevent decreasing the value of units in their new plush developments.  This Government is once again complicit in the ghettoisation of social housing and only pays lip service to a commitment to promote social inclusion.  The stipulation of 20% social and affordable housing in developments is a minimum and Sinn F&eacute;in has argued for more.</P>
        <P>Of the 81,000 homes constructed last year, a paltry 831 were social and affordable.  The Government has failed to deliver on its commitment in the national development plan to deliver social and affordable homes and Ireland has one of the lowest outputs of social housing in the EU.  Government inaction will ensure that the NESC target of achieving 73,000 social housing units by 2012 to tackle the housing crisis will not be realised.  It is shameful that the Government is putting the wealthy class of developers before families in critical need of housing, a case of once again putting profit before people.</P>
        <P>On the issue of management companies, I have received numerous complaints from concerned residents who have been forced to hand over considerable sums of cash to these companies, which are usually controlled by the property developer.  These management companies are notorious for failing to carry out their promised maintenance works.  The regulation of these companies is long overdue; in fact I question their existence.</P>
        <P>This Government&rsquo;s ideology relies on the market to provide housing.  I must admit this policy has proven extremely successful.  However, it is only successful for wealthy property developers, speculators, banks, solicitors and private interests.  The losers have been those on low incomes, homeless people, people with disabilities and the aged.</P>
        <P>It is undeniable that house prices have spiralled out of control in Dublin.  Young couples are being forced out of the areas in which they were reared to live in far away commuter towns.  Many of <Col N="154"/>those lucky enough to secure a house are then faced with 40 year mortgages, not to mention travelling long distances to and from work.  We have a two tier education system and a two tier health system, so why not a two tier housing system?  Sinn F&eacute;in perceives housing as a basic right, not as an opportunity to reap massive profits through investment and speculation.</P>
        <P>It is shameful that the State is subsidising private landlords, through rent supplements, to the tune of &euro;1 million every day, instead of using this money to invest in more local authority housing.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the Make Room campaign to end homelessness, still an acute problem in this extremely wealthy state.  While thousands of investor and holiday homes lie vacant, there are still an estimated 5,500 people throughout the State sleeping rough.  In my constituency, the Tallaght homeless information service registered an 83% increase in the number of people accessing services.  The local authority says that nobody is sleeping rough yet the local homeless unit gives out up to 200 sleeping bags per year.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s housing policy is characterised by inequality and segregation.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes housing is a right, not a commodity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Recently, when Deputy Crowe put forward a motion which sought some of the goals outlined in the motion before us, I spoke about the need for modernising our housing policies so accommodation can be delivered.  It is time this Government delivered on the promises it has made.  However, while I fully support certain proposals contained in the Labour Party motion, I do not believe the promises which have been broken by this Government can be replaced by some of the more unrealistic targets it sets out.</P>
        <P>I accept that we should have a proper national housing policy which delivers good quality and affordable houses to those who most need them and that such a policy should be accompanied by proper planning and infrastructural guidelines so that the ghetto-like estates built in the past by local authorities are not repeated.  However, the proposal that up to 50% of units in developments in housing blackspot areas should be affordable is counter-productive because it would discourage developers from building in such areas and allow local authorities to abdicate their responsibilities to deliver housing, with the result that fewer houses would be provided.  I could never support the proposal that all residential developments in housing blackspot areas would be acquired through compulsory purchase orders.  As cities and towns grow, their boundaries change, so that what was once agricultural land can become suitable for urban development in a matter of years.  The fact that boundaries change as towns grow does not mean that lands which have been in family ownership for generations should be acquired through compulsory purchase orders.  There is no point in replacing broken promises <Col N="155"/>with similarly unrealistic plans.  Therefore, while I want to see a concerted and vigorous effort to address homelessness, it is futile to believe that any measure we introduce this year will end homelessness by 2010.</P>
        <P>I have sought regulations on gazumping and auctioneering since I was elected to this House and have repeatedly urged the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to address the issue by introducing legislation.  When a house is put up for sale at auction, every bidder&rsquo;s name, address and other contact details should be recorded in a register which is made available for inspection by anybody who wishes to check the bona fides of a bid.  In the event of irregular bidding, penalties should ensue.  It is time the wheel turned in favour of the consumer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>We all share the need to live somewhere.  It would be impossible to imagine, for example, an election in which housing was not a dominant issue.  I anticipate that many of the issues addressed in the motion before us tonight will be raised in the coming months.</P>
        <P>New problems are arising in terms of management companies for traditional housing estates, which are tantamount to the return of domestic rates.  Although this morning in the District Court, 20 cases taken by a management company were struck out, the lack of legal protection is astonishing given the time that has passed since the issue first came to light.  Given that a minimum of 70,000 houses nationally are located in completed housing estates where local authorities have not taken responsibility for public spaces, I am convinced there is better protection for consumers who buy bags of crisps than for those who buy houses.  When a developer does not complete roads or landscaping before starting to sell dreams off the plans for his or her next site, the residents of incomplete estates are left with nightmares.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the height of the housing boom in 2005, a mere 730 people purchased homes under the shared ownership scheme.  The fact that shared ownership is the only loan available to those who are unable to get mortgages from private lending institutions demonstrates the inadequacy of the scheme.  Given that 2,500 local authority houses, excluding those in refurbishment schemes, currently lie vacant, the turnaround time for re-letting is unacceptably long in some locations.  Steel shutters ghettoise such areas and make it impossible for residents to build a sense of pride.  The lack of urgency in addressing that issue is breathtaking.</P>
        <P>The delays in delivering affordable housing, including developments under the Part V scheme, have added to the growing local authority waiting lists.  Single income households and individuals face particular difficulties in that regard.  The housing waiting list in County Kildare comprises <Col N="156"/>3,000 individuals and families, which equates to a decently sized town of 15,000 people.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s amendment demonstrates how far removed from reality it is.  Thankfully, it will not be long before the Government has to acknowledge that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Labour Party motion on housing, which comes at a time when many young people are striving to save the money to buy their first homes.  Many fail to achieve their aim of owning the home in which they live.  The motion before us makes a number of proposals, some of which I support and others which I do not.  However, I concur with the motion&rsquo;s general tenor that we require a new beginning.</P>
        <P>The proposal for increasing the maximum proportion of social and affordable housing in a Part V scheme from 20% to 50% is impractical.  In 2000, the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, introduced a proposal for a completely new departure which should have been implemented.  However, instead of progressing, we began to regress when the subsequent Minister, Deputy Cullen, began to row back on the provisions introduced by his predecessor.  Rather than going from 20% to 50%, a reversion to the terms proposed by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, would perhaps be preferable.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party motion also refers to the efficient management of housing estates, a matter on which the current Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is not discharging his responsibilities in an honourable manner.  The Minister wrings his hands and repeatedly states that the matter is the responsibility of local authorities when he should be acknowledging that local authorities come under his remit and that the buck ultimately stops with him.  If local authorities are not taking charge of estates, the Minister should provide the resources they need to discharge their responsibilities.  He should stop talking and begin to take effective and meaningful action so that residents can see real results.</P>
        <P>The quality of design in housing estates and the recreational and other facilities provided in them leave a lot to be desired.  It is true that some developments are built to high standards but it is equally true that others are substandard and, as a result, have contributed to many of the social problems being experienced at present.  Again, the Minister has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that standards are improved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Labour Party motion on the introduction of a new national housing policy so that everyone can have a home of good quality.  This may be a difficult task but, if the political will exists, it can be achieved despite the damage which has been done by the <Col N="157"/>present Government and its builder and developer friends.</P>
        <P>The average cost of a house in Dublin now exceeds &euro;420,000, while houses in former local authority estates in Cabra and East Wall are beyond the reach of the young people who grew up in them.  Only relatively affluent professionals can afford to spend half a million euro to purchase homes in these areas.</P>
        <P>Earlier this evening, I attended a meeting between residents from the Ballybough area and Dublin City Council.  The residents are long-standing tenants in the council&rsquo;s inner-city houses who had previously had to put up with Dickensian conditions in corporation flats.  Now they want to purchase their homes from the council but, even with discounts for long tenancy, the price is beyond their reach because the market value is being applied.  A new tenant purchase scheme is needed, with a better discount for tenants.  A special case can be made in that regard for Dublin, where house prices greatly exceed the national average.  I urge the Minister to respond to this need by acting responsibly.</P>
        <P>I note in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times </i>that the Government&rsquo;s affordable housing strategy is already failing in Dublin city before it has even left the ground, mainly because the so-called affordable houses comprise small apartments and, in most cases, the least attractive units in developments which often only attract single people.  Most families and couples in Dublin continue to aspire to a house of their own and the unaffordability of houses in the city is driving families to counties Meath and Westmeath.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Others are tying themselves to a crippling, life-long mortgage and paying crazy prices for the smallest and least attractive houses.  Only investors and the affluent can really afford an average house in Dublin city today.  This is the legacy of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government, which has neglected this vital social issue for so long, largely because it is beholden to its builder-developer paymasters.  I support this motion in its entirety because a radical and comprehensive housing policy is essential to reverse the neglect of the past decade.</P>

	<P>What does one say to a young mother when she approaches one for local authority housing having been told she must wait seven years?  What does one say to a mother with two children under the age of two who is living in a shack in the back garden of a house with 12 occupants?  What does one say to her in the knowledge that the waiting list for housing has trebled in D&uacute;n Laoghaire over the past ten years during a massive economic boom?  How does one relate to her that councillors of a party in Government, Fianna F&aacute;il, voted against the development of local authority housing a couple of miles from where she is living?</P><Col N="158"/>
        <P>Does one tell her the council cannot afford to buy land while the Progressive Democrats, the other party in Government, wants to give back &euro;2.5 billion in stamp duty?  Does one say to her that the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern, did not even show up at a debate on the issue this evening?  Does one tell her that one of the finest entrepreneurs and builders, Mick Wallace, is saying the Government does not have its act together on social housing?  It is hard to look such a person in the eye and tell her she will be waiting seven years for a house in spite of an unprecedented economic boom.</P>
        <P>One could say to this lady that State lands earmarked for development five years ago are lying idle, in spite of a promise that social housing units would be built there within months.  One could say that those responsible for the tens of thousands of one-off houses in the country do not pay a penny towards social and affordable housing because they are exempt from doing so under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  One could tell her the Minister of State with responsibility for these matters filleted the Act, which promised a great dawn for social and affordable housing.</P>
        <P>One must say to the woman that we need to build 10,000 social housing units per year.  One must say to her that there are many good ideas, given that developers in London are building houses for &euro;100,000.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire, however, one cannot put a down-payment on a house that costs under &euro;500,000.  One must say to her that the Government needs to be changed if she is to have a decent chance of having a home built within seven years, let alone three, to keep her safe and secure.</P>
        <P>The way we build homes and the building regulations need to be changed.  We are falling behind the rest of Europe in this regard.  If one wants to build a house tomorrow in Northern Ireland, it must have a condensing boiler and it must have higher standards of insulation than those which obtain here.  We are belatedly introducing the EU building performance directive, but according to standards that are much inferior to those that apply abroad.  Even the most pedestrian house built today will receive a &ldquo;C&rdquo; rating under the system proposed and we therefore need to improve the building regulations as much as anything else.  We need a change of Government if we are to deliver the housing required by the aforementioned woman and her children.</P>

Consequently, 45,000 families, or approximately 18,000 men, women and children, are on the ever-lengthening waiting list for council houses.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s conscious policies and decisions have made it impossible for hard-working young families to buy their own homes.  This did not happen by accident; it was deliberately engineered by a series of actions by Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers that rewarded and continues to reward their rich friends at the tent at the Galway races.</P>
        <P>The land and building speculators and so-called investors were given massive, generous tax breaks that enabled and encouraged them to involve themselves aggressively in the housing market.  They still enjoy these tax breaks exclusively and taxpayers are still paying this particular piper.  The result has been a financial bonanza for the few fat-cat friends of Fianna F&aacute;il and an unmitigated social and financial disaster for a large section of society.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s policy has resulted in a massive building boom, although those who need houses cannot afford them due to the housing inflation caused by the tax-break-sheltered speculators.  It is such that one in six houses built in the past five years lies idle and is held by an investor vulture for inflationary gain.</P>
        <P>The investor-vultures are the people the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern, said should be taxed out of existence.  He is the Minister of State and not a neutral observer.  When will he act or was his statement just an idle threat?  The budget is due in a few weeks and it will present him and his ministerial colleagues with the opportunity to take action.  However, the speculators and vultures are losing no sleep.  They know they have greased the paw of the Fianna F&aacute;il election machine and that the party always looks after those who pay up.</P>
        <P>A good and representative example of the depth of the housing crisis is evident in a town in my constituency of Kildare North, namely, Celbridge.  It is a town comprised largely of private housing estates and has a population of 18,000.  There is a very low level of unemployment in the town, yet there are 1,600 families on the waiting list for affordable and social housing.  At the current rate of provision of affordable, council, voluntary and co-operative housing, it will take some 20 years simply to clear the backlog.  This is unacceptable and the Labour Party can and will do much better.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party, if in Government, will work to achieve its objective of providing a secure, comfortable home for everyone living in the <Col N="160"/>State.  We have the resources and all that is needed is the political will, which Labour has.  The party&rsquo;s spokesperson, Deputy Gilmore, outlined to the House last night and in his policy documents, launched earlier this week, a package of measures to deal with the crisis caused by Fianna F&aacute;il and its fat-cat friends.  These include bringing an end to homelessness, which is a scandal in this rich country.  We can afford to and must do so.  Also included in the package of measures are a building programme to provide homes for those on the housing waiting list, with a turnover of 10,000 houses per year; ensuring tenants have the right to purchase their homes; measures to acquire building land to provide homes at prices affordable to young working families; and an end to the poverty trap caused by the rent subsidy scheme.</P>
        <P>On behalf of those on the waiting list for housing, those who cannot afford a home in the inflated market, the homeless and those who care for them, and parents who rightly fear their children will never have their own homes, the Labour Party, when in Government, will tackle and solve the housing crisis.  It needs their electoral support to do so.  The speculators, builders and investment vultures will vote for Fianna F&aacute;il, as they always do, while the aforementioned people should vote against that party in their own interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, on his paper detailing a new national housing plan.  In it he has included a section whereby persons who are tenants of voluntary rental subsidy schemes can purchase their own homes.  This scheme was implemented some years ago to provide houses for those on low incomes.  At the time, it seemed a good scheme, and many obtained their first family home through that process.  However, since that time we have moved to a position where a participant in such a scheme cannot purchase a house, and the rent he or she pays is uncapped.</P>
        <P>In many instances those schemes are adjacent to, or part of, a local authority initiative.  There is the person in the voluntary rental subsidy scheme paying an uncapped rent and unable to purchase his or her house.  On the other side of the road, the local authority tenant has a capped rent and can purchase his or her house after a year&rsquo;s tenancy.</P>
        <P>That inequality is unbelievable in current circumstances, since those involved in the rental subsidy scheme put their money together and co-operated to develop a scheme and policy on housing applicable to them.  However, the sad situation is that the Government has never accepted they are entitled as a community to purchase their own homes and move forward as families in an area that they developed.  They worked together to ensure the community would develop as such, and yet we see inequality between the two sides of the road.  Local auth<Col N="161"/>ority tenants may buy after one year, and the other person, with a 99-year lease, can never say he or she can pass on the house to a loved one or own the family home.</P>
        <P>This was discussed here when questions were last put to the Minister.  Deputy Stagg raised the feeling that something can be done in this regard.  I ask the Minister to move forward and ensure that in the budget provision is made on funding the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to put in place a tenant purchase scheme, as detailed in the housing plan that Deputy Gilmore proposes.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Catherine Murphy has already mentioned, there are major problems regarding shared ownership.  We see it is practically irrelevant in Kildare, since the ceiling that Kildare County Council has put on the loan of &euro;185,000 is not applicable to any housing estate in the county.  Even secondhand houses are going for more than &euro;200,000.  There are several problems in this regard.  First, people who qualify for the &euro;185,000 do not, in any instance, qualify for the rent subsidy that attaches to the scheme, owing to their income being over the limit of &euro;25,000.  There is therefore no longer any relevance to the rent subsidy part of that scheme, which must be urgently examined.</P>
        <P>The 100% loans now available from the banks require that a person have an income of over &euro;45,000 to apply.  A certain group is not able to purchase a house, since the scheme is not there.  Even if successful, they would not consider the scheme charged a good rate.  I checked with all the banks today, including AIB, Bank of Scotland Ireland, Bank of Ireland, and the TSB.  Every one had a lower rate of repayment than the shared ownership scheme.  That unacceptable position will have to be addressed, and I ask that the Minister consider those two items and decide in that regard.  When the Labour Party is in Government after the next election, they will certainly be addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, for raising this important issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A critical question for the Labour Party is affordability of housing for first-time buyers and people moving to larger properties as their families grow.  There is a growing issue, particularly on the fringes of Dublin, as people buy small, affordable homes or apartments through such councils as Fingal, Dublin city and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Currently, if they have a family, they are not given another chance to get a family-sized home.  They are restricted regarding affordable housing to one purchase only.  When family size increases as people marry, enter relationships or have children, a one or two-bedroom affordable apartment, which was appropriate for a single person or couple, becomes completely unsuitable.  The Government offers no assistance to such people, and Labour wants to see that property trap removed.</P><Col N="162"/>
        <P>The pre-budget outlook published by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, shows an estimated &euro;70 million will be paid by first-time buyers in 2006.  Those are first-time buyers of secondhand homes in expensive locations, with houses costing more than &euro;317,000.  The position of such first-time buyers and people trading up to buy a modest family home costing over &euro;317,000 is in stark contrast to the avoidance mechanisms that have been tolerated by the Government, and which the Minister for Finance defended again today where developers invest in multi-million euro land and property deals.  Those who buy apartments and houses in the developments pay the stamp duty, but the developer pays nothing on mega-million euro land deals.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government has left two loopholes, the first being a licence to build so that no land changes hands and no stamp duty arises, as the Minister told us today.  The second is that, instead of transferring land, one transfers shares in a company, which attracts a stamp duty of only 1%, whereas the transfer of valuable development land would normally attract the top rate of 9%.</P>
        <P>Perhaps Members are aware of the deal regarding the Irish Glass Bottle Company site, which was recently sold for over &euro;400 million.  That was done by share transfer, attracting a stamp duty rate of just 1%.  The developers made a cool &euro;30 million through avoiding stamp duty, and the Minister for Finance defended that today.  They saved almost half of what first-time buyers are paying in stamp duty this year.  It is set out in the Labour document that we want such blatant injustice regarding the tax and property system reversed in favour of first-time buyers and people who want a modest family home.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to say a word on mortgages.  I am not sure if many Members are aware that, in the last 18 months, their cost has risen by 50%, so the average mortgage repayment in the Dublin area has gone from &euro;1,453 to &euro;2,167.  Over a calendar year, one must find &euro;24,000 to pay for the average mortgage on a small property before anything else.  In addition, one must eat and provide for other necessities.  It is not possible to live on air in one&rsquo;s apartment.  It is outrageous that the acquisition of a family home has been put beyond people&rsquo;s grasp by this Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Labour Party for this motion and Deputy Gilmore, in particular, for his lifelong interest in this issue.  It is a human right for every person to have access to a good quality house at a price that is affordable to them.  This is something we tend to forget.  The Government has been boasting since the publication of the Book of Estimates that between 70,000 and 90,000 houses were built this year.  This is undoubtedly a positive development in itself.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to see, however, how the Government can take the credit for it.  It is the young people who must commit to mortgage repay<Col N="163"/>ments for the next 40 years who deserve credit.  It is good that they have the confidence to make that commitment.  As Deputy Burton observed, however, if interest rates increase by a further<?oasys _jy ?>2%, many people will be in a woeful situation.</P>
        <P>The main benefactor of this situation is the Government.  It is akin to a laying goose as the Government coffers are filled with direct and indirect taxes on every house that is built.  If ever there was a case where the Government is entitled to no credit whatsoever, it is this.  That credit should be reserved for the young people who are paying way above the odds for their homes while the Government reaps the benefits.</P>
        <P>I have the good fortune to have been in this House for a lengthy period and was involved in the Fine Gael-Labour coalition Government in the 1980s.  Many commentators now subscribe to the mantra that the lights almost went out on this country at that time.  The reality, however, is that more local authority housing was built in those years than at any other time because that Government had a social conscience.  In County Galway at that time, a local authority housing list of 700 or 800 was considered a disaster.  The current list stands at 1,700.  All these families are in need of assistance from Galway County Council because they cannot afford to purchase their own homes.  Any Government worth its salt, with the resources available to it that we have been told about in the last several days, should be ashamed of itself.  The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.</P>
        <P>There are many changes that could take place easily enough but which have not been made.  The difficulties in regard to the tenant purchase scheme do not relate only to Dublin.  It suits any Government, for a variety of reasons, that tenants should own their own property.  It removes the obligation of maintenance on the part of the State and allows tenants to become home owners who will take pride in their property.  I do not understand why it is not made easier and more acceptable for local authority tenants to purchase their homes.  Authorities in other jurisdictions have found it is better to sell houses at half price in view of the benefits accruing to both tenants and local authorities.</P>
        <P>I always believed in the concept of affordable housing but it must always be related to the ability of the person involved to pay.  That affordability element is no longer in place.  Even the so-called affordable homes are no longer affordable.  I hope Labour and Fine Gael will be in a position from next May to implement the proposals in the Labour Party motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to address some of the issues raised during the course of this debate.  We heard much from the Opposition yesterday about the plight of first-time buyers.  I reassure the House <Col N="164"/>that access to affordable housing for first-time buyers remains a core objective of the Government&rsquo;s housing policy.  This objective is being supported by record levels of housing; one in three of all homes in Ireland was built in the last ten years.</P>
        <P>Significant numbers have benefited under an expanding range of affordable housing schemes.  Other general measures are in place through the tax system to assist first-time buyers, such as stamp duty concessions and mortgage interest relief.  We have evidence too of strong activity by first-time buyers in the market.  It is estimated that 45% of new house loans in 2005 were taken out by first-time buyers.  The average age of first-time buyers in 2005 was 30 years.  This compares with a corresponding average age in the United Kingdom of 34 years.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to prioritise effective action to maintain current high levels of supply in the housing market and, in particular, will accelerate measures to assist those who cannot access affordable housing without assistance.  This will include evolving polices to meet changing circumstances.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, yesterday highlighted the new innovations in housing policy introduced by this Government.  One of these is the ground-breaking legislation that is Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2006.  Output under Part V is gathering momentum.  Instead of welcoming this, however, the current debate is based on misleading information about the potential yield.</P>
        <P>Several Deputies argued for the use of State land for affordable housing.  I remind them that the Government has already assigned lands for this purpose and, furthermore, has successfully used land swaps to turn some two acres of State land into almost 500 discounted affordable homes.  We have done so in a relatively short space of time, with some 400 of the homes coming on stream this year and the balance following in 2007.</P>
        <P>A further innovation is the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  I acknowledge the welcome given by the Opposition yesterday to this scheme.  Good progress has been made in implementing RAS, and nearly all housing authorities have begun to transfer cases to the scheme.  It is projected that by the end of 2006, between 4,500 to 5,000 households with a long-term housing need will have transferred from rent supplement to accommodation provided by local authorities, either to RAS, or some other type of social housing.</P>
        <P>We are providing the resources and evolving policies in line with principles set down in the housing policy framework, Building Sustainable Communities, published in December 2005.  The framework firmly sets the housing policy objective of enabling every household to have available an affordable dwelling of good quality, suited to its needs and, as far as possible, at the <Col N="165"/>tenure of its choice, in the broader context of building sustainable communities.  Our approach has been endorsed by the social partners in Towards 2016.  Record levels of funding have once again been provided for social and affordable housing programmes, and benefits will be seen in terms of outputs in 2007 and beyond.</P>
        <P>At a time of phenomenal change for the housing sector, the Government is delivering on housing.  We are not complacent about the future, however, and are determined to maintain our record of achievement in this vital area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>One would need great neck to make the claim the Minister of State has made that the Government is succeeding on the basic issue of housing.  How many units of social housing did the Government promise, how many units did the NESC tell us were necessary and how many have been provided?  This Government, which strongly represents the speculative mentality in regard to the building of homes, has provided only approximately one third of what was provided in the 1970s.  Government back bench Members hopped up to tell us it was because of the return of migrants, the expansion of the population and other demographic factors.  If that were all true, how can they then defend building only a third of the social housing compared to that provided in the 1970s?  The Government has added a tissue of untruths to the debate.</P>
        <P>The social and affordable housing that was promised has not been built.  It continues to surprise me how the social partners are satisfied at being conned as to the numbers of social and affordable housing units being built.  Some 40,000 affordable houses were promised by the Government but since 1999, it has only provided 3,000.  One does not need to be a genius to work out that 3,000 subtracted from 40,000 is 37,000.  As long as Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats are in government, there will never be a fundamental change in the legendary source of housing speculation and inflation of the price of building land.  The All-Party Committee on the Constitution agreed on the implementation of changes that Deputy Gilmore proposed in his motion on acquiring land for housing.  I am proud that the stamp of the Labour Party is on the motion.  I congratulate Deputy Gilmore and other Labour Members who have supported it.</P>
        <P>When the people will vote, they will know that the Progressive Democrats, when in government, will steal from the public what it does not own.  It stands for the taking of public property and handing it to the private sector for speculative gain.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is its mark, aim and achievement in government.</P>
        <P>We have explicitly stated that we will put an end to the sale of State land.  To those who ask how they are to know the difference between one party and another in government, it is in this motion.  If one wants to imagine nothing can be done about housing speculation or the market, then one can have more of the same misery.  If one wants a change, then one changes the Government&rsquo;s components.</P>
        <P>The Government has failed in housing provision.  In doing so, it has torn the heart out of the economy and destabilised society.  Those on the left know that one never speaks about the house one lives in as only an asset.  It is a home.  The absence of a good, secure and comfortable home has effects on one&rsquo;s partner, children and neighbours.  Imagine our State saying the speculators must be rewarded but will not guarantee the right to a home.  That is some Republic.  The principle of the right to a home must be accepted.  It does not mean the Government is required to provide everyone with a home tomorrow morning.  Instead we should look to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that states it should be progressively realised.  While not all builders are speculators, there is that small speculative clique which hoards lands near cities.  It knows it is always safe with Fianna F&aacute;il and even safer with the Progressive Democrats, which will take State assets and transfer all to them.  Stealing from the public for the benefit of the few.</P>
        <P>Historians will come to write about this period and ask how we used the fruits of economic growth.  They will write of people whispering about the number of houses they own.  No longer in the Republic is it a matter of having a roof over one&rsquo;s head but how many one has managed to acquire with tax benefits.  It is a question of how many properties one has acquired on the blood of those whose likelihood of having a roof over their heads one has, by one&rsquo;s actions, put out of reach.  That is the Government&rsquo;s Republic.  The housing crisis has not only torn the heart out of the economy and destroyed communities, it has dashed young people&rsquo;s hopes of owning a home.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore proposes a proper regulated public and private rental sector, social housing for those who cannot afford it and affordable housing to be provided through reforms on land acquisition.  In the miserable society we live in, newspapers are sold by suggesting it is a social success that a former corporation house has broken the &euro;500,000 barrier or that a house in the Republic has passed the &euro;1 million barrier.  At a reception several years ago, a Secretary General boasted to me, &ldquo;I never thought I would live to see my children buying houses for &euro;500,000 in this country.&rdquo;  After a lifetime in the public service, this was the extent of the moral vision of this miserable git.  The truth is that everything from health, social <Col N="167"/>life community, good planning is affected by one&rsquo;s home.</P>
        <P>The Government surrendered to the speculative clique in the building industry on Part V of the Planning Act.  Deputy Carey should return to the Chamber to explain why he finds our proposal on this unimaginative.  Maybe he will tell us the terms of the Government&rsquo;s surrender where they claimed working people could not live alongside those whose aspiration is to live in gated communities.  The Government will have created a society where people who cannot afford to buy their own houses will be on one side of the street.  Those taking the blood money from their 20 or so houses will be living behind their electronic gates, protected against the people they are supposed to be living with in communities.  The Government will have done all this in its Republic.</P>
        <P>If this is ever to change, it will mean removing the Progressive Democrats from office.  It is the party that represents those who want to put their private hospitals on the grounds of public hospitals.  They who want to sell State sites owned by CIE and other State agencies.  It is the party of the miserable Minister of State at the Department of Finance who stands with an auctioneer&rsquo;s hammer in his hand, declaring &ldquo;everything is up for sale&rdquo;.  Everything is up to be robbed from the public when it comes to the Progressive Democrats.  Builders know that Fianna F&aacute;il, with its own slick mohair inheritance from the building industry, will always facilitate a conversation with a Minister.</P>
        <P>In the time of the greatest economic growth in the State&rsquo;s history, has social protection been extended?  A home is the security to which a child returns after school.  It is the place where the elderly spend the remaining days of their lives.  The Government now requires them to sell their homes to go into nursing homes.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>A home in Fianna F&aacute;il thinking, already contaminated by the Progressive Democrats, is an asset and no longer a home in this republic of greed.  How can Ireland be the second richest country in the world yet have the second lowest level of social protection in comparison with its European neighbours?  Why will the Government not accept a rights-based approach to shelter?  Why will it not implement the proposals of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, and her colleagues come to the Galway Races and proclaim,&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Galway really flying?  There are cranes everywhere.&rdquo;  There are cranes in Cork, Dublin and elsewhere making money for those who have buckets of it already.  At the same time, 2,546 families in Galway city have waited six to ten years for a house.  Garda&iacute;, teachers and others <Col N="168"/>with moderate incomes are unable to purchase a house there.</P>
        <P>The moral challenge for any society is how its economy is regulated.  Today, thankfully in Ireland, it is a question of how to distribute the fruits of economic growth.  How could the Government have so much wealth and produce so much misery?  How could it have such an absence of courage in defining rights?  When history judges us it will say that at this time when everything could have been achieved, much damage was done.  The damage will have been led by putting housing out of the reach of those who wish to have their basic right to shelter accepted as a principle.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Members who contributed to this debate, particularly those Opposition Members who are supporting the Labour Party motion this evening.</P>
        <P>Yesterday evening, in response to the motion, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, offered a mixture of flattery and delusion.  Having considered the Labour Party motion and concluded that it was a good idea, the Minister of State&rsquo;s response was to remind the Labour Party that the Government has already launched that policy and welcome that party&rsquo;s endorsement of its approach. The Labour Party, he said, had picked up on many of the elements of the Government&rsquo;s statement in its policy document.  It appears that the Government&rsquo;s first response when faced with ten good ideas from the Labour Party on how to deal with the housing problem is to throw the cloak around it and say &ldquo;that is a great idea and we are doing it already&rdquo;.  If that were really the case the Minister of State would not have proposed an amendment to the motion which begins with the words &ldquo;To delete all words after &lsquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;<?oasys _is0p1- ?>&rdquo; and substitute a long litany of delusional Government platitudes.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State acknowledges the achievements of the Government in &ldquo;improving affordability for first-time buyers through targeted measures&rdquo;.  The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland in its Financial Stability Report published last week states: &ldquo;Following the publication of last year&rsquo;s Report a reacceleration emerged in annual house price increases. . . . [A continuation of high] increases in house prices, along with increasing interest rates, is contributing to a deterioration in affordability in the residential market.&rdquo;  So much for the Government&rsquo;s platitude that it is improving affordability.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said that the Government is &ldquo;taking action to improve the regulation of property services and to address various issues relating to the management of common areas and facilities in private developments...&rdquo;.  It is doing no such thing and in the text of the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech the issue of dealing with manage<Col N="169"/>ment companies is lost somewhere between the Law Reform Commission, the auctioneer and estate agents review group and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Government has certainly not taken any action to control and regulate management companies and management charges in private developments.</P>
        <P>He spoke about the introduction of &ldquo;ground-breaking legislation under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts&rdquo; and said that the Government is &ldquo;significantly increasing delivery under Part V in terms of both social and affordable housing;&rdquo;.  It is not.  The Government gutted Part V of the Planning and Development Acts.  Even by a conservative estimate, Part V should by now have delivered 40,000 homes, instead it has delivered 3,000.  That leaves 37,000 families who should today be living in an affordable home that this Government handed back before Christmas 2002 as a gift to private developers.</P>
        <P>The Government says it is bringing forward the housing action plan to increase the supply of <Col N="170"/>social housing.  We can judge it only by its results.  In the richest of times, after ten years of this coalition in Government there are twice as many people on social housing lists as were on it when the coalition took office.  That is so even after the Government changed the method of counting these people in order to make the figures look good.</P>
        <P>The Government compliments itself on the introduction of the rental accommodation scheme.  This scheme and the rent allowance scheme, as operated, are nothing more than the privatisation of social housing for the benefit of many of those who have in the first place benefited from tax-supported investment properties.</P>
        <P>This country needs a change in housing policy and if this Government votes down the Labour Party motion tonight the only way this will be achieved is by a change of Government.</P>

      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise the Stardust tragedy on the Adjournment.  This issue is about people, the death of loved ones and families. The Stardust fire was a nightmare for all the families and they all need and deserve our sympathy and support.  However, they need more than that and tonight I set out my clear position on the Stardust tragedy.  I support the families of the Stardust fire tragedy in their quest for truth and justice.  In this regard I call on the Government to honour the terms of Article 40.3.2&deg; of the Constitution which states:  &ldquo;The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen&rdquo;.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>I call on people to support the families in their call for a new Stardust inquiry which will include the new vital information.  I also call on all Members of the Oireachtas to support the families of the Stardust victims and survivors&rsquo; group.  I am here to add another voice to their campaign.</P>
        <P>The families of the victims have major concerns about the forensic investigation in the previous <Col N="172"/>tribunal and the competence and integrity of the forensic team.  There is a mixed agenda and people want to know if those who were criticised by Mr. Justice Keane were in a position to undertake an investigation.</P>
        <P>Various questions arise.  Why was the roof ignored?  Antoinette Keegan and the families want to know the details of the wall types that would have been the perimeter of the storeroom at mezzanine level, detailing their density and height.  Can they see the photographs of where the walls go right up to the roof ridge, because all pictures viewed show an 18-inch gap?  The tribunal report states no gap existed.  Can they have an explanation from Mr. Michael Norton as to why he said there was insufficient fuel in the storeroom to burn a black pipe?  The outside witnesses do not concur with this having viewed the inferno they saw.</P>
        <P>A resident took a photograph showing an inferno fire in the roof space some 26 feet above ground level.  The photograph was taken at 1.40 a.m., yet the fire on the seat seen at 1.41 a.m. was only 18 inches high, a point previously stated by Mr. Norton, forensic evidence officer.  He noted that the fuel in the storeroom would not be enough to burn the black pipe.  Could he now realise that he under-estimated the fuel or knew nothing about its existence, and that this inhibited him explaining correctly the rapid fire spread as viewed by people outside the building and heard by many while the roof shattered?  Antoinette Keegan and the families are disgusted by this and have made their views known to the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>There are serious questions for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Department is wheeling out the same old mantra that there is no new evidence but does not want to disturb the <i>status quo</i>.  Where does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stand on this issue?  Has the Taoiseach read the material?  The material is new.  Three independent experts <Col N="173"/>have said it is new.  Senior counsel believe it is new.  It does answer the criteria for a full public inquiry.</P>
        <P>Concerning the case for a new inquiry, in a letter from the office of the Taoiseach received the day before yesterday, the Government seeks a further three weeks because it advises its examination of the technical and legal questions arising is not yet satisfactorily concluded.  In response to that, the Stardust families believe that the original tribunal of inquiry reached conclusions in ignorance of crucial evidence.  The tribunal of inquiry was deprived of vital information essential to the proper discharge of its terms of reference.  Its efforts to determine the cause and rapid development of the fire were rendered fundamentally ineffective.  It is no longer safe to accept that the findings of the tribunal on the cause and rapid spread of the Stardust fire have any validity.  That too is the families&rsquo; view and I strongly support their position.</P>
        <P>A vitally important way in which the State vindicates the life of its citizens is to ensure that all unnatural deaths are fully and properly investigated.  The European Court of Human Rights has held that it is an obligation of a state to ensure that all inquiries into causes of the deaths of its citizens are independent, effective, reasonably prompt, have a sufficient element of public scrutiny and that the next of kin must be involved.  The strength of the new evidence is such that the families have been advised and believe that if available to the original tribunal it would have materially altered the outcome of the inquiry.  While the original tribunal of inquiry has concluded, it is open to the Government to establish a new tribunal of inquiry with discreet and focused terms of reference.</P>
        <P>Yesterday the families and their excellent legal team pointed to section 40 of the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000 and section 66 of the Railway Safety Act 2005 which provide that the relevant Minister may direct that a completed inquiry be reopened.  I urge the Minister and the Government to listen to the families of the Stardust fire tragedy and to do something now to end this sad situation once and for all.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Bruton.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for acknowledging in the House earlier today my interest and that of the Labour Party in pursuing justice and closure for the Stardust relatives and victims&rsquo; committee, the families of the 48 young people who tragically lost their lives in February 1981 and the people of Coolock, Raheny, Donaghmede, Kilbarrack and Artane in Dublin North East constituency. I renew my call tonight to the <Col N="174"/>Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to establish a commission of inquiry into the Stardust tragedy and to review the findings of the original tribunal which reported in 1982.</P>
        <P>In a very real way the people I represent have been waiting for nearly 26 years for such a judicial review and it is inexcusable that the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have continually stonewalled in their response to the review of the evidence presented by the Stardust relatives and victims&rsquo; committee and to the new evidence which has also been presented.  This morning the Taoiseach stated that he had been available to meet the Stardust committee since February this year but the meeting only finally took place in September last, more than six months later.  Why has a decision on this issue dragged on interminably and why are the relatives and survivors of the Stardust victims now being told that they must wait another three weeks?  Why do they have to parade up and down, as they did 20 years ago outside the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department?  These, including the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response this morning, do not seem like the actions of a Government that is anxious to help achieve some level of justice and closure for a group of people who have been treated so appallingly over the past 26 years.</P>
        <P>Exactly two years ago this month I accompanied a delegation of Stardust survivors and relatives to meet Mr. Se&aacute;n Aylward, Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his principal officer, Mr. Noel Sinnott.  This meeting was held in the light of a new report prepared by Ms Geraldine Foy that re-assessed and rejected some of the critical conclusions of the original Stardust tribunal report and presented new evidence.  The report also raised disturbing issues regarding the cause of the fire.  In particular it showed strong evidence that the fire began in the roof space where cleaning oils were located and greatly contributed to the rapid conflagration of the inferno.  It also showed that maps used during the original tribunal were misleading.</P>
        <P>In a special D&aacute;il debate earlier in the year I outlined a number of key issues which clearly point to the need for an urgent re-assessment of the unsound original conclusions of the Keane report.   They include a litany of breaches of the building by-laws and public resort laws, the serious shortcomings in the forensic examination carried out by the Garda and the Department of Justice and also compelling evidence relating to the electrical system of the Stardust night club which was disregarded in the tribunal report.</P>
        <P>We have had a series of new reports.  Two outstanding young northside journalists, Neil Fetherstonhaugh and Tony McCullagh, published their comprehensive book, <i>They Never Came Home</i>, in <Col N="175"/>2001.  We have had the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme on RTE on St. Valentine&rsquo;s night last.  These clearly show the urgent need for a new tribunal.</P>
        <P>Earlier today the Stardust relatives and victims&rsquo; committee asked me to ask the Taoiseach and the Minister to release all records held by the forensic department and Garda detailing their search of the waterlogged basement, as clearly marked on the Garda map.  They also asked for the publication of the full report on the storeroom contents at mezzanine level.  They asked for the publication of Garda photographs of the storeroom at mezzanine level and laboratory test results from Mr. Michael Norton&rsquo;s analysis.  They also asked why 32 of the victims&rsquo; bodies had portions of limbs missing, which the original tribunal report notes but does not investigate.</P>
        <P>The substantive issue remains.  We welcome the report on the tragic graves and bodies in St. Fintan&rsquo;s cemetery.  In light of the new evidence and the unsafe conclusions of the original tribunal report, a mechanism to facilitate a new commission of inquiry is urgently necessary and I urge the Taoiseach to set it up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Broughan for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I support the proposal put forward today by the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte, to have an independent legal person look at the new evidence, the flawed assumptions that underpin the previous inquiry, the testimony of records and so on.  There is no doubt that new experts have cast doubt on the sequence of events as set out in the original tribunal.  I do not question the bona fides of the Taoiseach in this matter.  As he said, he is not a forensic expert and he is trying to facilitate a detailed review of this evidence.  However, I believe he is taking on himself a judgment that should not be taken by a politician.  We need an independent legal expert to make the final judgment on the need for further investigation in identifying the causes that need to be studied and the questions that need to be answered before relatives can be satisfied.  I congratulate the Taoiseach on the interest he has taken in this matter.  However, it is not he who should be carrying out the investigation and making the judgment on these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the T&aacute;naiste, I thank the Deputies for their contributions to this debate, which provides an opportunity to update the House on the very latest developments with respect to this important matter.</P>
        <P>As the T&aacute;naiste has previously set out, discussions between his Department and representatives of the families led in 2004 to the presen<Col N="176"/>tation to the Department of a submission prepared on behalf of the Stardust Victims Committee which examined a range of issues relating to the fire and its investigation.  That submission was examined by the Garda Commissioner and the forensic science laboratory but was found not to contain new evidence.  More specifically, the forensic science laboratory concluded that the report in question amounted to a different interpretation of matters already brought to the attention of the tribunal.  Similarly, the Garda response concluded that no new evidence was forthcoming that would warrant the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na revisiting the investigation and that all the matters raised in the report had been adequately addressed by the tribunal of inquiry.</P>
        <P>At a subsequent meeting between the Stardust Victims Committee and departmental officials, the committee was informed of this position and advised that in the absence of compelling new evidence, the establishment of a further tribunal of inquiry could not be recommended.  It was made clear, however, that any further submission they or their representatives wished to make would be carefully examined.  In the immediate aftermath of that meeting no such submission was received.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste has pointed out previously, but believes it bears repeating, that the original inquiry carried out by the former Chief Justice was a substantial and extensive examination with comprehensive terms of reference.  It sat for 122 days and heard evidence from 363 witnesses, 161 of whom were present in the building on the night of the fire.  The tribunal had available to it a range of national and international expertise in matters relating to fire safety and building construction, and detailed forensic and pathology evidence was also heard.  By any standards it was an impressive undertaking and in no sense should it be seen as an inquiry with anything less than the gravity and thoroughness that would rightly be expected in these circumstances.</P>
        <P>As the 25th anniversary of the tragedy approached, the question of a new inquiry began to be raised again by representatives of the victims.  In response to queries from the representatives and when raised by Deputies, the T&aacute;naiste made it clear that any submission would receive serious attention.  In July a comprehensive submission was received and referred to the forensic science laboratory for analysis.  This was followed up by a meeting on 18 September at which the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, together with senior officials and the director of the forensic science laboratory, met representatives of the victims committee.  The purpose of the meeting was to hear from the committee in person on their detailed submission so as to properly inform the analysis of its contents.</P>
        <P>At the meeting the committee also outlined its concerns regarding the identification of five of <Col N="177"/>the victims whose remains have never been properly identified and proposals as to how this might be achieved were discussed.  The meeting concluded with an indication by the committee that it would follow up with some final observations, which could be added to the material already under examination.  The extent of the detail and the complexity of the issues, however, are such that the examination of the technical and legal questions arising is not yet satisfactorily concluded.  For this reason, the committee has recently been advised that it could be another three weeks before a final and properly considered response can issue.</P>
        <P>At the same time as advising it of this, it was however possible to provide a more definitive response on the question of unidentified victims.  The T&aacute;naiste is pleased to be able to confirm that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will initiate and oversee a process intended to lead to their identification.  The Garda authorities will give their full support in the logistics of this process and will be assisted by the forensic science laboratory with specialist analytical input from the UK.  The cost of the process will be borne by the Department, including all analytical expenses, as well as exhumation and reburial expenses, to include the reasonable costs of private funerals following identification.  This last item will be agreed with the next of kin of each of the five victims in due course.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste full appreciates the concerns of the families regarding a response to their call for a new inquiry.  There is no question that the response is being postponed indefinitely.  Their submission on identification has been dealt with in good faith and so will this.  Rather than rush that response, however, the issues are getting the careful attention they deserve.  Every effort will be made to respond under the timeline indicated and the families can take it that the timeline will not be exceeded.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I refer specifically to the professions of occupational therapy and speech therapy.  Over a period of time I have encountered difficulty in having work carried out under the housing aid for the elderly scheme, operated by the HSE.  As we were not able to get an occupational therapist examination, report and recommendation, individual work and undertakings could not proceed because approval for the work was not forthcoming.  On inquiry, I discovered that while we have a range of occupational therapists with a considerable volume of responsibility within the HSE organisation, many occupational therapists for various reasons are not at work and are not in a position to come to work to examine these cases.</P><Col N="178"/>

Where a ramp needs to be installed for somebody who is wheelchair-bound to give access to a front or back door, I fail to understand why the professional work could not be undertaken by an engineer who would be engaged by an agency or for a specific period by the HSE to fill the void during the period when the occupational therapists are not available and would examine, report and recommend so that the work could proceed.</P>
        <P>It is not a question of resources not being available under the particular heading for the HSE.  It has significant resources and is doing excellent work in this area.  The Minister of State should ask the HSE to examine that possibility urgently.  I do not accept that a qualified engineer could not carry out this work in a similar fashion to the occupational therapist.  I accept that there are other responsibilities in the HSE on which engineers would not be to suitable to report and make recommendations.</P>
        <P>In some two-storey houses a downstairs toilet needs to be installed.  There is no reason an engineer could not recommend that the toilet facilities be provided downstairs because the occupant may use a Zimmer frame or wheelchair or be partially disabled in such a way that they are not able to negotiate the stairs.</P>
        <P>Given the number of young females in both professions, occupational therapy and speech therapy, it is inevitable that they will occasionally be absent through pregnancy or illness.  We need to have formulas to deal with these circumstances.  I have already outlined the issues regarding occupational therapists.  There are also delays in dealing with young children with special needs who require speech therapy.  Insufficient numbers of speech therapists are available.  It must be possible to organise, in conjunction with their parents, qualified speech therapists to co-ordinate and supervise services to provide the tuition these children require.  This would be better than there being no speech therapy services available because there are not enough personnel to provide them.  It may be that, at any given time, the HSE is not in a position to recruit a sufficient number of speech therapists.  There must be a fall-back position.</P>
        <P>I would be happy to discuss this matter with the Minister of State and the officials in the personnel unit of the HSE responsible for dealing with it.  We must be practical and innovative and find solutions where they are required.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank the Deputy for raising it because it provides me with an opportunity to outline to this House the issues in <Col N="179"/>respect of the staffing levels relating to the grades to which he referred.</P>
        <P>The latest available figures show that in the period since the establishment of the Health Service Executive to 30 September 2006, the number of health and social care professionals employed in the area covered by the former North Eastern Health Board increased by 37 whole-time equivalents from 788 to 826, an increase of 4.7%.  In the specific grades of health and social care professionals to which the Deputy referred, there have been increases of 7.9%, 0.8% and 19.4%, respectively, in the numbers of occupational, speech and language therapists and social workers in the same period.  In addition, there was a significant increase, between October 2001 and June 2006, in the salary scale relating to speech and language therapists.  This resulted in an increase of 32% at the minimum point of the scale and an increase of 31.8% at the maximum.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the health service personnel census collects employment information in respect of the Health Service Executive, voluntary hospitals and certain disability services on the basis of administrative areas and not on a county basis.  He may also be aware that many services are provided on a national, regional and cross-county basis.  Total staffing in the former North Eastern Health Board area increased by 4.8% to 7,635, the number of medical and dental personnel increased by 7.3% to 530 and the number of nursing personnel increased by 4.0% to 2,622.</P>
        <P>In response to concerns regarding labour shortages, the Department of Health and Children commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions to 2015 in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.  The report was published in 2001.  Arising from its recommendations, three additional speech and language therapy courses commenced in the 2003-04 academic year at University College Cork, the National University of Ireland Galway, and the University of Limerick,  providing an additional 75 training places for speech and language therapy.  This expansion in training numbers was identified in the Bacon report as sufficient to meet the long-term demand-supply balance for speech and language therapists in Ireland.  The first graduates from the two-year masters course at UL completed their studies in June 2005.  The first graduates from the BSc courses in UCC and NUIG will graduate in 2007.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that it is a matter for the Health Service Executive, as part of its management of its employment ceiling, to determine the appropriate staffing mix required to deliver its service plan priorities.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has <Col N="180"/>been advised that the HSE is undertaking a national and international recruitment campaign to fill current vacancies and development posts and that the situation will be reviewed in 2007.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the Health Service Executive has also advised the Department of Health and Children that it is currently carrying out an in-depth appraisal of staffing levels in all services in County Louth.  It is expected that this will be completed shortly.  I will bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children and her officials the valid points made by the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.  I also thank the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, for coming before the House to reply to it.</P>
        <P>I raise this important issue on foot of a number of cases that have come to my notice in recent months.  The first of these involved a father who was retiring and handing over the farm to his son.  They went to their solicitor and signed the transfer documents relating to the land and then went to the district veterinary office and had the herd number transferred.  Everything was fine until it was time to claim the single farm payment.  They were advised at that point that because the father had applied for area aid and the single farm payment, he could not obtain the money because he no longer had a herd number.  The son could not be paid because the land had not been in his name for the necessary ten months.  It is obvious that these people will be paid this money when sufficient time passes and when they have completed the necessary forms.  However, they were not made aware of the problem by their solicitor or by the Department when the herd number was transferred.  This led to a serious delay in the issuing of the single farm payment at a time when the young man was building his own home.  The second case with which I am familiar involved a young graduate who had already built his new home and also a new cattle unit and who is still owed two years&rsquo; worth of payments.</P>
        <P>Is this the way to encourage young people to become involved in farming?  I urge that all personnel, such as solicitors and officials of the Department, be fully briefed in order that area aid and single farm payments can be dealt with in an organised and structured way.  The single farm payment and area aid often comprise the major part of farm incomes and are vital when young farmers are building new homes and, in some cases, starting families.</P>
        <P>The problem relating to late payments was a feature of what happened in respect of herds infected with BSE.  In such cases, the Department withdrew herd numbers and provided new ones but failed to transfer the payments.  This led to <Col N="181"/>long delays for farm families that had already suffered major trauma.</P>
        <P>When the single farm payment was announced, it was welcomed by farm organisation personnel as an end to form-filling etc., and by the then Minister, Deputy Walsh, as giving farmers total freedom to farm and to return to production.  However, on foot of the nitrates directive and traceability requirements, paperwork remains the order of the day for farmers, regardless of their age or level of education.  That is why it is so important that those who serve farmers should have the best advice available to them and ensure that their clients are treated well.</P>
        <P>I became aware earlier this evening of one of the worst cases to date when I was contacted by an aged farmer who read to me over the phone a letter he received from the Department.  The letter demanded that he provide an official of the Department of Agriculture and Food with proof of his place of residence for the past 20 years, even though he has only been involved in the various schemes since he returned home from working abroad 14 or 15 years ago.  Would any other group be subjected to such scrutiny or harassment?</P>
        <P>From working with farmers for the past 35 to 40 years, I am aware that the vast majority want to do what is right.  Many older farmers have little education and deserve help and encouragement.  Most departmental officials do a great job.  Unfortunately, however, certain individuals seem to have chips on their shoulders and focus on the negative, regardless of the damage this can do to farmers who live in isolated areas and who require, and should receive, support.  Young and elderly farmers need justice and support.  Big and small farmers are fleeing from the land and only fair play will ensure the maximum number of them are retained.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure the relevant information is provided so that solicitors and departmental personnel give farmers complete advice at the time of transfer to make this difficult time as easy as possible and to make sure the moneys to which they are entitled are paid on time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  The introduction of the single payment scheme in 2005 brought the new concept of payment entitlements into the direct payments system.  Payment entitlements are not attached to land but they are the property of the farmer who was farming during the reference period and was in receipt of direct payments under one or more of the livestock premium and-or arable aid schemes.  Entitlements may be sold with or without land but can only be sold without land once 80% have been used in one calendar year.  On the other hand, entitlements may only be leased to another farmer if <Col N="182"/>accompanied by an equivalent number of hectares of eligible land but they may also be transferred, with or without land, by gift or through inheritance.  The arrangements for the transfer of entitlements by way of sale, lease, gift or inheritance in respect of the 2006 and 2007 scheme years were clearly set out in press releases issued by my Department, which are available on its website.  The application forms to be completed by farmers engaged in transferring entitlements are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website for people who may wish to access that information through this medium.</P>
        <P>In this context, where an entire holding is being transferred within the ten-month period for compliance with the single payment scheme requirements, the transferee must complete a separate declaration of undertaking under which he or she undertakes to succeed to the responsibilities of the original applicant and, thereby, becomes entitled to payment.  In all such cases, my Department, on receipt of the application to transfer entitlements, decides, on the basis of the date of transfer, whether the declaration of undertaking is required.  Individual farmers need not, therefore, concern themselves with this aspect provided they have forwarded the application to transfer entitlements in the first instance.  I am satisfied my Department has taken every opportunity for informing farmers and others about the introduction of the single payment scheme and the various requirements pertaining to the transfer of payment entitlements.</P>
        <P>The arrangements governing the introduction of the scheme were the subject of two separate series of countrywide information seminars for farmers and others interested in the agricultural sector.  In addition, separate information seminars were held for agricultural consultants and others involved in giving advice to farmers.  A large volume of information was conveyed through the various media channels including radio and the farming press, while a number of information booklets were prepared and issued to individual farmers.  I assure the Deputy that the Department is in the process of writing to the Incorporated Law Society pointing out the need for members of the legal profession, who are dealing with the succession of estates where single payment entitlements are involved, to familiarise themselves fully with the rules pertaining to these entitlements.  This additional initiative will make a worthwhile contribution to the efficient operation of the scheme&rsquo;s arrangements to the benefit of all involved.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that all of us want every applicant to receive his or her entitlements.  The first year of the scheme went well, as it involved a major transformation from multiple schemes to a single payment scheme.  A number of queries were outstanding but I assure the Deputy that the Department is anxious that every applicant <Col N="183"/>receives his or her full entitlements and full information is available to them to assist them with queries that may arise regarding applications that are not straightforward.  It behoves those giving advice to farmers, whether they are consultants, Teagasc officials or members of the legal profession, to ensure they are fully apprised of the <Col N="184"/>rules on entitlements, transfer, etc.  The additional initiative we are taking will be of benefit in ensuring each applicant draws down his or her full entitlements.</P>

	<P>As I indicated in my reply to PQ 33214/06 of 18th October last,  I presume that the Deputy is referring to my Department&rsquo;s Report of the Pilot Project on Resource Allocation, Business Planning and Performance Measurement of August, 2005. The conclusions and recommendations of this report informed Government thinking on reform of the Estimates and Budget process signalled in Budget 2005 and announced in Budget 2006. The report&rsquo;s recommendations, including those in relation to the development of performance indicators, were subsumed by the Government&rsquo;s reforms announced by me in Budget 2006.  </P>
        <P>As part of the reforms Ministers are required to present an annual output statement in tandem with their Estimates commencing in 2007 to assist the Select Committees with their consideration of the Estimates.  The annual output statements for 2007 will set out performance output targets by <Col N="186"/>programme area linked to the high level goals in Departments&rsquo; strategy statements and, for 2008 onwards, will set out actual outturns against the previous year&rsquo;s output targets and new targets for the year under consideration. I understand from all Departments that their preparations for production of the first annual output statement are advancing to ensure that the 2007 deadline will be met.</P>

	<P>Under the EU Insurance Mediation Directive, travel agents who sell insurance only as part of a holiday package are specifically exempt from financial regulation. These agents are therefore not authorised and regulated as financial services providers by the Financial Regulator and do not come within the scope of the Consumer Protection Codes recently introduced by the Financial Regulator.  The Financial Regulator does however, publish information and advice on travel insurance for the benefit of consumers. </P>
        <P>The Package Holidays and Travel Trade Act covers the holiday package but not the travel insurance that may be sold with it.  The Financial Services Ombudsman has powers to deal with complaints which concern the conduct of the underwriting insurance company, in relation to claims about the actual policies themselves, but not the sales process of travel agents.</P>
        <P>Any travel agent selling travel insurance that is not part of a package holiday, must be registered with the Financial Regulator as an insurance intermediary.  I understand that such insurance is widely available, whether through travel agents <Col N="187"/>or other providers and I would urge consumers to examine carefully the benefits of this option.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Finance, I have therefore no statutory function in regulating the activities of travel agents selling insurance as part of a package holiday.  However, I am informed that the Financial Regulator has written to the Department of Transport regarding<i> </i>the recommendation by the Financial Services Ombudsman in his Annual Report 2005, that a code of practice be adopted to cover how travel insurance is sold by travel agents along with package holidays.  My Department understands that the Department of Transport plans to respond shortly to the Financial Regulator in this matter.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Relevant Contract Tax (RCT) Steering Group has made significant progress to date in 2006.  As I have previously advised the House, the Revenue Commissioners have made a commitment to assigning 25% of its audit and compliance resources to the construction sector in 2006.  In addition to this they launched a national construction project to be monitored by a central steering committee. Moreover substantial progress was made in relation to legislative changes, IT upgrades and administrative improvements.</P>
        <P>As regards Legislative Changes, the steering group proposed a number of legislative changes that I introduced in the Finance Act 2006. These affect</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />applicants for C2 certificates,</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />principal contractors making payments gross to certified subcontractors, and,</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />subcontractors claiming repayment of RCT deducted by the principal contractor.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The scope of RCT insofar as it extends to all relevant contracts carried out in the State was also clarified.   These legislative measures were aimed at tightening controls and discouraging fraud.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners continue to increase its use of Information Technology to identify areas of risk in the construction sector. This is feeding into the audit, site visit and assurance check programmes e.g. information now <Col N="188"/>captured on the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; systems is giving a good real time overview of RCT operations at principal or subcontractor level.  This greatly enhances the ability to identify, target and focus in on areas/cases that may pose a risk.</P>
        <P>Finally, as regards the administrative changes the Revenue Commissioners have introduced a number of administrative changes some of which are as follows:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />A full time national C2 monitoring group has been established for the construction industry.</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />A Central Unit to Deal with Non Resident Contractors has been established</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />More site visits are being carried out.</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Specific attention is being placed on ensuring the correct classification of all workers on the site as either self-employed sub contractors or employees</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Revenue is monitoring all new C2 holders within 6 months of getting the C2 certificate.</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Suitable cases are being identified for investigation with a view to prosecution</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Materials now displayed in a number of different languages to reflect the changing composition of the workforce involved in construction</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Revenue has engaged in an extensive information and educational programme with the industry and their advisors.</P>
        <P FLI="0">To turn to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific questions on the outcomes of construction activity in the year to date:</P>
     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />In relation to audits, there were 3,083 audits carried out on construction companies in the period to 31/10/2006. This in fact represented 29% of the total number of audits carried out by Revenue in that period.</P>
     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />In relation to Site Visits &amp; Assurance Checks, there were 1,457 Site Visits carried out in the same period. In addition, 35,062 assurance checks were carried out.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The yield from these activities to 31/10/2006 is &euro;126.6 million.  As these figures relate to audits finalised and settled there is no further tax due in these cases.</P>
        <P>In relation to reclassification of contractors, up to 31/10/2006,</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />411 subcontractors were reclassified as employees.</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />511 employees were identified who were not registered with the Revenue Commissioners;</P><Col N="189"/>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />490 self-employed subcontractors were identified as not being registered with the Revenue Commissioners</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />a total of 1,003 hidden economy cases.</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />1,974 additional taxes were registered. (These are cases that were not registered with the Revenue Commissioners for all the required taxes.)  All this testifies to an intense and vigilant watch on the RCT sector, for good reasons.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The scheme of capital allowances for the construction of private hospitals was reviewed by Indecon Economic Consultants as part of the overall review of property tax incentives in 2005. Indecon consulted widely in the course of their review, including consultations with the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive. Their report was published on 6 February 2006 and is available on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website. The review recommended that this scheme should continue as there was a need for on-going investment in private hospitals.  The consultants observed that the construction of private hospitals could free beds in public hospitals used by private patients. It should also be noted that the consultants observed that the Government&rsquo;s plan for private hospitals in the grounds of public hospitals is designed to be a cost effective way of expanding supply and if properly managed will increase supply and competition.</P>
        <P>The summary of the main findings from Indecon&rsquo;s analysis is as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />There has been an overall increase in planning applications and approvals for private hospitals since 2000 but most have not proceeded to date.</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Most of the extra investment in the sector would either not have been undertaken, or would have taken longer to come on-line in the absence of the tax incentive scheme.</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />While it is too early to provide detailed estimates of the impact of the scheme on the supply and on the costs of hospital beds, Indecon believes the scheme has the potential to address supply shortages in the sector and to reduce costs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In all of the circumstances, I have no plans at this time to terminate the scheme of capital allowances for the construction of private hospitals. Private health care is a long established feature of the system of health care provision in Ireland and acts as a strong complement to the publicly <Col N="190"/>funded system. Private health care provision spans from general practitioner services through private beds in public hospitals and private hospitals to private nursing homes.  The Government is committed to exploring fully the scope for the private sector to provide additional capacity in the health system. The key objective is to provide the required extra capacity, whether this is in the public or private sector. A number of Government policies-initiatives support the co-existence of public and private health care such as: the designation of private and semi-private beds in public hospitals; income tax relief on private health insurance premiums; income tax relief on medical-dental expenses; the National Treatment Purchase Fund sources capacity in private hospitals for public patients; and the policy direction of the Minister for Health and Children to the Health Service Executive to promote the co-location of private hospitals on public sites thereby freeing up beds for public patients.</P>

	<P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the subject of Revenue prosecutions activity, which is dealt with at Chapter 2.5 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Report for 2005. I am sure he will appreciate that I cannot comment on individual sentences imposed by the courts for tax evasion. Sentencing is a matter for the judiciary and I can only emphasise this point. The courts clearly take account of matters such as individual circumstances and monetary penalties already paid when deciding the level of severity of sentences imposed in any single case.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the following information is the up to date position on court prosecutions initiated for tax evasion since 1997.</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />In 1997, there was one prosecution and one conviction. A fine of &euro;635 was imposed with no custodial sentence.</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />In 1998, there were six cases and eight convictions; fines totalling &euro;42,854 were <Col N="191"/>imposed. There were two custodial sentences, one of six months suspended and one of two years suspended.</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />In 1999, there were two cases and one conviction.  In one case a fine of &euro;19,046 was imposed with no custodial sentence.  In the other the defendant was acquitted.</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />In 2000, there were three cases and three convictions. Fines totalling &euro;952 were imposed. There were two custodial sentences, one of two years, reduced to 18 months on appeal, and another of 12 months suspended.</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />In 2001, there were four cases and four convictions.  Fines totalling &euro;14,284 were imposed. There were four custodial sentences, one of 12 months, two of six months suspended and another of three months.</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />In 2002, there were three cases and three convictions. Fines totalling &euro;5,540 were imposed and there was one custodial sentence of six months.</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />In 2003, there were six cases and seven convictions. Fines totalling &euro;29,365 were imposed and there was one custodial sentence of two years suspended.</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />In 2004, there was one case and one conviction.  A fine of &euro;5,000 was imposed and 180 hours community service was imposed in lieu of a three months custodial sentence.</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />In 2005, there were ten cases resulting in thirteen convictions. While the question from the Deputy only refers to two custodial sentences, there were in fact three, one of six months suspended on each of four counts to run concurrently and two of three months each. In another case a fine was imposed and if this was not paid within three months a two year prison sentence would have been imposed.  In a further two cases 240 hours and 120 hours of community service were imposed in lieu of custodial sentences of six months and three months respectively. Fines totalling &euro;199,287 were imposed. In another two cases guilty pleas were entered and sentencing was adjourned to 2006, when fines totalling &euro;5,170 were imposed.</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />In 2006 so far, there have been three cases concluded resulting in three convictions. One case received a six-month suspended sentence and a fine of &euro;3,200. In the other two cases fines totalling &euro;35,481 were imposed. In addition to these three convictions, another 15 cases are currently before the Courts, the DPP has given <Col N="192"/>directions to prosecute in another 9 and is considering a further 13 cases that have been referred to him.  There is a bench warrant outstanding in one case and there are another 47 cases actively under investigation for potential prosecution. In all then, there are 85 cases of serious evasion currently being tackled on a criminal investigation footing by Revenue.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Revenue Commissioners have a clearly stated policy of prosecuting cases of serious tax evasion. This function is tasked to their Investigations and Prosecutions Division. Following the restructuring of Revenue in 2003, all investigation activity was consolidated in this Division with a remit to co-ordinate all Revenue prosecution work and, in particular, to increase the number of criminal investigations for serious tax offences and ultimately to increase the number of prosecutions. The number of investigators was also increased for this purpose.</P>
        <P>I believe the level of prosecution activity outlined above demonstrates that the decision to concentrate Revenue&rsquo;s prosecution resources in one area was the right one.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is presumed that the Deputy is referring to the statements made by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners (Mr. Frank Daly) to the Committee of Public Accounts when he appeared before it on November 9th 2006.</P>
        <P>As the record of the PAC clearly indicates, Mr Daly made no reference to one in five taxpayers claiming tax relief to date in 2006.  In response to questions from the Chairman of the PAC on the amount of money that may be owed to taxpayers and a suggestion that, in the case of PAYE taxpayers, large amounts are not owed in individual cases, Mr. Daly gave the following information to the committee. He said that Revenue had made a total of 485,000 repayments up to the end of October, 2006 involving an amount of &euro;353 million. He said that this was the factual situation in relation to what was claimed and repaid and that it was difficult to speculate about what more might be reclaimable. Mr. Daly said he was reluctant to put a figure on what had not been claimed but repeated the figure of &euro;353 million claimed to the end of October, 2006 and gave the compar<Col N="193"/>able figures for 2004 and 2003 which were &euro;325 million and &euro;295 million respectively.  Mr. Daly suggested that to say that there is almost the same amount unclaimed as has been repaid would be overstating it but perhaps there is a further &euro;100M unclaimed.</P>
        <P>The figures quoted by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners clearly show that taxpayers are becoming more aware of their entitlements and, as a consequence, the number of repayment claims and the amounts being repaid are increasing year on year.</P>
        <P>During August, September and October this year Revenue ran a high profile campaign to encourage taxpayers to claim the reliefs to which they are entitled. This campaign involved advertisements on radio, bus shelters, the DART and the Luas.  Also there is a continuing campaign of placing leaflets and claim forms in clinics, doctors&rsquo; surgeries and pharmacies to encourage take-up of the relief available for medical expenses. There has been a positive outcome to this campaign which is shown in a significant increase in the number of people contacting Revenue and claiming entitlements particularly in relation trade union subscriptions, bin charges and age, rent, home carers and dependent relative credits.  There are preliminary indications that claims for some of these reliefs have more than doubled following the Revenue campaign.  It is expected that the campaign will also lead to an increase in the number of claims in relation to health expenses at the end of this year and early in the New Year when the majority of these claims are normally made.</P>
        <P>The Tax Credit Certificate sent to each PAYE taxpayer at the beginning of the tax year is accompanied by a detailed leaflet setting out a wide range of information in relation to:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Main personal tax credits available for the year in question with comparative figures for the preceding year</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Tax rates and tax bands for the year in question</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Exemption limits for single, widowed and married persons</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />How to claim an adjustment to the Tax Credit Certificate.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Revenue&rsquo;s website provides easy-to-access customer service information on the full range of reliefs available to taxpayers together with a range of claim forms for download and completion.  The homepage on the website also contains a &ldquo;What&rsquo;s New&rdquo; section where Revenue alerts customers to timely items of interest.</P>
        <P>The website also has detailed information to direct customers to the appropriate contact point should they wish to phone, call, write, email or fax.</P><Col N="194"/>
        <P>In addition, in May 2006 Revenue introduced a full Internet service for PAYE customers, which allows them access their Revenue records over the Internet, review their liability and to claim or amend their tax credit details.  A leaflet giving details of how to access this new &ldquo;Self-Service&rdquo; option was sent to every PAYE taxpayer in the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68, 113 and 120 together. </P>
        <P>Following the precedent set in the preparation of previous National Development Plans, an ex-ante evaluation of investment priorities for the next NDP (2007-2013) was commissioned by my Department from the ESRI.   The ESRI published its report on 24th October last.</P>
        <P>As I stated in my comments at the time of the publication of the ESRI Report, I welcome the ESRI&rsquo;s conclusion that continuing substantial investment in our infrastructure is fully justified. I also welcome the ESRI assessment that previous National Development Plans have made an essential contribution to the transformation of the Irish economy and society over the last 15 years and that the current NDP has greatly enhanced the economic and social infrastructure of the State with major benefits to economic development throughout all regions.</P>
        <P>The prioritisation given by the ESRI to investment in infrastructure accords with that of the Government. I have noted the concerns expressed by the ESRI on the level of such investment. The Government&rsquo;s programme in that regard over the period to 2013 will have to <Col N="195"/>await the publication of the NDP on January next. I would, however, reiterate the view I expressed on the occasion of publication of the Report. In my view, we must use the window of opportunity we have over the short to medium term to deal with the serious infrastructure deficits we still face before other factors such as Health and Pensions arising from the aging population impact more strongly on resources over the longer term. I therefore believe that we should work to eliminate the infrastructure deficit as quickly as possible in order to improve quality of life and enhance competitiveness across the economy.</P>
        <P>The Deputies can equally be assured that this Government, in deciding on the appropriate level of capital investment and in implementing its capital programme, will not endanger its record of prudent management of the economy and of the public finances.</P>
        <P>I have noted the ESRI&rsquo;s comments in relation to taxation. As the Deputy will appreciate, taxation changes are a matter for the Budget.</P>
        <P>Overall, Government consideration of the new Plan will be informed by the ESRI study and by the priorities identified in the widespread consultation process which the Government has undertaken, notably with the Social Partners and Regional Interests.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The State encourages individuals to supplement the social welfare pension arrangements with private pension arrangements by offering tax relief on private pension provision. The tax relief arrangements for private pension provision are long-standing and have helped a significant proportion of the workforce to provide for supplementary pensions thus reducing the pressure on the Exchequer to fund pension needs.</P>
        <P>Tax relief is provided at an individual&rsquo;s marginal income tax rate on amounts contributed to pension schemes (subject to limits) and on the amount of profits and gains generated by the investments held by the pension schemes. Pension benefits payable on retirement are taxable subject to an entitlement to take a tax-free lump-sum cash benefit.</P>
        <P>Over half of all people in employment are covered by voluntary private pensions and, while this proportion has not changed hugely in recent years, the absolute numbers covered have been increasing. The National Pension Policy Initiative target is for a coverage rate of 70% for people in employment aged between 30 and 65.  The coverage rate is currently below this level. In the 2006 <Col N="196"/>Budget and Finance Act, I introduced some changes which were designed to encourage older people and those on lower incomes to commence or improve their voluntary pension arrangements. These changes involve:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />A Pension Incentive Tax Credit to encourage SSIA holders on lower incomes to put some or all of the proceeds of their accounts on maturity into a pension product. For each &euro;3 invested in a pension product, the Exchequer will contribute &euro;1 (to a max of &euro;2,500) together with a proportion of the exit tax deducted from the SSIA on maturity.</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />An increase in the rate of age-based tax relief for pensions contributions to all pension products for contributors aged 55 years or over (i.e. from 30% to 35% of net relevant earnings/ remuneration for those aged 55 or over but under 60; and from 30% to 40% of net relevant earnings/remuneration for those aged 60 or over).</P>
        <P FLI="0">At the same time, I introduced other changes the purpose of which was to limit the cost to the Exchequer of tax relief provided to higher income earners. These changes are:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />A cap on the value of a pension fund allowable for tax purposes of &euro;5 million (or, if higher, the value of the fund on 7 December 2005).</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />A cap on the maximum value of the tax-free lump sum of &euro;1.25 million which is 25% of the new maximum pension fund amount of &euro;5 million.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the same Budget I introduced, for the first time ever, a general restriction on the use by high earners of special tax reliefs of one type or another and I delivered what in real terms was described by the ESRI as a &ldquo;highly progressive&rdquo; Budget. Tax equity, both in relation to pensions and more generally, was therefore a major feature of my last Budget.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that prior to the passing of the Finance Act, 1999, any person going on pension under a <Col N="198"/>defined contribution scheme or a retirement annuity contract was required to purchase an annuity with  any remaining pension fund moneys, following the drawdown of the appropriate tax-free lump sum.</P>
        <P>The Finance Act, 1999 introduced changes which gave a significant degree of flexibility and personal choice to certain categories of individual in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans. These choices include the options to purchase an annuity, receive the balance of the fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate) or to invest in an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) or Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), depending on the circumstances. Proprietary directors, self-employed individuals and certain employees/directors in non-pensionable employment represent the categories of individual who can exercise these options in relation to their pension plans.</P>
        <P>While these flexible options for drawing down pension benefits are not available to members of employers&rsquo; defined contribution schemes (who are outside of the categories of individual described above) in respect of benefits derived from standard contributions to the schemes, the flexible options do apply as regards any Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) made by such members either to their main schemes or to separate AVC schemes. The flexible options also apply to Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) introduced in the Finance Act, 2002 to create an alternative pension product which is flexible, portable and user-friendly.</P>
        <P>The question of making changes, as suggested by the Deputy, to the existing arrangements for the broad membership of approved occupational pension schemes, generally, is a complex matter and needs to be considered as part of the wider issue of pension and retirement provision in Ireland. In this regard, the Government is committed to the publication next year of a Green Paper on Pensions Policy. The Green Paper, into which my Department (among others) will have an input, will outline the major policy choices and challenges facing us in the pensions area and important issues such as those raised in the question are best left for consideration in that context.</P>

In fact, I am advised that Revenue will shortly publish a survey which it conducted of 2000 SMEs, and from which indications are generally very positive as regards Revenue&rsquo;s service to businesses and preliminary results of my own Department&rsquo;s survey of several hundred firms on the operation of the BES scheme also indicate a positive view of Revenue&rsquo;s operations in that regard. I have also noted a recent comment by the Small Firms Association to the effect that they regard Revenue as being among the most proactive of Government agencies when it comes to empathising with the needs of small business. Therefore one needs to seek a balance in reporting on such matters.</P>
        <P>I am advised by Revenue that they continuously examine ideas to further improve service to all their customers, including tax practitioners. Earlier this year, senior staff from Revenue conducted a series of interviews with the major tax practitioner bodies to seek their views on service issues. Ideas on further improving service to tax practitioners will be advanced through the Tax Administration Liaison Committee, which is made up of Revenue and representatives of the main Accountancy Bodies, the Law Society and the Irish Taxation Institute.</P>
        <P>Revenue continues to work closely with all tax practitioner bodies and clearly Revenue sees tax practitioners as very important to the smooth running of the self-assessment tax system. In recent days, for example, record numbers of tax returns and record amounts of tax have been filed and paid electronically using Revenue&rsquo;s online service (ROS), which has been a tremendous success. Most of these returns are filed by tax practitioners on behalf of their clients and I understand that several practitioner representatives have commented very positively on this aspect of Revenue service.</P>

	<P>The question of whether an individual is resident or not-resident in the State for tax purposes is a question of fact, based on the tax legislation.</P>
        <P>The Residence Rules were last updated by in the 1994 Finance Act following a comprehensive review of the matter by the Revenue Commissioners and my Department.  A person is regarded as resident in Ireland for tax purposes in a particular tax year if he/she spends:</P><Col N="200"/>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />183 days in the State in that year, or</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />280 days in aggregate in that tax year and the preceding tax year &mdash; this aggregation rule does not apply if they are in the country for less than 30 days in the tax year being looked at.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The &lsquo;183 day&rsquo; rule that contributes to determining residence in Ireland is also a key rule in other countries including Australia, Austria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal and Sweden.</P>
        <P>I asked the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners last year to monitor the application of the current residency rules. The Revenue Commissioners subsequently reported to me that, of the cases examined, there was no reason to conclude that the individuals concerned failed to comply with the statutory rules governing non-residence.</P>

	<P>There are a number of schemes of relief from taxation which seek to assist and encourage research and development activity. These include:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />The deduction for capital or revenue expenditure incurred on scientific research;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Capital expenditure on patents can be written off in equal annual instalments over the shorter of 17 years and the life of the asset;</P>

      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />The deduction in the year of acquisition of capital expenditure on industrial know- how purchased from an unrelated party, unless the know-how is acquired together with the trade to which it relates;</P>
     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />An exemption from stamp duty on the sale, transfer or other disposition of intellectual property. Intellectual property includes any patent, trademark, copyright, registered design, design right, invention, domain name, supplementary protection certificate or plant breeders rights;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />A tax exemption is available, subject to certain conditions, in respect of income arising from a qualifying patent; and</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />A tax credit of 20% of incremental expenditure incurred by a company on research and development can be offset against its corporation tax liability.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a basis for providing estimates of tax forgone is available only in respect of the tax exemption for income arising from patent royalties and the tax credit available to companies for investment in research and development.</P>
        <P>Figures collated to date from income tax returns filed for the income tax year 2004 and from company tax returns filed for accounting periods ending in the year 2004, the latest year available, indicate that some &euro;333 million of tax exempt income arising from patent royalties was returned in 841 individual and corporate claims. This figure would correspond to a maximum Exchequer cost in terms of tax forgone of the order of &euro;62 million.</P>
        <P>The most recent year for which complete information is available on the tax credit for research and development is for the accounting year ended 2004. On that basis it is estimated that the total cost to the Exchequer of the tax credit is &euro;70.5 million in respect of 73 claims made against corporation tax liability for that year.</P><Col N="202"/>
        <P>I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that claims for the other tax incentives listed are aggregated with other claims in tax returns or in supporting business accounts and could not be distinguished from other reliefs claimed for the purposes of estimating tax forgone. Accordingly, specific information on costs for these items is not available.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Activity in the housing sector impacts primarily on VAT, Stamp duty and Capital gains tax. Housing market activity also impacts on Income tax and PRSI receipts and Corporation tax from construction sector company profits.  </P>
        <P>While revenues from housing market activity such as Stamp duty and Capital gains tax have made an increasing contribution to the Exchequer in recent years, we are not overly reliant on receipts from these sources. For example, taken together the Stamp duty and Capital Gains tax tax-heads were forecast to contribute just 11 per cent of total targeted tax revenues in 2006. In contrast the 4 main tax-heads &mdash; VAT, Income tax, Corporation tax and Excise were forecast to account for just over 87 per cent of tax receipts this year.</P>
        <P>Care has been taken not to plan the public finances around an assumption that receipts from Stamp duty and Capital gains tax will continue to grow in future years as they have in the recent past.  This is a prudent and sensible approach to take.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if he has assessed the affordability of house purchase for young families in view of the 40% increase in the cost of mortgages in the past twelve months and its implications for Government policy. </Quest>
        <QRef>[39151/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Central Bank&rsquo;s recently published Financial Stability Report noted that increases in both house prices and interest rates are contributing to reduced house price affordability. While the Report also shows that estimated mortgage repayments as a percentage of disposable income have varied over the past sixteen years, the current mortgage repayment level on a national basis is less than 35 per cent, which was the level during the early 1990s.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that Irish house buyers benefit from a range of supporting factors, <Col N="203"/>including healthy income growth, low income tax rates and relatively low levels of interest rates by historical standards. Affordability is also supported by the strength of the economy, record employment levels and relatively high savings rates.  Recent indicators point to continued moderation in house price inflation in line with increased housing supply and higher ECB interest rates.  The consensus among commentators is for this trend to continue, resulting in a gradual cooling and soft landing for property prices in Ireland.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s report shares the view that this is the most likely outcome.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s housing policy also tackles issues of affordability through supply side actions. Maintaining the pace of housing supply, in line with our future demographics requirements, is a primary objective of Government policy and has a critical role to play in securing balance in the marketplace and supporting affordability, particularly for first-time buyers. The Department of the Environment&rsquo;s Housing Policy Framework outlines Government plans to reform the social and affordable housing sectors and to support the expansion of home ownership. We are working towards building sustainable communities through a capital investment programme of <Col N="204"/>EUR4 billion over the next three years. Budget 2006 further supported these initiatives through the expansion of social housing options and the full implementation of the private sector&rsquo;s Rental Accommodation Scheme.</P>

        <P FLI="0">These figures allow for the fact that many income earners pay no tax at all; many pay tax at a standard rate but pay a much lower average rate because of the application of credits; and for many taxpayers who are, strictly speaking, liable for tax at the higher rate on part of their income, the amount of their liability at the higher rate is fully offset by their tax credits.  In fact, tax credits fully offset the 42% liability in the case of all but about 20% of all income earners.  Effectively, therefore, many of the &lsquo;top rate&rsquo; taxpayers actually pay at an average rate of 20% or less.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 81, 150, 162 and 221 together.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to review the scale or scope of the decentralisation programme.  A progress report by the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) was presented to Government in early October and published on 4th October last. The Group reported that implementation of the Decentralisation Programme is progressing satisfactorily.</P>
        <P>Over ten thousand, six hundred civil and public servants have applied to relocate under the Programme.  The Central Applications Facility remains open and continues to receive applications.  Some 53% of applicants are currently based in Dublin.</P>
        <P>All Departments and Offices have produced implementation plans setting out the detailed arrangements they are putting in place to plan for relocation while also ensuring business continuity and effective delivery of services to customers.  The plans are comprehensive and their preparation involved detailed reviews of business processes as well as the logistics of the move.  Departments and Offices are taking a prudent approach in relation to assessing the risks involved and the adoption of appropriate measures to manage business risk.</P>
        <P>Discussions have concluded on a number of human resource and industrial relations matters and are being progressed on other issues.  To date decentralising organisations have established a presence in 12 new locations.</P>
        <P>Over the next 18 months decentralising Departments and Offices will have a presence in a total of 29 new locations around the country.  Over the next 5 months alone, it is anticipated that the number of decentralised staff in their new locations will have grown to over 1,000 in approximately 20 towns around the country. The precise numbers moving by end year will depend on the timeframes for completion of fit out and installation of necessary ICT (information communications technology) and telecommunication cabling and equipment.</P>
        <P>At end October 2006, over 2,300 staff have been assigned to decentralising posts.  These are currently in place or are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location, as soon as accommodation becomes available.  Overall <Col N="206"/>approximately 60% of assignees to date are officers who were originally based in Dublin.</P>
        <P>A facility is being operated through the Public Appointments Service to allow staff remaining in Dublin to express preferences in relation to the organisations to which they would like to transfer.  This will be an ongoing process throughout the transition phase of the Programme. Progress in this priority area is currently being reviewed in co-operation with Departments and the relevant unions, to ensure that they are operating efficiently.</P>
        <P>The property programme is well advanced.  Property acquisition negotiations have been completed or significantly advanced in 36 locations.</P>
        <P>The OPW conducts a review of the property timeframes for permanent accommodation on an ongoing basis. Based on its experience to date in relation to timeframes for property selection and acquisition, brief and design issues, tendering periods, planning issues and contractual arrangements, it has provided an updated schedule of the likely availability of accommodation.</P>
        <P>This schedule allows for the planned movement of up to 6,800 staff in the next three years in line with the target set out in June 2005.  The delivery time for some locations will be later than originally projected, however, leading to a greater concentration of moves in 2009 rather than in 2008. Matters outside the control of the OPW, which could give rise to delay, will continue to be monitored and mitigating action taken where possible.</P>
        <P>There are of course elements of the programme which continue to present challenges. These include the position of professional and technical personnel who wish to remain in Dublin, the State agency sector and ICT areas.</P>
        <P>Having already met with a number of Secretaries General, the Decentralisation Implementation Group is currently meeting with some of the Chief Executives of State Agencies to discuss their Implementation Plans, the planning framework in place, to assess progress to date and to hear about the challenges arising and steps proposed by the agencies to address them.</P>
        <P>Across the public service, recruitment and promotion practices generally are being managed in a way which facilitates the achievement of the Decentralisation Programme in an efficient manner.  Agreement has been reached with the Civil Service unions representing general service staff that all interdepartmental promotions will be made on the basis of the appointee agreeing to move to a post in a decentralising unit, Department or Office.  In addition, any appointments from open competitions are being made on the same basis.  Where an organisation is moving in full, all internal promotions will include a decentralisation condition in the 52 week period prior to the move.  Where an organisation is moving in part, 50% of all internal promotions will include <Col N="207"/>a decentralisation condition in the 52 week period prior to the move taking place.  These arrangements allow for a proportion of all promotions arising in Civil Service general service posts in the normal course to have a decentralisation condition.</P>
        <P>Discussions are ongoing with the unions representing professional and technical staff in the Civil Service on this issue.</P>
        <P>The position in relation to the State Agencies is of course more complex.  The Government has always said that this is a voluntary Programme.  Any staff member wishing to remain in Dublin will be accommodated with a public service job in Dublin. I am aware of the need to balance the business needs of the organisation in furthering its relocation objective with the needs of staff remaining in Dublin.  The DIG in its recent report has highlighted the need to make progress on the question of transferability between State Agencies and between agencies and Civil Service.  It is my strong view that these issues can only be resolved through dialogue and negotiations with the unions representing the State Agency sector.</P>
        <P>In relation to ICT issues, a protocol has been prepared by my Department to address the filling of ICT posts and a sub-group of General Council has been established to move the process forward.  The Centre for Management and Organisational Development (CMOD) has already concluded a pilot programme of ICT certified training and is currently developing tender proposals to source trainers to provide such certified training for new entrants to the ICT area.

        <P>The issue of managed data centre services was also addressed by the DIG.

	<P>Ireland continues to use the tax system to provide a stimulus to encourage activities that can assist policies promoting sustainable energy and tackling climate change. Details of the relevant tax incentives introduced since 1997 are as follows: </P><Col N="208"/>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Benefit-In-Kind exemption on employer provided public transport tickets to encourage commuters who travel to and from work by car to switch to public transport thereby easing traffic congestion at peak times;</P>

     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Section 50 of the Finance Act 2004 provided for the introduction of a limited scheme of relief from excise tax for biofuels.

      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Section 81 of the Finance Act 2006 provided for a large scale scheme of excise relief intended to cover annual production of 163 million litres of biofuel over 5 years;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />VRT Relief for hybrid electric vehicles was introduced in January 2001, the purpose of the scheme &mdash; which provides for a 50% reduction in the VRT charge &mdash; is to encourage the purchase of vehicles that use a combination of an internal combustion engine and an electric motor to derive motive power; and</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />As a complementary measure, the Finance Act 2006 provides for a new 50% VRT relief to promote new flexible fuel vehicles (cars designed to operate on biofuels) for an initial period of 2 years.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As regards benefit-in-kind exemption on employer provided public transport tickets, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as taxpayers are not required to provide details of this benefit in their tax returns there is no basis on which an estimate of the cost to the Exchequer of this tax exemption can be provided.</P>
        <P>The corporation tax forgone in respect of corporate investment in certain renewable energy generation projects is estimated at close on &euro;8.5 million since inception to end 2005, the latest year for which figures are available. These are broken down as to &euro;1 million for accounting year 1998/99, &euro;3.6 million for 1999/00, &euro;0.7 million for 2000/01, &euro;1.3 million for 2001, &euro;1.0 million for 2002, &euro;0.1 million for 2003 and &euro;0.8 million for 2005.</P>
        <P>In relation to the limited scheme of relief from excise tax for biofuels introduced by section 50 of the Finance Act 2004 the amount of excise forgone was &euro;422,000 in 2005 and &euro;911,000 to date in 2006. There is as yet no basis for estimating the cost of the scheme introduced by section 81 of the Finance Act, 2006.</P>

        <Quest> further to the statement of the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners at the Public Accounts Committee that he believed consumers have a legal right to a share of the refund that has been granted to opticians for VAT paid on dispensing services, the procedures in place to ensure that consumers can claim their share of the VAT refund; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, historically, they had treated the supply of corrective spectacles and contact lenses by an optician as a single supply chargeable at the standard rate of VAT (currently 21%).  Opticians had, in general, accounted for VAT on the full price for the supply of spectacles and contact lenses.  Opticians have always been exempt from VAT in respect of the professional fees received from eye testing, which has always been treated as a separate supply.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Commissioner decided, in a test case, that the supply by an optician of spectacles and contact lenses constituted two separate supplies for VAT as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">(i) A taxable supply of goods; and</P>
       <P LI="1">(ii) An exempt supply of dispensing services.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The decision in question followed similar decisions in the UK courts.  The Revenue Commissioners have accepted the decision.  The principle that there are in fact two separate supplies involved is beyond dispute.</P>
        <P>As a result, many opticians now find themselves in a position to claim a refund from Revenue of a portion of the VAT accounted for by them on their supplies of corrective spectacles and contact lenses.  VAT is a consumption tax collected and accounted for by businesses.  Refunds of VAT are made to the persons chargeable to, and accountable for, the tax.  There are no provisions in EU VAT law, which could enable repayment of VAT to be made by Revenue to the ultimate consumer, in this instance, the customers of the opticians.  Therefore, the ques<Col N="210"/>tion of refunds to the opticians&rsquo; customers is a matter for the optician and customer concerned.  It was in that context that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, in his recent appearance before the Public Accounts Committee, encouraged opticians&rsquo; customers to check out the possibility of refunds with their optician.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Under Section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, there is an exemption from income tax on leasing of land in respect of the first &euro;12,000 of annual leasing income where the leasing is for a period of not less than 5 years and in respect of &euro;15,000 where the leasing is for a period of not less than 7 years. The exemptions are available to lessors of agricultural land aged 40 years or over or to those who are permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity from carrying on farming. In Budget 2006  I announced an increase in the annual exemption limits from &euro;7,500 to &euro;12,000 for leases between 5 and 7 years duration and from &euro;10,000 to &euro;15,000 for leases of 7 or more years duration. In addition, in order to provide for situations where land is leased along with entitlement to EU Single Farm Payments, I also announced that rental income arising from such entitlements would qualify for the relief with effect from 1 January 2005. These improvements were provided for in section 12 of the Finance Act 2006.</P>
        <P>These tax exemptions apply only in respect of leases to qualifying lessees. In this context, &ldquo;qualifying lessee&rdquo; specifically excludes from the scope of the relief any leases made between closely connected relatives. A person is connected with an individual if that person is the individual&rsquo;s husband or wife, or is a relative, or the husband or wife of a relative of the individual or of the individual&rsquo;s husband or wife. A relative in this context is defined as meaning brother, sister, ancestor or lineal descendant.</P>
        <P>This restriction covering leasing to closely connected relatives is a standard anti-avoidance measure and such measures are common throughout the tax code.  It should also be noted that there are already very generous stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax reliefs available in the case of permanent transfers of land between family members, such as  by gift or sale. Naturally, I am not going to comment on specific Budget measures, but a number of changes affecting the farming sector have already been signalled in the context of &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86, 127, 137, 148 and 216 together.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan/Community Support Framework (NDP/ CSF) 2000-2006 was an integrated investment plan and strategy for economic and social development for Ireland.  The objectives are to ensure that Ireland maintained its international competitiveness and that our economic success would be shared more equally at regional level and throughout our society.  The Plan was developed following an extensive consultation process that included the Social Partners and regional interests and, therefore, reflected the broad consensus on the future development needs of the country. The size and ambition of the Plan signalled an unparalleled commitment of &euro;57 billion of Public, Private and EU funds over the programme period, which under EU Rules continues to 2008. It has involved significant investment in infrastructure &mdash; such as roads, public transport, water and waste services &mdash; in health services, social housing, education, industry and rural development.  The Plan is delivered through seven Operational Programmes. These Operational Programmes are the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme, the Productive Sector Operational Programme, the Employment and Human Resources Operational Programme, the Border, Midlands and West (BMW) Regional Operational Programme, the Southern and Eastern (S&amp;E) Regional Operational Programme, the PEACE II Operational Programme; and the Technical Assistance Operational Programme.</P>
        <P>Based on the most recent expenditure information available, &euro;48bn had been spent by the end of June 2006. This is a healthy implementation rate in view of the slow start up in some areas at the beginning of the programme and the relatively disappointing response in certain demand led schemes due mainly to the impact of the slowdown in economic activity in 2000-02, the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, a lower than anticipated take up of financial opportunities by the private sector. The information also indicates <Col N="213"/>that while the overall outturn is expected to be close to the original forecast by the end of the programming period, there will be broadly offsetting variances as compared to the original forecasts at individual Operational Programme level. However, the final Exchequer and EU commitment is expected to be ahead of the original forecast and, on current expectations, this will largely cover a lower than expected take-up from the private sector.</P>
        <P>Progress reports to the end of June 2006 for the Operational Programmes will be reviewed by the NDP/CSF Monitoring Committee, which my Department chairs, when it meets next month.  However, initial indications show that physical progress on the infrastructure and the employment and human resource programmes are on target and good progress is evident in the regional programmes.  While financial performance in the Productive Sector programme remains behind target, physical progress is closer to targets.</P>
        <P>The mid-term evaluation of the NDP/CSF 2000-2006, carried out by the ESRI, stated that the &ldquo;NDP has made significant progress towards its objectives of continuing sustainable national economic and employment growth and of consolidating and improving Ireland&rsquo;s economic competitiveness&rdquo; and &ldquo;will have a sustainable positive effect on competitiveness and the productive capacity of the economy in the long-term&rdquo;.  The report said that the level of GNP will be around 3% higher in the long run which represents a real rate of return on NDP investment of around 14%.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, in its ex-ante evaluation of investment priorities for the next NDP 2007-2013, the ESRI states that, &ldquo;The current NDP has greatly enhanced the economic and social infrastructure of the State with major benefits to economic development throughout all regions&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Lessons have been learned and taken on board.  To improve the planning and execution of infrastructure projects, my Department has introduced a number of initiatives.  These include the strengthening of cost estimation and control systems and advancement of procurement policy and practice with the objective of completing projects on time and within budget. The latest Value for Money measures and the Government&rsquo;s proposals for Estimates and Budget Reform build on initiatives in recent years such as the multi-annual budgets for capital programmes, the revised Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals of February 2005 and construction procurement reform.  These are part of a concerted effort to improve public expenditure management and to maximise value for money from public expenditure.</P>
        <P>The preparation of a new NDP for 2007-2013 will build on the achievements already taking place under the current Plan and is being finalised.  This will include a concise review of the achievements under the NDP 2000-2006.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Credit Union Act, 1997 provides the legal framework for the regulation of credit unions. The Act was designed to provide the credit union movement with a regulatory structure that reflects and promotes the particular ethos and philosophy of the credit union movement, its strong tradition of volunteer service and the core objective of providing opportunities for saving and lending for members of credit unions.</P>
        <P>The approach to regulation embodied in the Credit Union, 1997 Act has served the credit union movement well by providing clarity and certainty to individual credit unions, their Directors and members. It has helped support the continued stability of the credit union movement and safeguard the members&rsquo; savings during a period of rapid growth.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions continues to be appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions. In recent months, I have introduced a regulation to increase the amount of money that members can deposit with a credit union. Furthermore, following extensive consultations with the representative bodies of credit unions and drawing on the advice of the Credit Union Advisory Committee &mdash; the statutory expert advisory body on credit union matters &mdash; the Registrar of Credit Unions recently issued guidelines on a revised investment framework for prudent and responsible investment by credit unions.</P>
        <P>Other developments include the establishment of a review group chaired by my Department to examine the limits on longer-term lending in Section 35 of the Credit Union Act, and the agreement by the Financial Regulator to examine proposals for reform of the Savings Protection Scheme for credit unions.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware the case for modernising the regulatory framework for credit unions has been raised by both the Registrar of Credit Unions and the representative bodies for credit unions. It is important that there is a clear shared understanding on how a new regulatory framework would operate, before moving to develop specific proposals.  In this context, I wrote to the Chair of the Financial Regulator earlier this year recommending that the Financial Regulator engages with the credit union movement, in the first instance, to identify common ground in relation to a set of principles that could guide the development of an updated regulatory framework for credit unions. The Chair of the Financial Regulator has indicated the Authority&rsquo;s willingness to move forward on this basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no statutory function in setting the interest rates offered by credit institutions &mdash; they are based on commercial criteria in the light of market conditions.  Since 1992, the Irish banking market has been open to competition from credit institutions authorised in any EU/EEA Member State. Hence, new entrants to the market from abroad are competing with domestic banks for business in, for example, the market for personal deposits. </P>
        <P>The September 2005 Competition Authority report on banking focused on two markets &mdash; personal current accounts and SME lending. It suggested measures aimed at promoting more active competition, but found no evidence of deliberate anti-competitive actions by banks. The Authority recommended action to make switching of accounts easier, and this is now in place.</P>
        <P>The Financial Integration Monitor, published by the European Commission to assess major trends in the pan-European market, indicates that the cross border competition inherent in the single market has contributed to convergence in interest rates, which is particularly evident in relation to the highly competitive mortgage market in Ireland.</P>
        <P>My function as the Minister for Finance is to provide an appropriate and robust legislative framework for regulation of the financial services sector.  I am satisfied that, since the establishment of the Financial Regulator and the Financial Services Ombudsman, with a particular focus on the consumer, we have such a framework in place.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has drawn attention to the need for consumers to choose the right type of loan for their needs.

	<P>VRT is a very important source of revenue for the Exchequer providing &euro;1.15 billion or 2.9% of total net tax receipts for 2005. It is a valuable source of funds given this Government&rsquo;s strategy <Col N="216"/>of reducing other taxes such as income tax and increasing the level of funding for vital public services such as health and education.  Consequently, any changes to the current system would require very careful consideration. </P>
        <P>The European Commission published a proposal for a directive in relation to car taxes in July 2005 which supports the gradual abolition of registration taxes which it believes is impacting adversely on the functioning of the internal market.  However, the aim of the proposal is that such registration taxes would be replaced by higher circulation taxes (such as Ireland&rsquo;s Motor Tax) which would have a CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> element or possibly increased excise taxes on fuel. VRT would be required to have a CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> basis in the period up to its abolition.  Since discussions at Council level commenced in October 2005, we have pointed out that we regard VRT as a national tax that falls within the national competence, a position shared by several other Member States.  The mix of taxes, their levels and rates are a matter for EU Member States based on legitimate choices.  As regards the balance of taxation, as I indicated earlier, Ireland has prioritised tax reductions on income earned by employees, in preference to other tax areas, and this policy has helped create record employment levels.</P>
        <P>However, we accept that the Commission in its proposal is attempting to design a structure which ideally would go someway towards incentivising behaviour that reduces carbon emissions.  On the domestic front, we will be reviewing policy options that may have the capacity to reduce emissions from cars but on a fiscal-neutral basis, which is in keeping with the spirit of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The most recent figures available for the growth in total private-sector credit (PSC) show it grew by 28.1 percent in September, which represents a slight easing in the rate of credit growth over the past number of months. Adjusted mortgage credit growth was 26.9 per cent in September.  House mortgage finance comprises the bulk of lending to households and represents approximately 83 per cent of the outstanding stock of personal debt. </P>
        <P>In terms of the economic implications, the relatively high level of private sector indebtedness must be seen in the context of a sharp decline in public sector indebtedness in recent years.  Moreover, a large part of the increase in private sector indebtedness reflects the accumulation of housing assets on the part of households.</P><Col N="217"/>
        <P>However, as I have pointed out before, both borrowers and lenders need to be aware that interest rates are currently low and will inevitably rise.  Moreover, a shock to the economy which affected employment and earnings growth could affect the ability of borrowers to service their debt.  As Ireland is a small and very open economy, and hence vulnerable to changes in the global environment, this highlights the need to retain and indeed improve our international cost competitiveness.  It also illustrates the need for fiscal prudence, in order to provide room for manoeuvre in the event of a shock transpiring.</P>
        <P>As far as looking after the interests of the individual borrower and the individual investor is concerned, the function of Government is to provide an appropriate legislative framework for regulation of the financial services sector &mdash; one that is both comprehensive and robust. As the Deputy will be aware, within the implementation of the overall legislative framework, private sector credit growth and debt levels are, in the first instance, a matter for the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  This follows from its role as part of the European System of Central Banks and its functions, as the Financial Regulator, in relation to the prudential supervision of financial institutions and the protection of the customers of those firms. In this regard, I fully support the vigilance of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator on the issue of personal credit and mortgage debt and in reminding both borrowers and lenders of the need for responsible behaviour.</P>

        <Quest> the basis on which forecasts of capital tax are made by his Department; and the assumptions in respect of the number of taxable transactions and the trend in house prices that underpinned the 2006 estimate. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The assumptions underpinning the 2006 capital taxes forecasts were based on economic growth estimates in the Stability Programme Update which was published on Budget day, December 2005. These estimates included GNP, projected changes in the consumer price index and developments in the construction sector.</P>
        <P>The methodology for forecasting capital taxes in 2006 firstly required my Department to estimate the outturns for the base year, in this case 2005. These projected outturns were then adjusted to take account of known once-off factors, both negative and positive, likely to impact on the yield in 2006. An example is the discontinuance in 2006 of the bank levy, the receipts from which came in under stamp duties. The figures were then refined to take account of the impact of Budget measures. These various <Col N="218"/>steps gave the base upon which the 2006 forecasts were built.</P>
        <P>The base was then inflated for projected economic developments in 2006. In the case of capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax, estimated growth was driven by the forecast change in nominal GNP and in the CPI, respectively. For stamp duties, since the bulk of the yield is from transactions in residential and commercial property, the forecast for 2006 was largely based on estimated volume and price growth in the residential and commercial property sectors.</P>
        <P>The capital gains tax estimate represented an increase of 3.8 per cent and the capital acquisitions tax estimate an increase of 4.4 per cent on their respective 2005 outturns. The stamp duty estimate represented a decrease of 1.5 per cent on the 2005 outturn but this largely reflected the non-renewal of the bank levy.</P>
        <P>The estimates for all three taxes assumed a lower rate of growth in revenues from these sources this year than the significant increases experienced in 2005. In the event the property market in 2006 proved far more robust than many commentators predicted around the time of last years Budget.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 119 and 132 together.</P>
        <P>I welcome the publication by the Central Bank of its Financial Stability Report 2006 which reflects the Bank&rsquo;s mandate to contribute to the stability of the financial system in Ireland. I note the Report&rsquo;s main conclusion that Ireland&rsquo;s financial system continues to be in a good state of health. The Bank&rsquo;s central expectation, based on an assessment of the risks facing borrowers, the financial position of the banking sector as well as the results of recent stress testing of the system, is that the current shock-absorption capacity of the banking system leaves it well placed to withstand possible pressures.</P>
        <P>The Bank&rsquo;s Report identifies vulnerabilities facing the financial system, including those arising from credit growth and house price inflation. As the Deputy will be aware, within the implementation of the overall legislative framework, private sector credit growth and debt levels are, in the first instance, a matter for the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. While the strong increase in borrowing is a sign of a healthy economy and a positive economic outlook on the part of borrowers, I  fully support the vigilance of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator on the issue of personal credit and mortgage debt and in reminding both borrowers and lenders of the need for responsible behaviour. Recent indicators point to continued moderation in house price inflation in line with increased housing supply and higher ECB interest rates. The consensus among commentators is for this trend to continue, resulting in a gradual cooling and soft landing for property prices in Ireland. The Central Bank&rsquo;s report shares the view that this is the most likely outcome.</P><Col N="221"/>
        <P>The Government, for its part, will continue to contribute to economic and financial stability by pursuing a prudent fiscal policy.</P>
        <P>In terms of the general economic implications of the rise in house prices and the associated increase in indebtedness in recent years highlighted in the Report, both borrowers and lenders need to be aware that interest rates are currently still low by historic standards. The Central Bank has highlighted the need for borrowers and lenders to factor into their financial decision-making the prospective impact of potential changes in the future economic and financial environment, including the impact of higher interest rates.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the Report makes the point that a shock to the economy which affected employment and earnings growth could affect the ability of borrowers to service their debt. As Ireland is a small and very open economy, and hence vulnerable to changes in the global environment, this highlights the need to retain and indeed improve our international cost competitiveness. It also illustrates the need for responsible budgetary policy in order to provide room for manoeuvre in the event of any sharp slowdown in  economic growth.</P>
        <P>As far as safeguarding the interests of the individual borrower is concerned, the role of Government is to provide an appropriate legislative framework for the regulation of the financial sector &mdash; one that is both comprehensive and robust. With the establishment of the Financial Regulator and the Financial Services Ombudsman, such a framework is now in place. Under the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Codes, mortgage lending institutions are obliged to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests. The Financial Regulator has launched a number of specific initiatives to inform consumers in making the best choice of mortgage product for their needs. There are also specific legal obligations under the Consumer Credit Act regarding the information that must be provided to borrowers about their housing loans. The Financial Regulator earlier in the year introduced a technical prudential measure requiring financial institutions to put more capital aside for certain categories of loans. This reinforces the message consistently conveyed to lending institutions by the Financial Regulator that mortgage lending policies and practices should be prudent and responsible.</P>
        <P>My overall view is that the Report, with its main conclusion and its assessment of risks, makes a valuable contribution to the assessment and maintenance of financial stability in our economy.</P>

	<P>In Budget 2006, following a major review of existing tax reliefs involving both internal reviews and the employment of outside consultants I announced the termination, subject to certain transitional provisions, of the following reliefs; the urban renewal, town renewal and rural renewal schemes, and the special reliefs for hotels, holiday cottages, student accommodation, multi-storey car parks, third-level educational buildings, sports injuries clinics, developments associated with park and ride facilities and the general rental refurbishment scheme.</P>
        <P>In line with the recommendations of the consultants, I retained the tax reliefs available for private hospitals, convalescent homes, registered nursing homes and childcare facilities. Finance Act 2006 introduced a new scheme for mental health centres but this has not yet been commenced.</P>
        <P>In addition to the special property-based tax schemes covered by last year&rsquo;s reviews, Section 268 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for capital allowances for a range of buildings or structures.  These are normal business related capital allowances rather than special incentive schemes.</P>
        <P>The operation and impact of tax reliefs are monitored and/or subject to review on an ongoing basis as part of the normal work of my Department and the Revenue Commissioners. For example, the Revenue Commissioners have been carrying out a review of the operation of VAT on property and my Department, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is examining the operation of the BES and Seed Capital schemes, which terminate this year unless renewed. I have also, for example, asked for an examination of the research and development tax credit, based on information to date of its operation. I will also expect to have the results of further examinations available to me in the coming months in relation to aspects of the operation of certain other reliefs.</P>
        <P>However, given the recent completion of a major review of existing tax relief schemes I have not, at this stage, requested the Revenue Commissioners to carry out any further review on a similar scale of property-based schemes in the context of the forthcoming Budget and Finance Bill.</P>

	<P>Provisional data for the first half of 2006 show that the volume of exports of goods and services increased by almost 6% on an annual basis in that period. This compares with an annual increase of 3.9% for 2005 as a whole.</P>
        <P>In the medium term, the outlook for Irish export performance remains broadly positive. Our existing strong export base, particularly in pharmaceuticals, food, medical devices, software and financial services, allied with our pro-business environment and skilled workforce, are factors which provide good grounds to expect a continued solid export performance from the Irish economy over the medium term. However, it is important that we remain focused on improving our competitiveness, which has been declining in recent years.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the apparent drop in audit numbers referred to by the Deputy in fact arose from a re-categorisation of audits in 2005 and that when the re-categorisation is taken into account, the number of audits conducted under the Revenue Audit Code of Practice actually increased marginally in 2005 compared with 2004.  </P>
        <P>Audit Categories were re-defined during 2005 with a view to making it clearer that the appropriate intervention depends on whether the risk is perceived to relate to one or more tax or duty headings or to relate to specific issues or transactions (as opposed to tax or duty headings). In particular, some items which would have been classified as verification audits in 2004 were re-classified as Assurance Checks in 2005. Therefore, in order to make direct comparisons between 2004 and 2005, some 2500 VAT refund <Col N="224"/>verification checks in 2005, now categorised as Assurance Checks, need to be taken into account. When this is done, the number of audits conducted under the Revenue Audit Code of Practice marginally increased in 2005 compared with 2004.</P>
        <P>In total there were 98,981 Assurance Checks in 2005 with a yield of &euro;50.41m, which means that the overall outcome from Revenue&rsquo;s Audit and Assurance activity in 2005 was ahead of 2004 both in numbers and in yield.</P><?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>Assurance checks are interventions by Revenue officers that, although not now categorised as audits under the Code of Practice, may involve tests, verification checks, desk examinations, visits to premises, searches, site visits, and telephone contacts for supporting documentation. Many of these interventions have traditionally been called verification audits. All such interventions are initiated with the intention of assuring Revenue, without recourse to resource-intensive audit or enforcement activity, that the customer is broadly compliant for the taxes and duties that are the subject of the intervention.</P>
        <P>Revenue&rsquo;s main focus in this area will continue to be on selecting cases for intervention on the basis of various risk indicators and other information available. This is the type of targeted intervention that gets best results and that is most likely to change the behaviour of the taxpayer into the future. The targeted approach is now greatly enhanced by the new computerised Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling System (REAP) recently developed by Revenue. This system, which categorises taxpayers in accordance with defined risk criteria, has been successfully piloted over the last two years and has been introduced nationwide during 2006. It allows for the screening of all tax returns against sectoral and business norms and provides a selection basis for checks or audits. This effectively means that 100% of self-assessed taxpayers will be risk assessed at least once a year.</P>
        <P>Revenue constantly monitor the resources available to them for audit and other responsibilities. They advise me, however, that their developing audit and compliance focus is not so much on the traditional quantitative measures of activity but on identifying and tackling the riskiest cases and minimising contacts with compliant taxpayers. This enables their audit and other resources to be deployed to best effect, as is evidenced by the continuing success of the Commissioners in dealing in a very determined way with tax evasion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is a tax on a capital gain arising on the disposal of assets. A 20% rate of CGT applies on the gains arising on the disposal of assets.  In Budget 2003, it was announced that no rollover relief would be allowed for any purpose on gains arising from disposals on or after 4 December 2002. Rollover relief applied when CGT rates were much higher.  In effect, it was a deferral of the tax to be paid, where the proceeds of the disposal were re-invested into replacement assets.  The taxation of these gains would take place following the eventual disposal of the new assets without their replacement. The abolition of this relief is in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low.</P>
        <P>Such reliefs made sense when CGT rates were 40% and above.  As you may be aware, the rate was halved from 40% to 20% in Budget 1998.  Taxing capital gains when they are realised is logical, and this change brings CGT into line with other areas.</P>
        <P>Where compensation is received for land that is compulsorily acquired, any gains arising from the amount paid for the acquisition of the land are chargeable to tax.  In other words, if there is a sum paid by a public authority for the compulsory acquisition of land, then irrespective of its components (for example disturbance, injurious affection etc.), that total sum will be the amount to be assessed for tax.  The CGT due on a disposal of land under a CPO is calculated in the same way as any other disposal of land.  The consideration for the disposal will be the sum received for the land.</P>
        <P>However, in the last two Budgets various measures were introduced to assist the farming community.  I announced in the 2005 Budget a new stamp duty relief which applies solely to farmland being exchanged between two farmers for the purposes of consolidating each farmer&rsquo;s holding. Guidelines in relation to this relief are available from the Department of Agriculture and Food. Budget 2006 extended the Young Trained Farmer Stamp Duty Relief for a further three years.  I also provided for tax relief on the EU Single Farm Payment Entitlement under CGT Retirement Relief and CAT Agricultural Relief.  In addition, I exempted all transfers of the Single Payment from stamp duty.</P>

	<P>I welcome the publication of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Strategic Plan for the next three years, 2007-2009.  The Strategic Plan is a detailed and comprehensive statement of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s objectives. It is set within an explicit performance framework identifying clearly the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s High Level Goals, together with specific actions and indicators of progress.  The Strategic Plan will direct the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s work and is a roadmap for Irish financial services regulation until 2009.</P>
        <P>The Strategic Plan explains the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s regulatory approach and objective of promoting the best interests of consumers and fostering sound dynamic financial institutions in Ireland.  The Plan set outs the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s principles-based approach to regulation and states the principles that the Financial Regulator expects financial service providers to comply with.  It also clarifies the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s risk-based approach to supervision and in particular its approach to supervising the international wholesale sector is spelt out.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Strategic Plan is an important manifestation of its open and transparent approach to financial regulation.  The Strategic Plan ensures a close alignment of the broad policy objectives with the day-to-day work of the organisation.  It provides a clear and objective basis for scrutinising the performance of the Financial Regulator. The plan therefore should enable a constructive engagement between the Financial Regulator, the financial services industry and consumer interests sharply focused on the concrete tasks that the Financial Regulator is now committed to undertake.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that the Strategic Plan has been developed in consultation with both the Industry and Consumer Consultative Panels and reflects the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s open and constructive dialogue with them.</P>

        <P FLI="0">These figures allow for the fact that many income earners pay no tax at all; many pay tax at a standard rate but pay a much lower average rate because of the application of credits.  And for many taxpayers who are, strictly speaking, liable for tax at the higher rate on part of their income, the amount of their liability at the higher rate is fully offset by their tax credits.  In fact, tax credits fully offset the 42% liability in the case of all but about 20% of all income earners.  Effectively, therefore, many of the &lsquo;top rate&rsquo; taxpayers actually pay at an average rate of 20% or less.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As with all tax reliefs, the scheme of tax relief for donations is constantly kept under review and any proposals submitted are examined carefully by my Department.</P>
        <P>On the subject of VAT compensation, the position is that charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply. This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group (ICTRG) accepts that charities cannot be granted VAT refunds through the tax system. However, they are seeking the introduction of a grant or subsidy in lieu of the VAT charities pay on their business inputs and estimate that this would cost the Exchequer &euro;18 million per annum.</P><Col N="228"/>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised that there are currently 7,000 charities registered with them. It is therefore likely that the introduction of a scheme along the lines proposed by the ICTRG would cost the Exchequer significantly more than the &euro;18 million they have estimated. The introduction of a grant in lieu of VAT paid by registered charities would undoubtedly lead to other exempt bodies such as schools, hospitals and sporting organisations, many of which are already registered as charities, seeking to benefit from such a system. These are in most cases already receiving considerable Exchequer funding.</P>
        <P>Finally, even if funds were available to introduce such a grant scheme, relieving charities registered with the Revenue Commissioners of the VAT paid on inputs as opposed to grant-aiding their activities using other criteria is not considered the most appropriate use of Exchequer funds.</P>
        <P>On the issue of the threshold for donations relief, amending the scheme to increase the tax relief available could significantly increase the current cost of the scheme to the Exchequer. The relief is already very generous. There is no upper limit on the amount which can be donated generally and relief is granted at the donor&rsquo;s marginal rate of income tax. Donations can be cumulative, so that a donation of just &euro;5 per week over the course of a year would qualify, for example. The donations scheme was one of the tax reliefs examined as part of last year&rsquo;s overall review of tax reliefs and exemptions. The review concluded that the &euro;250 minimum threshold is serving its purpose and should be retained at its current level, subject to ongoing review. I agree with this conclusion.</P>
        <P>With regard to duty relief on banking cards, I assume the Deputy is referring to the proposal to introduce a donation scheme in relation to the stamp duty paid on such cards. I have no plans to introduce a scheme along the lines proposed. In line with normal practice, stamp duty revenues are applied by the Exchequer for the common good, as determined by the Oireachtas.  Earmarking particular taxes reduces the discretion of Government and the Oireachtas in determining the priority areas in which public money should be spent.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104, 126, 160 and 163 together.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan 2007-2013, to be published in January next, will be a high level strategic document which will provide the framework for investment over the next seven years. The Plan will in particular seek to address the investment necessary to maintain national competitiveness and promote regional development within a sustainable economic and budgetary framework.  Whilst the precise details of the Plan will have to await its publication it will focus on investment priorities and programmes in public, economic and social infrastructure including roads, public transport, environmental services, energy, housing, education, health, childcare and R&amp;D. The Plan will also address investment in human capital, social inclusion and in enterprise development including agriculture, tourism and marine. The Plan will also address a number of horizontal themes including Regional Development, Environmental Sustainability, The Rural Economy, All-Island Co-operation and the promotion of Social Inclusion.</P>
        <P>The Plan will set out indicative seven year allocations on a national basis in the key programme areas. The allocation of these indicative amounts at project level will generally be a matter for individual Ministers, Departments and implementing agencies as appropriate over the period of the Plan. Project level allocation will of course have <Col N="230"/>to be consistent with the strategic goals of the NDP including maintaining national competitiveness, regional development, promotion of social inclusion and environmental sustainability.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware of the general state of play in relation to expenditure under the current Plan in the BMW Region from previous debates and questions on the issue. The figures reported at the recent Monitoring Committee meetings indicate that some &euro;11.1 billion or 82% of forecast Exchequer and EU expenditure had been incurred by the end of June 2006.  This is a healthy implementation rate in view of the slow start up in some areas at the very beginning, the relatively disappointing response in certain demand led schemes and the fact that Exchequer spending in relation to Structural Fund Measures for the 2000-2006 period will in fact continue up to 2008 in accordance with EU Regulations.  Based on the most recent information available to me from Monitoring Committee reports including their assessments of continuing spend under the current NDP, I expect that by the end of the programme period, the original forecasts for Exchequer and EU spending in the BMW region will have been realised in full.</P>
        <P>An important objective of the new NDP will be the promotion of balanced regional development in line with the National Spatial Strategy (the NSS). The details of the strategy for regional development will have to await publication of the Plan. I am, nonetheless, confident that the level of ambition in the overall NDP investment envelope combined with a commitment to utilise this investment to implement the NSS will lead to a better balance in economic development.</P>

The purpose of this scheme is to encourage the development of new technology that is used in the manufacture of vehicles that have flexible fuel capabilities which produce lower pollutant emissions than conventional vehicles fuelled exclusively by petrol/diesel.

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent year for which complete information on the cost to the Exchequer of the tax credit in relation to research and development is the accounting year ended 2004. This is the year in which the tax credit was first introduced. Some 73 claims were made for a total credit of &euro;70.5 million against the corporation tax liability of the companies concerned for 2004. Insofar as it is discernible from the information available, the Revenue Commissioners indicate that, of the numbers of claims made in respect of 2004, about 75% came from Irish indigenous companies and 25% from foreign-owned companies.  Data is not yet available to enable accurate estimates of the cost of the tax credit scheme for 2005 and 2006 to be compiled.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has been advised by the Financial Regulator that the new common framework for testing the fitness and probity of directors and senior managers of financial services firms will apply from 1 January 2007.  Previously, the Financial Regulator assessed the fitness and probity of directors and managers against broadly similar standards but with different sectoral processes.  Existing directors or managers will not have to complete the new Individual Questionnaire since they have already been subject to the previous sector-specific tests, but will be subject to the test for any new positions.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has also advised that moneylenders and mortgage intermediaries are already subject to regular fitness and probity tests as part of their authorisation procedure and because the existing test takes account of the specificities of the sector they work in it is not planned to extend the new common framework to them.</P>
        <P>Directors and managers of financial service firms have an important role to play in ensuring that their firms treat their customers fairly and are run in compliance with applicable financial services legislation. The new common fit and proper requirements help prove that this role is discharged by persons who are competent and of good standing.</P>

        <Quest> the anticipated costs, in terms of acquiring, and equipping premises and other related costs at the latest date for which figures are available, of the original decentralisation programme announced in Budget 2004 and the slimmed down version announced in December 2004; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is committed to the full implementation of the Decentralisation Programme announced in Budget 2004, involving some 10.300 civil and public service jobs in more that 56 locations across some 60 Government Departments/Office and Agencies.</P>
        <P>My Office is in the process of procuring appropriate properties in the designed locations for the departments and agencies involved, with much progress having been made to date. Property acquisition negotiations are completed or are significantly advanced at 35 locations.</P>
        <P>The prevailing property market conditions in each geographical area have a significant bearing <Col N="234"/>on the cost of acquiring sites. As the acquisition process is still in progress, it is not possible at this stage to provide a precise estimate of the cost of the site acquisition programme. However, and for working purposes only, an indicative figure of &euro;75 to &euro;100 million (excluding VAT) is being used by the OPW.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>Although property solutions will include leasing and fitting-out of existing buildings, it is anticipated that, in the majority of cases, the accommodation facilities will be provided by the construction of new office buildings and cost estimation can be approached on that basis. However, in advance of actual market testing of any procurement methodology, it is possible, at this time, only to assign the most general measurements of cost to such a large-scale, diverse and complex programme.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that approximately 210,000sq. m of office space will be required to accommodate the total numbers included in the programme. OPW cost norms (April 2005) in respect of offices would indicate an average build-cost to fit-out standard, in the range of &euro;1,800 to &euro;2,200 per square metre for suburban / rural locations and &euro;2,500 and &euro;3,000 per square metre in city / town centre locations. Such figures exclude VAT, professional fees and inflation.</P>
        <P>In addition, the cost of equipping the accommodation to standard office equipment levels should be estimated at c.&euro;4,000 per person. This would exclude the cost of Information and Communication Technology and specialised equipment requirements.</P>
        <P>Such general measurements of cost do not include specialised facility and equipment requirements and other variables which would arise from the spread of possible procurement methodologies. In addition general cost indicators of this type show a snapshot in time.</P>
        <P>It is self-evident that a firmer scale of costs for the decentralisation programme will only emerge on foot of actual cost proposals being received from the market. It will be some months yet before sufficient date can be extracted from a suitable range of tender competitions to provide a basis on which more robust estimates of the overall cost of the programme can be made. However, on the basis of experience to date, there is no reason to adjust the original estimates for the overall programme.</P>

	<P>As I stated in my reply to question no. 33171/06 on 18 October last, the Government&rsquo;s position on pension reform is reflected in the statement issued in August by my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs when the Report of the Pensions Board on Supplementary Pensions &mdash; &ldquo;Special Savings for Retirement&rdquo; &mdash; was published.  This statement recognised the many challenges in relation to pension coverage, while also making it clear that no pension system is worthwhile unless it is sustainable.  It also highlighted the need for any examination of pensions policy to recognise the following facts: </P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />that the number of persons aged 65 is projected to double from a current level of some 464,000, to nearly one million by 2030;</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the public cost of providing for those in this age group will rise from 13% of GNP to over 17%, apart from other pressures or enhancements to social welfare or public services;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />there are over 4 workers contributing to the support of every pensioner at present; this will fall to 2.7 in 20 years time and to less than 1.5 workers per pensioner in 50 years time;</P><Col N="236"/>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />that people are living longer, healthier lives and this, in itself, must inevitably mean a longer working life is possible and that a higher pension age overall may in time become the norm.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Government is committed to publishing a Green Paper on Pensions Policy outlining the major policy choices and challenges in this area. Work on the Green Paper, which will take account of the views of the social partners, is being progressed by my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  The Government is also committed to responding to the consultations arising from the Green Paper within 12 months of the ratification of Towards 2016 by developing a comprehensive framework for addressing the pensions agenda over the long term.</P>
        <P>The financial and economic sustainability of our pensions system is extremely important in the context of any future decisions the Government may take in this area.  Changing demographic trends over the coming years will present a number of significant interrelated challenges which can only be addressed if the economy remains competitive and improves its long-term growth potential.  It will be vital that policy development in this area is underpinned by a comprehensive assessment of the impact on competitiveness and macro-economic performance so that the right mix of policies can be developed for the long-term.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The above figures allow for the fact that many income earners pay no tax at all; many pay tax at a standard rate but pay a much lower average rate because of the application of credits.  And for many taxpayers who are, strictly speaking, liable for tax at the higher rate on part of their income, the amount of their liability at the higher rate is fully offset by their tax credits.  In fact, tax credits fully offset the 42% liability in the case of all but about 20% of all income earners.  Effectively, therefore, many of the &lsquo;top rate&rsquo; taxpayers actually pay at an average rate of 20% or less.</P>

	<P>Under the stamp duty code, liability to duty mainly arises where there is a conveyance or transfer of the legal title to certain property. It is the instrument of conveyance that is liable to stamp duty and it requires having a &ldquo;stamp&rdquo; impressed thereon.  The rates of stamp duty that are applicable to various instruments are set out in Schedule 1 to Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.  Historically, different rates of ad valorem stamp duty have applied to instruments transferring real property and those transferring stocks/ marketable securities (viz. mainly shares).  The rate of duty on the transfers of shares has remained at 1% since 1951, while the rate of duty on the transfer of real property has varied over the intervening years. The current rates for transfer of non-residential property are as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">Non-Residential Property is basically any property other than residential property, stocks or <Col N="240"/>marketable securities or policies of insurance. It includes (but is not limited to) sites, offices, factories, other business premises, shops, public houses, land and goodwill attaching to a business.</P>
        <P>If an instrument transfers the shares of a company, then the stamp duty rate is 1% of the value of the shares.  This is the case whether all or part of the value of the shares derives from real property held by the company e.g. commercial buildings, offices, factories, lands etc.  The purchaser of the shares will be a shareholder in a company that now owns the real property. General corporate law regards a company as having a personality distinct from its shareholder.</P>

        <Quest> the number of the proposed decentralisation moves announced in December 2003, in respect of which no property solutions have yet been identified. </Quest>

	<P>The Decentralisation Programme envisages the relocation of some 10,600 civil and public servants to more that 50 locations outside of Dublin. By any standards, this represents a major undertaking, involving property procurement, legal, construction, H.R. and operational issues. </P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works has direct responsibility for the property aspects relating to most of these locations. In the case of a small number of locations e.g. Birr (F&Aacute;S), Mitchelstown (Bus &Eacute;ireann), Shannon (Enterprise Ireland) and Wexford (N.B.A.), the responsibility for the acquisition of property solutions rests with the relevant agencies.</P>
        <P>Since the announcement of the programme, the Office of Public Works has been engaged in an extensive exercise with the aim of sourcing a range of property solutions covering all of its locations. The solutions include development sites, purchase or lease of existing buildings as well as purchase or lease of proposed buildings with planning permission.</P>
        <P>To date, property acquisition negotiations have been completed or significantly advanced by the Office of Public Works in 35 locations in respect of permanent accommodation solutions.  The solutions to date include a combination of O.P.W. owned sites, local authority owned sites and privately owned sites. In a number of cases, it has been decided to lease or purchase buildings.  In parallel with the acquisition of permanent accommodation solutions, the Office of Public Works has been involved in sourcing temporary sol<Col N="241"/>utions in some 20 locations in order to accommodate advance parties.  These temporary solutions will allow the early movement of staff to their desired locations and will also facilitate them regarding their domestic family arrangements.</P>
        <P>In a number of locations various proposals are still being evaluated and firm, preferred solutions have yet to be identified. These locations include Dundalk, Kildare, Monaghan, Arklow, Portarlington, Ballinasloe, Mallow, Carrick-on-Shannon (Central Fisheries Board) and Macroom.</P>
        <P>The Decentralisation Implementations Group on its recent report expressed its satisfaction on progress to date in terms of property acquisition. The Group noted that significant progress has been made as is evidenced by the fact that approximately 500 staff are currently in new locations and that over 2,100 staff have already been reassigned to decentralising posts.</P>
        <P>Taking into account the permanent and temporary solutions already sourced, the expectation is that there will be accommodation for approximately 2,000 staff in 29 locations by the end of 2007.  Furthermore, it is expected that upwards of 6,800 staff will be accommodated in decentralised locations by the end of 2009.  The progress achieved to date on the property front confirms that the Decentralisation Programme is well advanced and on course to achieve the Government&rsquo;s objective.</P>

	<P>I have not instructed the Revenue Commissioners to conduct an estimate of  underclaiming of tax reliefs by taxpayers. Revenue advise me that in the current year to the end of October, they have made a total of 485,000 repayments involving an amount of &euro;353 million. This is the factual situation in relation to what has been claimed and it is difficult to speculate about what more might be claimable. </P>
        <P>I am satisfied that Revenue are very proactive in ensuring that taxpayers are fully informed of their entitlements. During August, September and October this year, Revenue ran an intense high profile campaign to encourage taxpayers to claim the reliefs to which they are entitled. This campaign involved advertisements on bus shelters, the DART and the Luas and there is a continuing campaign of placing leaflets and claim forms in clinics, doctors&rsquo; surgeries and pharmacies. There has been a positive outcome to this campaign which is shown in a significant increase in the number of people contacting Revenue and <Col N="242"/>claiming entitlements particularly in relation to trade union subscriptions, bin charges and age, rent, home carers and dependent relative credits. It is expected that the campaign will also lead to an increase in the number of claims in relation to health expenses at the end of this year and early in the New Year when the majority of these claims are normally made.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it that the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to stamp duty on residential property. </P>
        <P>The rate of stamp duty on residential property is dependent on the status of the buyer (first time buyer or owner occupier) and whether the property is new or second hand.  Stamp duty is chargeable on the purchase of residential properties greater than &euro;127,000.  There are exemptions available for first time buyers and owner occupiers.  First time buyers can purchase second hand properties up to &euro;317,500 without a liability to stamp duty.  In addition, there are reduced rates on properties up to &euro;635,000.  All owner occupiers (including first time buyers) can purchase a new home between 38sq. m and 125sq. m., where a Floor Area Compliance Certificate has been obtained, without a liability to stamp duty.  Where a new house is over 125sq. m., stamp duty is charged on either the value of the site or 25% of the value of the property, whichever is the greater. As stamp duty arises on the conveyance or transfer of the legal title in a house, there is a direct relationship between the price of the house and the stamp duty payable.  It is therefore logical that the greater the house prices, the higher the stamp duty liability.</P>

        <Quest> if the Revenue Commissioners Office have set an increased target level of random audits following from their findings that 30% of targeted businesses had a liability; his views on the implications of this high percentage for the self assessment system; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the objectives of their random audit programme are to measure and track compliance with tax legislation, validate Revenue&rsquo;s risk analysis approach and ensure that all taxpayers run the risk of being audited. </P>
        <P>Revenue further advise me that of 379 random audit cases finalised from their 2005 programme, <Col N="243"/>277 cases or 73% have had no liability and over 80% yielded either nothing or less than &euro;2000 in additional yield.  It is instructive to compare the outcome to date of the 2005 random programme with that of the targeted programme. The average yield from all Random audits completed to date as part of the 2005 programme at &euro;3,437 is less than 10% of the average yield from all targeted audits at &euro;36,933.  Revenue advise me that a random audit programme will continue to be a feature of the overall Revenue audit programme in future years. However at this time they have no plans to increase the numbers of random audits beyond approximately 400 per annum. Internationally a sample of this size is regarded as an acceptable sample for the size of the population being measured and sufficient to validate Revenue&rsquo;s risk approach and to ensure that all taxpayers run the risk of being selected for audit.  It is also clear from comparisons of random and targeted audits that there is an opportunity cost associated with random work which Revenue must take into account.</P>
        <P>While the random audit programme is important therefore, its significance should not be overplayed and it would almost certainly be premature and unsafe to draw conclusions on foot of the results from one year&rsquo;s random programme. Revenue are not prepared to do this.  The main focus of Revenue will continue to be on selecting cases for audit based on the presence of various risk indicators and other information available. This is the type of targeted audit that gets best results and that is most likely to change the behaviour of the taxpayer into the future.  The targeted approach is now greatly enhanced by the new computerised Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling System (REAP) recently developed by Revenue. This system, which categorises taxpayers in accordance with defined risk criteria, has been successfully piloted over the last two years and has been introduced nationwide during 2006. The system allows for the screening of all tax returns against sectoral and business norms and provides a selection basis for check or audits. This effectively means that 100% of self-assessed taxpayers will be risk assessed at least once a year. This approach allows valuable audit resources to be assigned to tackling those cases featuring in the higher end of risk ranking and analysis of the 2005 random results to date shows that there is strong evidence to suggest that this risk-based approach is the correct one.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply. This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT. </P>
        <P>The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group (ICTRG) appears to accepts that charities can not be granted VAT refunds through the tax system. However, they are still seeking the introduction of a grant or subsidy in lieu of the VAT charities pay on their business inputs and estimate that this would cost &euro;18 million per annum.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the 140 bodies represented by the ICTRG already acknowledge that they receive &euro;8.6 million in funding either directly or indirectly from the Exchequer. However, there are currently 7,000 charities registered with the Revenue Commissioners. It is therefore likely that the introduction of a scheme along the lines proposed by the ICTRG would cost the Exchequer significantly more than the &euro;18 million they have estimated.  The ICTRG will argue that they represent the largest charities but that is not the case as many educational and sporting organisations are also registered with the Revenue Commissioners as charitable or not-for-profit organisations.  Therefore, the introduction of grant in lieu of VAT paid by registered charities would undoubtedly lead to other exempt bodies such as schools, hospitals and sporting, many of which are already registered as charities, seeking to benefit from such a system of refunds.  These exempt bodies are already receiving considerable Exchequer funding.</P>
        <P>Charities are exempt from Income Tax, DIRT, Stamp duty, Capital taxes and donations to chari<Col N="245"/>ties are tax relieved. These are of substantial benefit to charities already.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no State savings guarantee for savers with Irish credit institutions generally.  There is, however, a deposit protection scheme funded by credit institutions (other than credit unions) which are authorised by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  The Deputy should note that a key principle underlying the operation of the deposit protection scheme is that the full cost of financing the scheme must be borne by the participating credit institutions. </P>
        <P>The level of contribution required from each credit institution is 0.2% of deposits held at all branches of the credit institution in the EEA, including deposits on current accounts and share accounts with a building society (but excluding certain other specified deposits).  Contributions are maintained in a Deposit Protection Account at the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  The European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Schemes) Regulations, 1995 set out the terms and conditions governing deposit protection in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In the case of credit unions the Irish League of Credit Unions operates a separate Savings Protection Scheme (SPS). The SPS aims to protect individual savings of members by making sure that the credit unions are financially and administratively sound and by providing remedial help to any participating credit union which shows signs of weakness in these areas.  Savings of individual credit union members are also protected.  The operation of the credit union SPS is consistent with the specific regulatory approach adopted for credit unions under the Credit Union Act, 1997 which is differentiated from that applying to mainstream commercial financial institutions on account of the unique ethos and philosophy of the credit union movement.  In this context, the 32 county all-island basis of the current SPS is valuable and one that is important to maintain. In May 2006 the Financial Regulator agreed to examine proposals for the reform of the existing SPS for credit unions.</P>

	<P>The main consumption related taxes are VAT and Excise duty. Taken together these two tax-heads were forecast to account for &euro;18.6 billion or 45 per cent of total tax revenues in 2006, a very significant proportion of total tax revenues.  Construction impacts on a number of tax-heads, most notably capital taxes such as Stamp duty and Capital gains tax but also VAT and to a lesser extent Income tax, PRSI receipts and Corporation tax. </P>
        <P>While revenues from construction related taxes such as Stamp duty and Capital gains tax have made an increasing contribution to the Exchequer in recent years, we are not overly reliant on receipts from these sources.  For example, taken together the Stamp duty and Capital Gains tax tax-heads were forecast to contribute just 11 per cent of total targeted tax revenues in 2006.  In contrast the 4 main tax-heads &mdash; VAT, Income tax, Corporation tax and Excise were forecast to account for just over 87 per cent of tax receipts this year.</P>
        <P>Care has been taken not to plan the public finances around an assumption that receipts from Stamp duty and Capital gains tax will continue to grow in future years as they have in the recent past.  This is a prudent and sensible approach to take.</P>

	<P>Credit card companies that fall within the definition of &lsquo;credit institutions&rsquo; for the purposes of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, must notify the Financial Regulator of any proposal to introduce or increase charges for services as defined in Section 149 of the Act.  This encompasses any penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears on a credit agreement or a loan, including penalty fees charged to consumers by credit card companies as referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  In considering each charging proposal, the Financial Regulator assesses it against the criteria set down in the Act and either approves the charge at the notified level, approves it at a lower level or rejects the proposal.  The criteria set out in the Act are: the promotion of fair competition; the statement of commercial justification; a credit institution passing any costs on to its customers; and the effect on customers of any proposal to impose or change any charge in relation to the provision of such service. </P>

	<P>In 2002, Exchequer tax receipts amounted to &euro;29,294 million. Receipts in 2006 in the October Pre-Budget Outlook were estimated at &euro;43,850 million.  This translates into an absolute increase of just over &euro;14.5 billion or a percentage increase of 49.7 per cent since 2002. </P>
        <P>A large part of the increases in taxes in recent years came from the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s special investigations and also the continued strength of the property market over the period.  However, the main reason we are receiving more in tax is the significant growth in the economy over the period.  The tax and economic policies being pursued by this Government have put more money into the pockets of taxpayers and they are spending and investing that extra money as they see fit.  This extra spending and investment yields extra taxes.  I am more than satisfied with the policies that have facilitated this increased economic activity.</P>

	<P>The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Under the Sixth VAT Directive Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services, which have been in place since 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to other goods and services. </P>
        <P>It is therefore not possible under EU law to apply a zero VAT rate to the provision of road safety products.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are conducting their investigation into the use by taxpayers of life assurance investment products for the purposes of tax evasion in two stages. In the first stage of these enquiries taxpayers who invested undisclosed and undeclared funds in life assurance investment products were given an opportunity to make a voluntary disclosure.  About 5,000 taxpayers made payments of around &euro;400 million in the course of the disclosure scheme. </P>
        <P>The second stage of this investigation relates to the identification and pursuit of taxpayers who should have availed of the voluntary disclosure scheme but who opted not to.  This stage commenced on 23 May 2005, the closing date for taxpayers to advise Revenue that they intended to make voluntary disclosures in the first stage of the enquiries.  New powers were provided in the Finance Act 2005 to authorise Revenue officers to examine the records that relate to a class or classes of life assurance policies and policyholders in the course of conducting sampling exercises.  Revenue has completed its on-site sampling work in all of the relevant Life Assurance companies.</P>
        <P>The information gathered in this process and from the voluntary disclosures has been used to ground applications to the High Court for orders directing Life Assurance companies to provide information to Revenue that will facilitate the identification of the taxpayers who ought to be included in the follow-up enquiry programme.  To date 11 High Court orders have been applied for and made.  It is envisaged that the information that is sought in these orders will be delivered to <Col N="250"/>Revenue by the end of November of this year.  It is expected that the follow-up enquiry programme will commence in the first half of 2007.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the work of the Mortgage Expert Group which is investigating opportunities to integrate the EU mortgage market.  Because of the scale of this market, at &euro;4.7 trillion, and the expectation that the sector is set for significant growth, the removal of barriers which cause fragmentation should lead to improved competition, efficiency and consumer choice, and of course cheaper mortgages.  I acknowledge, however, that there are important obstacles to be overcome, particularly in relation to the differences in the laws of Member States and lack of knowledge of other markets on the part of both the lender and the borrower.  This has led to low levels of confidence in conducting cross border mortgage business.  I would agree with the view expressed by Commissioner McCreevy last week that any change in this area will be incremental.  It is also true that, because of the size of the EU market, quite small percentage increases in cross border mortgage lending could amount to a significant increase in mortgage business in national terms.  Furthermore, given the variety of practices in the Member States, a principles based approach to harmonising mortgage credit across the EU may be appropriate, so that existing efficient and competitive individual markets within the EU are not disadvantaged as a result of the integration proposal.</P>
        <P>The complexity of the mortgage integration issue has been recognised by the Commission in the manner in which it is engaging with the process, through consultation and dialogue, and the publication of its Green Paper.  In addition, the findings of the Funding Expert Group set up by the Commission addresses an area where competitive and economic success may be achieved, (i.e. in the secondary mortgage market through the use of pan-European funding).  The standardisation of the mortgage deed, forced sales procedures, valuation and taxation systems are among the many other issues which remain to be addressed.  In addition, I share the view that non-legislative options for the integration of the mortgage credit market should be thoroughly examined prior to any regulatory intervention. Legislative intervention to prescribe rules should be used only as a final option to address proven market failure.  The Commission&rsquo;s White Paper, due to be issued in the coming months, will outline the next steps and will recommend areas to which the mortgage integration proposal should be directed, and I look forward to its publication.</P>

	<P>An inter-agency procurement group, chaired by my Department, was established in late 2004 and began working in 2005 to determine how best to procure digital radio for the Irish public service, and most particularly the emergency and security services.  The group spent the first part of 2005 considering a range of options, including the possibility of the public service building a digital radio network itself, or owning a digital radio network and getting a third-party company to operate and maintain it, or procuring digital radio as a service from a third-party with the expertise to build, operate and maintain it.  The Group was particularly mindful of the complexities involved in a national provision of digital radio and the need to address a range of matters including security, national operation, high quality coverage, interoperability between public bodies, integration with existing environments, reasonable roll-out times, and affordability.  Following extensive analysis of these options, the Group decided that the best value for money approach was to procure the provision of digital radio services from a third-party rather than a State-owned or managed infrastructure or a system based on any particular technology.  The Group also decided that it should do this procurement on a public service wide basis because the aggregation of demand and requirements would provide far greater market influence than if individual public bodies were to seek to do this on their own.</P>
        <P>The Group spent the second part of 2005 building its specification of requirements.  The first phase of the procurement procedure was conducted between January and April 2006 from which five candidates were shortlisted and provided with the full tender documentation.  Responses were received from four of these candidates and are being evaluated at present.  The Group is availing of assistance from the National Development Finance Agency in the evaluation of the financial aspects of the bids.  The Group has decided that, once the tender evaluation is completed, the preferred bidder will be required to undergo a &ldquo;service performance evaluation&rdquo; to ensure the appropriateness, performance and robustness of its proposal, before a contract can be awarded.  It is estimated that such a performance evaluation could take approximately six months to complete.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Taxation, as I have previously stated, can play a part in attaining environment objectives which include promoting energy efficiency and reducing emissions.  In this regard, the current National Climate Change Strategy does envisage initiatives in the tax area with one such example being tax reliefs for &ldquo;green initiatives&rdquo;.  Essentially this approach uses the tax system to provide incentives for certain behaviour.  Such incentives include capital allowances for corporate investment in renewable energy projects which have been available since 1998, and the significant new Biofuels excise relief scheme which I provided for in Finance Act 2006.  This latter Scheme will provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum; cost over &euro;200m over 5 years; result in carbon dioxide savings of over 250,000 tonnes per annum; meet a target of 2% transport fuel market penetration by biofuels by 2008; help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels, and stimulate activity in the agricultural sector.  As a complementary measure, I provided in Finance Act 2006 for a new 50% VRT relief to promote new flexible fuel vehicles (cars designed to operate on biofuels) for an initial period of 2 years, and also extended the existing VRT relief for hybrid cars by a further year to the end of 2007.</P>

        <Quest> the amount received to date by the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; Office in respect of deductions of tax at maturity on maturing SSIA accounts; the total anticipated take by the Exchequer when all SSIAs have matured; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax arising on maturing SSIA accounts, in respect of accounts maturing in May, June, July, August and September 2006, was &euro;99.3m.</P>
        <P>My Department currently expects that the total exit tax accruing to the Exchequer from the maturing of all SSIAs will be approximately &euro;400 million over the period 2006-2007. However, the exact value of the exit tax to be received is subject to a number of uncertainties. These include the possibility of accounts closing before maturity, participants varying their monthly contributions, the actual investment returns arising and the level of take-up of the Pension Incentive Tax Credit allowing the certain transfer of SSIA funds into pension products. This incentive gives qualifying account holders a 1 for 3 bonus on their subscriptions to a pension product, subject to a maximum <Col N="265"/>of &euro;2,500 and also a proportionate credit on the exit tax payable on the accrued investment return.</P>

        <Quest> if an estimate has been undertaken of the number of civil or public servants, who do not wish to relocate, who will be surplus to requirements as a result of their jobs being transferred to other locations under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme; the jobs that will be provided for these personnel; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[39247/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Because of the nature of the programme it is not possible at this stage to estimate the number of public servants who do not wish to relocate as individual circumstances are open to change and therefore figures can fluctuate. The picture will become clearer over the coming period as staff are assigned to decentralising organisations.</P>
        <P>The primary mechanism for placing civil servants who are in posts which are due to decentralise but wish to remain in Dublin is by way of bilateral transfer.  As staff, in organisations who are remaining in Dublin, who have applied to decentralise continue to be transferred into decentralising organisations, the posts they vacate become available to those wishing to remain in Dublin.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Public Appointments Service has commenced the operation of a system which will match Dublin based posts with people wishing to remain in Dublin.  Any decentralising organisation which anticipates that it will have staff wishing to remain in Dublin who cannot be placed within the organisation will engage with the Public Appointments Service in the placement of these individuals.  The precise operation of these arrangements is currently being discussed with the civil service unions to improve their overall effectiveness.  The aim is to achieve a close alignment between the assignment of staff to Dublin posts and the readiness of Departments to release staff at particular grade levels.</P><Col N="266"/>
        <P>Negotiations are ongoing with the unions representing professional &amp; technical staff in the Civil Service on this issue.</P>
        <P>The position in relation to the State Agencies is of course more complex.  The Government has always said that this is a voluntary Programme.  Any staff member wishing to remain in Dublin will be accommodated with a public service job in Dublin.  It remains my view that suitable arrangements meeting the needs of these staff of can be arrived at through dialogue and negotiations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent basic data on incomes available from which information of the type requested by the Deputy could be derived are in respect of the income tax year 2003.</P>
        <P>The information requested is set out in the following tables for the income tax years 2000/01, 2001 &ldquo;short&rdquo; year, 2002 and 2003. However, because of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; obligation to observe confidentiality in relation to the taxation affairs of individual taxpayers and small groups of taxpayers, the breakdown by income bands requested by the Deputy is not provided in relation to incomes exceeding &euro;1 million due to the small numbers of income earners with incomes in excess of that level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware that this material is dated in that major changes I made in my Budgets to the structure and extent of tax reliefs will increase the average tax rate for those on higher incomes using such reliefs. Caution should be used in basing policy pronouncements on these data.</P><Col N="265"/>

<P><i>*Notes to Tables</i></P>
        <P>The 2001 short income tax year was a short transitional tax &ldquo;year&rdquo; running from 6 April to <Col N="284"/>31 December 2001 which preceded the first full calendar tax year 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2002. It should be noted that as PAYE taxpayers <Col N="285"/>were charged to tax on their earnings in the period from 6 April to 31 December 2001 and self-employed taxpayers were assessed to tax for the short &ldquo;year&rdquo; on 74% of the profits earned in a 12 month accounting period, the income figures will not be directly comparable with those of earlier or later years.</P>
        <P>A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit. Married couples and individuals with income chargeable to tax under both Schedule E and Schedule D have been classified in the attached tables by reference to the Schedule under which the larger amount of income is taxable.</P>
        <P>The designation of a tax rate to an income earner in the tables is based on identifying the top tax rate applying to the taxable income of each earner. To arrive at the figure for taxable income, the gross income is reduced by various relevant deductions and allowances such as capital allowances, losses, allowable expenses and retirement annuities. In some cases, these will reduce the taxable income to nil.</P>
        <P>Caution is required in comparing between years because data for 2002 and 2003 take account of DIRT paid by taxpayers, whereas the figures for 2000/2001 and the short tax &ldquo;year&rdquo; 2001 do not do so. To identify and associate the DIRT paid figures at taxpayer level for the two earlier years could not be achieved without conducting a protracted examination of the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s records and amending supporting computer software.</P>
        <P>The information on incomes is based on income returns on Revenue records at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes, representing about 95 per cent of all returns expected.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Eamon Ryan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the Danish Government making provision for the repayment of VAT paid on expenditure of charitable bodies; and the way such a provision sits with the position of the Irish Government that such a measure cannot be undertaken due to European Union regulations. </Quest>
        <QRef>[39081/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply. This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.</P><Col N="286"/>
        <P>The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group (ICTRG) appears to accepts that charities can not be granted VAT refunds through the tax system. However, they are still seeking the introduction of a grant or subsidy in lieu of the VAT charities pay on their business inputs and estimate that this would cost &euro;18 million per annum. In this regard, I am aware that the Danish equivalent to the ICTRG has made proposals to the Danish Finance Ministry. I understand, however, that as yet no scheme has been introduced.</P>
        <P>I would add that the 140 bodies represented by the ICTRG already acknowledge that they receive &euro;8.6 million in funding either directly or indirectly from the Exchequer. However, there are currently 7,000 charities registered with the Revenue Commissioners. It is therefore likely that the introduction of a scheme along the lines proposed by the ICTRG would cost the Exchequer significantly more than the &euro;18 million they have estimated. The ICTRG will argue that they represent the largest charities but that is not the case as many educational and sporting organisations are also registered with the Revenue Commissioners as charitable or not-for-profit organisations. Therefore, the introduction of grant in lieu of VAT paid by registered charities would undoubtedly lead to other exempt bodies such as schools, hospitals and sporting, many of which are already registered as charities, seeking to benefit from such a system of refunds. These exempt bodies are already receiving considerable Exchequer funding.</P>
        <P>Charities are exempt from Income Tax, DIRT, Stamp duty, Capital taxes and donations to charities are tax relieved. These are of substantial benefit to charities already.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the recent study from the Combat Poverty Agency which shows that the increasing levels of indirect taxation is having a disproportionate effect on those on lower incomes; the efforts he is making to ensure that those on low incomes receive sufficient supports to deflect the impact of these <Col N="287"/>indirect taxes; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject entirely the assertion that the indirect tax system has a disproportionate effect on those on lower incomes. A simple look at the facts will show that the conclusions in the report are misdirected.</P>
        <P>Firstly, there is no VAT on the main low income items such as food, oral medicines, childrens&rsquo; shoes and clothing.</P>
        <P>Secondly, most excise revenue (60%) comes from excises on petrol, diesel and cars. These are <Col N="288"/>not items that low income groups spend most on. As for the remaining 40% of excise revenue, this comes from duties on tobacco and alcohol where there are solid health grounds for using the tax system to discourage consumption.</P>
        <P>Thirdly, there are special reliefs in the VAT and Excise system for medical and other equipment for the disabled. There is no VAT on public transport and diesel used in buses and trains is subject to reduced rates of excise. Most public services are not liable to VAT.</P>
        <P>Furthermore it is simply wrong to claim that we are relying more on indirect taxation now than in the past as the following table will show.</P><Col N="287"/>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with the view that the VAT system is inherently regressive. In fact, every effort is made, as far as EU law will permit, to reduce the incidence of VAT on low incomes.</P>
        <P>The position is that VAT rates are applied in accordance with the rules and rating structures provided for under the Sixth VAT Directive. It is EU law, agreed by all Member States, that defines the scope for applying a rate to a good or service. In this regard, Ireland, apart from the farmers&rsquo; flat rate VAT addition, operates three rates of VAT.</P>
        <P LI="1">1. Zero-rate which generally applies to most food, children&rsquo;s clothes and shoes, and oral medicines. While it is possible to retain the zero rating for goods and services that were in place on 1 January 1991, no new zero VAT rates can be introduced.</P>
       <P LI="1">2. Reduced rate of 13.5 per cent which applies, for example, to hot food, cinemas and certain live animals and plants. Member States may have up to two reduced VAT rates of not less than 5 per cent for a specified number of goods or services which are set out in Annex H of the EU Sixth VAT Directive.</P>
 <?oasys _cl11- ?>
     <P LI="1">3. Furthermore, Member States have the option of maintaining, at a reduced rate of not <Col N="289"/>less than 12 per cent, any items not listed in Annex H, provided they carried that reduced rate on 1 January 1991. These items are considered to be &lsquo;parked&rsquo; and Ireland&rsquo;s parked rate equates to our reduced rate of 13.5%. Domestic fuels and labour intensive services are examples of parked items.</P>
        <P LI="1">4. Standard rate of 21 per cent for goods or services which are not zero rated or reduced rated. Examples would include: cars, electrical equipment, motor fuels and CD/DVDs. Under the Sixth VAT Directive Member States may set the standard VAT rate not lower than 15% &mdash; there is political agreement that the standard rate of VAT applying in each Member State does not exceed 25%.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Certain services provided by charities and the financial services sector are VAT exempt. Operators in these sectors do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot claim VAT on the goods and services they purchase. In general, Government Departments and local authorities are also exempt. This means that most public services are not liable to VAT.</P>
        <P>The question of using the VAT system to bring about pro-energy-efficiency measures can only be addressed in line with EU law. Supplies of fuel and energy used for heat or light are subject to the parked VAT rate of 13.5% under Article 28 (2e) of the Sixth VAT Directive.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to reduce to any real extent the VAT rate applicable to fuel and energy used for heat or light (e.g. wood pellets). The reduction would only be from 13.5% to 12% with little or no impact on the price of fuel.</P>
        <P>In relation to the supply only of the equipment required for energy generation, which would include geothermal and solar energy systems, this is liable to VAT at 21 per cent.  However, where the systems are supplied and installed as a single contract, the total charge may be liable to VAT at 13.5 per cent subject to the &lsquo;two-thirds rule&rsquo;.  If the VAT-exclusive cost of the goods to the supplier exceeds two-thirds of the total VAT-exclusive charge to the customer in respect of the supply and installation of the goods, then the entire contract is treated as the supply of goods liable to VAT at 21 per cent. However, it is likely that the latter would only apply in a small minority of cases.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that where the VAT content of fuel or equipment purchases is a business input, these are treated as a deductible credit for business.</P>
        <P>In regard to undertaking a review of the scope for introducing new anti-regressive and pro-energy-efficiency measures, I don&rsquo;t believe that a special review is necessary. Such considerations are continually kept in mind in the context of developing taxation policy, in so far as this is possible under EU law and especially in the annual budgetary process.</P>

	<P>Regulatory inspections are the responsibility of the Registrar of Credit Unions under the Credit Union Act, 1997.</P>
        <P>My Department has been advised that arising out of governance difficulties in the credit union in question and the failure of the board to resolve these difficulties through an arbitration process initiated by the Registrar, authorised officers from an outside specialist firm were appointed under the relevant provisions of the Credit Union Act 1997. The report of the authorised officers was received by the Registrar in August and the matters contained therein are under continuing review by him.</P>

        <Quest> the way in which income tax policies since 1997 have benefited the least well off in society here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[39069/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The position is that since 1997, the income tax policies pursued by this Government have resulted in more low-paid earners being outside the tax net than ever before.  There are now over 776,000 income earners (about 36% of all earners) who are completely out of the tax net compared with about 380,000 (about 25% of all earners) ten years ago.  In 1997 there was not even a statutory minimum wage in existence but this Government put one in place in April 2000.   We also replaced tax allowances with tax credits which are fairer to those on low pay because the credits have the same value to all taxpayers.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the position today is that the minimum wage in its annualised form is entirely free of tax.  This is due to the fact that we have substantially increased the aggregate value of the employee and basic personal tax credits.  In addition, in Budget 2006 the PRSI weekly threshold was raised to &euro;300.   It is now the case, therefore, that a person on the minimum wage keeps 100 per cent of what he or she earns. I understand that, of those countries in the European Union which have a minimum wage, Ireland is the only country where this is the case.</P>
        <P>Besides the increases in the value of the tax credits, we have reduced the standard and higher rates of tax by six percentage points each and widened the standard rate bands considerably.  Taken together, the positive changes to credits, rates and bands have meant that since 1997 average tax rates have fallen for all categories of taxpayer, including those on lower incomes. The position now is that four fifths of income earners pay no more than one fifth of their income in income tax.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy may wish to note that taking account of tax, PRSI and the health levy, the average tax rate for a married one-earner couple with two children on 67% of the average industrial wage in Ireland is now 2.8% as compared with 7.8% in 1997.</P>
        <P>The average tax rate for a married one-earner couple with two children on the average industrial wage is now 7.7% as compared with 20.3% in 1997.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the single employee on the average industrial wage has also gained considerably.  In 2006, such a person will have seen their take-home pay rise by over &euro;12,300 since 1997 but their tax bill actually cut by almost &euro;500 as compared with 1997; not only has take-home pay <Col N="293"/>risen substantially, the actual amount of tax paid has fallen.</P>
        <P>Besides the tax changes, we have increased the health levy threshold so as to ensure that lower earners are not subject to it.  In fact, since 1994, the health levy threshold has increased by almost a quarter. It now stands at &euro;440 per week and &euro;22,880 per annum in 2006.</P>
        <P>In line with the commitment in the current Government Programme, we have prioritised available resources towards elderly persons as well as those on low pay.  In the last five years, the age exemption limits, under which those aged 65 or over are exempt from tax up to specified limits, have increased by over 57% whereas inflation for the same period is expected to increase by about 17%. Indeed, these limits have almost trebled since this Government came into office in 1997.  For 2006, the limits stand at &euro;17,000 for the single person and &euro;34,000 where at least one spouse in a married couple is aged 65 or over.</P>
        <P>The tax, PRSI and levies changes which this Government has introduced since 1997 have resulted in a position where, in international terms, for the single worker on average earnings, Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the EU.  This has been the case in each of the six years 2000 to 2005.  We also have one of the lowest tax wedges in the entire OECD.</P>
        <P>For a married one-earner couple with two children on average earnings, Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the entire OECD.  In addition, when cash transfers from the State are taken into account, such couples face a negative burden in Ireland because they receive more in the cash transfers than they pay out in tax and social security contributions.  Ireland is the only OECD country where this is the case.</P>
        <P>Finally, may I point out that in its commentary on the Budgets of the last three years, the ESRI expressed the view that these were progressive <Col N="294"/>in nature, favouring those on lower incomes to a greater extent than those higher up the income range.</P>

	<P>The Government recognises the need to provide support to working parents after the birth or adoption of a child, and has already made a number of significant improvements to our legislation to ensure this.</P>
        <P>The latest National Agreement &mdash; Towards 2016 &mdash; includes a commitment to continue to enhance maternity leave entitlements, in line with the measures announced in Budget 2006, aimed at helping children and their families to experience the qualities of family life, particularly in the important first year of life of the child. This will involve extending the period of paid maternity leave to 6 months by March 2007 and the unpaid maternity leave entitlement to 16 weeks. Together with the existing 14 weeks parental leave, parents&rsquo; entitlement to paid and unpaid leave will be increased to a total period of 56 weeks (or 70 weeks if the father&rsquo;s parental leave entitlement is also included). The level of provision of maternity/paternity leave will be reviewed again before end 2008.</P>
        <P>Comparisons between the Member States are difficult in that one needs to see maternity rights in the context of the overall package of parenting entitlements available in Member States. In some countries, there is a fine line between maternity and parental leave, and that part of the leave classified as parental leave may in fact be maternity leave.</P>

	<P>The information conveyed to me by the Garda Authorities relates solely to this jurisdiction and I am informed that seventeen individuals have been prosecuted in the past five years for money-laundering offences.  In addition, a number of &lsquo;money-laundering&rsquo; schemes have been uncovered during Garda investigations into serious and organised criminal groupings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Money Laundering Investigation Unit (MLIU) at the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation has primary responsibility for the investigation of money laundering offences in this jurisdiction, while the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) is charged with depriving criminals and their networks of assets derived from criminal activity.

        <P>As money laundering is a transnational crime which does not respect any borders, international co-operation is a key strategy to combat this type of crime.

        <P>I understand that local Garda management is satisfied that adequate resources, both in relation to technology and personnel, are currently available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate this type of criminality.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that approximately &euro;13 million in respect of payment cards was lost to the financial institutions in 2005.  Of this, &euro;4 million related to Automated Teller Machines (ATMs).  Up to 2002, this type of fraud had been increasing by approximately thirty per cent annually but there have been slight decreases since then.  It is anticipated that the total loss to the industry will be in the region of &euro;14.5 million for 2006.   In relation to ATM fraud specifically, there has been a dramatic decrease in 2006 with a drop of sixty five per cent on the previous year.  I understand that this substantial decrease is in part attributable to the arrest and conviction of a number of criminal gangs which had been operating in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>With regard to specific measures taken by the banking and finance sector to counteract payment card fraud, action has been taken by the Irish Payments Services Organisation (IPSO), the umbrella body for the Irish payments industry, to tackle this problem.  These actions include co-ordinating the Irish implementation of the Chip and Pin migration programme as part of a Europe-wide anti-fraud initiative.  The Deputy might like to note that it will no longer be possible  to by-pass chip and pin from March 2007.  IPSO actively promotes awareness of the problem through media appearances, educational initiatives and other channels.</P>
        <P>In addition to this, the Credit Card Forum (CFF), consisting of the senior fraud staff from each of the banks and financial institutions meets on a regular basis under the auspices of IPSO Card Services.  One of this group&rsquo;s prime responsibilities is to control the cost of plastic card crime by facilitating major anti-fraud initiatives and preparing for possible future crime trends that may affect the card industry.  This work is carried out with co-operation from national and international card schemes, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and retail and consumer groups.</P>
        <P>While every attempt is made to make the public aware of credit card fraud through the use of advertising campaigns, one ongoing aspect of the process of providing information is a very useful website run under the auspices of IPSO Card Services.  The <i>www.safecard.ie</i> website provides advice and information to cardholders and retailers who are looking to reduce or prevent <Col N="300"/>card fraud in their places of business. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to monitor trends to ensure that law enforcement activities are in place to tackle crimes of this type.</P>

	<P>The position is that sections 2(7) and 2(8) of the Data Protection Act 1988 (as amended by section 3 of the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003) contain provisions directly related to direct marketing. Section 2(7) provides that where personal data are kept for the purpose of direct marketing, any individual may request the data controller (the person who controls the content and use of that data) in writing not to process personal data relating to him or her for that purpose or to cease such processing.  The data controller must comply with such a request within 40 days and notify the individual in writing accordingly.</P>
        <P>Under section 2(8), where a data controller anticipates that personal data (including personal data that is required by law to be made available to the public) kept by him or her will be processed for the purposes of direct marketing, the data controller is required to inform the individuals to whom the data relate that they may object in writing to the data controller, and free of any charge, to such processing.</P>
        <P>These provisions are intended to raise awareness of the right, and give individuals the opportunity, to opt out of receiving direct marketing if they so wish. In line with these provisions, the Irish Direct Marketing Association (IDMA) operates a Mailing Preference Service which enables individuals who do not wish to receive direct mail from IDMA members to register their details with IDMA.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 to 177, inclusive, together.  </P>
        <P>As outlined in my replies to Parliamentary Question No.&rsquo;s 205 and 208 of 14th November, there are plans under the Garda Building Programme to build smaller standard stations at Kilconnell, Athleague, Ballyforan, Cootehall and Drumshambo stations.</P>
        <P>Projects are progressed under the various Garda Building Programmes on the basis of agreed priorities. This is achieved by consensus and with the cooperation and commitment of all concerned &mdash; the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda authorities and Representative Associations and the Office of Public Works from whose Vote the capital works for Garda properties are funded.  Progress in each case is dependent on a number of factors including the priorities as determined by Garda Headquarters taking into account the merits of the case made by local Garda Management and associated reports supplied by the Office of Public Works. In some instances, the commencement of a project may first be dependent on the successful acquisition of a suitable site for the proposed development.  Accordingly, it is not possible to say at this point in time, when works will commence at these locations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that details of the activities of the Criminal Assets Bureau are contained in the Annual Reports of the Criminal Assets Bureau since its establishment in 1996. These reports are quite comprehensive and include details of the number of cases commenced, money frozen under the Proceeds of Crime Acts and details of money collected by the Bureau under the provisions of Revenue and Social Welfare legislation. Copies of the Annual Reports are available from the Oireachtas library.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since its statutory inception in October 1996 and up to 31 December 2005, the Bureau has obtained interim and &ldquo;final&rdquo; restraint orders to the value of over &euro;58 million and &euro;25 million respectively.  In the same period, taxes and interest demanded was almost &euro;87 million, with almost &euro;89 million collected.  Regarding social welfare payments, savings amounted to almost &euro;2 million and recovery of overpayments amounted to almost &euro;1 million. The following tables provide details of the amounts of money seized for the years in question under orders made under sections 2, 3, 4 and 4a of the Proceeds of Crime legislation 1996 to 2005.</P>
        <P>The first applications for &ldquo;Disposal Orders&rdquo; under Section 4 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 at the end of the statutory seven year period from the making of the first Section 3 Orders in <Col N="303"/>1997 came before the Courts in 2004. In 2004 the first two Section 4 applications were concluded and two sums totalling over &euro;275,000 were sent to the Minister of Finance for the benefit of the Central Fund, following directions made in that regard by the High Court.</P>
        <P>Disposal Orders under Section 4 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and Section 4A of the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005 realised &euro;2.02 million in 2005. It should be noted <Col N="304"/>that some of the figures quoted under Section 2 and 3 of the Proceeds of Crime Acts relate to real property, the value of which may have increased significantly since the making of the freezing order. All funds collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau are forwarded either directly, or through the Revenue Commissioners / Department of Social and Family Affairs, to the Central Exchequer Fund under the remit of the Department of Finance and are allocated accordingly as approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann through the normal Estimates process.</P><Col N="303"/>

        <P>I have been informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that table 1 below shows the number and estimated value of seizures of heroin in the Garda District of Coolock, which includes Coolock, Malahide and Swords Garda stations, for the years 2001 to 2005.  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the number of proceedings commenced and convictions recorded for drug offences in the Garda District of Coolock for the years 2001-2005 is as follows. The Swords area is contained in the Coolock Garda District.</P>
       <P LI="1">Year 2001 &mdash; 174 proceedings commenced, 103 convictions</P>
        <P LI="1">Year 2002 &mdash; 236 proceedings commenced, 90 convictions</P>
        <P LI="1">Year 2003 &mdash; 258 proceedings commenced, 116 convictions</P>
       <P LI="1">Year 2004 &mdash; 278 proceedings commenced, 98 convictions</P>
       <P LI="1">Year 2005 &mdash; 655 proceedings commenced, 163 convictions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The statistics provided include drug offences such as possession, supply, importation and cultivation.  Information relating to the number of arrests made for a specific type of drug is not readily available.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that it would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources to research each case manually in an attempt to identify the drug type involved in the drug offence recorded or arrest made.  Data in relation to the number of cocaine seizures in the Swords area over the period in question is not readily available within the timeframe for answering Parliamentary Questions. I will revert to you when this information is to hand.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the information sought by the Deputy refers to cases before the Courts under section 15A of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. According to figures made available to me from the Courts Service, during 2005  80 persons were convicted under section 15A of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 as inserted by section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  Of these 10 (or 12.5%) received a  sentence of 10 years or more as provided by section 27 of the 1977 Act. </P>
        <P>Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 inserted a new section 15A into the 1977 Act. It provides for an offence related to the possession of drugs with a value of &euro;13,000 or more for the purpose of sale or supply. Section 5 (amending section 27 of the 1977 Act) provides for a maximum penalty of life imprisonment as well as for a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years imprisonment for the offence under section 15A.</P>
        <P>According to section 5, a court should not apply the mandatory minimum sentence where it is satisfied there are exceptional and specific circumstances which would make it unjust in all the circumstances to impose the minimum sentence of 10 years. Factors to which the court may have regard include whether the person pleaded guilty, the stage at which such an intention was indicated and the circumstances surrounding the indication and whether the person materially assisted the investigation of the offence.</P>
        <P>In order to ensure that due regard is paid to the wishes of the Oireachtas that serious drug offences are severely punished, I have sought to strengthen these mandatory minimum provisions by way of the Criminal Justice Act 2006. Section 84 of the 2006 Act (which further amended section 27 of the 1977 Act) requires the court to take account of any previous convictions and also, whether the public interest in preventing drug trafficking is served by imposing a lesser sentence.</P>
        <P>In addition, the 2006 Act provides that the 10 year minimum sentence must be imposed where the person has a previous conviction for an offence under either section 15A or the new offence under section 15B (inserted by section 82 of the 2006 Act) of importation of drugs with a value of &euro;13,000 or more. I believe these amendments reflect the sentiments of the Oireachtas and are justified by the public interest in ensuring the strongest possible response to drug crime. The relevant provisions of the 2006 Act were commenced with effect from 1 August. It is too early at this stage to come to any conclusions as to their impact on sentencing for drug trafficking offences.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding the in-camera rule; the number of family law cases which have been heard since the new legislation was passed; the number that have been reported; the number of stenographers and reporters who have been appointed to cover the family court cases since the legislation was passed; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 40 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 provides for a relaxation of the in camera rule while continuing to respect the confidential nature of family law cases. The section also provides that nothing in a relevant enactment shall operate to prohibit the preparation of a report of proceedings in family law cases or the publication of the decision of the court in those proceedings.  The report may be prepared by a barrister at law or a solicitor or a person falling within a class of persons specified in regulations made by the Minister.  The section goes on to state that the identity of the parties to the case or any child to which the proceedings relate must not be disclosed.  The attendance of any person to report on a case must be in accordance with rules of court.</P>
        <P>On 1 July 2005, I made the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 (Section 40(3)) Regulations 2005 which specify the following classes of persons entitled to apply to attend family law proceedings for the purpose of publishing reports on the cases:</P>
<P LI="1">(a) family mediators who are accredited to the Mediators Institute Ireland, nominated by the Family Support Agency, and approved by the Minister,</P>
<P LI="1">(b) persons engaged in family law research who are nominated by a body specified in the Schedule to these Regulations and approved by the Minister,</P>
<P LI="1" Just="Left">(c) persons engaged by the Courts Service to prepare court reports of proceedings under relevant enactments.</P><Col N="311"/>
<?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P FLI="0">To date, I have approved one family mediator and several other persons engaged in family law research on the nomination of bodies specified in the Regulations and, in view of enquiries made to my Department, I expect to receive further nominations shortly. In addition the Courts Service has recently engaged a Family Court Recorder on a one year pilot basis. Appointment of stenographers is a matter for the Courts Service and the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 made no provision in this respect.</P>
        <P>Information on the operation of the Courts is contained in the Annual Reports of the Courts Service which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The Service may also provide other information on request.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 196 together.</P>
        <P>Section 37 of the Prisons Bill 2006 allows the Minister to provide for charges to be made to prisoners for goods or services that are not generally available to prisoners or are not available on an unlimited basis. This would include telephone calls, access to electronic devices, private medical treatment or escorts provided outside the prison for matters not related to their imprisonment. This section will provide a statutory basis for provisions in the Draft Prison Rules (a copy of which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.justice.ie</i>) which allow a Prison Governor to charge for the provision of certain services over and above the standard provision to all prisoners, such as use of the videolink, telephone calls and access to materials relating to current affairs (e.g. newspapers, magazines etc.).</P>
        <P>Access to many of these services are currently provided without charge and it is not intended to begin charging for all of these services. For example no charge is currently made for the making of a certain amount of phone calls. Prisoners are currently entitled to a daily phone call including calls to their legal advisor, and this will continue to be the position. Prisoners are provided <Col N="312"/>with access to Healthcare services on an equivalent basis to citizens in the general community who are covered by the GMS (Medical Card) service.  Section 37 of the Prisons Bill 2006 allows for the Prison Rules to provide,  where it is deemed necessary (on the basis of non-convicted status) to facilitate a prisoner with access to elective health care outside the public system,  that the prisoner will be responsible for the costs associated with facilitating such provision.  Provision of necessary healthcare to all prisoners on an equivalent basis to that provided under the public health system will continue to be funded by the State.</P>
        <P>In addition to the escorts costs that would arise in the facilitation of access to elective healthcare outside the public system, prisoners  are charged for escorts outside of their place of detention in relation to civil proceedings against third parties. It is not proposed to charge for  escorts where the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or an individual governor is listed as a defendant or co-defendant in such proceedings. It is also not proposed to charge prisoners for appointments relating to any matters before the Residential Institutions Redress Board.</P>

        <Quest> if he will introduce privatised prison escorts, as provided for under Part 2 of the Prisons Bill 2006; if so, the evidence that has emerged in favour of such a plan since 2002 when his Department&rsquo;s expert committee concluded that privatisation of prisoner escorts was not a viable option; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>While Part II of the Prisons Bill 2006 provides for an option to outsource prisoner escorts should it become necessary at some future date, I have no plans in the current circumstances to pursue that course. The Deputy will be aware that agreement was reached with the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association last year on a comprehensive Proposal for Organisational Change in the Irish Prison Service.  A key element of that Agreement involved the establishment of an in-house Prison Service Escort Corps.  In the intervening period, the Prison Service Escort Corps has been successfully established and is now operating very well and the efficiencies anticipated from its introduction are being realised.</P>

	<P>As part of the Project Management Structure for the Thornton Hall Development a sub committee of the Project Board was established to consider design issues.  As part of the design process a delegation from the committee looked at prison systems in other countries.  The terms of reference for this delegation was to inform the Thornton Hall Design committee of developments in penology, security and technological advances in other jurisdictions.  The visits were highly informative in the context of the development of the design concept for the new prison development at Thornton Hall. </P>
        <P>In this context, a number of Prison Service personnel visited SIEP, the Spanish agency with responsibilities for their prison building programme.  The visit also included a visit to a recently built prison. The members of the delegation were; Director of Prison Operations, Director of Regimes, Head of Estate Management, Prison Governor, Mountjoy Prison,Governor of Works, Building Services Division, Representative from Jacobs Engineering, Technical Adviser. Similar delegations visited prison institutions in the  UK, Norway, Denmark and USA.  A detailed technical report was prepared in respect of each prison visit and further visits outside the jurisdiction will be considered from time to time as appropriate.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 on Thursday, 16 November, 2006, following the attestation of 299 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>

This represents an increase of 18 (or 6.9%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.  Garda management state that every effort is made to fill vacancies that have arisen as a result of promotions/retirements during each allocation of newly promoted/attested Garda personnel.</P>
        <P>I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 on Thursday, 16 November, 2006, following the attestation of 299 <Col N="318"/>new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities, that there are currently two mountain bikes allocated to the Castlebar District of the Mayo Garda Division. Two members have been equipped and trained in the use of these bikes.  I am also informed that training has been arranged for a further three members, and that additional mountain bikes and equipment will be available for allocation before the end of 2006 with further bikes and equipment due to be delivered in 2007.</P>

	<P>The arrangements for the payment of Gaeltacht allowances are among the issues being examined at present by an Interdepartmental Group on the use and promotion of the Irish language in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This Group was established following the Government decision of 7 September, 2005 which approved changes in the eligibility criteria for <Col N="319"/>entry to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the requirements relating to the Irish language. The group consists of senior representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, my Department and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  I expect to receive the report of the Interdepartmental Group shortly, and I will carefully examine whatever recommendations are made.    </P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are tasked with enforcing road traffic legislation, and the Divisional Traffic Corps in Galway supplement local mobile units in this task.</P>
        <P>I am also informed that a system which focuses on collision prone zones was piloted in Galway West Division and has proved successful in encouraging a compliance culture by all road-users, curbing speeding not only by young drivers but by the general motoring population.  This system has also helped in identifying areas where fatal and serious injury traffic collisions occur frequently, and this has allowed local Garda management to assign additional Garda patrols to enforce road traffic legislation and speed limits with a particular focus on these identified areas.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that a number of road traffic initiatives and operations have also been put in place.  Mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints introduced following the enactment of the Road Traffic Act 2006 are being operated by Garda&iacute;, and extra Garda&iacute; are conducting additional checkpoints, particularly at those times which have been identified as most dangerous for road-users.  So called boy racers, the use of mobile phones while driving and heavy goods vehicles are being targeted at these checkpoints. In addition, the Garda campaign against drink driving and speeding on the roads will be intensified in the run-up to Christmas and the New Year period.</P>
        <P>At the national level, developments since the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing in July have been encouraging.  The number of road <Col N="320"/>deaths in August was 17 &mdash; the lowest number for any month since November 1999.  This trend continued in September, when the number of deaths was 23, compared with 31 in the same month in 2005, and in October, when the number of deaths was 32, compared with 44 in the same month in 2005.  Up to and including 17 November, there were 324 deaths in 2006, 21 less than for the same period last year.</P>
        <P>The current strength of the Garda Traffic Corps stands at 745, with an additional 60 members to be allocated during the remainder of 2006. The Corps is well on target to achieve its planned strength of 805 members at the end of 2006.  Further allocations to the Traffic Corps will continue until the planned strength of 1,200 is achieved.</P>

        <P>The Commissioners of Public Works carry out refurbishment projects at the behest of the Garda Authorities and the Department of Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform.

However, with regard to Strokestown Garda station, the Office of Public Works propose to undertake some minor works to the building in 2007.  These works are to include the provision of universal access features such as accessibility ramp, disabled persons toilets etc.; installation of new windows; and electrical re-wiring.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Discussions have concluded with the civil service unions on a <Col N="322"/>number of human resource and industrial relations matters, including staff transfer protocols, and in the main these are working well.  To date decentralising organisations have established a presence in 12 new locations and at the end of October 2006, over 2,300 staff have been assigned to decentralising posts.  These are currently in place or are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location, as soon as accommodation becomes available.</P>
        <P>In a limited number of cases the release of staff by Departments and Offices can be slower than is provided for under the staff transfer protocols. The release of staff is managed between the two Departments involved in the transfer and the release date is agreed so as to avoid disruption to the business operation of the Department from which the officer is departing.</P>
        <P>My Department monitors the situation on an ongoing basis and will continue to act in consultation with Departments and the staff unions to resolve cases where delays have arisen.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 50 of the Finance Act 2004 provided for the introduction of a limited scheme of relief from excise tax for biofuels.  Under the Scheme, full 100% excise relief was granted to successful applicants to the scheme from August 2005 for a total of 16 million litres of fuel at a cost of &euro;3m per annum over 2 years. </P>
        <P>The number of applications made for relief from excise duty under the pilot scheme clearly indicated the strong interest in developing a biofuels industry in Ireland and consequently I made a provision in the Finance Act 2006 for a significantly expanded 5 year scheme of Mineral Oil Tax relief. The scope of the relief extends to projects which are not just of a pilot nature. The scheme will provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum and cost over &euro;200m over 5 years.</P>
        <P>The Scheme was advertised by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in late July 2006. Over 100 applications were received  and the assessment panel has forwarded its recommendations to my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. It is expected that approval will be sought from me, shortly. The intention, as with the pilot scheme, will be that participants in the Scheme will receive full 100% excise relief. Full relief is regarded as necessary to make biofuels competitive from a price perspective.</P>

	<P>The PPP approach has the potential to offer value for money and timely delivery of infrastructure when applied to projects of the right scale, risk and operational profile.  There has been good progress on PPPs overall since the first group of pilot projects were announced in 1999 notwithstanding the challenges involved in adopting this relatively complex form of procurement.  The process is demanding up front: it involves identification of whole life costs of delivering the asset involved <Col N="324"/>and the negotiation of a contract which typically will be of 25 to 30 years duration. Under current guidelines issued by the Minister for Finance, the advice of the National Development Finance Agency must be sought for major projects and grouped projects with a capital cost in excess of the limit set by the Department of Finance (set at &euro;20 million initially and under review as of July 2006). After a decision has been taken to procure a project as a PPP, the lead time involved in reaching construction stage is typically 18 to 24 months. Overall delivery times have been impressive to date.   Also, projects procured by means of PPP can be subject to the factors that can cause delays on other capital projects, such as planning and legal challenges. </P>
        <P>A review of the PPP process was undertaken by my Department in 2005, in consultation with a range of stakeholders.  At that stage, deal flow <Col N="325"/>was established in the roads and environment areas but had been slower in the area of PPP projects funded by unitary payments from Departments&rsquo;/Agencies&rsquo; Votes. The need for skills and capacity to manage the procurement process in this area was identified. The Government therefore decided to establish a Centre of Expertise for PPP procurement in the National Development Finance Agency to undertake the procurement of PPP projects on behalf of Departments/Agencies in the Central Government area. The Centre of Expertise is to undertake the procurement after the setting of project budgets, output specifications and other service requirements &mdash; initially concentrating on projects brought forward by the justice, education and health areas.  There are now PPP projects at various stages of procurement in the area of PPPs funded by unitary payments from Votes.</P>
        <P>A list of projects of over &euro;20m which have reached the stage of the appointment of client advisers, as advised by members of the Interdepartmental Group on PPPs, is available on my Department&rsquo;s PPP website at: <i>www.ppp.gov.ie</i>.</P>

        <Quest> if the Revenue Commissioners have identified potential abuses of SSIA&rsquo;s where there may be breaches of the declaration of the participation on commencement of the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the SSIA scheme commenced in May 2001 and in excess of 1 million SSIA&rsquo;s were opened by the closing date of 30th April 2002. The scheme itself is administered by the financial institutions under the guidance of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>Comprehensive guidelines, setting out the manner in which the scheme must be administered, were drawn up by Revenue, in consultation with the financial institutions at the commencement of the scheme. This is supported by compliance visits undertaken by Revenue each year to the financial institutions to ensure the terms of the guidelines are being fully implemented. Ongoing guidance is being provided by means of SSIA Updates.  Apart from that the financial institutions are obliged to report to Revenue any case where it is suspected that the rules of the scheme are being breached.</P>
        <P>On commencement of the scheme, each account holder was obliged to sign a declaration confirming their eligibility to participate in the scheme and that they would abide by the terms of the scheme for its duration. These terms include:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />That the account holder was over 18 years of age and resident in the State.</P><Col N="326"/>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />They s/he would operate only one SSIA.</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Subscriptions could only be made from the individual&rsquo;s own or spouse&rsquo;s resources.</P>
     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Subscriptions must not be funded by borrowings or deferral of existing repayments.</P>
     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />That at least the minimum subscriptions be made in the first 12 months and that the maximum subscriptions levels be complied with for the duration of the scheme.</P>
     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Funds in an SSIA must not be used as security for a loan.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition, before an SSIA can be matured, the account holder has to sign a further declaration confirming compliance with the rules of the scheme, including those relating to residency, for its duration.</P>
        <P>Apart from cases reported by the financial institutions to Revenue in accordance with the requirement to do so, Revenue has extensive control systems in place to monitor the scheme and identify any potential abuses. Where an apparent breach of the rules is identified, Revenue fully investigates each case and takes appropriate action. I am advised by Revenue that, considering the number of accounts in operation, the number of actual abuses is very small and have been appropriately dealt with.</P>

	<P>The SSIA scheme opened on 1 May 2001 and entry to the scheme closed on 30 April 2002. A total of 1,170,208 SSIAs were opened during this period. 86,569 SSIAs were ceased in the period 30 April 2002 to 31 December 2005. These SSIAs were ceased either by the individual themselves or by Revenue for breaches of SSIA rules. The vast majority of SSIAs were ceased by individuals that no longer wished to partake in the scheme.</P>
        <P>The number of SSIAs that are scheduled to mature in the period May 2006 to April 2007 is 1,083,639. The total number of SSIAs that have matured to date is 285,584, which is approximately 26.4% of all SSIAs scheduled to mature.</P>
        <P>The maturing of SSIAs commenced on 31 May 2006 and the vast majority of SSIA holders are returning the SSIA maturity declaration on time. The compliance level is in excess of 99.5%. While it is not possible at this stage to quantify definitively the number of SSIAs that have failed to mature (as distinct from accounts that have been ceased by the account holders), information from the financial institutions that manage the scheme is that the numbers involved are extremely low.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the general position in relation to such projects under the rural renewal and other schemes is that qualifying expenditure may be incurred for tax relief purposes up to 31 December 2006 where a valid application for full planning permission in respect of the project was submitted to the relevant local authority by 31 December 2004. However, the Finance Act 2006 extended the deadline for tax relief purposes to 31 July 2008 where work to the value of at least 15% of the actual construction or refurbishment costs is carried out by 31 December 2006.  The Finance Act 2006 also provided for a gradual reduction in the amount of expenditure qualifying for tax relief after 31 December 2006. Thus, while expenditure incurred during 2006 can qualify for full relief without restriction, only 75% of expenditure incurred in 2007 and 50% of expenditure incurred in the period 1 January 2008 to 31 July 2008 can qualify for tax relief.  </P>
        <P>If the person referred to by the Deputy carries out work to the value of not less than 15% of the actual construction costs of the development in question by 31 December 2006, he can avail of the extended 31 July 2008 qualifying period for the purposes of section 23 relief, subject to the restriction mentioned in respect of expenditure incurred after 2006. It should be noted that this <Col N="328"/>&ldquo;15%&rdquo; test is based solely on the value of construction work actually carried out on a particular building or development. It takes no account of the cost of acquiring the site or of any costs associated with its acquisition. The value of work and costs associated with site preparation such as site clearance, laying foundations, power supply, drainage, sanitation and water supply can, however, be taken into account. If, on this basis, the value of the work carried out by 31 December 2006 by the person referred to by the Deputy amounts to at least 15% of the overall construction costs of the development, the person may avail of the extended deadline of 31 July 2008 for section 23 relief purposes. However, if the value of work carried out by 31 December 2006 is less that the 15% requirement, then relief will only be available in respect of whatever qualifying construction expenditure is incurred before that date. There is no provision for entitlement to relief beyond 31 December 2006 where the 15% requirements have not been met.</P>
        <P>I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their publication, Tax Briefing, issue 65 November 2006, contains an article that provides guidance on the operation of the &ldquo;15%&rdquo; test.  Tax Briefing is available on the Revenue website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i>, under &ldquo;Publications&rdquo;.</P>

        <P FLI="0">These figures allow for the fact that many income earners pay no tax at all; many pay tax at a standard rate but pay a much lower average rate because of the application of credits.  And for many taxpayers who are, strictly speaking, liable for tax at the higher rate on part of their income, the amount of their liability at the higher rate is fully offset by their tax credits.  In fact, tax credits fully offset the 42% liability in the case of all but about 20% of all income earners.  Effectively, therefore, many of the &ldquo;top rate&rdquo; taxpayers actually pay at an average rate of 20% or less.</P>

        <P>It should also be noted that the VAT content of purchases of gas and electricity is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The increase in the estimated amount of VAT received from gas and electricity arises in part from increases in fuel prices but also from the very strong growth in the economy over the period in question. Fuel prices, including those of gas and electricity, are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty, supply disruptions and strong economic growth in countries such as China.</P>

	<P>While the promotion of biofuels and other renewable energy is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I am pleased to inform the <Col N="333"/>Deputy that in Finance Act 2006 I provided for significant tax measures to promote biofuels in Ireland. The scheme of excise relief for biofuels will:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />cost over &euro;200m over 5 years;</P>
       <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />when fully operational, result in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> savings of over 250,000 tonnes per annum;</P>
     <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />meet a target of 2% transport fuel market penetration by biofuels by 2008;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels, and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />stimulate activity in the agricultural sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The level of excise relief available is that which had been proposed by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in advance of last year&rsquo;s Budget and is regarded as a figure which is sufficient to match Ireland&rsquo;s output potential in relation to renewable energy crops for motor fuels over the period of the scheme. Consequently, any extension in the level of relief that was announced last year is not envisaged at this stage.</P>
        <P>As regards other fiscal supports for the Biofuels industry, I would point out that also in Budget 2006, I introduced a 50% VRT relief for flexible fuel vehicles.  These are defined as cars or small vans produced so as to be capable of using a blend of ethanol and petrol containing a minimum of 85% ethanol. This should encourage the purchase of vehicles that have been manufactured with flexible fuel capabilities which will result in lower pollutant emissions than conventional vehicles fuelled exclusively by petrol/diesel.</P>

	<P>A special Interdepartmental Review Group reviewed the operation of the Disabled Drivers Scheme.  The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</P><Col N="334"/>
        <P>The Group&rsquo;s Report, published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.</P>
        <P>In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.</P>

	<P>Anti-Money Laundering procedures in Ireland and throughout the European Economic Area are governed by the 1st and 2nd Money Laundering Directives.   Those Directives were recently updated by the 3rd Money Laundering Directive which is required to be transposed into National Law by December 2007.  The main purpose of the 3rd Money Laundering Directive is to implement the most recent revisions of the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on prevention of money laundering, the main international anti money laundering organisation.  The FATF recommendations constitute the international standard for anti-money laundering procedures.</P>
        <P>The procedures for the prevention of money laundering in the financial system primarily involve the requirement on financial institutions (and other designated bodies) to identify their customers, to have adequate anti-money laundering procedures in place, including staff training, to keep records and to report suspicions of money laundering and terrorist financing offences to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to the Revenue Commissioners.  These procedures arise under the Money Laundering Provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.</P><Col N="335"/>
        <P>The Financial Regulator requires all institutions which it supervises to comply with the anti-money laundering legislation and relevant sectoral guidance notes, and to have in place the necessary procedures and controls to ensure such compliance. The adequacy of such systems is reviewed by the Financial Regulator in the course of its ongoing supervision of institutions and requirements for improvement are advised to institutions as necessary. Furthermore, in accordance with its legal obligation under Section 57(2) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, the Financial Regulator is obliged to make reports to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners where in the course of its supervision it suspects that an institution has breached the relevant money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners regularly receive reports from financial institutions and other designated bodies where they suspect that a money laundering offence is being or has been committed.  All such reports are investigated and progressed as appropriate by the relevant authorities.</P>
        <P>The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), the international standard setting body in this area recently published a report on Ireland&rsquo;s systems to combat money laundering and terrorist funding. Ireland is one of twelve countries evaluated to date in the FATF Third Round of Mutual Evaluations. Its overall ratings are comparable to those obtained by the other countries evaluated.</P>
        <P>Ireland opted to be evaluated early in the 3rd Round of Mutual Evaluations because this would be of considerable assistance in planning the transposition of the 3rd EU Money Laundering Directive into Irish Law. Many of the FATF recommendations on which Ireland is currently assessed as either partially compliant or non-compliant will be addressed in the transposition into Irish Law of the 3rd EU Money Laundering Directive.  These include additional measures in relation to customer due diligence, beneficial ownership, measures relating to the identification of foreign politically exposed persons, the strengthening of the sanctions for breaches of money laundering rules and the regulation of non-financial entities.</P>
        <P>On publication of the FATF report in March this year my colleague the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform and I jointly undertook to examine the Report&rsquo;s recommendations thoroughly and gave a commitment to further strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s anti-money laundering mechanisms.  The process of reviewing and updating the Irish legal framework to meet both our domestic needs and international obligations is already under way and it is expected that draft legislation will be put before the Oireachtas by <Col N="336"/>the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in early 2007.  The issues of money laundering and criminality generally are, of course, also regularly discussed at the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council of the EU.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Enhancing national competitiveness is a key priority for this Government.  The Government is keenly aware of the importance of Ireland&rsquo;s exporting sectors to investment and jobs &mdash; and in turn of the importance of competitiveness for these sectors. Competitiveness is influenced by many factors not just inflation. Exchange rates, moderate wage inflation, sustainable public spending growth, capital spending on infrastructure as well as inflation are all major determinants of competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Inflation, as measured by annual changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 3.9 per cent in October. However, a better measure of underlying inflation is the EU comparable measure of inflation, the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).  The HICP differs from the CPI in terms of coverage.  The most notable difference relates to the exclusion of mortgage interest repayments from the HICP. Annual HICP inflation in Ireland was 2.2 per cent in October.</P>
        <P>A large proportion of the rise in the annual inflation rate during the year has been due to external factors such as higher oil prices and recent rises in interest rates by the ECB. Given that the increase in our inflation rate is largely determined by external factors over which we have no control, we can seek to ensure that our domestic cost base does not add to it.  Annual services sector inflation is currently running at 7.8 per cent and this is a cause for concern.  This highlights the need for more competition in the economy as well as pay and profit restraint in all sectors in order to keep our cost base down.</P>
        <P>The Government is taking positive actions in areas that it can influence to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies. For example, we have not increased excise duties for the last two years, and we are promoting greater price competition by removing the Groceries Order. We have also agreed a reasonable wage deal in order to maintain and improve our international competitiveness. In addition we are investing in public infrastructure which will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services and keep inflation down in the process.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s economic and budgetary strategy is based on pursuing economic growth and full employment as the basis of continued prosperity and enhanced living standards for all.  In this regard maintaining and improving Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position is imperative in order to ensure Ireland continues to grow strongly and remains an attractive location for inward foreign direct investment.</P>
        <P>According to IDA Ireland, 2005 was another positive year with regard to new investment projects coming to Ireland. New business projects, involving a total investment over the coming years of more than &euro;760 million, were announced with 46 of these locating outside Dublin. 50 R&amp;D projects were supported involving a total investment in excess of &euro;275 million, a record in number and value and an 85% increase over 2004. Close to 40% of all new jobs in IDA-backed projects now pay in excess of &euro;37,000 per annum. Total employment in IDA supported companies has increased to 132,728. The number of new jobs created during the year was 12,623. This was offset by job losses of 9,211 giving a net gain of 3,412, the highest gain since the year 2000.</P>
        <P>We have no control over some of the factors influencing competitiveness, such as the exchange rate.  However, we must always seek to ensure that our domestic cost base does not undermine competitiveness.  In this context, it is important to maintain low inflation, pursue sensible incomes policy and keep public spending growth at sustainable levels in the medium term.  This will allow us to keep the burden of taxation low in order to protect competitiveness and maximise our economic potential. In terms of wage costs, the Government remains focused, through the partnership process, on securing a responsible approach to earnings growth in the economy.</P>
        <P>I am confident that Ireland remains well placed to maintain our position as an attractive location for overseas investors.  The taxation system has been reformed.  Our workforce is highly skilled.  Infrastructural development has been prioritised. These key policy orientations equip Ireland with the skills, infrastructure, facilities and overall operating environment that will allow us to compete effectively for projects at the upper end of the high skill/high wage spectrum, which is where our competitive advantage now lies.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the report referred to by the Deputy and welcome all contributions to the debate regarding the future development of the credit union movement. The Deputy should note, however, that many of the recommendations contained in the report are addressed to the credit union movement itself. My specific role as Minister for Finance is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions continues to be appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware the case for modernising the regulatory framework for credit unions has been raised by both the Registrar of Credit Unions and the representative bodies for credit unions, including the body referred to by the Deputy. It is important that there is a clear shared understanding on how a new regulatory framework would operate, before moving to develop particular proposals.  In this context, I wrote to the Chair of the Financial Regulator earlier this year recommending that the Financial Regulator engages with the credit union movement, in the first instance, to identify common ground in relation to a set of principles that could guide the development of an updated regulatory framework for credit unions. The Chair of the Financial Regulator has indicated the Authority&rsquo;s willingness to move forward on this basis.  The proposals in the report referred to by the Deputy represent an important input into the process, insofar as they relate to the modernisation of the regulation of credit unions.</P>
        <P>As far as the appropriate consumer protection framework for credit unions is concerned, the Financial Regulator has included an initiative in its recently published three-year Strategic Plan to consult credit unions on an appropriate consumer protection framework for its members, in respect of their core business, with the objective of commencing the consultation process in 2007.</P>
        <P>The question of establishing the structure referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question does not therefore arise at this time.</P>

	<P>Respite care is provided at a number of locations around the country. One of the purposes of respite care is to give carers a break, to allow them time for themselves, to have a holiday or to spend time with other family members. The person being cared for may be admitted to a Health Service Executive (public) nursing home for respite care and this is organised through the public health nurse or the G.P.</P>
        <P>An annual Respite Care Grant of &euro;1,200 is paid by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in June to all carers in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Constant Attendance Allowance or Prescribed Relative&rsquo;s Allowance. <Col N="342"/>Since June 2005 the grant was extended to all carers who are providing full-time care to an older person or a person with a disability regardless of the carers&rsquo; means.</P>

	<P>Whereas there is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; in practice, arrangements are already in place to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.

	<P>I was recently made aware that an issue has arisen around the availability of employment opportunities for recently qualified physiotherapists and I have asked the HSE to give the matter its urgent attention.</P>
        <P>Let me say at the outset that it is a matter for the Health Service Executive, as part of the management of its employment ceiling, to determine the appropriate staffing mix required to deliver its service plan priorities.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that there is not an over supply of physiotherapists in Ireland. The Bacon Report (&ldquo;Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists&rdquo;) March 2001 recommended an increase in physiotherapy training places, following which additional training places were provided.  There continues to be a growing demand for physiotherapy services and this is likely to continue as was highlighted in the Healthcare Skills Monitoring Report (F&Aacute;S, August 2005) and as evidenced by the number of development posts planned for the physiotherapy profession in the coming years.</P>
        <P>At present, there is a significant demand for senior physiotherapists but, less opportunities for newly qualified graduates.  I am advised that the HSE has recently advertised 81 Primary Care physiotherapy posts and there will be a further 62 development posts in physiotherapy, in areas such as services for persons with disability and older person&rsquo;s services.  The majority of these posts, which should be filled in the coming months, are at senior level, but their filling should provide employment opportunities for recent graduates through backfill. As the development posts are taken up by seniors, or more qualified basic grades currently in the system, a gap will be left for the recent physiotherapy graduates.</P>
        <P>My Department and the HSE are taking steps, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, to find <Col N="347"/>a satisfactory and sustainable resolution to this issue that will lead to greater employment opportunities for newly qualified graduates.</P>

	<P>Increased investment in mental health services has accelerated the move from institutionally provided <Col N="348"/>services to community-based services and has provided for increases in the number of Consultant Psychiatrists in the public health service.  The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, entitled &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;, was launched on 24 January 2006. This provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over the next 7 to 10 years.  In 2006, a sum of &euro;26.2 million has been allocated for the further development of our mental health services in line with &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;.  This includes funding of &euro;1.2 million to the National Office for Suicide Prevention for suicide prevention initiatives and research in accordance with &ldquo;Reach Out&rdquo;, the National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention.</P>
        <P>Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004 and funding for all health services has been provided as part of its overall vote.  Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have received representations concerning the transfer of radiation oncology services from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Rathgar to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin.  The decision to transfer this resource was taken by the Government in the context of its consideration of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology Services.  The decision is based on expert advice and is designed to ensure that radiation oncology, one element of cancer care, is integrated with all other aspects of care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.  I am convinced that this model will provide better patient centred treatment with improved quality of service and outcome for patients.  The Board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government&rsquo;s decision in relation to the development of radiation oncology.  A transfer on similar lines took place earlier this year in Northern Ireland when radiation oncology services transferred to Belfast City Hospital, a major academic teaching hospital.</P>
        <P>In progressing the transfer, I will build on the expertise and ethos of St. Luke&rsquo;s.  I have ensured that experts at St. Luke&rsquo;s are centrally involved in the planning and delivery of the National Plan.  The plan consists of large centres in Dublin (at Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals), Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.  Medical and scientific experts from the hospital are involved in developing the output specifications for the delivery of new radiation oncology services nationally.  The Chief Executive at St. Luke&rsquo;s will lead the management team of the new facility at St. James&rsquo;s.  I also appointed the Chairman of St. Luke&rsquo;s to chair a <Col N="351"/>National Radiation Oncology Oversight Group to advise me on progress on the implementation of the plan.</P>
        <P>The tender has recently been awarded for two additional and two replacement linear accelerators at St. Luke&rsquo;s to provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the national plan.  I expect these services to commence late next year.  I also recently announced the approval of two radiation oncology facilities at Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals, comprising of two linear accelerators and associated treatment planning at each site, to be delivered in early 2009.  These are key elements of the delivery of the National Plan.</P>
        <P>The expertise and professional commitment of the staff at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital will continue to be an essential element in the development of cancer care.</P>

Autism is a spectrum of disorders characterised by deficits in social skills, communication and behaviour.  Developmental surveillance is ongoing from infancy through school age or at any age if concerns are raised.  A number of developmental screening tools are available to this end.  Children failing routine developmental surveillance procedures are referred to medical staff for more detailed examination.</P>

Following a series of meetings and checking of documentation, the HSE provided this amount to the IOS on the 22nd of September 2006.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has informed my Department that the IOS have not formally applied for further funding but have indicated they wish to.  Representatives from the Population Health Directorate are scheduled to meet with the IOS on the 28th November to discuss funding.</P>

        <Quest> if the vaccine for the prevention of the human papilloma virus will be available to private patients; if it will be available on the medical card if patients request it; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The first vaccine for the prevention of human papilloma virus (HPV) has recently been licensed for use in Ireland and may be prescribed.  A decision about the availability of the vaccine to both public and private patients as part of a public vaccination programme is under consideration by my Department.</P>
        <P>The major public health benefit claimed for HPV vaccine is the prevention of cervical cancer.  Cervical cancer screening programmes have similar objectives.  We, like other jurisdictions, are undertaking an examination of the potential role of HPV vaccination, its possible inclusion in public vaccination programmes, and the relative contribution of both HPV vaccination and cervical screening programmes in the prevention and control of cervical cancer.  Issues to be examined include the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the vaccine for different age groups, for differing levels of screening provision and uptake, and the implications for the national screening programme.</P>
        <P>The National Immunisation Advisory Committee has been requested by the Department of Health and Children to advise on the potential public health benefit and appropriate use of HPV vaccine in the vaccination programme.  In the light of that advice, the soon to be established National Cancer Screening Service will be asked to address as a matter of urgency the roll-out of the cervical screening programme and advise on an integrated approach between the two approaches that reflects evidenced-based priorities.</P>
        <P>It is not intended to make the HPV vaccine available on the medical card.  While this product is licensed for use in Ireland and may be prescribed, preventive vaccines which are part of public vaccination programmes are routinely acquired by the HSE, and supplied for clinical administration on its behalf, through an established procurement process.  Effective vaccination programmes require education programmes, significant planning, clinical and administrative support, monitoring and evaluation and are not suitable to be carried out through the community drug schemes.  Therefore, as direct dispensing to patients through a contracted community pharmacy would not be an appropriate channel for distribution for a preventative vaccine, this product was refused approval for inclusion in the com<Col N="357"/>mon list of reimbursable products under the GMS and community drugs schemes.</P>

        <P>If a need arises for specific medical information that is not contained in the file, the relevant adoption agency will also attempt to locate and make contact with members of the child&rsquo;s natural family in order to obtain such information.

Before the publication of the Ferns Report I sought the advice of the Attorney General on the Report including the issue of the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s powers in relation to third party abuse raised in the Report and the advice was that the Executive had general powers under the Child Care Act 1991 in relation to third party abuse.</P>
        <P>In line with the recommendations, however, it was considered that the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office should undertake an in depth study of the HSE&rsquo;s powers in relation to third party abuse and this would be followed by legislative proposals as required.  Following further detailed discussions between the Office of the Minister for Children and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office on the question of conducting the in depth examination of these issues the Office of the Minister for Children and the Health Service Executive are examining in detail the various issues involved.  I expect that this process will be concluded in the near future and that the advice of the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office will be sought on the outcome of these deliberations as necessary and that subject to Government approval I will then publish legislative proposals as required following this.</P>

	<P>The Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction (CAHR) was established in March 2000.  Its terms of reference were:</P>
        <P LI="2">&lsquo;To prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area.&rsquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Commission conducted an intensive and analytical examination of Assisted Human Reproduction (AHR) issues, and its conclusions derive from this wide research. In its report published in May 2005, the Commission noted that in the case of all of the AHR specialist clinics in Ireland, the director was a consultant obstetrician/ gynaecologist on the register of Medical Practitioners of the Medical Council.  The Medical Council&rsquo;s Guide to Ethical Conduct and Behaviour, to which all registered medical practitioners are subject, provides inter alia that doctors are obliged to preserve life and to promote health.</P>
        <P>In addition, the European Communities (Quality and Safety of Human Tissues and Cells) Regulations (Statutory Instrument No. 158 of <Col N="362"/>2006) came into law on 7 April, 2006.  The Regulations apply to tissues establishments that are involved in the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells intended for human applications. The aim of the Regulations is to ensure a high level of protection of human health.</P>
        <P>The Regulations include criteria for assessing the status of prospective donors, inspection and control measures, traceability of donations and qualifications and training for persons working in tissue establishments.</P>
        <P>Fertility clinics are tissue establishments under the Regulations.  They must be inspected and authorised by the Irish Medicines Board, which is the competent authority under the Regulations, to ensure that they meet quality and safety standards.</P>
        <P>In addition to the foregoing, I have instructed my Department to begin preparing for specific legislation in the area of AHR.  The recent High Court judgment will be examined by my Department as part of this process, along with both the report of the CAHR and the report, when complete, of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The Early Childhood Supplement (ECS) was introduced by the Government with effect from 1 April 2006 and is being paid in quarterly instalments of &euro;250.  The final payment in 2006 is due to be paid on 11 December and some 275,000 families are benefiting.  </P>
        <P>The funding allocated for the ECS in 2006 is &euro;265 million, covering three payments, which equates to full year funding of &euro;353.3 million. The 2007 full year allocation for the ECS is &euro;381 million, representing an increase of 7.8% on the full year figure for 2006.  This significant level of funding reflects factors such as the increasing birth rate and, therefore an increase in the number of children aged under 6 years, and the fact that, to maximise the benefit to parents of young children, the ECS is being paid to parents for each quarter in which their child is under 6 years, including the quarter in which the child reaches 6 years, effectively giving parents an additional quarterly payment.</P>

	<P>I take it the question refers to the charging of people in long stay care.</P>
        <P>The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 in keeping with Section 53 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended, have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges can be levied.  Class 1 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24-hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;120 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;35, whichever is the lesser.  Class 2 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24-hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;90, or the weekly income of that person less &euro;55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P>These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person. The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo;. Under Section 1 (b) of the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005, the HSE can examine a person&rsquo;s overall financial situation in view of the person&rsquo;s reasonable <Col N="370"/>expenditure in relation to themselves or their dependants, if any.  There are no plans to change the charges which apply in nursing homes as part of the 2007 Estimates.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 304 and 306 together.</P><Col N="371"/>
        <P>The assessment guidelines used by the Health Service Executive (HSE) in respect of applications for medical cards and GP visit cards are subject to review by the Executive and my Department from time to time, having regard to the need to ensure that persons intended to benefit under these arrangements can do so.  Such reviews have regard to factors such as changes in income levels generally, the nature of typical household outgoings and also changes which may be made to the various social welfare schemes.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. In 2005 the income guidelines were increased incrementally by a cumulative 29%.  Other significant changes which I have introduced are that applications are now considered on the basis of income net of tax and PRSI and that allowance is made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work.   In June 2006 I agreed with the Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>Persons aged 16-25 (including students) who are financially dependent on their parents are entitled to a medical card / GP visit card if their parents are medical card / GP visit card holders. Those who are financially independent of their parents are assessed in their own right. The current weekly income allowance, after tax and PRSI and net of allowable disregards, allowed for a single person under 65 and living with family, is &euro;164 for a medical card and &euro;246 for a GP visit card.</P>

        <Quest> the qualifying conditions which will apply in 2007 for the receipt of a home care package; the benefits which will be available under the scheme; the number of such packages for which provision has been made in Estimates 2007; and the way it is intended to publicise the eligibility conditions. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>An additional &euro;55 million (full year cost) was allocated in Budget 2006 for the provision of home care packages. &euro;30m of this additional funding was to provide 2,000 extra packages by the end of 2006. The HSE has advised that 3,095 extra packages were provided up to the end of September 2006. The remaining &euro;25 million was included in the 2007 Estimates and the number of packages provided in 2007 will depend on the cost and make-up of such packages. It is not normal practice in the run-up to the Budget to com<Col N="372"/>ment on extra provision that may be made, if any, for home care packages or other services next year.</P>
        <P>The remainder of the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to operational issues, which are within the area of responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

As a result I have not issued guidelines to the HSE on the method it should use for valuing savings or investments in the means test for medical cards. Nevertheless, I understand that the HSE has established detailed operational guidelines for the assessment of medical card applications and so my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

        <QRef>[39694/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993 provide for the payment of subvention for private nursing home care for applicants who qualify on both medical and means grounds.  General rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for nursing home subvention are set out in the <Col N="373"/>Second Schedule of the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993, as amended by the Nursing Homes (Subvention) (Amendment) Regulations 2005.</P>
        <P>There are currently three rates of subvention payable, i.e. &euro;114.30, &euro;152.40 and &euro;190.50 for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum and these rates apply in all parts of the country.</P>
        <P>Under the current Regulations, when considering an application for subvention, the Health Service Executive carries out a means test which takes into account the means (including assets) of the applicant and his or her spouse/cohabiting partner, where appropriate. The means test involves looking at the applicant&rsquo;s income for the previous twelve months.  Income from all sources is taken into account and is assessed net of PRSI, income tax and the health contribution and the income of a married or cohabiting person is half the total income of the couple.  In assessing an applicant&rsquo;s assets the first &euro;11,000 of such assets is disregarded. The HSE may refuse to pay a subvention if an applicant has assets exceeding &euro;36,000 (excluding their principal residence). The HSE  may impute an income of 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of an applicant for subvention, regardless of market value, unless the residence is occupied by a spouse or son or daughter aged less than twenty one years or in full time education or in receipt of certain social welfare pensions/allowances, and generally does so unless there are exceptional circumstances. The Regulations provide that the HSE may refuse to pay a subvention if the value of the applicant&rsquo;s principal residence is in excess of &euro;500,000 (where the residence is located in the Dublin area) or &euro;300,000 (where the residence is located outside the Dublin area) and the applicant has an income of at least &euro;9,000 per annum.</P>
        <P>The HSE has discretion to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual&rsquo;s level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted.  The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention, subject to the provisions of the Health Act, 2004.  The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates. The supports paid by the HSE vary from person to person and region to region, depending on nursing home fees for example.</P>
        <P>Additional funding of &euro;20 million was provided for the administration of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme in 2006 bringing the total available budget to &euro;160 million.  The additional &euro;20 million is to support more basic nursing home subventions and reduce waiting lists for enhanced subventions: it is also to bring more consistency to subventions support throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The Health (Nursing Homes)(Amendment) Bill 2006 is designed to ensure that the existing <Col N="374"/>subvention scheme for private nursing home care is grounded in primary legislation and to help the HSE to implement the scheme on a standardised basis across the country. It was prepared on a &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; basis. In addition, national guidelines on nursing home subvention are currently being developed by the HSE to ensure an even and equitable application of the regulations nationally.</P>
        <P>The Government is currently considering new policy on Long Term Care and several principles underlying this were agreed with the social partners in &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;. These principles include, for example, that there should be one standardised national needs assessment for older people needing care.  The use of community and home-based care should be maximised.  Sheltered housing options will be encouraged.  Where residential care is required, it should be quality care and there should be appropriate and equitable levels of co-payment by care recipients based on a national standardised financial assessment.  The level of support for residential care should be indifferent as to whether that care is in a public or private facility. The financial model to support any new arrangements must also be financially sustainable.</P>
        <P>The Department is currently drawing up proposals for the Government&rsquo;s consideration based on the principles in &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government do not consider that there is a case for a State company for oil and gas and I would offer the following facts to the Deputy to support that view.</P>
        <P>At present Ireland has not established itself as a petroleum province. After 35 years and 123 exploration wells only 4 commercial finds have been made offshore Ireland. Of these one (Kinsale) has almost reached depletion, two (Ballycotton and Seven Heads) are commercial only because of their proximity to the Kinsale production facilities and the fourth (Corrib) is awaiting development. By 1987 Norway had made 60 commercial finds, on average each one significantly larger than the Kinsale Field. Also Norway made its commercial finds in shallow waters which made exploration and development less costly.</P><Col N="375"/>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>Ireland is still an exploration province, with low levels of exploration at that. Its offshore is less prospective than Norway&rsquo;s, its waters deeper and therefore more costly to explore and develop. To put it another way the Irish offshore is a high-cost high-risk exploration environment, where exploration wells cost circa &euro;25-30 million. In the context of these facts the Government is unwilling to risk taxpayers money to establish a State exploration company.</P>

	<P>The Alternative Energy Requirement support programme concentrated on increasing the contribution from renewable energy sources to the electricity market. The contribution by renewable energy sources to gross electricity consumption was 5.2% in 2004, the last full year for which figures are available. Preliminary figures for 2005 show that the contribution by renewable energy sources to gross electricity consumption has increased to 6.8% and the expectation for 2006 is that it will be over 8%.</P>

My Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.

	<P>At the request of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland carried out radon surveys at the Department&rsquo;s offices in the State between July 2005 and May 2006. All measurements at the Department&rsquo;s offices were below the Reference Level for radon gas in workplaces as set in the &ldquo;Radiological Protection Act, 1991, (Ionising Radiation) Order 2000&rdquo;. The Radiological Institute advised that no remedial action was necessary. The only Departmental offices in the State where radon surveys have not been carried out as yet are in Hatch Street and Cumberland Street, Dublin. As radon gas disperses above ground level, it was deemed unnecessary to carry out a radon survey of the Hatch Street office which is on the first floor. The office in Cumberland Street was unoccupied at the time of the earlier survey. However, as this office is now once again in use, it is proposed to ask the Institute to carry out a radon survey there in the near future. </P>

In each case my Department pays an agreed percentage of the utility bills corresponding to the amount of floor space occupied. The cost is paid directly to the main tenant not the energy supplier. To date in 2006 &euro;11,851 has been paid to the Department of Foreign Affairs and &euro;10,304  to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in respect of electricity charges. My Department opened new temporary decentralised premises in Fossa, Co. Kerry on 4 September 2006. New accounts were opened at this time with the ESB and Calor Teoranta.  To date &euro;1,602 has been paid to ESB and &euro;532 to Calor Teoranta. The National Archives, which is part of my Department, has accounts with the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is. The cost to date in 2006 has been &euro;84,600 to ESB and &euro;30,047 to Bord G&aacute;is.

	<P>In accordance with the new mandate for Shannon Development, the functions in relation to indigenous enterprises hitherto carried by the Company under delegated authority from Enterprise Ireland will revert to Enterprise Ireland on 1 January 2007.  This will involve the transfer of a number of staff from Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland. The purpose of the Industrial Development Bill, 2006 is to provide legislative authority to the Minister to designate the transfer of individual staff members concerned and to provide a statutory guarantee to the staff that their pay, conditions of service and pension arrangements shall be in no way diminished by virtue of the transfer.  Shannon Development will retain ownership of industrial property throughout the Mid West region, including the Shannon Free Zone and will also retain responsibility for the attraction of Foreign Direct Investment into the Shannon Free Zone.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 329, 330, 332 and 334 together.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland. The Agency is committed to achieving the best possible regional balance in investments. In tandem with the National Spatial Strategy (NSS), the Agency is actively encouraging FDI into all regions through the following strategies: Providing reduced, and in many cases zero, grant assistance to companies locating in Dublin; Leveraging the higher grant rate permitted in regions outside Dublin; Having in place a network of regional offices &mdash; three of which have specific sectoral responsibilities to attract and support business investment; Encouraging client firms to locate outside of Dublin by developing &ldquo;Magnets of Attraction&rdquo; around the Gateway and Hub locations; Providing regionally based property solutions; Designing itineraries around regional locations; and Working closely with local and regional partners to develop the infrastructure offering in each region.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland regularly reviews its strategies to ensure that they are in keeping with Government policy and are responsive to the challenges of a dynamic global economic environment.  For example the Agency completed a fundamental review of its overall strategy in November 2005, which resulted in a number of significant changes to the structure of the organisation.  The Agency&rsquo;s current regional strategy, which covers the period 2004 to 2006, focuses upon enhanced FDI, identification of Strategic Business Areas, regional <Col N="387"/>economic development and upgrading the educations, skills and research capabilities of the economy.  The Agency continues to re-invent its value proposition for inward investment, recognizing changes in global conditions and in our own circumstances.  There have been many contributions to this transformation, at Government level, in educational and other public institutions, and in the business sector.  Each has pursued improvements in order to be more competitive at more advanced levels of activity.  In the case of multinational companies in Ireland, recent years have seen new investments in production and service facilities and, increasingly, in R&amp;D and other innovation activities.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s investments are characterised by their leading-edge nature, in terms of technology, such as in Amgen and Intel, or their market innovation, such as in eBay and Google.  They are increasingly reliant on a highly skilled workforce.  They require an agile, flexible and responsive operating environment. We have now established a reputation globally as a location for advanced manufacturing, sophisticated business services and, increasingly, for leading research and innovation.  Each of these areas will be of critical importance to our continuing success. In terms of IDA Ireland prioritising cost in individual regions, costs are centred around advancing the NSS, which provides a framework for the achievement of more investment outside the Dublin region through the prioritisation of investment in the Gateway and Hub locations. The primary needs of new investment projects can be summarised as follows: A high quality urban environment with critical mass in population; A world-class access infrastructure, e.g. Roads, airports etc.; Telecommunications infrastructure including Universities and Institutes of Technology that are located close to Business and Technology Parks; and A range of affordable, state of the art, property solutions.</P>
        <P>In line with the NSS IDA Ireland is working with a range of bodies at local and national levels, including utilities providers, local authorities, property developers, universities etc. to enhance regional locations and make them more attractive and competitive for high value and sustainable enterprise development. I am satisfied that the policies and strategies being pursued by IDA Ireland are the most appropriate ones to attract and grow foreign direct investment throughout the country that will, in turn, contribute to balanced regional development and grow sustainable quality employment into the future.</P>

        <P>In line with the NSS IDA Ireland is working with a range of bodies at local and national levels, including utilities providers, local authorities, property developers, universities etc. to enhance regional locations and make them more attractive and competitive for high value and sustainable enterprise development. Wexford was designated a Hub town under the NSS.  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for Wexford is to promote the County as part of an integrated South-East region that has a population of 420,000 people.  Key to IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for Co. Wexford is to progress within the South East Region the development of a knowledge economy so that the County and Region, and particularly the Hub town of Wexford, can compete both nationally and internationally for FDI. Specifically, this includes working with local development partner agencies in Co. Wexford to advance critical supporting infrastructure, both hard and soft, which will contribute to a sustainable business environment for the long term, and actively engaging with the existing client base in Co. Wexford to encourage their transition to continually higher value activities and to promote further investment in Ireland. IDA Ireland is committed to working with com<Col N="389"/>panies such as Lake Region and Waters Technology to ensure that Wexford develops as a successful location for high-end manufacturing from both the medical technologies and engineering sectors.</P>
        <P>IDA is currently developing its 65 acre Wexford Business and Technology Park as part of a national property development programme to ensure the availability of international standard property solutions for potential investors into the future.    To date, in excess of &euro;5m has been invested in the Wexford Business &amp; Technology Park.  IDA has a further 17 acres available in Wexford County at sites in Gorey, New Ross and Enniscorthy.  I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland in Wexford will deliver maximum results in terms of attracting additional sustainable investment to the County.</P>

	<P>Irish trade is regulated in accordance with the Common Commercial Policy rules of the European Union. The EU has a long-standing commitment to the promotion of core labour standards and social development; the charter of fundamental rights of the EU confirms the aim to fully integrate these standards in all its policies and actions.</P>
        <P>Cooperation agreements between the EU and other countries, as a matter of course, include human rights and core labour standard clauses as set out in International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions. In addition, the EU uses its trade policy mechanisms to encourage other countries to improve standards by offering additional preferential access dependant on adherence to ILO conventions. Within the World Trade Organisation also, the EU, with our support, has been pursuing improved international regulation in the area of trade and labour standards.</P>
        <P>Ireland has consistently supported the International Labour Organisation in its efforts to promote core labour standards. In 1998, we supported the adoption by the ILO of a Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. This commits the ILO&rsquo;s 175 member states worldwide to respect the principles inherent in the core labour standards and to promote their universal application. Ireland has ratified all eight core labour standards, including those addressing the abolition of forced or compulsory labour and child labour.</P>

	<P>I can advise the Deputy that EU State Aid rules do not include any conditions regarding the employment of persons in non-EU countries. It should also be borne in mind that  any State Aid grants to companies in Ireland are paid solely in respect of the operations of the recipient company in the State.</P>
        <P>However, the Deputy can be assured that the State&rsquo;s development agencies are most unlikely to be in a position of offering grant-aid to companies, which avail of child labour elsewhere in the World.  The agencies in question are usually well informed of the history and spread of activities of their clients.</P>
        <P>Ireland has consistently supported the International Labour Organisation in its efforts to promote core labour standards.  In June 1998, Ireland supported the adoption by the International Labour Conference of a Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.  This com<Col N="393"/>mits the International Labour Organisation&rsquo;s 179 member states worldwide to respect the principles inherent in the  core labour standards and to promote their universal application.  Ireland has ratified all of the seven core labour standards.</P>
        <P>This Declaration emphasises that all member states of the International Labour Organisation, even if they have not ratified the conventions in question, have an obligation, arising from the very fact of membership of the organisation, to respect, to promote and to realise, in good faith and in accordance with the constitution of the International Labour Organisation, the principles concerning the fundamental rights which are the subject of those conventions, namely:</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective   bargaining;</P>
        <P LI="1">(b) the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour;</P>
        <P LI="1">(c) the effective abolition of child labour; and</P>
        <P LI="1">(d) the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In June 1999, the International Labour Conference adopted Convention No. 182 concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour.  Ireland registered its ratification of that Convention on 20th December 1999 and was the first European Union country to do so.</P>
        <P>Ireland has in the past and will continue to support the promotion of core labour standards  and this commitment has been reaffirmed in successive National Partnership Agreements.</P>
        <P>Should the Deputy be aware of any specific information regarding child labour and companies operating in Ireland, I would appreciate if he would bring this to my attention.</P>

	<P>Irish Aid provides financial assistance to the Irish Fair Trade Network to support its activities in Ireland. This will amount to a total of &euro;410,000 over the period 2005 to 2007.  Irish Aid also plays an important role in supporting capacity building for fair trade producers. Thus, for example, small coffee producers in Central America were provided with funding of &euro;567,000 for the period 2003 to 2006. It is through initiatives such as these in the areas of product promotion and capacity building that the fair trade niche market will expand and develop further through opening new markets and presenting opportunities to fair trade producers.</P><Col N="394"/>
        <P>At the wider EU level, Ireland, in common with other EU Member States, has placed a very clear emphasis on the need to assist developing countries and, in particular, least developed countries, in their integration into the world economy, as a necessary condition for their future development.  Such integration, which is one element in the process of poverty reduction in developing countries, will be deeper and fairer if anchored in the multilateral trading system.</P>
        <P>Proposals under the umbrella of the Aid for Trade (AfT) initiative, being promoted by Members of the World Trade Organisation, for example, provides the framework in which substantial resources will be made available to developing and least developed countries to help them grow their trading potential. Under the Aft initiative, the contribution of the EU as a whole, including the Community contribution, on trade-related assistance in response to needs prioritised by participating countries, will reach &euro;2 billion per year, by 2010.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 344 and 355 together.</P>
        <P>My Department assists and encourages the long term unemployed, lone parents and other social welfare recipients to return to work, training or further education through a range of measures administered by my Department&rsquo;s social and family support service.</P>
        <P>One significant measure is the back to work allowance scheme which incentivises and encourages people to return to work by allowing them to retain part of their social welfare payment for a period when they take up employment or self-employment.  Research has shown that 75% of participants remain in employment or self-employment following participation.</P>
        <P>To obtain back to work allowance, a person must have been in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment, such as job seeker&rsquo;s allowance, for various specified periods of between twelve months and five years, depending on the qualifying payment and on whether the person is going into employment or self-employment.</P>
        <P>Another measure offered by my Department is the back to education allowance programme which provides support to long term social welfare recipients who need to obtain educational <Col N="395"/>qualifications before re-entering the labour force.  Again, information provided through research has shown that, in the case of a control group surveyed, 63% were in employment following participation in the scheme.</P>
        <P>To obtain back-to education allowance, a person must have been in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for six, nine or twelve months, depending on the type of qualification being pursued and whether the person is participating in the national employment action plan.</P>
        <P>The operation of my Department&rsquo;s employment support measures, in the context of modern labour market conditions, is continually monitored.  Any changes necessary to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness are considered in the annual budgetary process.</P>

	<P>My Department undertook a programme to have all of the Department&rsquo;s 140 offices tested for radon levels in 2004.  To date over 100 offices have been tested with the remaining 40 expected to be completed by early 2007.  Of the offices tested, 5 indicated radon levels above the National reference Level.  An approved company has carried out remedial work in these locations and the offices were re-tested and the radon levels are reduced and are now below the National reference Level.</P>
        <P>During the course of this programme my Department has kept the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland appraised of the situation in accordance with the relevant legislation.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the campaign to which the Deputy refers.</P>
        <P>EU Regulations provide that migrant workers who are EEA nationals, i.e. EEA nationals who have been employed since coming to this country, are entitled to payment of family benefits under the same conditions as Irish nationals and the habitual residence condition does not apply in their case.</P>
        <P>The effect of the condition, therefore, is principally in relation to claims by non-EEA nationals.  Approximately 15% of such claims, received in the period May 2004 to October 2006, were refused on the grounds that the habitual residence condition was not satisfied.</P>
        <P>Those who are refused are mainly persons whose claim to asylum has not yet been decided, who do not have a work permit or who have a minimal attachment to the workforce in Ireland.  The original reason for the introduction of the habitual residence condition in May 2004 was to ensure that persons who have not worked in Ireland or who have not established their habitual residence in Ireland cannot avail of assistance schemes or child benefit, and this continues to be its purpose.</P>
        <P FLI="0">A review of the operation of the habitual residence condition was completed by my Department in July this year and, following consultation with other relevant Departments, is being brought to the attention of the Government.  The arguments put forward in the context of the current campaign were considered during the course of this review.</P>

	<P>My Department has overall responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need intensive help and advice in coping with their debt problems.  There are 53 independent companies nationwide operating the service.  The MABS service has been allocated &euro;16.4 million this year to ensure the continued development of the service.  In 2006 to date approximately 10,000 new <Col N="398"/>clients have approached the service for advice with debt problems.</P>
        <P>There is one MABS company based in Kildare which operates from two locations, Kilcock and Newbridge.  It employs 7 staff and in each of the past three years respectively 355, 429 and 479 new customers have approached the service.  So far this year, a total of 411 customers have approached the service.  There is no waiting list and customers contacting the service are given an appointment to see a money advisor within 10 days.</P>
        <P>Last year almost 27,000 people used the MABS throughout the country as compared with almost 18,000 some 4 years earlier.  The growth in demand for the service is evidence of the quality of the service provided by the MABS staff.  This year I have increased the allocation from my Department to the MABS Service by in excess of twenty percent to assist the MABS in dealing with this increased workload.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme which was introduced from 1994. The scheme allows up to 20 years (from 1994) spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.</P>
        <P>The scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the appropriate rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age must also be satisfied.  Accordingly, a person who cannot satisfy the basic requirements outlined above or whose contribution record is based solely on modified contributions, payable in the public service, cannot benefit from the scheme.</P>
        <P>No provision has been made in the 2007 estimates for changes to the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme.  However, issues relating to the operation of the scheme, and social welfare pensions in general, will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Green Paper on pensions to which the Government is committed as part of the new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  The <Col N="399"/>Green Paper will be published at the end of March next year.  A consultation process will then take place and the Government will publish a framework for future pensions policy later in the year.</P>

	<P>The Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme (SWA) is administered by some 700 Community Welfare Officers and 59 Superintendent Community Welfare Officers and supporting staff, within the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Over 110,000 people receive an SWA payment each week.  &euro;733.6m has been provided for the scheme in 2006 including provision for administration costs of &euro;51.4m. &euro;720.1m has been provided for the scheme in 2007 including provision for administration costs of &euro;55.5m.  This represents a decrease of 2% in estimated expenditure over 2006.</P>
        <P>The decrease of 2% is due mainly to an emerging saving of &euro;48m on the 2006 estimate, on which the 2007 estimate is based, and to the transfer of &euro;24m to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the Rental Accommodation Scheme, partially offset by provision for some increases in 2007 under other headings.</P>
        <P>Expenditure on all elements of the scheme is expected to increase in 2007 over 2006 except for expenditure on basic weekly payments which is expected to be down &euro;35m, and certain supplements which are expected to show a decrease by &euro;900,000.</P>
        <P>The main reason  for the expected decrease in expenditure on basic weekly payments in 2007 is improved  processing times for primary payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance in respect of which interim SWA is paid pending the finalisation of the primary claim.</P>

	<P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive, a weekly or monthly rent or mortgage interest supplement is available to assist eligible people who are unable to meet their immediate accommodation needs through their own resources.</P>
        <P>Under standard supplementary welfare allowance assessment rules, rent supplements are calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;13 which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.  Family income supplement is disregarded in the standard means test.  In addition in cases where the applicant has part-time employment, i.e. less than 30 hours per week, up to &euro;60 of weekly earnings is disregarded with half of any additional income between &euro;60 and &euro;90 also disregarded for means assessment purposes.</P>
        <P>People who participate in certain employment schemes are also assessed under special rules governing the retention of rent supplement.  These rules provide for the retention for one year of 75% of the amount of rent supplement previously in payment, tapering to 50% in the second year and 25% in the third and fourth years.  These <Col N="401"/>arrangements are subject to an income limit of &euro;317.43.</P>
        <P>Back to work allowance and family income supplement, in cases where one or both of these are in payment, are disregarded in the assessment of the &euro;317.43 weekly income limit.  PRSI and reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded in the means test.</P>
        <P>People availing of an employment support scheme are assessed under both standard supplementary welfare allowance rules and under the special retention rules, and will be entitled to receive payment under whichever is the more favourable option for them.</P>
        <P>Half of any maintenance payments a lone parent receives can be disregarded as means for the purposes of assessing a person&rsquo;s entitlement to one-parent family payment.  The means test for this and certain other social assistance schemes also provides for a disregard of up to &euro;95.23 per week of maintenance payments in instances where applicants have rent or mortgage interest obligations on their family homes.</P>
        <P>Given that up to &euro;95.23 per week of maintenance payments has already been disregarded in the means test for the primary scheme payment purposes to allow for housing costs, maintenance income up to this weekly amount is assessable in determining the appropriate level of rent supplement payable.  However, depending on the particular family housing cost, any maintenance payment received between &euro;95.24 and &euro;155.24 (i.e. up to &euro;60) is disregarded in full with half of any additional maintenance payments between &euro;155.25 and &euro;185.23 (i.e. up to &euro;15) also disregarded, subject to a maximum disregard of &euro;75 per week.</P>
        <P>In the past, in the specific situation where budget increases in rates of payment were granted to old age pensioners at amounts higher than applied to supplementary welfare allowance, a special income disregard was introduced to ensure that the people concerned received the full benefit of their budget increase.  The amount of income in excess of the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate that can be disregarded in the means test for rent supplement for people aged 65 or over who are in receipt of a social welfare pension or equivalent payment from another country is now &euro;26 per household.</P>
        <P>The 2007 Abridged Estimates made no provision for changes in rent supplement eligibility, entitlements or rates of payment.  Any such change in the scheme would be a matter for consideration in the context of the forthcoming Budget.</P>

	<P>I assume the changes to which the Deputy refers are the recently announced increases in the level of the electricity and gas allowances.</P>
        <P>In order to cover the 33.8% increase in the cost of natural gas, from 1 October I increased the value of the natural gas allowance to cover increased standing charges and the associated VAT as well as additional kilowatt hours usage.  This means that the value of the natural gas allowance to a household has increased from &euro;313.17 to &euro;516 per year.</P>
        <P>At present, the electricity allowance covers normal standing charges and up to 1,800 units of electricity.  The allowance also covers the VAT applicable to these charges. In the light of the recent increase in electricity charges the allowance will be increased to cover increased standing charges and the units will also increase from 1,800 to 2,400 with effect from January 2007.</P>
        <P>Approximately 340,000 pensioner and other households qualify for the electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package.  I am confident that these increases, the cost of which is provided for in the Estimates for 2007, will be of major benefit to these recipients.</P>
        <P>In addition to the electricity and gas allowance my Department also pays a fuel allowance for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April to assist householders on long-term social welfare or Health Service Executive payments with meeting the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season.  In Budget 2006, I provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance of &euro;5, from &euro;9 per week to &euro;14 per week and to &euro;17.90 in designated smokeless areas.  This matter is being kept under review.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the maximum rent payment which will be considered for supplement under supplementary welfare in respect of different household sizes in Dublin in 2007; and the index of rents which was used for considering adjusting these limits. </Quest>
        <QRef>[39687/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a rent supplement to assist eligible people who are unable to provide for their immediate accommodation needs from their own resources and <Col N="403"/>who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
        <P>Rent supplements are subject to a limit depending on household size, on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur.  The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the Health Service Executive may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent levels as an exceptional measure, for example:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances for example, disabled persons in specially-adapted accommodation or homeless persons,</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />where the tenant will be in a position to re-assume responsibility for his/her rent within a short period.</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />where the person concerned is entitled to an income disregard and has sufficient income to meet his or her basic needs after paying rent, taking into account the appropriate rate of rent supplement that is otherwise payable in the case.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.</P>
        <P>In November 2002, when the Central Statistics Office Privately Owned Rent Index first showed evidence of continued reductions in rent levels, regulations were introduced to set the maximum amount of rent in respect of which a rent supplement is payable. These limits remained in place to the end of December 2003.  Further Regulations introduced in December 2003 and prescribed the limits to be used between January 2004 and June 2005.  The current rent limits, which are set out in S.I. 386 of 2005, cover the period July 2005 to 31 December 2006.</P>
        <P>Despite recent increases in rent levels, the Central Statistics Office Privately Owned Rent Index shows that rent levels for October 2006 were in line with those which applied in October 2002.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently reviewing levels of rent limits in order to develop proposals regarding what limits should apply from January 2007 onwards.  The review is taking account of prevailing rent levels in the private rental sector generally, together with detailed input from the Health Service Executive on the market situation within each of its operational areas.</P>
        <P>The review will also include consultation with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  In addition, a number of the voluntary agencies working in this area have <Col N="404"/>made detailed submissions.  This process will ensure that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country, and that they will continue to enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the proposed EU US Open Skies Agreement I negotiated transitional arrangements for Ireland which were to provide for an orderly change to the Shannon-stop arrangements. These transitional measures were supported by our European colleagues and the US Authorities.</P>
        <P>I have publicly stated my commitment to the view that the liberalisation of air transport services between Ireland and the U.S. will deliver major benefits for Irish business and tourism. The conclusion of an open skies agreement would have particular benefits for Ireland compared to Member States (15 of 25) that already have open-skies agreements with the U.S. These Member States already enjoy an advantage in unrestricted <Col N="405"/>access to route rights for the development of air services to and from the U.S.</P>
        <P>In view of the importance of this matter for Ireland, I informed the Government in September this year that I proposed to continue to pursue all possible avenues through contacts with the European Commission, with Ministerial colleagues in other Member States and with the U.S. to provide for the entry into force at the earliest possible date of the EU/U.S. Open Skies agreement including the transitional arrangements relating to Ireland already agreed between the EU and the U.S.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Estimates for 2007, not 2006. Provision is made for Grants for Community and Voluntary Service under subhead K1 on my Department&rsquo;s Vote as published in the 2007 Abridged Estimates Volume. &euro;26.548 million has been provided for a number of programmes including the Scheme of Community Supports for Older People &mdash; under which funding for security devices for older <Col N="410"/>people is made available. The final allocations between the programmes operated by my Department under this subhead will be published in the Revised Estimates Volume.</P>
        <P>The Scheme of Community Supports for Older People is open to people aged 65 and over who have a genuine need for assistance under the scheme and it is administered by community and voluntary organisations throughout the country with support provided by my Department.</P>
        <P>When I launched the 2006 Scheme in May last, I decided to leave it open for the rest of the year, as distinct from previous years where a fixed closing date applied. Feedback from community groups in relation to this initiative has been very positive and, accordingly, I propose to introduce a fully open Scheme in 2007.  I am confident that this measure will further assist these groups in administering this very worthwhile Scheme.</P>

	<P>The compensation package negotiated in the context of the reform of the EU sugar regime is worth over &euro;310m to Ireland. It comprises three elements. </P>
        <P>The first element is the sugar beet compensation being incorporated into the Single Payment Scheme with effect from 2006. It will be worth approximately &euro;123 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years.</P>
<?oasys _dc14- ?>
        <P>The second element is the EU restructuring aid for the sugar industry, which in Ireland&rsquo;s case is worth &euro;145m approximately. This aid, as provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No. 320/2006, is to cover the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring the sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota. It is to be drawn down on the basis of an aid application, including a detailed restructuring plan, submitted by the processor. In July 2006 the Government made decisions regarding the percentage of the aid to be reserved for beet growers and contractors and the indicative breakdown of the potential allocation of the aid to be followed by Greencore in preparing its restructuring plan. These decisions are now the subject of judicial review proceedings instituted by Greencore in the High Court. Under the EU Regulation, the first instalment of aid would fall to be paid in June 2007.</P><Col N="412"/><?oasys _dc0- ?>
        <P>The third element of the compensation package is the diversification aid, also provided for in Council Regulation (EC) 320/2006, worth almost &euro;44m in Ireland&rsquo;s case. A national restructuring programme is being prepared, in accordance with the EU Regulations, for submission to the EU Commission by the end of this year with a view to drawing down the diversification aid. The Regulations provide that payment of the aid would commence in September 2007.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the staffing schedule for primary schools is structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to an average mainstream class size of 28 pupils. Posts allocated on the basis of this schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in <Col N="415"/>any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum. </P>
        <P>The staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year is a Principal, 16 mainstream class teachers (based on an enrolment of 435 pupils on 30th September, 2005), 3 Permanent Learning Support/Resource teachers (1 of these is a shared post).</P>
        <P>The enrolment figure submitted by the Board of Management for the 30th September, 2006 is 422 pupils. The average class size in the school this year is therefore 26.4.</P>

	<P>At the core of the recommendations of the Task Force on Student Behaviour was the establishment of a Behaviour Support Team.  The purpose of this Team was envisaged as helping identify problems of student behaviour in second-level schools, leading to the development of strategies to resolve these problems and to facilitate the implementation of these strategies in practice.</P>
        <P>When launching the Report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour, I indicated my agreement to the establishment of this Behaviour Support Team which I regarded as a priority for my Department.</P>
        <P>Since then, and over a short time-scale, a National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) has been established.  It is based in Navan Education Centre.  A multi-disciplinary professional team has been recruited and appointed to the NBSS, which consists of a National Co-ordinator, four Assistant National Co-ordinators, eight Regional Development Officers and twenty part-time Associates.  In addition, a senior psychologist and three psychologists have been assigned to the team.  A full-time administrator is based in Navan Education Centre.</P>
        <P>Since its appointment, the team has been working on a number of key issues:</P><Col N="416"/>
        <P LI="1">1. The development of a Draft National Framework for Behaviour Improvement.</P>

        <P LI="1">3. On-going training for the NBSS team.</P>
        <P LI="1">4. Research into and communication with behaviour support systems in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The NBSS will shortly be commencing its engagement with schools and a series of information seminars have been organised throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In terms of expenditure, funding has been provided to cover the costs of the NBSS recruitment process, staff training and development, staff salaries, establishment of an NBSS Office, development of an NBSS website and the information seminars with schools.  At this stage, it is anticipated that the &euro;2 million allocated toward the implementation of the Task Force&rsquo;s recommendations will be fully expended by the end of the current financial year.</P>

	<P>It is a fundamental principle of the Free Second Level Education Scheme that no charge be made in respect of:</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) instruction in any subject of my Department&rsquo;s Programme for Secondary Schools;</P>
       <P LI="1">(b) recreation or study facilities of which all pupils are expected to avail as part of the school programme;</P>
       <P LI="1">(c) any other activity in which all pupils are required to take part.</P>
       <P FLI="0">Accordingly, it would be a breach of my Department&rsquo;s policy for post-primary schools involved in the Free Second Level Education Scheme to demand or levy a fee.</P>
        <P>However, voluntary contributions by parents, or charges for optional extras over and above what is provided for in the general school programme, are permissible provided that it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition.</P><Col N="417"/>
        <P>Day to day funding for our schools has increased significantly in recent years. The standard capitation grant of &euro;266 per pupil in 2003 now stands at &euro;298 per pupil and the support services grant for secondary schools has been increased from &euro;127 per pupil in 2003 to &euro;159 per pupil in 2006.</P>
        <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Deputy to my announcement of further significant increases in the context of the 2007 estimates. From 1 January next the standard per capita grant will be increased by a further &euro;18 to &euro;316 per pupil. In addition, for voluntary secondary schools the support services grant will be increased by a further &euro;30, which includes a further equalisation measure, to &euro;189 per pupil. This aggregate increase of &euro;48 per pupil will bring the cumulative increase in the per capita and support services grants concerned since 2003 to &euro;112 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.</P>
        <P>This Government is strongly committed to improving participation and achievement at every level of education. We have put the resources and supports in place to ensure that our children get the highest standard of education. With an increase of some 9%, day-to-day expenditure on education will exceed &euro;7 billion for the first time in 2006.</P>

	<P>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department. However, I can assure the Deputy that the Government has made a record investment of over &euro;2 billion in the period from 2000 to 2005 in upgrading existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first and second-level. Over 6,500 projects were delivered in this period, including 76 new school buildings, 380 major refurbishment/extensions and over 6,050 smaller scale projects. In addition the investment covered site purchases, the minor works grant issued to all primary schools annually, dust/asbestos and radon remediation programmes, science and technology initiatives, contingency works and grants for the purchase of furniture and equipment. This year alone &euro;506m is being invested in schools and this will deliver over 1,300 building projects.</P>
        <P>The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expan<Col N="418"/>sion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</P>
        <P>The focus within my Department is on empowering schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible, by way of permanent accommodation. In order to reduce the amount of temporary/prefabricated accommodation, to upgrade existing facilities and to achieve the best value for money as opposed to the provision of temporary accommodation, two new initiatives, the Permanent Accommodation Initiative and the Small School Initiative were launched in 2003 on a pilot basis. Due to their success they have become a permanent feature of my Schools Building and Modernisation Programme. As a result the amount spent on the purchase of prefabricated buildings in has been significantly reduced.</P>
        <P>The infrastructural investment needs in schools will continue into the future. Building on the record investment in recent years the Government&rsquo;s has decided to provide &euro;3.9 billion in capital funding for the education sector over the next 5 years. This is proof of its continuing commitment to educational infrastructure and will allow my Department to continue to take a pro-active approach in modernising school accommodation throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 390 and 391 together.</P>
        <P>On the 1 February 2006 the Minister for Health and Children and I published the report of the Fottrell Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education and Training. As part of these reforms I am increasing the annual number of undergraduate places for Irish and EU students from 305 to 485. I am also introducing a separate graduate entry stream which will provide 240 additional places per annum. These increases, which will be phased in over a five year period, will increase the annual number of medical places from 305 to 725.</P>
        <P>At undergraduate level an additional 70 places have been provided this Autumn, with a further <Col N="419"/>40 places being provided in 2007 and a further 35 places in each of 2008 and 2009. It is anticipated that the Higher Education Authority will shortly issue a competitive call for proposals to provide the new graduate entry programme, with a view to additional places being provided on this programme from 2007.</P>
        <P>In the interest of alleviating the enormous pressures of the high CAO points requirements, the Fottrell report recommended that Leaving Certificate results should no longer be the sole selection criterion for undergraduate entry. It proposes that all students with 450 Leaving Certificate points be considered for selection on the basis of a separate aptitude test. While I am a keen supporter of the fairness and objectivity of the points system, I recognise that the pressures on students wishing to study medicine to achieve an almost perfect Leaving Cert are excessive and unnecessary.  There is a need however to ensure that the revised system will adequately reward strong academic performance, will provide an appropriate evaluation of aptitude and suitability for a career in medicine and will retain public confidence in its objectivity and fairness.</P>
        <P>The Higher Education Authority established an Expert Group to develop a standardised test that, drawing on best international practice. I asked the HEA Expert Group to bring forward detailed proposals on a proposed new undergraduate selection system, to devise an appropriate selection test for use at undergraduate level and to advise on the logistics of its administration.  The new entry procedures for undergraduate medical education will not be introduced for September 2007.</P>

	<P>My Department is of the view that children with autism, in common with all children should have access to appropriate provision delivered by suitably qualified teachers within the school system where children can mix with their wider peer group and have maximum opportunities for integration. The preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for children with autism, is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or <Col N="420"/>in special schools, a view that is supported by the findings of the Task Force Report on Autism. My Department&rsquo;s ongoing commitment is to ensuring that all children, including those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders, receive an education appropriate to their needs.</P>
        <P>An application was recently received from the group in question to participate in the pilot scheme which has facilitated the establishment of a number of ABA-specific autism units nationwide. My officials requested that the psychological assessments of the children proposing to attend the proposed centre should be forwarded to the Department for consideration. My Department is awaiting the necessary reports.</P>

	<P>DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme, SSP. The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the SSP. These comprised 640 primary schools &mdash; 320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools &mdash; and 200 second-level schools.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.</P>
        <P>The closing date for receipt of review applications was Friday, 31st March, 2006. An application for review was not received from the school referred to by the Deputy. The Group has submitted a final report and the review process is now concluded.</P><Col N="424"/>

After that, schools will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</P>

	<P>My Department is of the view that children with autism, in common with all children should have access to appropriate provision delivered by suitably qualified teachers within the school system where children can mix with their wider peer group and have maximum opportunities for integration.  The preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for children with autism, is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools, a view that is supported by the findings of the Task Force Report on Autism.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s ongoing commitment is to ensuring that all children, including those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders receive an education appropriate to their needs and in this regard my Department has established: 175 Special Classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools, 6 of which are located in the Mayo area; five special Classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome; 16 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum; and 12 stand alone ABA specific units.</P>
        <P>An application was recently received from the group in question to participate in the pilot scheme which has facilitated the establishment of a number of ABA-specific autism units nationwide.  My officials requested that the psychological assessments of the children proposing to attend the proposed centre should be forwarded to the Department in order to progress the application further.  My Department is awaiting the necessary reports.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government has provided for the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  The number of primary school teachers has increased by 4,000 since 2002 alone.  We have reduced the average primary class size to 24.  With the unprecedented increases in support staff, there is now one teacher for every 17 primary school children, down from one for 22.  Children who need extra help are getting more support than ever before.</P>
        <P>But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for <Col N="428"/>another 800 primary teachers.  The final determination of posts between these categories has yet to be decided.  The employment of a teacher is the responsibility of the Board of Management of a primary school, however it is anticipated that the additional teachers allocated by my Department will be in place by 1 September 2007.</P>
        <P>There will be approximately 1,280 graduates from the Colleges of Education and it is also estimated that there will be circa 400 graduates from the Hibernia College in 2007.  The Deputy will of course be aware that as well as filling extra posts in schools, newly qualified teachers will be needed to replace retiring teachers.  The level of retirements has been quite high in the past few years.  For example, since January 2006 approximately 620 primary teachers have retired.</P>
        <P>This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 413 and 414 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made by this Government in both the income limits and the payment levels for third level grants.  The income limits were increased significantly in 2003/04.  For the 2003/04 academic year, the income limit for a family with 4 children was increased from &euro;23,770 to &euro;35,165, an increase of nearly 48%.  The income limits have continued to rise each year, to the point where the limit for a family with 4 children this year is &euro;41,055, an increase of nearly 73% on the amount allowed in the 2002/03 academic year.</P>
        <P>Given the huge increase in income limits in 2003/04, the practice in recent years has been to increase the limits at least in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year in the reference period (September to September).  This year, an increase of 5.3% was approved, in the reckonable income limits for the 2006/2007 academic year, as has the allowance by which the income limits may be increased for each dependant where two or more children are in further or higher education.  This increase was ahead of the 3.2% increase in the relevant reference period.  The tables below provide details of the current reckonable income limits and grant rates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Special Rates of Maintenance Grant, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, were introduced with effect from the 2000/01 academic year.  The annual income threshold for the special rates of maintenance grant is increased, in line with the relevant social welfare payments. The current income threshold for &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; is &euro;16,748.  The higher, non-adjacent special rate of maintenance <Col N="430"/>is based on the maximum personal rate of Social Welfare Unemployment Assistance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As these increases show, this Government has shown a clear determination to improve the grant system to ensure that students get as much support as possible.  But, not only have we increased the income limits significantly, we have also made other improvements to the grants system.  We have introduced two new income thresholds to allow for 25% and 75% grants as well as the 50% and 100% rates; we have brought in a new &lsquo;top-up grant&rsquo; to target extra funding at those who need it most; and we have increased grant payment rates.  Indeed, the maximum level of grant support available in the current academic year is &euro;5,970, compared with &euro;3,000 in 2001/02.</P>
        <P>In relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation as per the consumer price index.  The reference period currently used is the increase in the period to December of the year prior to the relevant academic year.  The review of the income eligibility thresholds and the rates of grant that will apply for the 07/08 academic year will take place in the first quarter of 2007 when the relevant reference data is available.  Provision will be determined at that point.</P>
        <P>More than &euro;228 million has been allocated for the third level student support schemes in 2006.  As the Deputy will be aware, further improvements to the grant system are on the cards, with the development of the Student Support Bill and the introduction of payment deadlines to ensure that students get their grants earlier.  Major progress has been made by this Government in improving financial support for students and I assure the Deputy that this area will continue to be a priority for us.</P>
        <P>For the 2006/07 academic year, the reckonable income limits  (based on income for the tax-year 2005) are:</P><Col N="429"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 415, 416, 423 and 424 together.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children is responsible for policy formation in respect of pre-hospital emergency care, and the Health Service Executive has statutory responsibility for the provision of ambulance services throughout the State.  A Service Level Agreement between my Department and the Department of Health and Children for the provision of an Air Ambulance Service by the Air Corps was signed in September 2005.  This Service Level Agreement was prepared by my Department and the Department of Health and Children in consultation with the Health Services Executive and the Defence Forces including the Air Corps, who are all signatories to the Agreement.</P>
        <P>The Air Corps Air Ambulance Service is an emergency inter-hospital transfer service for the essential rapid transfer of patients between hospitals, encompassing inter-hospital transfer for spinal and serious injury and illness; air transport of Neonates requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland; air transport of patients requiring emergency organ transplant in the UK; air transport of Organ Harvest Teams within Ireland, and air transport of patients from offshore islands to mainland hospitals where the Coast Guard service is not available.  The Air Corps does not offer a HEMS primary response capability.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Service Level Agreement, the Air Corps provide aircraft and flying crews as available for the specific services to be delivered.  The aircraft provided depends on the nature of the mission and the service requirement, and the final decision in this regard lies with the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps.  The availability of services is dependent on the availability of a suitable aircraft, the availability of flying crews, and the suitability of weather conditions.  The authorised requestor for all Air Ambulance requests is the relevant Health Services Executive Ambulance Service Emer<Col N="433"/>gency Medical Controller, who submits the request directly to the Air Corps.</P>
        <P>Since the signing of the Service Level Agreement on 13 September 2005, the Air Corps has carried out a total of 96 Air Ambulance missions at the request of the HSE.  Of the 96 missions undertaken, 29 were missions to the UK by fixed wing aircraft and 38 were inter-hospital transfers within Ireland.  A breakdown of all missions is set out in the table below.</P>

	<P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin was offered for sale by public tender on the 14 June 2001.  Two bids were received, one of which was from Dublin City Council.  Both tenders were considered too low to permit acceptance.  Subsequently discussions took place with officials of the then Department of the Environment and Local Government and Dublin City Council.  In the event, Dublin City Council did not proceed to acquire the property on the basis that it was considered that the public interest would be best served from a housing and planning perspective by selling the property on the open market rather than have it purchased by the Local Authority.</P>
        <P>Clancy Barracks was subsequently sold to Florence Properties Ltd for &euro;25.4 million.  The sale was completed on 26 March 2004.   My Department does not retain an interest in the property.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the recommendations of the Gleeson Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces 1990, that the military service allowance should be made fully reckonable for <Col N="434"/>superannuation purposes for all military pensioners; if he will implement this recommendation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from a recommendation made in 1990 by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces (the Gleeson Commission), Military Service Allowance (MSA) was made pensionable in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990.   As I have previously indicated to the House, this approach was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners.</P>
        <P>More recently, the Final Report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions, which was published in January 2001, was considered and broadly accepted by Government.  In that Report, the Commission specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances (including the MSA) and the consequences for public service pensioners generally.  However, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected, together with long-standing public service pensions policy in that context and the substantial cost implications involved, the Commission did not recommend any increase for the pensioners concerned.</P>
        <P>Aside from pre-August 1990 Defence Forces pensioners, the other groups affected include certain retired members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Prison Service and retired teachers.  In the context of the Government&rsquo;s subsequent consideration of the Commission&rsquo;s Report, no change in existing policy on this matter has been authorised or is contemplated.  Accordingly, there is no scope for departing from settled public service pensions policy in the case of MSA.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest> if he will allow retired members of the Defence Forces in receipt of a service pension, but who are not members of the spouses and children&rsquo;s pension scheme, to join the scheme, at an appropriate contribution rate; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The contributory pension schemes for the widow(er)s and children of deceased military personnel are essentially the same as those applying elsewhere in the public service.  Benefits under the schemes are additional to Widow(er)&rsquo;s Contributory Pension under the Social Welfare Acts for which Defence Forces&rsquo; personnel are insured by virtue of their PRSI contributions.</P>
        <P>Provision for the payment of pensions by this Department to the widows and children of deceased NCOs and Privates was first made in <Col N="435"/>1978 when a contributory pension scheme for those dependants was introduced.  Membership of the scheme was compulsory in the case of personnel enlisting on or after 1 February 1978.  Personnel serving at the time were included as members of the scheme unless they made a positive option in writing not to become members.</P>
        <P>In 1985, a second opportunity to make provision for their dependants was granted when all NCOs and Privates &mdash; as well as pensioners and the representatives of deceased soldiers &mdash; who had opted out of the scheme in 1978 were invited to reconsider their decision and to join a revised scheme.  Unfortunately, not all availed of this option.</P>
        <P>At this stage, all NCOs and Privates who were serving when the original scheme was introduced in 1978 have had two opportunities to join the scheme.  The question of again re-opening membership options in respect of the spouses&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s pension scheme has been considered on a number of occasions over the years but I regret to say that it has not been found possible to make any concession.</P>
        <P>More recently, the Final Report of the Commission of Public Service Pensions, which was published in January 2001, was considered and broadly accepted by Government.  In its Report, the Commission recommended against a general re-opening of spouses&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s scheme membership options across the public service because of the major additional costs involved and concerns for the integrity and financing of the schemes.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest> if he will amend the superannuation scheme for military personnel in order that the additional increment paid to pensioners for each year of service in excess of 21 years service is applicable to those who avail of the social welfare retirement pension in their 65th year; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[39304/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the existing Defence Forces Pensions Schemes, the minimum service required for an immediate pension in the case of NCOs and Privates is 21 years.  The pension for 21 years&rsquo; service is a flat rate amount which varies according to rank and which, together with the addition for military service allowance, currently ranges from &euro;248.35 a week in the case of a Private to &euro;370.30 a week in the case of a Sergeant Major.  This pension is payable for the lifetime of the pensioner.</P>
        <P>Where service exceeds 21 years, the pension is increased by an additional flat rate amount &mdash; known as an additional increment and currently &euro;8.10 a week &mdash; for each such year of service up to a maximum of 31 years.  This additional increment continues to be payable until the pen<Col N="436"/>sioner reaches the qualifying age of 66 for an Old Age Contributory Pension or becomes entitled at an earlier age to a Social Welfare Retirement Pension, at which stage the payment ceases.  The maximum personal rate of either Social Welfare pension is currently &euro;193.30 a week (if aged under 80) and is considerably greater than the maximum additional increment of &euro;81.00 a week (after 31 years&rsquo; service when maximum pension is payable).</P>
        <P>These arrangements are in accordance with the principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits in the case of employees, such as NCOs and Privates, who are fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  This principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector.  I should say, however, that the method of applying the integration principle in the case of retired NCOs and Privates is less severe than that applying in other areas of the public service.</P>
        <P>The general issue of integration of occupational pensions in the public service was examined by the Commission on Public Service Pensions whose Final Report, published in January 2001, has been considered and broadly accepted by Government.  The Commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pensions framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued.  It did not make any recommendations that would affect the current integration arrangements applicable to retired NCOs and Privates.</P>

	<P>In common with other groups of public servants, there are certain circumstances whereby a civilian employee of my Department can retire in advance of the standard retirement age of 65.  Firstly, an employee with an ongoing serious medical condition who has at least five years&rsquo; pensionable service may apply to retire on grounds of ill-health.  An application of this nature is subject to the approval of the Chief Medical Officer, Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>In addition, employees aged at least 55 years may opt to avail of a cost neutral early retirement facility.  Under this facility, the pension and retirement lump sum received by the employee are actuarially reduced in accordance with actuarial tables issued by the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>Finally, in certain limited circumstances, my Department, with the approval of the Department of Finance, from time to time offers a voluntary early retirement package to certain <Col N="437"/>employees.  In general, this would arise when a decision is taken to close military sites or there is no longer a need for the Department to employ a person to provide a particular service.</P>

	<P>The Department and the Defence Forces use a number of different types of fuel.  These are electricity, oil and gas. Each type of fuel is measured in a different way and priced at different rates. For example electricity is measured in units, however the rates vary depending on time of usage, day rates, night rates and in other cases tariff charges.  Given the various measurement methods involved, it is not possible to determine quantities used for over thirty-three locations at such short notice.</P>

	<P el="0">I propose to take Questions Nos. 428 and 429 together.</P>
        <P>The Lower Liffey Valley Sewerage Scheme has been approved for funding in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007 at an estimated cost of &euro;31 million.  The scheme provides for the expansion of the Leixlip waste water treatment plant under one contract and for the upgrading and improvement of the waste water collection systems in Celbridge, Kilcock, Leixlip (including elimination of odours), Maynooth and Straffan under other contracts.   The works provided for in relation to Straffan have been completed and my Department has no proposals from Kildare County Council for any further works in the village.</P>
        <P>I recently conveyed approval to Kildare County Council to prepare contract documents <Col N="442"/>for the expansion of the Leixlip waste water treatment plant, subject to a number of conditions.  The Council&rsquo;s contract documents for the collection systems are under examination in my Department and are being dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

        <P>Under the social partnership agreement Towards 2016, a National Housing Strategy for People with Disabilities will be developed, as recommended in the NESC-Housing in Ireland report, in order to support the provision of tailored housing and housing support to people with disabilities.  This would have particular regard to adults with significant disabilities and people who experience mental illness and will be progressed through the establishment of a national group under the aegis of the Housing Forum, which is currently being reconstituted by my Department.</P>
        <P>Under the Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme, which is administered by local authorities, funding is made available to approved voluntary housing bodies providing accom<Col N="443"/>modation to meet special housing needs such as the elderly, homeless or persons with disabilities.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Department recoups to local authorities 90% of their current expenditure on accommodation related costs in respect of homeless persons including, where appropriate, persons with mental illness.</P>

Tests have been carried out to-date on all of the Department&rsquo;s main offices and it is expected that testing of the remaining offices will be completed in the coming months.  In cases where high levels of radon are detected remedial action will be taken following consultation with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Office of Public Works.</P>

	<P>The use of quads and other off-road vehicles has become an increasing problem in the Wicklow Uplands and the Wicklow Mountains National Park, and I share the concern about the inappropriate impacts of these vehicles.</P>
        <P>In so far as the National Park is concerned, the unauthorised use of off-road vehicles, including quad bikes, is prohibited.  Every effort is made by staff of my Department to monitor areas of the National Park where use of off-road vehicles might be suspected and to deter such unauthor<Col N="444"/>ized use.  Conservation Rangers also respond to calls from the public in this regard.</P>
        <P>Sites designated as Special Protection Areas (SPA) and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), whether located within or outside Wicklow Mountains National Park, enjoy special protection in law.  Where development is proposed to be carried out within these areas, regard must be had by local authorities in considering the relevant planning application to the need to protect the habitats or species involved.  Where activity is proposed to be undertaken which does not require planning permission, the consent of my Department must normally be sought: this will not be granted where significant adverse impact on the SAC or SPA would result.  These latter provisions have recently been strengthened and extended with a view inter alia to exercising more effective control or use of quads or other vehicles in protected areas.</P>
        <P>I have asked my Department to examine ways in which existing legislative and regulatory provisions can be more effectively used and better applied in relation to this problem: we are already actively finalising a joint strategy with Coillte and Wicklow County Council.</P>
        <P>All recorded monuments, including those located in the Dublin and Wicklow mountains, are protected under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004. My Department responds to reports from the public of any alleged damage or potential for damage to such monuments.  For example, my Department&rsquo;s archaeologists confirmed last year on foot of such a report that there was no evidence of specific damage to the passage tomb at Seefin from quad bikers.  The need for any additional operational measures to ensure the ongoing protection and conservation of this national monument is kept under review by my Department in consultation with the Office of Public Works.</P>

The local authority may seek recoupment from my Department for the difference between the cost of the site, including any development costs, and the price paid by the applicant to the authority for the site.
