    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I will call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the Teagasc recommendations on the EU nitrates directive, arrived at after extensive independent scientific analysis by 24 scientists, which would be acceptable in Europe if they were vigorously pursued and received uniform national support from the Departments of Agriculture and Food and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency, in addition to the support they enjoy from the Irish Farmers Association and Teagasc. The positive recommendations in the Teagasc proposals for changes in the nitrates directive and the extreme urgency for the future of Irish farming warrant a united approach on the part of farming organisations, Departments and the EPA in ensuring the adoption and implementation of the Teagasc document in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the Aer Lingus privatisation timetable and how the jobs of Aer Lingus staff in Shannon and other locations will be protected, what guarantee there is that the transatlantic fleet maintenance staff in Shannon will not be centralised under a new ownership structure and whether, in an economic downturn under an open skies policy, Shannon will be by-passed as a transatlantic airport by a privatised Aer Lingus with only a feeder service being provided to Dublin, which would have huge consequences for tourism and industry in the region.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1910"/>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the urgent need to have more community garda&iacute; engaged in frontline policing on the streets and working with people in their communities; that priority be given to investment in disadvantaged areas to urgently expand services to the youngest children in these communities by supporting pre-school and primary school initiatives; the urgent need to provide more social housing and to provide a clear Garda strategy, with resources, that deals effectively with the drug gangs that are destroying communities; and to make each of these issues a priority for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the need to get agreement in Brussels for the implementation of the nitrates directive based on the scientific evidence produced by Teagasc for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Food. It is vital that the D&aacute;il has a full and frank discussion on this important issue, which will decide the future of thousands of Irish farmers and the workers involved in the food industry. These decisions must be taken by the Ministers concerned, who should have some knowledge of the serious potential damage that would be caused by failure to get agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to reverse his decision not to designate the forthcoming Ryder Cup at the K Club, County Kildare, as a free-to-air television event as this will deny millions of Irish households the opportunity to watch the most significant international sporting event to be held here. In view of the importance of this issue, I hope the Ceann Comhairle will agree to this request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: in light of the disclosure by the Scottish authorities that preliminary tests have found a highly pathogenic strain of H5 avian flu in the wild bird population, there is an immediate need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to outline the steps she is taking to protect the domestic poultry industry against a potential outbreak of avian flu and to inform the consumer of the safety of Irish poultry products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform explain why funding would be removed from the immigrant welfare group NASC for its daring to seek to represent <Col N="1911"/>the interests of refugees and asylum seekers staying at the Kinsale Road accommodation centre, where management of that centre has raised many concerns and the residents of the centre feel their concerns are not being addressed.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11- ?>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to outline the steps she is taking to prepare for the arrival of avian flu, following the death of a swan in Scotland suspected to be caused by the deadly H5N1 virus, and the need for the Government to take a more proactive role in this regard to protect public safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the need for the Minister for Transport to establish a task force to identify and tackle congestion in the area bounded by the N4, the N7 and the M50 in west Dublin, with real funding commitments, given that the problem is already clearly unmanageable and people feel they are living in a gridlock box. The ongoing development of Adamstown and the new welcome employment opportunities at Grangecastle are going ahead without sufficient public transport infrastructure, some of which could be immediately provided, such as more buses, while the rail network could and should be electrified long before 2015.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to indicate his acceptance of the Teagasc report on the implementation of the nitrates directive in Ireland; the need for the implementation of an amended directive in a manner that recognises Irish conditions; and the needs of the environment and of agriculture as established by the Teagasc report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: not only must census data be collected and compiled but the Government must make a strong commitment to realise the promises made in the census 2006 advertising campaign. The public is being told in this campaign that census data is needed so that services can be planned for but similar promises were made in previous census years and the under-provision in many service areas, such as schools and hospitals, continues to pose significant problems for the people of Ireland. I call on the Government to recognise and act on the urgent need for targeted investment in schools, transport networks, hospitals, and public services so that rapidly developing areas like north Kildare are adequately supported and provided for.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1912"/>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: to debate the need for plans to counteract the threat of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu following the report of a case in Scotland this morning and the need to ascertain the level of preparedness required by Government to protect the health, economic and ecological well-being of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the reason 250 women from the south and the west of Ireland must die owing to the failure of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to provide a temporary breast screening service which has been offered by the Galway Clinic since 2003 and which is necessary to save their lives as BreastCheck will not be fully rolled out for all the women of the south and west until 2009.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of" RHead="Business">
    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 11<i>a, </i>motion re ministerial rota for parliamentary questions; No. 15, Registration of Deeds and Title Bill 2004 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Order for Report, Report and Final Stages; and No. 1, Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 11<i>a</i> shall be decided without debate and the D&aacute;il on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 25 April 2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, the Ceann Comhairle made no decision on the Standing Order 31 requests. The one with regard to avian flu is a serious issue and should be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I made a decision and I read it out. That is not a point of order.</P>
      <P>There are two proposals to put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 11<i>a</i> without debate, motion re ministerial rota for parliamentary questions, agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal that the D&aacute;il on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 25 April 2006 agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, is the Government going to close the D&aacute;il again for another two weeks? It is like a Government in exile. If it wants to go into exile, let it leave the country. It could not be closing the D&aacute;il again for another two weeks.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11- ?>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to show respect for the Chair and to Deputy Sargent <Col N="1913"/>who has been called. I ask the Deputy to resume his seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Government to show respect for the people of this country and the D&aacute;il. How could it be closing the D&aacute;il again for two more weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy does not want to resume his seat, he will have an earlier recess than anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Where will they put me? I will not be put out at all because the D&aacute;il will not be open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be put out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government and the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers are all in on it. Let us go to the country and let the people decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to resume his seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a disgrace that they are closing the D&aacute;il again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is strange that the only Easter rising mentioned by the Government is the Easter rising to run rather than face the music in the D&aacute;il. The Government needs to be reminded that the D&aacute;il should sit for much longer than it does. A term of 92 days a year is not a proper parliamentary term in European terms. With the Taoiseach in Armagh today talking to the British Prime Minister, it is fitting that if we are to have <Col N="1914"/>proper implementation of strand 3, whatever about strands 2 and 1, we should have the same sitting arrangements as Westminster.</P>
      <P>I seek to amend the proposal so that we return on Wednesday, 19 April 2006 at 2.30 p.m. That would give us an extra week&rsquo;s sitting. The D&aacute;il should not take 16 days&rsquo; recess when we face the numerous issues raised by Deputies under Standing Order 31. The issues raised should indicate to the Ceann Comhairle the inappropriateness of this break. I ask the Government to recognise that we must be in the House to articulate fully the views of the public. The Government cannot be left to operate without the public accountability the D&aacute;il would ensure. On that basis, I ask the Ceann Comhairle to allow an amendment to the effect that we come back a week earlier to get on with the business we are elected to carry out in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>On a point of order&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no provision for Independent Deputies to speak on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>We have this type of charade at every recess. It is designed for little more than public consumption. If we were genuine about this, we would examine it in a committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Deputy Sargent pressing the amendment?</P>

	<P>In respect of the A list of Bills to be published before the beginning of the next parliamentary session, only six of the 17 Bills have been published. Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate when the remainder will be published before the D&aacute;il resumes in two weeks&rsquo; time? What is the position of the two pharmacy Bills?</P>

      <P>Does the T&aacute;naiste agree with the comments made by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism this morning that it does not matter one iota what a Minister says in the D&aacute;il? He claimed he would seek advice from the EU on amendments to broadcasting legislation arising from his non-listing of the Ryder Cup as an event of national sporting importance.</P>

	<P>The commitment is to publish the Bills in the A list before the start of the next session. The defamation Bill, for example, will be discussed at the Government meeting next week. Several of these will be published between now and the next session.</P>
      <P>I will be bringing the heads of the pharmacy Bills to the Government in May. It is hoped we will have the legislation later this year. I am hoping to have it before the summer session. If not, it will be in the autumn session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism has taken the Dalton report on alleged drug abuse in the greyhound industry. Will he lay it in the Library for Members to read over the recess?</P>
      <P>On the failure to put the coverage of the Ryder Cup on free-to-air, Members will recall the Taoiseach&rsquo;s tour of television studios during Christmas. He even appeared on Setanta Sports in a golf jersey and told us he was trying to organise free-to-air for the Ryder Cup. He claimed from the Irish point of view we have to get and maximise the audience. Is he still working on it? Will there be any breakthrough between now and the tournament?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not familiar with the Dalton report and was not aware the Minister had received it. I assume he will bring it to the Government. It is normal practice for a report of that kind to be published unless there are some legal reasons why it cannot.</P><Col N="1917"/>
      <P>The Ryder Cup will not be free-to-air due to several reasons, including advice from the Attorney General and contractual arrangements entered into when the Ryder Cup agreed to come to Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

	<P>Whatever about the euphemism of the Easter Rising meaning a long D&aacute;il holiday and considering the Government will be giving a military show of strength over the Easter, where is the promised legislation on the exports of arms? Will the control of exports Bill take into account the Forf&aacute;s recommendations from September 2003 recognising that Irish export licensing does not control the exports or brokering of arms and security equipment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the outbreak of H5N1 avian flu in Scotland yesterday, will the T&aacute;naiste clarify the enactment of section 54 of the Health Act 1947 which was amended by the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill? It will allow for the labelling of the country of origin of all foods used in the catering trade. The Bill was passed by the House but has not yet been enacted. I asked the Taoiseach last week on the matter and he informed me he would get back to me. With yesterday&rsquo;s news, it is of critical importance to the food industry that clear and concise food labelling is introduced so consumers know they are buying Irish products and not imported products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy acknowledged the Bill was passed. It is a matter of drafting regulations to implement those particular provisions which is happening as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste said she was not familiar with the Dalton report. However, since last year she has been sitting on a report on neurosurgery. For some inexplicable reason, it has not been published. Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure <Col N="1918"/>the publication of the report which has major implications for many seriously ill people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>All reports of that kind are published as a matter of routine after they have been considered by the Cabinet. We need to increase the number of consultant posts in neurology as there are only some 60 existing posts. It is important to have a new contract of employment with hospital consultants so we can have them on appropriate terms.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already raised the issue of equality legislation at the Joint Committee on Health and Children as well as under Standing Order 31. There is a need for such legislation for the 250 women who are going to die before BreastCheck is rolled out in 2009.</P>

	<P>That is what is going to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should allow his colleague, Deputy Catherine Murphy, to contribute or else we will have to move on to the next business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>Those women are definitely going to die so I am asking the T&aacute;naiste to answer that point now. She did not answer it at the Joint Committee on Health and Children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle has been very helpful in the past so he might be able to help me now. ESB meters are no longer read on a bi-monthly basis and this has resulted in some meters not being read for up to 14 months or two years.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This is a cluster of drafting amendments relating to the collective citation and the entry into force of sections 76 and 77. Since sections 76 and 77 contain amendments to the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 it is not appropriate to include them in the collective citation contained in subsection 2.</P>
      <P>Amendments 2 and 3 provide that sections 76 and 77 will come into effect following passage of the Bill without need for a commencement order.

	<P>I ask because this legislation envisages a new dispensation in terms of the registration of deeds and titles to make it more accessible and to make conveyancing easier. What equipment, resources and personnel recruitment will be required to implement the legislation? Has it been put in train or are we awaiting the legislation to be passed before we put in place the necessary equipment and resources and recruit the necessary personnel?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>We recently passed the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill and the ombudsman commission is supposedly up and running. However, there are hitches regarding a number of matters which I do not want to go into and it does not seem we will have an effective ombudsman commission for 12 or 18 months. The Private Security Services Bill was published in 2001 and was passed in 2004. <Col N="1926"/>The Minister eventually appointed the authority in 2005. As we saw last week, security firms operate under a voluntary code because the authority has not drawn up a statutory code for them.</P>
      <P>There is no sense in us passing legislation which requires a fair amount of structure to underpin it and then finding that nothing happens after the legislation is passed and it lies idle. The purpose of this Bill is to speed up and streamline the property market so we can move on deeds, titles and conveyancing, bring it into the electronic age and modernise it. I know it is not easy for the Minister of State to come here and speak on this Bill. Perhaps he will outline the steps that will be taken to ensure it is other than aspirational.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Costello. Approximately half of the Bills that go through this House come from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We find that after spending hours debating Bills and amendments, the resources to implement them have not been properly thought out, and those resources are not available a long time after a Bill is passed. We constantly state the Minister would be better off implementing Bills already on the books rather than dreaming up new ideas on a constant basis without any thought as to how they will be implemented or how resources will be made available. This is another example. This Bill is important from a business and efficiency point of view. If the track record is anything to go by, all we will get is the Bill and not its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 7, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">3.<i>&mdash;Part 3</i> of this Act shall cease to apply to the registration of new deeds as and from <Col N="1927"/>the date on which the Act of 1964 is applied by the Minister so as to require compulsory registration of title throughout this State.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is not unrelated to what we were discussing. I am concerned that despite the 1964 Act, we have an extremely poor level of registering title deeds. Under the 1964 legislation we are supposed to have compulsory registration throughout the country. Only three counties, namely, Laois, Carlow and Meath, have been registered. The Minister has begun the process of registration in Longford, Roscommon and Leitrim. Surely, compulsory registration is the way to achieve savings in conveyancing costs and all titles should be registered in the State.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned establishing a property registration authority. We already have the 1964 Act in place, which makes provision for compulsory registration, but we have only registered title in three counties. God knows how long it will take to get something done under this legislation. It will be another 50 years before we have compulsory registration of title. That should be moved on. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the first Minister in donkey&rsquo;s years to move the process on at least a little, as he considers fully registering three other counties. We have 26 counties to register, with an amount of title relating to cross-Border land, which would be even more difficult to deal with in many situations. Three from 26 leaves a great deal to be desired. Since 1964, 42 years have passed.</P>
      <P>I raise this as an indication of how backward and slow we have been in dealing with this matter and how outdated are our present land registry and registry of deeds systems. We are in a mess and do not know where the title is, its quality or the registration of the title. We transfer and interchange title at a colossal rate, and Ireland is one of the leading countries to do so as the property market goes through a boom, with the accompanying sale of land and transfer of title. We are still in the dark ages when it comes to conducting our business. We should consider compulsory registration of title for the State. The Minister of State might indicate whether there is a move to initiate and institute compulsory registration of title nationwide. If so, are extra resources being put in place, extra staff being recruited and a map drawn of how the country will achieve full registration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an extremely important Bill from a business point of view. There is a high volume of property transactions with unacceptable delays in solicitor&rsquo;s offices and generally in the transfer of property, which hamper business. If there is not some degree of compulsion in the Bill it will go the same way as many other Bills from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That is, it will be passed and shelved, and no resources or determi<Col N="1928"/>nation will be put into implementing its provisions.</P>
      <P>This is the first time for many years a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has attempted to take on this issue, in a small way, but Fianna F&aacute;il has been in power for 18 of the past 20 years and the Minister&rsquo;s party has been in power for ten years. It is time to start doing something rather than talking about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister cannot accept this amendment because it is not necessary. The amendment presupposes that extended compulsory registration is the only method by which the registration of ownership of land can be extended. Any person outside a compulsory registration area can apply to have his or her land registered in the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>The definition of deed in section 31 provides that any document, in so far as it affects registered land, cannot be registered in the register of deeds and Part 3 cannot therefore apply to any registered land.</P>
      <P>From 1 April this year, Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath are compulsory registration areas. One of the specific objectives of the new authority is to accelerate compulsory registration throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Longford, Roscommon, Westmeath sounds more like a song than a registration process. When did the Minister initiate that compulsory registration and when is it envisaged that it will be complete? What is the next set of counties to be affected? Will they be taken, not two by two like the animals entering Noah&rsquo;s Ark, but three by three <i>ad infinitum</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>This will be one of the first strategic issues with which the new authority will deal. One of its primary objectives is to accelerate the compulsory registration process. I am not in a position to pre-empt what the new authority will do.</P>

Have the resources been earmarked and obtained from the Minister for Finance to do this? It is extremely important for the health of the nation to deal efficiently with property and land sales. We do not want to see another Act sitting on the books without the proper resources, and therefore useless, and all our time here wasted.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This proposal was discussed on Committee Stage and the Minister said there was no need to <Col N="1930"/>include it in the legislation. While I accept that we live in changing times which places new demands on the public service, this Bill will have a significant effect on commercial and private business. Many young people are involved in property deals and any delay can be expensive. It is important that the authority is run in a customer-friendly way and is open for hours that are suitable for individuals and businesses that want to deal with it. If the Minister agrees to emphasise this to the authority or include it in its terms of reference I will withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister cannot accept this amendment because it provides for operational matters rather than the authority&rsquo;s statutory functions. The Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry will be managed by the property registration authority which will be responsible for administrative matters such as the opening hours of offices. It is neither necessary nor appropriate to include provisions for matters such as opening hours in primary legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister is, however, sympathetic to the concerns underlying the amendment and expects the authority to take full advantage of information and communication technology in the development of its services especially on-line access where appropriate.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This amendment is an effort to ensure solicitors or barristers appointed to the authority have sufficient experience to ensure they do the job. While the Minister was reasonably sympathetic to the amendment on Committee Stage he ruled it out.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is extremely important that when people are to be appointed to State boards the legislation specifies they must have the proper qualifications and experience to ensure they can do the job properly.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 11, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(d) being convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty,</P>
      <P LI="2">(e) being disqualified or restricted from being a director of any company,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">When discussing subsection (13) on Committee Stage, the Minister stated he would re-examine the grounds upon which an individual ceases to be a member of the authority. In particular, he stated he would re-examine the grounds of bankruptcy and the making of a compositional arrangement with creditors. Arising from this re-examination, it appears these two grounds are common to the various statutory bodies established over the past number of years. For this reason, the Minister does not propose to delete the grounds relating to bankruptcy and arrangements with creditors.</P>
      <P>However, other legislation of this type includes additional grounds under which an individual shall cease to be a member, such as being convicted of an offence for fraud or dishonesty and being disqualified or restricted from being a company director. The Minister has, therefore, decided that these additional grounds should be included in the Bill, which is the purpose of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 11, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(14) Without prejudice to <i>subsection (12)</i>, a cesser under <i>subsection (13)(a)</i> or <i>(c)</i> by virtue of an order of a court shall not operate until the ordinary time for appeal has expired, or until the final determination of any appeal lodged during such time, whichever last occurs.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment is related to amendment No. 12 because the Minister agreed to re-examine some of the grounds under which an individual could be disqualified from membership of the authority. I have two concerns about his proposals. The first is that nobody should be disqualified without having access to due process so that an appeal would be completed before any disqualification could take place. This is the thrust of the amendment, <Col N="1932"/>which states a cesser under <i>subsection (13)(a)</i> or <i>(c)</i> by virtue of an order of a court shall not operate until the ordinary time for appeal has expired, or until the final determination of any appeal lodged during such time, whichever last occurs. This relates to when a person is asked to step down but appeals the decision. The amendment provides that the final decision will not become operational until such time as the process had been determined.</P>
      <P>The Minister agreed to examine my second concern, which relates to some of the grounds for disqualification. An individual can be disqualified from the authority if he or she is adjudicated bankrupt. All bankruptcy means is that someone has lost his or her money. It does not mean that he or she has committed a crime or gone through a court process. Bankruptcy should not result in automatic disqualification. According to the Minister of State, the Minister has decided not to delete this section because it appeared somewhere else. I do not believe that bankruptcy is a ground for disqualification and it seems strange to include simple bankruptcy as a ground for disqualification in the Bill. Anyone could, for one reason or another, find himself or herself bankrupt. Many people find themselves in such a predicament during the course of their lifetime, depending on the nature of their employment or developments in the areas in which they have invested. Bankruptcy may not have been due to any misbehaviour on their part. It does not suggest that there has been any referral to the courts for prosecution.</P>
      <P>Making a compositional arrangement with creditors also does not smack of criminality or any form of misbehaviour. It is the normal procedure which takes place when a bankruptcy occurs. Creditors must be dealt with and the law demands that a compositional arrangement is set up. It is quite innocent and should not be grounds for anyone to lose his or her position on a board if he or she has been appointed to it as a result of his or her talents or abilities.</P>
      <P>Being sentenced to imprisonment on conviction on indictment and ceasing to be an ordinary resident in the State are appropriate grounds for disqualification. If a member does not reside in the State, he or she cannot do his or her job. It is unfair to use bankruptcy and the making of arrangements with creditors as grounds for disqualification or removal from the authority. The Minister should re-examine the situation.</P>
      <P>If an individual becomes bankrupt for legitimate reasons, he or she is entitled to appeal his or her removal from the board. Why should he or she be removed from the board until his or her appeal is heard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated in my reply to amendment No. 12, the Minister does not intend to amend this section, which is a standard provision in all legislation. I have some sympathy with Deputy Costello&rsquo;s position but bankruptcy is <Col N="1933"/>likely to be very rare among the people who will be appointed members.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not believe that amendment No. 13 is necessary as it is implicit that in such circumstances, a person will cease to become a member of the authority only after all proceedings have been completed and a final determination has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not sufficient to simply say that this is a standard provision. What does this mean? There could be standard provisions in legislation which new legislation will update. The fact that a standard provision has existed in previous legislation does not mean it has an aura of absolute correctness. Such provision can be examined as much as any other provision. If it is not a proper provision, it should be deleted. I do not doubt that if someone becomes bankrupt, makes a compositional arrangement with creditors and is removed from the authority by the Minister, he or she will successfully appeal the decision. Why include this unnecessary bureaucracy in this legislation? Legislation should be simple, straightforward and relevant. A provision should not be included simply because it is standard practice in old legislation. Given that this Bill might return to the Seanad, the best course of action is to delete these two sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand this is a standard provision which has been included in some reasonably recent legislation. This provision has been included in legislation for a very long time for a good reason. The Bill lists these standard provisions as reasons for people to step down as members of the authority. Deputy Costello could probably raise this issue in another forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The motto of the Progressive Democrats was to be radical or redundant and to move out into new ground and avoid standard provisions. I still believe the only argument for retaining this provision is that it is a standard provision. It has no merit in its own right.</P>

      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) The Freedom of Information Act 1997 shall apply to the Authority.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This matter is an old hobby horse of mine. We introduced the Freedom of Information Act so there would be access to important matters that seem to be shrouded in mystery within the bowels of the State. All legislation should be subject to the Freedom of Information Act unless specifically excluded rather than being excluded and listed further down the line as legislation that becomes subject to the Act. We are putting the <Col N="1934"/>cart before the horse, as the purpose of the Act is accountability and transparency.</P>
      <P>Let us pass legislation that we can stand over and allow access to decisions made under it. We are shrouding in secrecy decisions made in respect of State bodies and legislative provisions as much as we can. There is no reason not to specify that the authority should be subject to the Freedom of Information Act. There may be matters that must be addressed with a level of discretion but, in general terms, the proceedings of the authority should be subject to freedom of information legislation. We should not need to wait until the future when somebody may or may not get around to including this Bill, when enacted, on the list of legislative provisions open to freedom of information questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Costello&rsquo;s amendment. In recent weeks, this matter arose on Committee Stage of another Bill. The Minister of State spoke about standard provisions in a Bill &mdash; this should be a standard provision in every Bill and for every authority that is established. A number of exceptions could be discussed but the applicability of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 to all authorities and legislation should be standard practice.</P>
      <P>There is a growing feeling that since the restrictions were placed on the Freedom of Information Act, activities have been conducted in such a way as to prevent people finding information on them. It is a significant issue for the general public, as the Act provides security for people in that they can discover exactly what is happening within a particular service or Department. I do not see why this essential provision should not be included in the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister agreed on Committee Stage that the property registration authority <Col N="1935"/>should, in principle, be subject to the Freedom of Information Act 1997 in the same manner as the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds. However, instead of amending the primary legislation as proposed in the amendment, it is intended to include the authority in a set of regulations currently being drawn up by the Department of Finance that will extend the application of the 1997 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>That is something. We have moved further down the road and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s progress. Section 15, which I will try to amend, states: &ldquo;Unless otherwise provided for by law, a person shall not, without the consent of the Authority, disclose any confidential information obtained while performing, or as a result of having performed, duties as a member of the Authority or advisory committee or as a consultant or an adviser appointed by the Authority&rdquo;. This is a gagging mechanism and I am concerned that previously established parameters in the Bill are restrictive in terms of freedom of information. It will be difficult for any worthwhile question under the Freedom of Information Act to elicit useful information because of the confidentiality clause contained in this section. It puts the authority on notice that there should be no disclosure of information in so far as is possible without the authority of the body.</P>
      <P>There is no sign of whistleblower legislation in section 15, which tells authority members to keep quiet and, if they open their mouths, they could be in trouble. I am not happy with this type of gagging legislation. It is not standard practice in legislation. Wherever applicable, State bodies should be subject to the Freedom of Information Act&rsquo;s provisions and disclosures should be permitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>In my responsibility as Minister of State at the Department of Finance, I extend the applications of the Freedom of Information Act annually, including to new agencies, authorities or whatever. Deputy Costello referred to putting the cart before the horse, but that does not apply in this instance. The Government is committed to extending the Freedom of Information Act to the RSA as soon as it is established. Confidentiality is a significant issue, as are sensitivities in respect of freedom of information and, in particular, the ownership of land. Regarding the provisions to which the Deputy referred, they are intended to protect confidentiality in the above areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Irrespective of the section, I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s point on confidentiality in terms of important and sensitive information relating to titles and so on, but the thrust of my amendment concerns the broader issues of transparency, accountability and freedom of information. Most people would agree that the opposite to the Minister&rsquo;s comments is the case. <Col N="1936"/>There is much less freedom of information now than before the Government entered office. Significant costs and restrictions have been placed on ordinary citizens accessing information that should be readily available.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is particularly appropriate that this Bill is being considered by this House, given the renewed debate at European level on the need for a common European energy policy and the changing energy landscape internationally. The Bill, when enacted, will provide an important component in driving forward the Government&rsquo;s progressive energy agenda. Given Europe&rsquo;s dependence on a small number of external suppliers, and security of supply issues, this Bill is timely. Increasing demand on fuel resources, and concerns about long-term availability of supplies are driving forward the need for consensus on a wide range of energy issues.</P>
      <P>This Bill forms a key part of the Government&rsquo;s priority legislative programme. It is the result of ongoing consultation between officials of my Department, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, and key market players. For the convenience of the House, a detailed explanatory memorandum has been published which provides a synopsis of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions. The Bill proposes to assign additional functions to the CER, which is the independent body responsible for regulating and overseeing the liberalisation of Ireland&rsquo;s energy sector. These new responsibilities include participation in the development of an all-island energy market, regulation of the activities of electricity and gas installers and the regulation and promotion of natural gas safety.</P>
      <P>Other provisions of the Bill include amending the definition of combined heat and power, CHP; the conferral of power on the Minister to issue policy directions to the CER; provision for the full opening of the natural gas market; and provision for the taking of emergency measures by the Minister in the event of a sudden crisis in the energy market.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In order to contextualise the various provisions of the Bill, I propose to speak briefly on the important role played by the CER in discharging its statutory functions. Established as the independent regulatory body with responsibility for electricity under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, the CER&rsquo;s powers and responsibilities were extended under the Gas (Interim)(Regulation) Act 2002 to cover regulation of the natural gas market. As the independent regulator for the electricity market, the CER facilitates competition by authorising the construction of new generating plant and licensing companies to generate and supply electricity. The CER also has responsibility for the regulating of prices charged to customers by the ESB, in its capacity as public electricity supplier. Within the gas sector, the CER grants licences to suppliers and other <Col N="1940"/>market players and has the power to regulate prices charged to certain gas customers.</P>
      <P>The CER assumes an active regulatory stance with regard to the operation, maintenance and development of the electricity and gas transmission and distribution networks. Partnered with this role, it also has responsibility for the approval of tariffs for third party access to these systems. In carrying out its various functions and responsibilities, the CER has a statutory obligation to exercise its powers in a manner which in respect of electricity, does not discriminate unfairly between holders of licences, authorisations and the Electricity Supply Board, or between applicants for authorisations or licences; with regard to gas, does not discriminate unfairly between holders of licences or consents and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, or between applicants for consents or licences; and protects the interests of final customers of electricity or gas or both.</P>
      <P>Given its already wide-ranging knowledge and experience of both the gas and electricity markets and its statutory responsibility to carry out its activities in a fair and impartial fashion, the CER is evidently best placed to tackle the additional functions and responsibilities proposed by the provisions of this Bill. I shall now address these provisions in more detail.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Section 3 of the Bill amends the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, hereafter described as the 1999 Act, by providing that it shall be a new function of the CER to participate in the development of an all-island energy market. Currently, policy on such a market is encapsulated in the all-island energy market development framework published in November 2004 by the Minister and his then Northern Ireland ministerial counterpart, Barry Gardiner MP.</P>
      <P>The framework, produced in consultation with the two regulatory authorities and with energy stakeholders, sets out the commitment of both Governments to achieving a single energy market that will contribute to a more secure and cost efficient service for all consumers. It includes a high level development programme setting out goals and timeframes over the next few years for an all-island approach to electricity, gas and sustainable energy.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In order to further this commitment to an all-island energy market, section 3 provides that the CER will also be granted the power to arrange for the establishment of a &ldquo;single market operator&rdquo; which will, when established, operate a system of contracts and arrangements for trading in electricity on the island of Ireland. This measure will serve to underpin the ongoing co-operation between the CER and its counterparts in Northern Ireland in developing the all-island energy market.</P>
      <P>The resulting integration of the energy markets on the island as a whole will, overtime, result in a number of positive benefits, which include the removal of market distortions and the minimisation of the upward pressure on wholesale elec<Col N="1941"/>tricity costs. It will also create a more attractive location for investment in new electricity generation within the island of Ireland and serve to improve overall security and reliability of electricity supplies throughout the entire island.</P>
      <P>Whereas section 3 provides for the development of an all-island energy market, sections 13 and 14 of the Bill amend the Gas Act 1976 to provide for the full opening of the natural gas market. The section provides that any person shall be entitled to switch his or her natural gas supplier if he or she so wishes. It further provides that a natural gas supplier acting on behalf of any person may be granted third party access to gas pipelines or facilities. The upshot of these provisions is that the benefits of liberalisation previously enjoyed by industrial and commercial consumers will be extended to all natural gas customers, allowing them to shop around for their supplier and to obtain the best value for their money. The market will then be fully contestable.</P>
      <P>It is important to note these sections include a commencement provision, which serves to ensure the market will be fully open no later than the 1 July 2007 deadline set by the EU directive requirements. However, so as not to delay matters unnecessarily, and should the necessary administrative and technical measures be in place prior to this date, provision is also made allowing the Minister to make an order or orders to open the gas market either in part, or in whole, in advance of this deadline.</P>
      <P>Turning to the new powers and responsibilities to be allocated to the CER, sections 4 and 11 of the Bill amend the 1999 Act by providing for the regulation by the CER of electrical contractors and gas installers, respectively. These sections, in conjunction with section 8, which provide for the taking of emergency measures in certain specified circumstances, and section 10, which covers the issue of natural gas safety in general, demonstrate that central concerns in the drafting of the Bill were the issue of safety and security of supply in so far as they relate to energy matters. It is with this in mind that I am particularly pleased to put forward these provisions for the consideration of Members of the House.</P>
      <P>Sections 4 and 11 provide that the CER may establish standards of training for both electrical contractors and gas installers in regard to safety in their areas of work. Under the provisions of the Bill, the CER will have the power to designate persons to be electrical or gas safety supervisory bodies, which will be required to operate in accordance with criteria and procedures published by the CER. Under CER oversight, these bodies will be allocated responsibility for the registration of electrical contractors and gas installers, as appropriate. They will have the power to inspect work carried out by their various members, monitor and review the training of their various members and suspend or revoke the membership of one of their members for certain <Col N="1942"/>specified reasons, including where work carried out by that member is unsafe or of an unsatisfactory standard.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure fairness and transparency in the activities of any such body, and between such a body and its various members, any fees or charges imposed by any such body will be subject to CER approval. Furthermore, any decision by such a body to suspend or revoke the membership of one or more of its members will be subject to appeal to the CER.</P>
      <P>Both sections also provide that the CER shall have responsibility for the following associated measures relating to the activities of electrical contractors and gas installers. It will have the power to appoint authorised officers for the inspection of electrical or gas works; the designation, by means of regulations, of certain works as being solely the province of electrical contractors or gas installers, as appropriate; the designation of the requirement for completion certificates for specified works carried out; and the power to prosecute rogue installers or contractors.</P>
      <P>Section 11 also provides for a natural gas transmission system operator and a distribution system operator to appoint a gas emergency officer, with powers to enter land and take emergency measures, where there is a danger to a person or property arising from natural gas. This reflects the particularities of the use of gas as a source of energy, such as its combustible nature and the means by which it is transported, as well as the multi-operator environment envisaged for the market. The CER will also have the power to appoint a gas safety officer to assist in the carrying out of its new gas safety functions.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Section 12 is an enabling provision, which acts as an addendum to section 11, allowing the Minister to make an order to extend certain of the Bill&rsquo;s natural gas safety provisions such as regulation of installers to include liquefied petroleum gas, LPG. Whereas sections 4 and 11 focus on the activities of individual tradespersons in order to provide for proper regulation of their activities, the purpose of section 8 is to take account of the probability, however remote, of a sudden crisis taking place in the energy market. Its provisions are, therefore, designed to ensure the physical safety and security of persons and energy infrastructure, as well as the integrity of the transmission and distribution systems for natural gas or electricity, are protected. Under the section&rsquo;s provisions, the Minister can, where there is such an evident cause of major concern within the energy market, by order, direct the CER or certain electricity or natural gas market players to take whatever safeguard measures the Minister considers necessary with regard to the circumstances. It is important to note, however, that this is not a <i>carte blanche</i> provision. ln making such an order, the Minister will be obligated to ensure that, whatever action is taken under this section, the potential impacts to the gas and electricity <Col N="1943"/>markets are kept to a minimum. Also, any direction given must not go beyond what the circumstances of the particular crisis dictates. A standard revocation-amendment provision is included to allow for the fact that such crises are likely to be, by their nature, short-term. These provisions are in line with EU requirements on security of energy supply.</P>
      <P>As previously outlined, section 10 of the Bill serves to expand the functions of the CER to include the regulation and active promotion of natural gas safety. ln this context, the CER will be required to consult the National Standards Authority of Ireland regarding standards and specifications relating to gas safety. The purpose of this provision is to copperfasten Ireland&rsquo;s continued success in meeting with international best practice. Similar to section 11, section 10 also takes account of the nature of gas as a source of energy. Towards this end, the section imposes certain obligations on the CER as to how it will regulate natural gas safety. Under the section, the CER, having consulted with the Minister, will be required to establish and implement a natural gas safety framework. This framework must include, but is not limited to, inspection and testing regimes for downstream transmission and distribution pipelines, and for storage and liquefied natural gas facilities. Any such framework must also focus on the regulation and certification of natural gas installers and provide for procedures for the investigation of complaints against them.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Furthermore, in the interests of transparency, the CER will be required to report to the Minister on an annual basis on the functioning of this framework. The CER will also have the power to direct natural gas undertakings to advise their customers and the public as to natural gas safety. By providing for a gas safety framework, for reporting mechanisms to be in place, and for the power to issue directions, a more comprehensive and holistic approach to natural gas safety will be achieved. Apart from issues relating to safety and security, the Bill also serves to rectify an impediment in current legislation. It goes without saying that east-west and North-South electricity interconnection are critical planks of the Government&rsquo;s energy policy. Both can provide strong physical links with Northern Ireland and mainland UK, and will serve to integrate Ireland into wider European markets.</P>
      <P>Section 7 amends the 1999 Act for the purpose of providing for an electricity interconnector owned by a person other than the ESB to be subject to authorisation and licence granted by the CER. For technical reasons relating to the definition of the electrical transmission system, the section also provides that such an interconnector shall not be part of the transmission system except where it comes to the issue of calculating and imposing charges for the transmission system&rsquo;s use. Under the provisions of the section, the CER may also, with the consent of the Mini<Col N="1944"/>ster, secure the construction of an interconnector by specified means, including by competitive tender; by authorisation granted without a prior competitive tender, but which must be seen to be necessary and in the long-term interests of final customers; or directly, by requesting the transmission system operator to provide for its construction as part of the CER&rsquo;s development plan.</P>
      <P>Provision is also made to ensure an interconnector operator shall offer access to the interconnector on the basis of published non-discriminatory terms, which will be subject to the approval or, if deemed necessary, the direction of the CER. To ensure fair play between interconnector operators and applicants for access to the interconnector, a dispute appeals mechanism is also provided for with the CER as final arbiter.</P>
      <P>While concentrating in the main on new functions to be allocated to the CER, the Bill also provides for the improvement of its inner workings and administration. Towards this end, section 9 provides for an acting chairperson to be appointed to the CER by the Minister in circumstances where the chairperson is unavailable to perform his or her duties or functions. This allows for a degree of flexibility in the inner workings of the CER and takes account of the various contingencies which can occur outside the normal day-to-day operations of any organisation.</P>
      <P>Further flexibility in the internal workings of the CER is provided for by allowing the chairperson to have a casting vote where a difference of opinion has not been resolved through the usual decision-making process. Such a mechanism is a standard provision, in this case modelled on similar mechanisms governing the workings of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. To enhance the accountability of the CER to both the Minister and the Oireachtas, while also reflecting the reality of the day-to-day business operations of any publicly accountable body, the appropriate timing of the submission by the CER of its annual accounts and work programmes is provided for.</P>
      <P>Again, using similar provisions governing the activities of ComReg as a template, section 6 provides that the Minister may, in the interests of the proper and effective regulation of both the electricity and natural gas markets, give general policy directions to the CER relating to the exercise of its statutory functions. It is important to note that such powers would be used sparingly and always in the public interest. Any policy direction which the Minister may wish to put forward will be subject to a public consultation process. Such a process can serve to improve upon the <i>modus operandi</i> of the CER by increasing its awareness of public concerns and issues.</P>
      <P>Section 5 amends the Act of 1999 by replacing the definition of combined heat and power, CHP, with a new definition of CHP as set out in Directive 2004/8/EC, and by providing for the methodology through which the various forms of CHP can be calculated. CHP is the simultaneous <Col N="1945"/>generation of useable heat and electricity in a single process. It makes use of the heat produced in electricity generation instead of releasing it into the atmosphere and has a less detrimental effect on the environment than if heat and power were produced independently. It is not strictly a renewable energy but contributes to general energy efficiency and can make considerable energy savings for businesses and industry.</P>
      <P>The new definition will facilitate the establishment of a guarantee of origin system for high efficiency CHP, establishment of appropriate support mechanisms and reporting to the European Commission as required by the directive. It is an important step in ensuring that support for CHP in Ireland can be targeted to achieve optimum energy efficiency and environmental protection. Section 5 also provides for the appointment by the Minister of a person who will be allocated responsibility for the calculation and certification of power-to-heat ratios of specific CHP units.</P>
      <P>Section 15 deals with a further legal lacuna by providing that a 10% capital stockholding in the ESB be vested in the Minister to give him or her the same legal entitlement as other capital stock shareholders. The Minister, the person to whom the ESB normally reports in a shareholding capacity, does not have any shareholding representation in the company and, accordingly, does not have the rights and obligations of other stockholders, such as voting rights at annual general meetings. At present, the issued capital stock in the ESB is apportioned between the Minister for Finance &mdash; 95% &mdash; and the employee share ownership plan &mdash; 5%. Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Finance, it was agreed to rectify this matter through the divestment by the Minister for Finance of 10% of the capital stock to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Bill is an important measure in the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s developing energy policy. By focusing on the issue of safety while also taking account of the need to progress the integration of an all-island market for energy, the Bill will, on enactment, have considerable benefits for all electricity and gas consumers, be they industrial or domestic. The Minister and I look forward to working closely with the CER on ensuring the speedy implementation of the Bill&rsquo;s various provisions following enactment. I therefore look forward to listening carefully to the views of Members of this House on this important legislation and their assistance in progressing the Bill into law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill for what it contains, which is not very much. That is not a criticism of the Minister of State. When so much attention is focused on the energy industry, not only here but throughout Europe and worldwide, I would have expected the Bill to contain some earth-shattering proposals to deal with future <Col N="1946"/>energy requirements, to recognise the instability of energy markets and supply, especially arising from developments in eastern Europe, and to recognise the need to provide to a much greater extent, from within our own resources, by one means or another, for alternative energy production and for research and development into such production. Unfortunately the Bill does not contain any of those, although it refers to them. It deals with what are largely housekeeping issues which essentially should have been dealt with about four years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Four years ago would have been the time to introduce this Bill, and over the intervening period we could have developed the industry to the extent to which we now require it to be developed. I notice that one section of the Bill allows for the Minister to take emergency action, as it were. When one gets to the stage of emergency action it is too late. If Ministers and the various agencies do their job, the requirement for emergency, fire-brigade action should not arise. I emphasise that especially in the energy industry. Everyone knows that a major blackout or power failure is an emergency. That is when things start to hop and when everything begins to boil except the kettle. That is when everybody will realise it is too late. It should not come to that juncture.</P>
      <P>The flaws are as I have already outlined. The Bill does not provide for the development of the alternative energy sector. It merely refers to energy in general. It does not take account of the fact that in Ireland we have a 90% dependency on imported fossil fuels for energy. Although the legislation could and should address that issue, it does not.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Bill takes account of the need to give more powers to the Commission for Energy Regulation. I am sure the regulator needs increased powers to supervise the industry. However, the Bill also refers to the fact that in the regulation, there is a necessity to pass on to the consumer the benefits of deregulation. I question what the benefits to the consumer have been. Since deregulation was thought of, the regulator has devoted most effort to suggesting increases in energy prices to the consumer. I do not know how that comes about but the consumer has begun to pay through the nose. The Minister remains coy on this issue, does not want to get involved, and never will want to get involved. The Minister does not want to come to the House and seek permission to raise the price of electricity to the consumer. This will be done by the regulator in the future, as it has already been done over the past three years by the regulator in respect of electricity and gas. The Bill as it stands merely gives legislative effect to the powers the regulator already has, or should have and should have operated, to the benefit of the consumer.</P><Col N="1947"/>
      <P Just="Left">Let us consider other matters to which the Bill does not refer. It only refers in passing to EU energy policy. As we all know, the European Union, like the rest of the world, has taken time out to focus on the issue of energy, or lack of it as the case may be. Suddenly, great emphasis is now being placed throughout Europe and the world on how to allow countries become less dependent on imported oil or other fuels. In the rest of Europe, a different situation prevails. Whether we like it or not, they have access to other energies. They have a much higher level of hydro energy, research and development and work done in developing alternative energy sources throughout Europe and they have nuclear energy. The Bill should have obtained an analysis of the right marriage of fuels to be used in the future energy industry. I emphasise that simply because it is being done in Europe over our heads. We have only two parts of the equation: we have hydro to a limited extent and wind energy to whatever extent we want, depending on the degree to which we can contain it within the grid. We do not have nuclear energy. That is not an option for us. We are out of that part of the equation altogether and we must remain out of it. However, we have to develop some other element that will ensure we can avail of the maximum amount of wind energy and biofuels and at the same time ensure continuity of supply, all of which requires a fair amount of ingenuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has anyone asked Mr. David McWilliams where we will put the nuclear reactor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the old story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it be in Wexford?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely. Could it be like the incinerator for Ringsend where one Minister said it shall not be in Wicklow and another Minister said it shall not be in Ringsend? In that case we could be treated to the unthinkable spectacle at the next general election of two Ministers up the same pole, at the same time, one telling the people of the benefits of incineration and the other with a placard saying, &ldquo;I will defend your right to say no&rdquo;. I am not suggesting the Minister of State will be part and parcel of that type of hypocrisy. This whole area will have a huge impact on our economic development side by side with our European colleagues.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There has been virtually no research and development into alternative energy here or into how we break from our dependence on fuel imports. We have one or two notable exceptions. The University of Limerick, Dundalk IT and University College Cork have spent a considerable amount of time and expertise in this area. However, it needs much more support and a huge impetus that can only come from Government, <Col N="1948"/>not from CER or anywhere else. If it gets that support we can identify the optimum mix of energy that will be required for the foreseeable future while maintaining our economic independence.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to the all-island energy market. That is desirable and I welcome it. It is important for Ireland. We all support that concept. The market in Ireland is not the biggest market in the world although it has improved. We need to produce energy as competitively as other European mainland countries otherwise our economic position will be affected. The Bill should have identified as its first objective how to deal with the optimum mix of energy. The Minister referred to combined heat and power and so on, and that is part and parcel of the evolution of the energy industry but did not refer to the optimum mix of energy. That indicates a lack of forward thinking.</P>
      <P>We need short, medium and long-term dove-tailed energy plans, so that in quickly changing circumstances it is possible to adapt policies and adopt new policies capable of meeting the requirements of the market. I refer to both the industrial market and the domestic market. As the market grows we become more vulnerable if we are dependent on outside sources. I would like to see a huge emphasis in the area of research and development and a special effort being made to identify the optimum marriage in terms of the mix of fuels used and the whole area of research and development progressed to a much greater extent.</P>
      <P>An issue that comes to our attention from time to time is that the regulator will be used as a shuttlecock. If something nasty has to be done, out will come the regulator. If there is to be an increase in energy prices the regulator will appear. However, if there is good news a Minister will be out on the plinth to make the announcement.</P>
      <P>It was mentioned earlier that the ESB no longer reads meters on a bimonthly basis. Meters are supposed to be read four times a year but they are not in many cases. Recently I received a communication from a lady in the greater Dublin area whose meter was read once in two years. In that case the consumer receives a bill incorporating arrears that occurred since the previous estimate was taken. If the meter was read in mid-summer an average assessment would be made of the bill based on that. However, two years later, the arrears which have accrued are calculated at the price of electricity at current costs not as it was charged two years ago. I am sure the Minister of State will get hurried notations stating that is incorrect. However, it is correct and that is what is happening. There are consumers who argue against having to pay the current price, inclusive of increases that have taken place over the past two or three years. In his reply I am sure the Minister of State will deal with that issue and I will refer his reply to all those who have com<Col N="1949"/>plained to me, and there are many. I am sure the Minister of State received one or two such complaints.</P>
      <P>As I have not had an opportunity to do so until now, I welcome the Minister of State to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Though he is in the Department only a short time I have no doubt he will receive a baptism of fire in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>He was in that Department before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>He is welcome back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a return to the hot seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is. Ministers should take an interest in that area. It should not be up to a regulator, notwithstanding the fact that the regulator has been busy in recent years ensuring that electricity and gas prices have been increased. The price increases relate to worldwide energy prices. We had this argument many years ago with Bord na M&oacute;na when prices increased from &pound;16 per tonne to approximately &pound;60 per tonne, which was quite an increase. The reason for this was the international fuel scarcity and fluctuations in the market. It was probably good from the point of view of Bord na M&oacute;na in respect of its viability but it was not good for the consumer. Likewise, in the case of the increases in recent years the poor unfortunate consumer has been left to the elements.</P>
      <P>The Bill correctly deals with safety regulations in respect of installers and instructors in the gas and electricity industry. Those involved in installation in either industry must be top-class professionals who observe the rules and regulations. The key element is the level of inspection, as this dictates the degree to which standards are observed. Although I had doubts about some of these issues in the past, I welcome these aspects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>A well-known installer of central heating informed me that a similar requirement, above and beyond standards applied heretofore, is in force in the central heating sector for reasons of energy efficiency and safety. Safety is an issue because there have been cases of boilers exploding. The domestic central heating sector has made considerable advances in the past ten years, with significant increases in efficiency achieved and stricter safety standards in place. As a result, significant savings can be achieved by homeowners and the owners of commercial premises, provided the highest possible safety and efficiency standards are applied.</P>
      <P>I presume the health and safety regulations will address circumstances such as those that have arisen with regard to the Corrib gas pipeline, an issue which has occupied the minds of many people in recent years. As I have stated on previous occasions, it is essential that the highest <Col N="1950"/>possible health and safety standards apply to the extraction and conveyance of natural gas. Irrespective of the companies involved in transporting this product, they must all comply with the spirit and letter of the law, as every other citizen must do. No exceptions should be made and no corners cut in the provision of the infrastructure required for natural gas production and transport. Any attempt to do so would have a negative impact on the community at large and the development of the energy industry, particularly the natural gas sector. I am not apportioning blame but pointing out that some actions taken in the past were not carried out in the proper fashion or sequence. If they had been, we would not have reached the impasse in which we have found ourselves in recent years.</P>
      <P>In the event that further major gas resources are identified, it would not make sense to repeat the nonsense of digging up trenches and laying pipes and then taking them up again or welding pipes together and then cutting them into shorter pieces. We must never again rush ahead without regard to compliance with regulations before admitting that it may have been preferable to have taken option X, Y or Z. We all know what should have been done.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, the areas of mining, prospecting and oil and gas exploration are no longer new. These activities have taken place many times the world over and Ireland is no exception. For this reason, it is no longer excusable to argue that Ireland is in the early stages of developing these products. They are in development worldwide and we must avail of worldwide technology and observe optimum health and safety requirements when volatile products such as natural gas are being developed.</P>
      <P>The merits of conferring further powers on the Commission for Energy Regulation are debatable but I will address them at a later stage. In general, however, the more power that is devolved from Ministers&rsquo; offices to outside bodies, the less power the House has and the fewer the number of opportunities Members have to raise questions and have Ministers answer them in the House. It also gives the poor, over-worked Ceann Comhairle more opportunities to tell Members the Minister has no responsibility for certain matters. I could paper the walls of my house with the number of letters I received from the Ceann Comhairle in recent days informing me that certain questions I have raised are matters for the Commission for Energy Regulation. I have since discovered that this Bill confers powers on the CER which the Ceann Comhairle believed it already enjoyed. Is that not a quare conundrum? How would the Acting Chairman, Deputy Cowley, deal with that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfortunate when it transpires that the Ceann Comhairle mistakenly believes a body has powers it does not possess. The legislation before the House confers on the Commission for Energy Regulation the same powers the Ceann Comhairle believed it already held.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>

	<P>When I raised this issue on the Order of Business this morning, the T&aacute;naiste informed me I would have an opportunity to raise it during the debate on this Bill. I have received six items of correspondence from the Ceann Comhairle indicating that the Minister has no official responsibility to the D&aacute;il for matters I raised because they fall within the remit of the Commission for Energy Regulation. The issues in question concerned procedures regarding liberalisation and deregulation to enable easy access to the electricity market for alternative energy suppliers. I am informed I cannot raise these matters with the Minister in the House but must write a letter to the Commission for Energy Regulation. Perhaps I would then receive an answer at some point, much like the position with regard to questions on the health service.</P>
      <P>The worst aspect of this is that the energy regulator cannot come before the House to answer questions. We must face up to this problem. An Opposition Deputy would have received an answer to virtually any question 20 years ago when a plethora of highly competent officials in the various Departments were ready, willing and able to provide good and accountable answers to questions. More important, they were accountable in and to Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, of which the Deputy is a member, can call in the Commissioner for Energy Regulation at any time to ask him questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfortunate the Minister of State has raised that matter because I am sick to <Col N="1952"/>my teeth listening to people giving advice that issues should be discussed at committee meetings. This is the national Parliament, the place where these issues should be thrashed out in the first instance. Minor details can be dealt with by the committee but here, in Parliament, is where the job is done or not done. The day the Minister delegates his authority to anywhere other than Parliament is the day he will be sorry. More importantly, it is a day the population will regret because that is the day accountability will recede from the people, which is a serious development.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I will not go through the list of functions for which the CER is already responsible. The kind of crimes the CER could be accused of, the areas in which the CER has been unable to deliver and the things it should be delivering are so many and varied that I am glad the CER does not have to run for election. If it did, it would be in deep trouble. Its remit ranges from energy prices to access to the grid to the provision of various services, such as telecommunications to the Black Valley and such places.</P>
      <P>There is probably a need for a regulator. It is a European concept. How did we manage before regulators were invented?</P>

	<P>Regulators were introduced after the American Civil War to ensure everything was regulated. However, markets have a tendency to regulate themselves.

	<P>The Bill is welcome as far as it goes. It puts in place a statutory basis for what regulators are supposed to do effectively. We have yet to see evidence that deregulation will be of benefit to the consumer. I look forward to that because it is not obvious yet. I hope it will be. The Bill does not contain any short, medium or long-term plans for the provision of an energy sector that will be self sufficient, will reduce dependency on overseas energy and ensure continuity of supply.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not deal with the future of the ESB. The Government could have mentioned the ESB somewhere in it. The ESB is the biggest energy provider in the country. It has economies of scale which other providers do not have. It is the pivotal provider so it has advantages over others. It does not have the right to prevent others from entering the market. It also does not have the right, nor does anybody have the right, to hike the prices to make it more attractive for others to enter the market. The consumer should not be screwed to the wall as a result of the necessity to include other operators in the marketplace.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Bill could have included some reference to the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, which is fundamental to the energy sector at present. There is not a word about it. I cannot understand how a Bill could be introduced at this stage that does not contain a reference to the Deloitte &amp; Touche report. It should have contained such a reference. The Bill makes countless references to the CER. It reminds me of the boy in school who was offering excuses. He said: &ldquo;Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir&rdquo;, but there was nothing else. It was a series of &ldquo;Sirs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope the Bill means something and that it is the forerunner of something more fundamental. Hopefully, we will get an indication, which we do not now have, of how this country will be provided with cost effective and reliable energy which will take account of the ingredients that are likely to be required in the mix to ensure we can enjoy a secure energy supply in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome a number of the key provisions of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. The amendments to the 1999 Act in Part 2 extending the functions of CER to the all-island market are important, if belated. Sections 4, 10, 11 and 12 relating to electrical safety and the regulation of electrical contractors serve functions relating to natural gas safety, the <Col N="1954"/>regulation of gas installers and the introduction of gas emergency officers and gas safety officers and are useful and important legislative provisions. Likewise, sections 6 and 8, dealing with ministerial directions to CER and Government emergency powers relating to energy, are also timely in the context of the dramatic and rising importance of public energy policy in every state. Section 5, which implements Directive 2004/8/EC on combined heat and power, is another useful step to improve energy efficiency in this country.</P>
      <P>However, there has been a long wait for this legislation and, for that reason, the extremely modest nature of the Bill is surprising. In fact, there is a strong suspicion that this legislation has been precipitated by recent threats from the European Commission regarding the failures of national governments, including Ireland&rsquo;s, in their energy markets. Ireland is one of the 17 countries now being processed for legal action in this regard due to the failure of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the indictment by the European Commission on Tuesday that the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and his predecessors have failed to facilitate competitive markets for Irish consumers and householders. Irish energy prices remain among the highest in the EU and, despite repeated Government spin, no real options have been provided for householders in either electricity or gas.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission believes that the three principal elements of modern market regulation and initiatives to guarantee competition are not being developed in this country. These are the extent of market opening, a real possibility of changing supplier and the emergence of new market entrants, with non-discriminatory access guaranteed by strong independent regulators. The Commission has also called for stronger consumer protection and the universal right to receive electricity. Given Ireland&rsquo;s poor performance so far in sustainable energy, it is no wonder the EU Commission is always extremely critical about our performance on biofuels and the use of renewable energy sources.</P>
      <P>The response from the Government to the changing and increasingly difficult energy situation has been seriously inadequate and lacks focus. Energy legislation has been brought through the House in a haphazard and <i>ad hoc</i> manner. Not only did we have to wait an unacceptably long time for this updated legislation but it is also striking how we lack a coherent, overarching energy vision. Necessary energy legislation is being brought forward in a piecemeal and disjointed manner. In fact, the status of a further two Bills, the electricity Bill and the single energy market Bill, is still unclear, as is the timeframe for their return to the legislative programme. Should not one or both of these Bills also be before the House today so we can examine this important issue in a more consistent and coherent way?</P><Col N="1955"/>
      <P>Yesterday, I asked the Taoiseach on the Order of Business about the protracted and paltry Government approach to the new energy and climate era. I asked him whether the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, should have introduced a comprehensive new energy Bill, incorporating the limited Bill before us, the equally long promised single electricity market Bill and the electricity Bill which was on the Order Paper last year but now appears to have disappeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It has slipped away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The latter Bill was intended to turn the ESB into a plc under the Companies Acts. We are all aware of the long timeframe in developing energy infrastructure, but surely the Government should not have taken almost ten years to reach the modest platform provided by this Bill.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>We learned recently that more than &euro;1.2 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money has been spent on commissioning a report by the consultants Deloitte &amp; Touche that will not be published or presented to the House, even though select journalists and publications appear to have obtained detailed knowledge of various aspects of the report and of the future of the ESB. Unfortunately, the energy spokespersons in the House have not received the same information, which is undemocratic.</P>
      <P>The Government appears to be sleepwalking on the issue of energy and has been for the past few years when most of our EU partners presented major energy reviews and policies. The United Kingdom is in the process of presenting its second major energy review of the past three years, but no comprehensive energy document has been published by our Government over its nine years in office. The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said that after physical security, energy security is the most important task of any government.</P>
      <P>Although energy matters have gained unprecedented public attention in the past six months, the past week has seen some particularly important issues brought to the fore. In a new international survey published on Monday of countries in which it is most attractive to invest in renewable energy technology Ireland dropped from sixth to 12th place. According to the new quarterly renewable energy country attractiveness indices from the consultants Ernst &amp; Young, Ireland is ranked in 12th place, having dropped six places over the past year. This league table is based on an assessment of national renewable energy markets, especially the fiscal supports and tariffs that are in place, the state&rsquo;s renewable energy infrastructure and the potential renewable resources a state possesses.</P>
      <P>Ireland&rsquo;s ranking in the long-term index is particularly disappointing as that index reflects the unexploited resources of a state. Ireland has <Col N="1956"/>significant sources of untapped wind and wave power. The Labour Party believes Ireland can and should become an exporter of renewable energy. The recent report indicates the mechanisms in place to facilitate the development of renewable resources are not currently in place to allow greater investment in the renewables sector. The report shows that Spain and the United States remain at the top of the long-term renewables index for attracting investment in the renewables industries as both continue to show strong growth in the renewables sector and attract the bulk of capital investment. We are all aware of the achievements of Spain in the area of wind power.</P>
      <P>In contrast to the dismal Irish performance on attracting investment in renewables let us look at how different it is abroad. I wish to mention four exemplar nations, Austria, Sweden, Scotland and Denmark. Although each of these states has excelled in developing different renewable technologies, they have in common a proactive approach by government on energy policy which concentrates on the natural strengths and advantages of each state in the advancement of alternative energy resources and the diversification of the fuel mix. These nations are surging ahead with increasing the role of renewable technologies in their energy mix. For example, in Sweden in 2003 approximately 43.9% of electricity was generated through renewable sources, including hydro, wind and biomass.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The work of the Scottish Executive has been outstanding, despite the fact Scotland is not yet fully independent. The Labour-led Executive, led by Jack McConnell, has much power over Scotland&rsquo;s future and has taken some remarkable initiatives in the area of wind and wave power. The focus on renewables research and development undertaken by the Scottish Executive in the few short years of its existence puts to shame the measly time and resources our Government has devoted to the same issue. Scotland has declared the wish to become the &ldquo;Saudi Arabia&rdquo; of renewable energy.</P>
      <P>Austria, a densely forested region, has shrewdly become a world leader in the development of bioenergy, especially biomass. In 2003, approximately 70% of Austria&rsquo;s domestically produced power was generated through renewable sources and biomass alone was responsible for 11.2% of Austria&rsquo;s total primary energy supply and 21% of heat production. I know this subject is close to the Minister of State&rsquo;s heart and I commend him for his initiatives in developing the use of biomass in the forestry industry in his previous Department.</P>
      <P>Denmark, with its significant wind resources, claims it is the leading wind power nation in the world. The Danes were pioneers in developing wind turbine technology and they manufacture almost half the wind turbines used all over the world. The Danish wind industry employs approximately 20,000 people and generates <Col N="1957"/>almost &euro;3 billion for the Danish economy. Approximately 5,500 gigawatts of energy was produced by wind turbines in Denmark in 2003 and this provided electricity power for approximately 1.4 million Danish households.</P>
      <P>These four countries are examples of the route Ireland could take. It is important to discuss these issues coming up to a general election so a new government will go forward with a coherent and consistent policy, based on increasing the development of renewable, biomass and biofuel energy.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There have been numerous warnings in the past two weeks of how much our failures in dealing with energy change could end up costing in the next ten years. Under the new emissions trading system businesses and industrial users will have to cut their level of emissions or purchase carbon credits on the open market. Currently the cost for one year&rsquo;s credit is approximately &euro;27 per tonne. However, recent analyses in the media and scientific journals have predicted a sharp escalation of these prices that could end up costing Irish industry between &euro;500 and &euro;1 billion between 2008 and 2012.</P>
      <P>Recently we had a debate on this portfolio and the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, warned us not to waste taxpayers&rsquo; money. Not alone is the Minister one of those primarily responsible for the waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money &mdash; approximately &euro;15,000 a week will be spent on minding and protecting his voting machines which are basically junk, having wasted &euro;70 million on them &mdash; we are now faced with a bill of approximately &euro;1 billion. Where is the guilty Minister now?</P>
      <P>More ominously, taxpayers will have to purchase carbon credits if as a nation we exceed the national limit of greenhouse gas emissions as agreed under the EU-wide national allocation plan. Eirgrid has stated that the emissions trading scheme will have an effect on the cost of electricity generation. Therefore we will pay more and not just through our taxes. This is money the Minister for Finance could spend elsewhere. It is ominous that in the most recent budget the Minister had to allocate some of his precious funds towards carbon abatement, which is an astonishing development. Now we are told electricity prices will definitely rise because of the Government&rsquo;s failure over the past nine years to take climate change seriously. We dealt with a Bill earlier on which a group of Government Deputies stated the proponents of the Bill, the Green Party, were mad because they wanted an annual debate on climate change in the House.</P>
      <P>Carbon credit purchase is the first obvious financial impact of climate change policy on taxpayers and without serious changes to our energy mix, it will be the first of many. From 2012 onwards, the burden of climate change policy will be enormous. We need a radical shift in mindset by the Government on energy policy. We must start taking it seriously and discuss it, not just in the House but in every forum around the country. <Col N="1958"/>It is interesting that the people we represent are deeply interested in the area, which is hopeful.</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome the sections of the Bill that will facilitate the moves towards an all-island market. Part 2 of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill proposes critical new functions for the enhanced role the Commission for Energy Regulation will perform. How will the relationship between CER and the Northern regulator be teased out? Should this issue not be included in the Bill and will we need amendments on this?</P>
      <P>The question for the longer term is what the future will be. Will the next Government introduce a single all-island regulator Bill? In other words will we have a single regulator and will the roles of our and the Northern regulator be merged? We have heard from Europe and Commissioner Piebalgs visited us recently and gave us a pep talk on the importance of this issue. However, he seems to talk about a two-island market with Britain in which we will be part of a regional market. The implication is that we will have significant interconnection and must provide for this. Does the Bill go far enough on this? There are some questions to be answered with reference to interconnectors.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the year there were reports from Brussels that France, Germany and the Benelux are in talks to set up a single electricity market as a first step towards a common energy policy. What are the implications of that development for us? Will we become part of a new EU electricity club?</P>
      <P>Currently, the ESB is the dominant operator in the Irish market and enjoys a market share of more than 60%. It is hoped that in July 2007, when the all-island market is fully implemented, its share will fall to approximately 43%. A great deal of discussion has taken place, mainly in the media, about the future role of the ESB, as a key public policy instrument in the energy market. However, there is virtually nothing in this Bill that gives us any idea as to what that role might be in the future.</P>

	<P>Not a word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>We were so burned and scorched by the Eircom experience &mdash; and Deputy Durkan will pose questions later this afternoon on that issue and the Babcock and Browne situation &mdash; that there is an almost visceral fear among the people we represent, who believe we should not allow our key electricity transmission, distribution and generation assets to become the playthings of venture capitalists.</P>
      <P>Energia, which is part of the Viridian Group, is the most significant independent operator in the newly liberalised electricity market, although it operates solely in the non-domestic sector. At present there are seven independent electricity suppliers in the market providing electricity to an estimated 42,000 customers. This represents approximately 30% of the total annual electricity <Col N="1959"/>supply. The outcome of market opening has been very disappointing so far, especially in the domestic sector. Several weeks ago, for example, Airtricity announced that even though it had more than 8,000 domestic customers, it was leaving the domestic sector completely. Airtricity blamed the Commission for Energy Regulation for &ldquo;regulatory failure&rdquo; because the price the company had to pay for top-up power was, it alleged, unjustifiably high. Although the commission rejected this allegation, it launched its own investigation into electricity pricing and tried to explain why electricity market prices were higher from August 2005. Airtricity had also criticised the wind moratorium, which was lifted in early 2005.</P>
      <P>So far, the promise of the all-island market has proved extremely disappointing for consumers. One of the key reasons put forward for liberalising the gas and electricity markets and the basis for the entire single European market project, was that increased competition and market opening would benefit European consumers and businesses in the form of lower prices and more choice. However, the Irish experience has been the exact opposite, with consistently increasing prices and little choice, especially in the domestic sector. Electricity prices have increased by an astonishing 61% in the past five years, the highest rise of any EU country. Prices for industry have increased by 41% since 2000 and many commentators have said that these sky-rocketing prices will threaten the competitiveness of the economy. Similarly, gas prices have increased by more than 35% for domestic users since 2003. Almost no natural gas users, apart from those in five or six towns in the west, have a choice of natural gas supplier.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, this Bill holds out no promise of lower electricity and gas prices from the summer of 2007 because it contains no provision for assessing consumers&rsquo; needs and addressing the energy poverty that affects up to 750,000 citizens. This is an area to which I will return on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources I questioned members of the Commission on Energy Regulation. The only hope given by Commissioner Finn was that &ldquo;prices in an all-island market would be lower than they would be if there were two separate markets operating independently&rdquo;. As I said at the time, and I hope my colleagues will forgive me, that was a response worthy of Dr. Garret FitzGerald. I remember being in Dr. FitzGerald&rsquo;s economics class years ago where he referred to the fact that the rate of the increase in unemployment was falling.</P>
      <P>The proposal that the Minister will issue ministerial directives to the regulator and energy industry appears to offer little to consumers, given the reference to &ldquo;general policy direction&rdquo;, which is very vague. If this proposal is modelled <Col N="1960"/>on the Minister&rsquo;s performance of directing the other main regulator, ComReg, the new power of direction for the Commission for Energy Regulation will be totally inadequate.</P>
      <P>Recent media reports have shown that many families are now scrimping to pay key household bills, such as for heat and light. A survey in the <i>Irish Independent</i> showed that people are finding energy bills more difficult to meet and this is also made clear to Members who speak to their constituents. People in very poor households are forced to go to the Health Service Executive to seek supplementary benefit or to agencies like the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. The estimates for Irish households which experience some level of fuel and energy poverty are frightening, ranging from 225,000 to 750,000 people. The Labour Party believes it is unacceptable for so many people to have to live without adequate access to basic provisions such as heating and lighting. Therefore, I will table amendments to Part 2, section 3 to ensure that serious measures are put in place to tackle this pernicious and often hidden form of poverty.</P>
      <P>The President of the United States, Mr. George W. Bush recently described America as being &ldquo;addicted to oil&rdquo; in his state of the union address. If that statement is true of America, it is even truer of Ireland. We have exceptionally high, and increasing, levels of dependence on imported sources of oil and natural gas. Ireland&rsquo;s rate of total import dependency is extremely high, at 87%. What has the Government and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, done about this? Nothing.</P>
      <P>Forf&aacute;s published a report this week on the problem of Ireland&rsquo;s oil dependency. It is clear from that report that Ireland has one of the highest rates of import dependency in the EU. Our <i>per capita</i> oil consumption increased by more than 50% between 1990 and 2002. Forf&aacute;s is very critical of the absence of proper energy planning under the current Fianna F&aacute;il, Progressive Democrats administration. The report also valuably reflects on exemplar countries like Sweden, to which I referred earlier.</P>
      <P>With regard to section 8 which refers to emergency measures, oil is excluded. Why is that? If this is dealing with emergency energy, why does it only refer to gas and electricity? Where is the reference to oil, given that we hold so much of our oil stocks abroad? Perhaps we can return to this issue at a later stage.</P>
      <P>There are clear advantages to natural gas over oil. It is a cleaner fuel source for generating electricity and is not set to peak and decline as early as oil. It has often been described as a &ldquo;bridging fuel&rdquo;, bridging the gap between the decline of the current oil-based energy system and the development of a more diversified one. Our consumption of natural gas is increasing rapidly but in 2004 an estimated 81% of our natural gas was imported with only 19% produced from indigenous <Col N="1961"/>sources. In that context, Part 3 which deals with natural gas safety is very important and welcome. Sections 10 to 12 clearly define and provide for new functions for the Commission for Energy Regulation to regulate and invigilate natural gas installers, promote the safety of users and the public generally with regard to natural gas and certify natural gas installers, as well as outlining complaints procedures for installers and the relevant sanctions. We have had recent warnings about the dangerous inefficiency of the invigilation of natural gas and electrical installers. During the recent debate on the Stardust tragedy, it was pointed out that the electrical system in the Stardust was installed by unqualified people. More than 25 years later we are only now inserting this provision into law, which seems astonishing.</P>
      <P>The European Commissioner for Energy, Mr. Andris Piebalgs, who recently gave a very interesting presentation to the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, has strongly urged the Irish Government to establish natural gas storage facilities to increase the security of our energy supply. In a recent reply to a parliamentary question that I tabled on 25 January 2006, the Minister stated that &ldquo;The CER is in discussion with Marathon Oil Ireland Limited regarding the development of natural gas storage facilities at south west Kinsale.&rdquo; That is something I welcome but there is no reference to it in the Bill. There is also the possibility of storage at Kilroot in Belfast, when the all-island market is established. These are issues that should be pursued, given their importance to the energy security of the country.</P>
      <P>It is also critical that the gas in the Corrib gas field is brought ashore, but this must be done in an agreed, safe and acceptable manner. By some estimates, the Corrib field has enough reserves to supply more than 60% of Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas needs for a decade or more. Mr. Peter Cassells, who has an excellent track record as a mediator and negotiator, is currently in charge of the negotiation process. It is hoped that a breakthrough which will be acceptable to the people of Rossport and the brave men who spent so much time in jail, will be brought forward so that this vital energy source can be secured, giving us a window of opportunity. It will allow this and the next Government a chance to put in place an all-round energy policy. Last year I introduced the Petroleum and Other Mineral Developments Bill which sought to ensure greater accountability to the D&aacute;il in the regulation of exploration and production of natural resources. I hope the Minister will consider the Bill again for the regulation of other energy sectors.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to allow the Minister to give ministerial direction to the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER. I welcome any mechanism whereby a Minister can issue policy directions to a regulator on important issues such as energy production and climate change. However, <Col N="1962"/>the track record of the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has been dismal with the CER and ComReg. The proposal is modelled on the Minister&rsquo;s performance of directing ComReg, making the new power of direction for the CER inadequate.</P>
      <P>Although the new policy direction functions are being introduced, when I question the Minister on critical issues he has declined to answer on the grounds that it is within the CER&rsquo;s remit. Yesterday, I raised with the Ceann Comhairle the fact that a raft of parliamentary questions seeking to understand how the CER is invigilated were ruled out of order. It seems the regulator is an independent body with no reporting responsibilities to the people.</P>
      <P>In the present volatile energy situation, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision to introduce emergency measures in the event of a sudden energy crisis. Oil, critical to the transport sector, must be included in these measures. It makes up one third of our energy production and I hope Ireland can diversify from it as Sweden is attempting. In the meantime, contingency plans are needed.</P>
      <P>The Minister claimed the electricity supply demand balance for the winter was tight but that the CER continues to monitor the situation closely. It is of some concern in light of the warnings being issued in Britain and our overwhelming dependence on gas imported through the British market that similar contingency plans were not in place in Ireland last winter. Considering the recent events between Russia and Ukraine over gas supply, Ireland is exposed to supply problems.</P>
      <P>In recent years serious electricity disruptions have occurred in Birmingham, London, California, the north-east United States, Canada and northern Italy. These were primarily due to problems in the deregulated power markets. Keeping the lights on and powering and heating our homes and hospitals is the most critical service any Government can provide for its citizens. In light of the serious difficulties experienced in Britain and the wider European energy markets, it is imperative the Minister ensures adequate and sufficient measures are in place to cope with any sudden and potentially destabilising energy crisis.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have some concerns about the measures in the amending of Part VIA of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 that allow for the implementation of emergency measures. They do not provide for sufficient clarity that in the event of an energy crisis, the Minister will assume the direct leadership necessary to deal with the crisis. In reality, this appears to give the Minister power to direct the CER and the energy industry in the same manner as the policy direction sanctioned for the CER or ComReg. It seems vague and imprecise and does not spell out the lead role the Minister must take in the event of an energy crisis.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There are concerns that section 7, on the provision of the interconnector and the insertion of <Col N="1963"/>a section 2A in the original Act, allows for the involvement of merchant construction, competitive tender and the long-term interest of customers. We need to avoid the situation in which Britain is embroiled. Over recent winters the wholesale price of British gas was profoundly affected by the deficiency of the interconnector to Belgium. The British market was increasingly at the mercy of traders trying to get the best possible spot prizes. Ultimately, British households suffered with higher prices.</P>
      <P>I welcome the belated appearance of the Bill, the all-island functions for the CER and the key safety provisions in electricity and gas. I especially welcome the provisions on combined heat and power and liquified natural gas. The Bill, however, is an overall disappointment. On the Order of Business, Opposition spokespersons have constantly asked about the Bill&rsquo;s progress. We were led to expect a fundamentally new vision for energy policy with targets on energy consumption efficiencies, renewable energy and the challenges of climate change and the depletion of oil and gas resources. None of these issues is tackled by the Bill.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Green Party spent much of its recent conference criticising the Labour and Fine Gael parties for not espousing a joint energy policy with the Government parties. Obviously, there are strategic difficulties in that the Government has had nine years to prepare a fundamental energy policy but has not. Why should the good ideas from our parties be the saviours of the Government? I hope the Green Party will work together with the Labour and Fine Gael parties to put forward a sustainable and alternative energy vision and to present it to the country in the early spring of next year. Whatever happens in the next general election, I hope all parties recognise the realities of energy production and work together in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Deputy Broughan. I would be happy to join him and our Fine Gael colleagues in lambasting the Government for the utter failure of its energy policy.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, I was on radio with our beloved Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, who told us how all things were going green and swimmingly in the energy area with renewable this, that and the other. The commentator asked me was it not the case that other political parties were stealing the Green Party&rsquo;s clothes. Last night, thinking about it, the only image I had was of Deputy Roche standing on a Wicklow mountain on a cold and windy day, stark naked with nothing other <Col N="1964"/>than a fig leaf to cover his modest green credentials.</P>
      <P>The Government has failed us in energy policy. We need no greater example of that than the presentation of yesterday&rsquo;s Forf&aacute;s report. The report contained some examples of our dangerous energy position. IBEC has described it as an energy crisis. The Government cannot blame the rainbow Government for the situation. In 1997, when the Government came to power, Ireland had the same oil use <i>per capita</i> as the EU 15. In ten years, Ireland has gone to being 50% above the European average. In recent years commentators have said oil production is about to peak and a low dependent fossil fuel economy must be prepared. Despite this, Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on fossil fuels has risen in electricity production and transport. The Government has been a disaster for the country&rsquo;s energy policy.</P>
      <P>Ireland has not had an energy policy for 20-odd years. We have had no political leadership in the energy area. Instead we have had an inadequate, timid and bureaucratic response which has failed us. I hear our bureaucrats on television saying that we have a target for 2010 and we might achieve it. That is not the long-term vision needed in energy policy. That is why the Green Party seeks a cross-party approach on the issue. We need political change in the area quickly.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is simply not good enough. It is an example of that same bureaucratic, timid, inadequate and unambitious thinking. If the Green Party were in Government, the Bill would be radically amended. No one could disagree with the all-Ireland energy market but we do not know how it will work. We do not know how both regulators will engage nor how the six or seven institutions involved in the negotiations will come up with a real solution. We should be ambitious and brave in this regard, however, because we need an all-Ireland energy market.</P>
      <P>In fact, we need a wider energy policy which recognises that we are inextricably connected to the neighbouring island. The oil and gas we have been dependent upon is depleting at approximately 10% per year. That is why we have a crisis. In addition, there is no connection to continental Europe so the gas upon which we are now inextricably dependent because of Government policy will not be secure for us. I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s provision for such an all-Ireland development but it is not sufficiently ambitious nor does it go far enough.</P>
      <P>One cannot disagree with section 4 which contains the second main provision concerning electrical safety. It is a necessary mopping up of the complete lack of control which exists and which the Government seems to have been happy to oversee for the past ten years. As long as the Celtic tiger was booming and buildings were being erected, who cared about the standards involved? Who was checking the building standards, including electrical installations? Who <Col N="1965"/>cared if the work was undertaken by subcontractors who were not properly registered? The Government did not care for the past ten years and neither does it care now. If this provision in some way compensates for that lack of concern for what is built, then I welcome it.</P>
      <P>Section 5 deals with combined heat and power. One could not get a better example of the disaster concerning the implementation of what is required than our utter failure to develop proper amounts of CHP. The gas we are dependent upon from the North Sea and from our dwindling Kinsale field is a precious, finite resource which is being depleted. It makes no sense whatsoever to burn it in a power station and dispense one third of it as heat into the air. That is of no value to the people. It would make much more sense to use the remaining gas we have in a highly efficient and intelligent manner to produce both heat and power in the one source and thereby obtain approximately 80% or 90% efficiency, rather than 30% to 40% as at present. We have done nothing in that regard, however. We have failed utterly, as the European Commission recognised in its damning indictment by the action it is taking against the Government for its failure to develop renewable power.</P>
      <P>Section 6 deals with policy directions, which have been missing. The regulated model has not worked because a regulator or bureaucrat based in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources or the Commission for Energy Regulation cannot take on the political responsibility to lead. Such a person cannot take decisions or say something awkward, difficult or risky. In our democratic system, only politicians have the power to do that. We have had no leadership from the top down. I blame the Taoiseach personally for that. We know this Government will do nothing about market dominance in the next 18 months for fear of scaring a union in advance of a general election.</P>
      <P>We know the Government, ultimately from the Taoiseach downwards, is looking after developers&rsquo; interests. As long as we are building and have power for the moment, who cares about tomorrow? That is the ethos one gets from the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, down. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, did nothing about energy in his former portfolio of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The current Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is too busy looking after fish and broadband wires to think about energy.</P>

	<P>We need policy directions from the CER and the Department which recognise the crisis we are in.</P>
      <P>Section 7 concerns interconnection and there could be no better example of the incompetence and delay that has occurred in this regard. Just about everyone agrees that we need an intercon<Col N="1966"/>nector. We have gone around the houses as regards whether it should be a merger or built project but no one knows. No one has made a decision and the dawdling has been going on for about three years and is still continuing. People say we should build a 500 MW interconnector first and then think about a second one. We need two interconnectors now. It is hugely important infrastructure, although not for the reasons Forf&aacute;s seems to believe.</P>
      <P>We have a State agency which says we need nuclear power so we will buy it off the English and ship it in or we will build our own nuclear power station and ship the power out. That is not why I want an interconnector. I do not believe the logic that Forf&aacute;s is coming out with, which is that recognising that we have a transport disaster with depleting oil reserves, we need nuclear energy to power electric rail lines. Will someone tell the Minister for Transport that we need electric railways? Do we have to build a nuclear power facility to run our public transport system? I do not think so. It is not justified and it is not clever long-term thinking.</P>
      <P>Purely on energy grounds it does not make sense to go nuclear but we do need interconnectors for the alternative vision. That comprises an interconnected European grid connecting up the offshore wind farms in whose raw material we are abundantly rich. Both interconnectors could feed power back into Europe. That is why we need such a decision today rather than tomorrow. I heard an official from the Department state the other day that such long-term wind projects are for the future, but they should be for today. Until we start getting that urgency into energy policy thinking we will be going nowhere.</P>
      <P>Section 8 deals with emergency provisions. Deputy Broughan is right in saying that we need to consider oil as well. Oil and gas are interconnectable so, as a regulator, the CER should examine the whole energy area.</P>
      <P>Section 10 concerns the national gas supply. We have a problem in that at European level there is no fluidity in the European gas market on which we are utterly dependent. We are becoming more dependent on it. All the regulator can say is that rather than developing CHP, which would provide a multitude of small CHP sources, we are going the same old way, which the boys in the ESB think is the right thing to do &mdash; the big 400 MW power plants. They say that is the way the Westinghouse lads do it, so it must be the right way. I am afraid it is not. It is leading us to a dependence on gas although we are at the very end of the pipeline. We need to be active at European level but the Minister did not even turn up to the European Council meeting on this issue. He was in Sacramento with the Ancient Order of Hibernians.</P>

      <P>The Bill contains a proposal concerning the ESB&rsquo;s shareholding. I will table an amendment in this regard. I have many things to say about the ESB but, first and foremost, the obvious one and the one of which the European Commissioner will probably inform the Minister shortly by way of a legal notice is that we need to unbundle the transmission grid from power generation and the supply company. Why is the Minister presenting this Bill but not making that obvious, urgent, immediate and uncontroversial change? That is an example of the lack of any vision in this Government. It is an example of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, saying that whatever else, we should not rock the boat or do anything controversial. That is an example of why this Bill is not worth the paper it is written on. It does not give a sense of urgency to the people about what needs to be done in this vital area.</P>

	<P>My party certainly welcomes some of the objectives outlined in this Bill. In particular, we support the aim, as outlined in section 3, to promote the development of an all-Ireland energy market. However, we also believe that such an objective will be best served by developing such a market under a company that is in public ownership and for the public good.</P>
      <P>On this side of the Border that entity is obviously the ESB and we will strongly resist any attempt to privatise this company. Our position stems not from purely ideological reasons but because we believe that the ESB has served its function well and that the original aspirations and reasons for establishing a publicly, rather than a privately, owned company still stand.</P>
      <P>It is vital that such an important area as the provision of energy supplies should be under national control. That is why we have major difficulties with what appears to be the thrust of the recently announced European Commission policy of promoting an EU energy market, with national operators forced into competition with transnational corporations. It is one of the reasons we will question the provision in section 3(1) for an all-Ireland energy market to involve operators from outside the country.</P>
      <P>Regarding the provision in section 4 for the Commission on Energy Regulation to monitor the regulation of private electrical contractors in the industry, we have no problem with the general intent of the proposal and recognise the need for strict supervision of a sector that has such serious implications for people&rsquo;s safety. This <Col N="1968"/>has been recognised by the industry itself, which has established the register of electrical contractors in Ireland, RECI. This body, with more than 2,000 members, has built up considerable credibility. Probably most private users of electrical services would employ a member of RECI. It is important, therefore, that RECI is involved in any proposal to change the system of regulation and that its views are taken into account. Likewise, trade unions whose members are employed in the sector must be given a say in how working and safety conditions are observed within the industry.</P>
      <P>With regard to the policy aspects of the proposed Commission for Energy Regulation, I note that these will continue to be made by the Minister and that the commission will be obliged to implement whatever decisions are made. It would be a good idea, however, in light of the growing debate on future energy needs for the commission to include experts from the relevant areas who would have a more direct input into the policy debate. The need for such a wide-ranging debate, which would be able to influence policy at departmental level, is indicated by recent EU announcements on the future structure of the European energy market and by the recently published Forf&aacute;s report on the future availability of oil and the implications it will have for the provision of energy supplies in this country. The report raises a number of issues, all of which have implications for the future of the energy market in the general aspects referred to by the Bill.</P>
      <P>The media picked up almost exclusively on the proposal that nuclear energy might have to be considered as a possible alternative on the basis of the peak oil theory which the authors believe will curtail future supplies of oil. I do not believe that nuclear energy is necessary and the major issues regarding safety which surround it have not been adequately addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Other energy sources provide possible alternatives. Forf&aacute;s refers to wind and wave power and we certainly support research and development in those areas with a view to expanding the proportion of energy needs supplied from those sources.</P>
      <P Just="Left">One of the other areas of more immediate importance, especially in the light of the Bill&rsquo;s reference to the all-island energy market and the gas interconnector, is how best to utilise and control the gas reserves which lie off our coast. The Corrib field is the best known through its connection with the ongoing struggle of the Rossport community regarding the safety of the proposed pipeline there. Issues of revenue are also raised, but a more important matter is who will have control over such an important and potentially valuable resource in terms of both supplying future needs and economic value. It has long been our belief that such a resource, along with <Col N="1969"/>other reserves and exploration fields off our coast, must be subject to national control. This requires a radical overhaul of the licensing and revenue conditions which govern the sector. This must be seriously debated in the context of future energy policy and we will seek to build it into this legislation on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Another key area in the future will be biofuels. At present, the EU has issued a number of directives which set targets for the proportion of vehicle fuels to be supplied from this source. Although the targets are relatively small, the ability of this State to meet them must be questioned. This is despite the advantages this country has in terms of domestic production and distillation of energy crops. This issue was raised by my colleague, Deputy Ferris, in the context of the shameful betrayal of the Irish sugar beet sector and the possibility that beet and the surviving processing plants at Carlow and Mallow could be redirected from the production of sugar to the production of biofuels. This, along with the promotion of growing other energy crops, would present not only a means of establishing a significant national source of future energy supplies but also represent a potentially significant new area of growth for both farming and the industrial processing of such fuels.</P>
      <P>I urge that the proposed commission should also include as one of its responsibilities the examination of fuel poverty. A number of reports have shown this to be a serious issue for those on social welfare and low incomes. A series of price increases have added to the difficulties of many households and addressing this would represent a significant contribution to lessening the burden on those living in poverty. I urge that proposals for an all-Ireland energy market and the provision of gas interconnectors would lead to the provision of cheaper energy to domestic customers throughout the island rather than provide another opportunity for profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006. This important debate allows us the opportunity to see which way this country will go on energy. It is up to us and the wider community to be creative, radical and green in our thinking. In planning on energy issues, people, health issues and the environment must be at the centre of policies. We must also consider this from an all-Ireland perspective and approach. I urge all political leaders on the island to open their eyes to the huge potential for economic growth and work together in the interests of all the people.</P>
      <P>This debate is relevant on the day the Taoiseach met the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, to progress the peace process. On examining the main issues and details of the legislation, one sees the main provisions of the Bill are to expand the functions of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, to underpin its work <Col N="1970"/>on an all-Ireland energy market, to remove legislative constraint to facilitate regulated electricity interconnection not owned by the ESB, to provide for the taking of emergency measures by means of ministerial order in the event of a sudden crisis in the energy market, to confer power on the Minister to issues policy directions to the CER, to provide for the regulation of the electrical contracting sector by the CER, to make provision on gas safety in the context of the new multi-operator environment and to facilitate gas market opening. I urge the Minister to be creative, radical and positive in the energy debate.</P>
      <P>I want to promote biomass as an environmentally, economically and socially sustainable indigenous energy resource and promote its non-energy related benefits. Public awareness of biomass as a realistic option for energy supply must be improved. We must influence policy makers, as we are doing today, to promote the development of bioenergy and the implementation of bioenergy projects. Those interested in bioenergy development must network and share information. We must promote these issues and bring the people with us.</P>
      <P>It is relevant as we discuss energy to mention the topical case of the Rossport five. I wish the men well in their legal case tomorrow. This matter is not just about a group of five brave families standing up against multinational industry and supporting the need to respect our energy and the gas and oil off our coasts, which is important. This is also an environmental issue. I compliment my colleague, Deputy Cowley, on his work on this case in Mayo. These people must be supported and listened to carefully. It is all part of the energy debate and is related to it.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the energy debate is the issue of nuclear power, about which I have major concerns. Yesterday we debated Sellafield. One must consider what is stored at nuclear power stations, such as the high level of liquid waste. A total of 21 tanks, each containing 1,500 cu. m. constantly need to be cooled and seven different cooling systems are in place. A number of tanks contain 2,400 kg of caesium-137, the main cause of off-site radiation exposure from the Chernobyl accident. The total amount released from Chernobyl was 27 kg, almost 100 times less than the potential release from the facility at Sellafield. Its stockpiles of plutonium, the raw material for nuclear weapons, amount to 60 metric tonnes, or 60,000 kg, 6 kg of which could be used in nuclear weapons and would amount to 10,000 bombs. These places are very dangerous. One must also consider the amount of spent fuel used there.</P>
      <P>I raise these issues because we must be radical. We must also consider the issues of solar energy and the use of wind power. It is essential we do so in the broader debate. I urge the Minister and the Government to be radical, creative, green and environmentally friendly in their policies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill attempts to do several things, many of which are requirements under EU directives. It is reactive in that sense. Much of the Bill is about the extension of functions. I welcome the mechanism for an all-Ireland approach to energy which is sensible and meaningful. However, I wonder whether it is an academic exercise given the looming energy crisis. We may have great institutional arrangements and high safety standards but no gas to put in the pipelines. That is the key issue and the Bill does not address it.</P>
      <P>This Bill allows for the regulator to determine price. That should not give comfort to anyone because the price will be determined by the amount of gas available and, consequently, the amount of electricity available. Producing electricity from gas is probably not the most efficient form of generation. If supply is insufficient, the regulator will tell us how much the increases are rather than determining the price.</P>
      <P>The 25% increase in gas prices last winter is having a knock-on effect on families. Only when it starts to affect industry and competitiveness, however, will the penny drop because the economy is centre stage. Many families are strapped because these increases have significantly affected their finances.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Ireland and Europe face an energy crisis. The February newsletter of the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas, ASPO, stated that western Europe uses 50% more gas than it produces. European imports of gas increasingly depend on Russia which earns five times as much by exporting gas as it would on the domestic market. This in turn causes significant problems in Russia which is not a guaranteed and stable source. For example last winter there was a cold spell of approximately -40&deg; C which interrupted supplies of gas to western Europe. The writing is on the wall. The ASPO newsletter makes stark reading and gives an insight into the problem we face.</P>
      <P>The Bill extends the function to the Minister in the event of a sudden crisis but we need to anticipate a chronic crisis because that is predictable and will lead to a sudden crisis. Although the Bill does not cover oil supply, most of us recall the 1974 oil crisis when lines of cars queued for a few gallons of petrol. Given the increase in the car population and the inadequate public transport system, a similar crisis today would not only affect domestic supplies, industry would not be able to function. This is predictable.</P>
      <P>We need to get real about supply and the first area to address is energy conservation. We can act on that today but we need a strategy for reducing waste. We also need to identify new energy sources. Renewable energy must be the first object of our attention. The possibility of harnessing wind energy has already been pushed into the future. Agriculture too has a role in providing fuel products for industry. We need to continue to explore for offshore gas but events such <Col N="1972"/>as those in Rossport cannot continue if communities near those finds are to feel satisfied and safe about the finds. It is important that this issue is concluded satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>We have a culture of creating a crisis, not only in respect of energy but in many different ways. We seem to like creating a crisis then trying to resolve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Without a doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>We have been told that bigger, wider roads will give us more cars, as has happened everywhere else, and we need to counterbalance that with public transport, but we ignore that saying it will not happen here. When it happens, we try to resolve it. That approach seems to be almost a national pastime. We need to plan for a crisis but I see no evidence of that happening.</P>
      <P>An article in <i>The Independent </i>in the United Kingdom last January referred to what &ldquo;they&rdquo; do not want us to know about the coming oil crisis, namely, soaring fuel prices, rumours of winter power cuts, panic over gas supply from Russia, and abrupt changes to forecasts of crude output because the reserves seem to be understated. The writer of the article asked whether there was something sinister going on. Not long afterwards the British Government announced a public inquiry into the country&rsquo;s energy situation. It has recognised that its oil and gas production from the North Sea is in steep decline and facing depletion and it is starting to plan for this.</P>
      <P>We also need to recognise what is happening elsewhere and how exposed and dependent we are, and to start planning. In ten years&rsquo; time when someone asks what we were doing in 2006 when this was predictable, let us not say that we were talking about institutional arrangements and other matters instead of dealing with the fundamental issue of supply. We need to deal with that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a wide-ranging Bill which, when enacted, will have a vital role in driving forward a progressive energy agenda in a new global energy landscape with increasing demands on fuel resources. Key features of the Bill include a move towards all-island markets. The Bill also deals with electricity interconnections. East-west and North-South electricity interconnections are significant elements of energy policy. Both provide strong physical links with Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom and will integrate Ireland into wider European markets.</P>
      <P>The Bill removes an impediment in law by facilitating regulated electricity interconnection not owned by the ESB. It also empowers the regulator, with ministerial consent, to secure interconnector builds by various means, including competitive tendering, direct authorisation or by the transmission system operator.</P><Col N="1973"/>
      <P>This Bill will provide the legal basis for the energy regulator, the Commission for Energy Regulation, to engage in the development of an aIl-island energy market with a milestone of 1 July 2007 for a single electricity market North and South. The aIl-island market will remove market distortions and minimise the wholesale cost of electricity. It will also create a more attractive location for new electricity generation investment and help to improve the security and reliability of electricity supplies throughout the island.</P>
      <P>It is vital to ensure that both communities and economies on the island have access to safe, secure and sustainable energy supplies obtained through competitive energy markets. There is no doubt that this challenge can be met more effectively and to our mutual benefit if we work together.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This is especially fitting when considered in the context of the regional approach to the development of energy markets being pursued as part of the European Union&rsquo;s drive to create an EU-wide internal market in electricity and natural gas. The creation of an all-island energy market involves collaboration on issues ranging from improved interconnection, competitive markets and harmonised trading arrangements through to generation adequacy, security of supply, sustainable energy and energy efficiency measures.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>A key priority is to establish all-island wholesale electricity trading arrangements. Other priorities will include the establishment of an all-island gas market in line with the commissioning of the infrastructure. It will also be vital to maximise the benefits of environmentally sustainable energy, from rapidly maturing wind generation and the combined heat and power business through to the growing rural biomass energy industry and the future promise of substantial energy from the sea.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt there is extensive and wholehearted support for the all-island energy market. The issues involved are intricate and sometimes competing and not all of the benefits will be immediately achievable. However, the long-term reward will be a market that is much better placed to meet the future energy needs of the whole island. Given that a cross-Border energy market already exists, albeit in an nascent form, there is an acknowledged requirement that we ensure policy developments North and South are progressed in ways which advance the goal of improved economic and energy supply benefits for both parts of the island.</P>
      <P>We must also act to ensure policies are developed to exploit opportunities for enhancing the value of the energy industries on the island through external links with Britain and continental Europe. The energy policy agenda must be widened beyond traditional market development issues to take account of national and international concerns with combating climate change. More particularly, there is a requirement to follow renewable energy and energy efficiency <Col N="1974"/>opportunities where the benefits can be enhanced by acting on an all-island basis.</P>
      <P>Market structures need to be integrated and infrastructure investment secured to improve islandwide efficiencies in the sector. We also need co-ordination in the activities of the regulatory authorities and transmissions system operators. This must lead to unified regulatory and system operator arrangements for the island as a whole which are geared to the delivery of measurable benefits. Energy issues are complex, frequently interconnected and often related to long-term investment decisions. There are also differing stages of development between the electricity and natural gas markets and infrastructure. This means that achieving the most advantageous outcome for the entire range of energy policy issues will be a protracted process requiring the support, dedication and active co-operation of all stakeholders if the benefits of the all-island market are to be secured.</P>
      <P>I know that Ministers North and South have confirmed that any policy, legislative, structural, institutional or resource issues that may unfavourably affect the development or effective functioning of the all-island energy market and which may arise in the course of implementing this strategy will be carefully examined and addressed, in conjunction with the relevant agencies. The aim will be to pursue complementary actions as far as possible.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the test by which the value of a fully integrated all-island energy market should be judged is that energy users in both parts of the island are better off than they would be in two smaller markets which are mutually supportive good neighbours but which trade together opportunistically rather than systematically. The potential benefits of a mature all-island energy market should include a larger single market with competitive energy prices. There should be open and transparent competition at all levels in the marketplace and for all energy sources, including combined heat and power and renewables. It should also mean a more stable and attractive investment location and provide a boost to the competitiveness of the wider industrial sector.</P>
      <P>There will be greater security of supply, an integrated infrastructure and the sharing of a more diverse energy mix. Greater energy efficiency will undoubtedly result in longer term savings through rationalisation of functions in regulation, system operation and transmission asset planning and ownership. It will also facilitate greater consumer choice of supplier of energy or energy services and enhanced organisation of energy research through the emergence of an all-island network of academic and industry expertise.</P>
      <P>The Bill includes provisions to further enhance the safety of energy consumers and the public, ensuring Ireland continues to meet with international best practice in respect of electrical and natural gas safety. The regulator has been given <Col N="1975"/>robust new safety functions, which include the regulation of electrical contractors and natural gas installers. The regulator has also been granted additional powers to ensure rigorous enforcement, including, for the first time, the power to designate electrical and gas safety supervisory bodies, as well as the power to establish standards for training and registration, introduce certification schemes and prosecute rogue installers.</P>
      <P>Other key features include the provisions enabling the Minister to introduce the full opening of the gas market by ministerial order in advance of the EU deadline of 1 July 2007. This will extend the benefits of liberalisation previously enjoyed by industrial and commercial consumers by enabling all natural gas customers to shop around for suppliers and get the best value. The Irish gas market has been undergoing a process of liberalisation since the enactment of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995. This process is being driven by both Government policy and developments at EU level. The enactment of the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002 in April 2002 saw the establishment of independent regulation for the sector. That Act provided for increased competition in the natural gas supply market.</P>
      <P>In July 2004, the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, liberalised the natural gas market by making all non-household customers eligible to switch suppliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>How many switched?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>This move had a dramatic impact on the number of customers eligible to switch supplier. While previous rounds of market opening impacted on a small group of approximately 250 high volume customers, this move meant that more than 17,000 industrial and commercial customers were eligible to switch supplier or source their own natural gas. Overall, market opening by volume increased by 86%. This was another important step towards the full opening of the natural gas market.</P>
      <P>The benefits of liberalisation, which were previously enjoyed by large customers, will now be extended to all industrial and commercial customers. This will assist our economic competitiveness. Subsequently, the then Minister introduced a customer charter for the market, which provided for increased levels of consumer protection for natural gas customers and household consumers. The statutory instrument also contains provisions relating to natural gas licences, accounting procedures, the gas capacity statement and the functions of the Commission for Energy Regulation. These regulations continue the process of meeting Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under Directive 2003/55/EC.</P>
      <P>Another statutory instrument signed into law last December imposed a legal obligation on <Col N="1976"/>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to unbundle its transmission and distribution system operators. Bord G&aacute;is is taking measures to comply with this through the establishment of an independent system operator subsidiary. Thus, the conditions for competition are being created through progressive liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets. Liberalisation of the electricity market has proceeded on a phased basis since February 2000 under the regulatory oversight of the CER. In accordance with the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Eligible Customer) (Consumption of Electricity) Order 2003 on 19 February 2005, the market opened fully to competition. From that date, all customers have been eligible to source their electricity from any licensed supplier and the entire market became contestable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>No one is contesting it. That is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>Scope now exists for all customers, household and non-household alike, to seek out keener prices in the competitive market. This is well in advance of the July 2007 deadline set down in the EU Directive 2003/54/EC on electricity. The opening of the market has benefited customers by broadening customer choice and already some 42% of the market by volume is supplied by independent suppliers. I commend the Bill to the House and compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good to speak opposite the Minister of State again as it has been some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage to outline some of my ideas and concerns in respect of the energy market, of which some the Minister of State may already be aware. I hope he and his advisory team will take note of my contribution.</P>
      <P>My first criticism has been outlined by other Opposition spokespersons, that is, the lack of a Government energy policy document setting out targets and requirements for the energy market in the short, medium and long terms. Instead, we have piecemeal policy development. In 1999 in the alternative energy sector alone, there was a Green Paper on sustainable energy and, in 2000, there was a consultation document entitled Options for Future Renewable Energy Policy, Targets and Programmes. In 2004, we set up a renewable energy development group to essentially start all over again. We have had consecutive alternative energy requirement or AER programmes, of which any realist would recognise that the first four were absolute failures. They did <Col N="1977"/>not result in the type of wind energy development anticipated. I accept the recent AER programmes have been successful. Most recently, there has been a welcome development in subsidies for domestic grant schemes for greener homes, but it is a piecemeal approach.</P>
      <P>More broadly within the energy sector, consultations have taken place with a range of different bodies and interest groups. However, nine years after the Government entered office, there is still no overarching policy document. Ireland must be the only country in Europe that does not have one and is certainly the only country in Europe that has a nine year old Government without a coherent overarching energy policy. It remains to the CER to deal with all of the complexities and significant challenges of the marketplace. I accept there are no easy answers.</P>
      <P>The energy climate is constantly changing and, while some issues remain consistent, the factors influencing any overarching policy document for Ireland are also changing. Two years ago, I was Opposition spokesperson in this sector and, even in those two years, the goalposts have shifted somewhat. Energy is a policy area of discussion in the European Parliament and has rapidly moved up the priority list. A number of factors affect all states within the European Union. In the past three years, we have moved from $35 per barrel of oil to almost $70 per barrel and the price is fluctuating between $60 and $70. In the long term, it will really only move in one direction. Security of supply is perhaps the most significant political issue relating to energy in the European Parliament at present.</P>
      <P>Countries such as Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are exerting tremendous pressure to try to reduce the European Union&rsquo;s existing reliance on Russian gas. At present, the European Union imports 55% of its energy fuels and by 2025, it is estimated that this figure will be closer to 75%. This is movement in the wrong direction. EU policy encourages member states to become more self-sufficient in energy and to move away from the importation of carbon fuels, particularly oil and gas. Moreover, all member states have commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and I intend to discuss Ireland&rsquo;s lack of response in that regard shortly. In addition, environmental commitments have led the European Union to discuss and support alternative fuel sources and to find ways in which it can provide direct financial support to them.</P>
      <P>Factors specifically affecting the Irish market are somewhat more complex. First, there is a lack of competition. Deputy Kelly spoke as though we have successfully opened and liberalised the Irish marketplace to the extent whereby every energy supplier in Europe wishes to compete here. That is an extremely naive position to take. While we have gone through the motions and have made an effort to open up the Irish market to competition, it has not come. Although consumers and particularly businesses have some choice, it is still <Col N="1978"/>limited. In effect, the ESB still enjoys a monopoly of supply of electricity and power in Ireland. Moreover, the restrictions imposed on the ESB in an effort to try to promote competition mean that potentially, we have the worst of both worlds. As we do not permit the ESB to expand and increase its generational capacity in an effort to introduce competition, we are in danger of having insufficient capacity. Potentially, we may not provide sufficient power to the growing Irish economy as a consequence of failing to attract competition to fill the space which would be filled by the ESB, if it was allowed to so do. High demand has led to high prices and that factor, combined with the increased cost of gas and oil has meant that costs are rising dramatically for Irish consumers and business operators. This makes Ireland less competitive than it ought to be, relative to other parts of Europe.</P>
      <P>As an island, Ireland is an isolated marketplace and I welcome this Bill&rsquo;s attempts to create an all-Ireland market. It is an obvious step and has not happened before time. However, even with the creation of an all-Ireland market for energy, Ireland will still be a small player isolated by the sea. The interconnection capacity between Northern Ireland and Scotland is small and insufficient. If we seriously intend to significantly expand wind energy projects in Ireland, our grid can only handle significantly more power from wind generation if we have significant interconnection capacity. This is because by its nature, wind is an inconsistent source of supply and although better wind speeds and consistency can be achieved in Ireland than in most other European countries, one still needs a substitute source of energy when the wind is not blowing.</P>
      <P>Until such a substitute source of energy can be obtained through interconnection and until that interconnection is used to export green energy produced in Ireland &mdash; it has a natural competitive advantage to so do with its wind speeds &mdash; we will never maximise our potential as far as wind energy is concerned.</P>
      <P>Ireland is incredibly vulnerable to imported fuel inconsistency and at present, it imports approximately 87% of its fuel requirements. It is the end of the line in the European Union, with respect to gas pipelines and, potentially, the supply of oil. Ireland is on the western coast and most energy comes from eastern Europe. Hence, if the supply runs out, Ireland will probably be the first country to suffer. Although we should be aware of this, little is being done to address this issue.</P>
      <P>From a positive perspective, as I stated earlier Ireland has a significant natural competitive advantage as regards renewable sources of supply in that its wind speeds are better than anywhere else in Europe. From an efficiency perspective, approximately 40% can be achieved from wind turbines here. In other words, 40% of the time, one can take acceptable amounts of power from wind turbines in Ireland. In most other European <Col N="1979"/>countries, that figure is closer to 35% and falls to 30% in some regions. Ireland also has an advantage in that at present, the EU, of which it is part, actively tries to support renewable energy and has encouraged the Irish Government to take initiatives in this regard. Unfortunately however, Ireland has not acted on this encouragement.</P>
      <P>Moreover, one can point to a change in the Irish mindset. People are more aware of our responsibilities regarding the environment and are more aware that alternative and renewable energy sources are no longer pie in the sky. This is no longer exclusively concerned with the environment as it is also about economics. Hence, groups such as IBEC, as well as business leaders have become engaged in pushing alternative energy sources. It is no longer simply a Green Party issue. While I intend no disrespect to the Green Party, from a policy perspective, this is the area on which it focuses.</P>
      <P>What is the way forward for Ireland? I wish to discuss interconnection in more detail because it is critical in a wide range of areas. Despite Deputy Crowe&rsquo;s comments, we are moving towards a common European energy market, and rightly so because we live in an internal market in which jobs, people and goods move freely between countries and borders. This is encouraged to promote more competition, opportunities, business activity and so on. Hence, energy should also move between European countries. If Ireland is to participate in this regard and is to have the security which this would provide, it requires proper interconnection.</P>
      <P>Hence, from the perspective of security of supply, this is absolutely essential. The Government would claim that several years ago, it announced that it was open to the development of an interconnector between, for example, Wicklow and Wales and that it invited private sector interests to build it. This should be built and paid for by the State. It is fundamental infrastructure like roads, airports and railway stations. Moreover, the present electricity grid in Ireland is also fundamental, and should be kept in public ownership if the ESB is ever privatised. We cannot afford to wait for an entrepreneur to finance this project. The State must do so immediately and regardless of whether it costs &euro;200 million, &euro;300 million or &euro;400 million, it would be money well spent because of the significant costs to the economy if this is not done. Hence, we should invest in this project without delay.</P>
      <P>We require a balanced energy mix in Ireland. I do not advocate the proposition that Ireland should be entirely energised by renewable sources. However, although gas and oil have roles to play, renewable energy should be part of the energy mix. Although some people may not agree, coal also has a role. It contributes to the security mix as the broader one&rsquo;s mix of sources, the more secure one&rsquo;s overall power generation will be. Nevertheless, we grossly under estimate <Col N="1980"/>the potential of renewable resources, particularly in the new, high cost environment for carbon fuels and for gas and oil in particular.</P>
      <P>I will focus on wind power in some detail. Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to generate power for ourselves and for other parts of Europe is highly significant. Any economist would agree that it makes sense to concentrate on the areas in which one is competent. By any calculations, in the purest sense, Ireland should be very good at producing energy from wind. It has higher wind speeds, and more importantly, more consistent wind speeds on the west coast, than anywhere else in Europe. However, we do not appear to see this as the kind of opportunity that we should. Until the interconnector issue is sorted out, this discussion is futile as we can only reach a certain capacity within the Irish grid for an inconsistent source of supply.</P>
      <P>We should be planning for other aspects such as the cost of grid connection. The Minister of State will be aware that the cost of grid connection for a farmer, or a consortium of farmers who are putting together an ambitious wind energy project is nothing short of scandalous. It could cost hundreds of thousands of euro after a landowner has put a similar amount of money into a planning application to get connection to the grid, which is sometimes not far away. People have asked the legitimate question whether ESB subsidiaries pay the same costs for advice and grid connection when setting up wind farms in parts of the country for which they have been given contracts.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Energy crops in Ireland are an exciting new opportunity for farmers. They can be a competitive fuel source. They are secure and predictable. They can be grown on a contract basis, as was the case with sugar beet, and they should be promoted. European Commissioner Fischer Boel wants to promote this area. She is willing to increase energy crop subsidies and change the rules so that they can be grown on set-aside land. However, there should be a response from the Irish Government on excise duty, as is the case in other European countries. We are being encouraged to do this by the European Union which is giving a definite competitive advantage to this industry. The Minister of State will get a very positive response from the farming sector if he provides it with a new crop which is financially viable.</P>
      <P>The EU will require Ireland and all other countries to have a 5% ethanol content in all petrol from 2010. How is Ireland planning for this? Ethanol is not being produced in Ireland at present or, if it is, it is in pilot projects on a small scale. Are we going to start importing ethanol in 2010 even though it can probably be produced more efficiently here than anywhere else in Europe? There are existing ethanol industries in Spain and Italy that are growing and expanding, especially as a result of the demise of the sugar industry in Ireland. The Government has an opportunity to try to redeem itself by finding <Col N="1981"/>alternatives for arable farmers, whether they grow wheat or sugar beet to produce ethanol, after an appalling and misleading performance in the last months of the sugar industry. We should use our influence as a shareholder in Greencore, albeit a small one, to ensure that everything possible is done to try to facilitate the transition from a sugar factory in Mallow to an ethanol or energy crop processing plant.</P>
      <P>The same opportunities apply to biodiesel through growing oil seed rape as apply to ethanol through growing sugar beet and wheat. We can make this happen by way of a combination of price supports from the European Union and tax incentives from the Irish Government. If we do not do so, it will be a huge opportunity missed for Irish agriculture and the Irish energy sector.</P>
      <P>Wood biomass is another important area. I regret that the Minister of State has left the House because he knows a bit about this area as a result of his work in the forestry sector. Whether it is fast growing wood coppice plantations, forestry thinnings or wood and paper waste, these are viable fuel sources that are being used to significant effect in other European countries. However, they are not being used in Ireland to the extent they could be. New peat power stations were built here in recent years which are ideal to allow a gradual substitution from peat to wood biomass over a period. We should use this source for environmental as well as cost-effective reasons from an energy fuel point of view.</P>
      <P>Tidal power, wave power and solar energy are all under-estimated by the Government. There is no reason a percentage of public housing projects cannot be powered through solar panels on the roofs. We should examine template projects in other European countries. It is not true to say that because we do not have very high sunshine rates, solar panels will not work.</P>
      <P>It will take political courage to deal with the ESB, which I do not see happening before the next general election. It is not the ESB&rsquo;s fault that it is as dominant in the energy market. It is because it is good at its job that it retains this dominant position, and it is because of this dominant position that other players throughout Europe do not consider Ireland an attractive option to produce and supply power. This must change. Options should be considered to weaken the ESB&rsquo;s dominance in the marketplace. We must consider whether this would mean separating the generation, supply and grid management in a real way or breaking up the ESB. My preference would be not to break up ESB generation.</P>
      <P>While there are some good provisions in the Bill, we are hopelessly unambitious in regard to the energy sector. We should work to our strengths. We should not be afraid to be proactive by providing tax incentives to kick-start industries, especially in the biofuel, energy crop and biomass sectors. As the farming sector is well educated and ambitious, it should be given an opportunity to produce energy crops so that <Col N="1982"/>Ireland can provide energy for its economy in the future rather than having to rely on inconsistent and politically controversial sources for gas and oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and support the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006. It is very important legislation which governs one of the most critical parts of our infrastructure, namely, the energy sector. Energy is the core of any economy. To take it away would mean taking away one&rsquo;s ability to read, have light, cook or run factories and transport. Energy is at the core of the way people live and create wealth. This is why it is time the energy portfolio was taken from what has become too big a Department. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is too big for any one Minister to handle, no matter how competent or from which party. The seriousness of the energy situation is such that it is time to have a dedicated Department of Energy whose sole focus is on the two sides of the energy coin, that of consumption, on the one hand, and production, on the other. I will come back to that aspect later.</P>
      <P>The Bill has a number of important features deserving of support in this House. Section 3 is perhaps the most important section and concerns an all-Ireland energy market. That is consistent with the political progress on this island in the past ten or 15 years. We have developed North-South co-operation in waterways, tourism and transport links, and it is now timely and vital that we have an all-Ireland energy market where the increase in the number of consumers can only work to the benefit of the energy market and, I hope, reduce prices.</P>
      <P>I also welcome section 4, which contains provisions for the standards of training for electrical contractors. Much work in this area has already been done because various institutes such as the AECI and RECI have already by and large brought a high standard into electrical contracting in Ireland, but I am glad there will be a function for the Department and the Commission for Energy Regulation.</P>
      <P>I also welcome section 6, which allows for policy directions to be given by the Minister to the Commission for Energy Regulation. This is important and the section should be mirrored in other legislation. As a society, we are wrong to set up regulators in all aspects of our lives, such as telecommunications, education, energy and so on, and allow these regulators to lead what appears to be an independent life away from the authority of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Nor do they have to stand for election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is high time we introduced legislation to ensure that all regulators appear regularly before committees of the D&aacute;il and are <Col N="1983"/>fully accountable to the House for the way in which they regulate their industries. That would be a non-partisan approach to the issue. In general I welcome the fact that the Minister will be able to give policy direction to the energy regulator.</P>
      <P>I also welcome section 8 which deals with emergency measures in the event of a sudden crisis. That is necessary. Ireland and the world face an energy crisis which may not have hit us yet. It is a little like the tsunami which starts in the middle of the ocean and takes some time to travel to shore. The energy crisis is complex and multifaceted and the only question we as legislators must ask, in an open and honest way, is whether we are doing enough to prepare for it. I do not believe that we as a society are doing enough to meet that incoming crisis.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The last large energy crisis was the oil crisis of 1973 which sent shock waves throughout the industrialised world. As we can see, it was a wholly unnecessary crisis in that at the time, there was no real shortfall in energy supply, but there was a decision, effectively by the oil cartel which still exists today, to increase the price of the oil supply radically. That could happen again and we should all pay tribute to OPEC for thus far, certainly in recent years, having responsibly increased supply where there was a threat of a spike in prices. Many of those countries have, to their detriment, increased supply, because they could have made a great deal of profit from increasing the price of oil but did not.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister of State will accept there are two sides to the energy crisis coin. There is the question of supply and the question of consumption. With regard to competition, I will refer back to Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s contribution. I pay tribute to the Government for opening up competition in recent years. It is not true to say there has been a failure in this regard. I did not hear Deputy Coveney referring to all the new independent power plants built in Mulhuddart, Galway and Shannon. Companies such as Viridian have entered the market. We must accept there has been progress in that regard.</P>
      <P>There has not been enough progress in the adoption of new technologies. We have not provided enough encouragement to the wind energy sector, for example. A few months ago I spoke to people involved in the wind energy industry and they were complaining about lack of encouragement for the sector. I appeal to the Minister of State to do everything he can to radically encourage a dramatic increase in supply from the wind energy sector. That may entail Government subsidy, and even though I believe completely in the market, when one is trying to encourage an industry there is a time for subsidy. We need more radical proposals before this House to encourage the wind energy, solar, ethanol and biofuel sectors.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Government and I criticise the contribution by Deputy Coveney who failed <Col N="1984"/>to refer to the positive moves the Minister for Finance has made in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>About five years too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>The House will be aware that in the Finance Act 2004, a relief from mineral tax was introduced by the Minister for Finance for pilot projects for the production of biofuel and for testing the technical viability of biofuel as a motor fuel. This relief was confined to pilot projects. In the Finance Bill of this year, the Minister significantly expanded this scheme to make it a five-year scheme for mineral oil tax relief to commence in 2006 and end in 2010. This will cost approximately &euro;20 million this year, &euro;35 million next year and &euro;50 million in each of the following years. When fully operational, this relief scheme is expected to support the use and production in Ireland of about 163 million litres of biofuels a year.</P>
      <P>In this year&rsquo;s Finance Act, the Minister also introduced a vehicle registration tax relief of 50% for flexible fuel vehicles. This scheme is intended to encourage the purchase of such vehicles which use bioethanol, a blend of a minimum of 85% ethanol and petrol. That is excellent work by the Government but it needs to go further. Large motor vehicles which consume a large amount of petrol or diesel should have very high rates of vehicle registration tax. They should be discouraged as strongly as possible. Smaller cars with engine sizes of up to 1300 cc or 1600 cc should be fully exempt from vehicle registration tax to encourage the majority of our population to buy such vehicles. That kind of radical measure is needed to shift the balance away from the large, fuel guzzling cars which in a time of energy shortage virtually amount to an obscenity. There is no excuse for such vehicles, and I take a very strong line on that.</P>
      <P>With regard to bioethanol, I agree with other speakers that through the former sugar factories, we should encourage the creation of fuels from sugar beet. That should become a priority for the Government.</P>
      <P>On the consumption side, is the Minister satisfied that enough has been done to reduce our dependence on natural fossil fuels? I am not so satisfied. This is a crisis that we should take steps to remedy.</P>
      <P>It is time there was a major policy statement from the Government setting out initiatives and measurable savings in consumption over the next ten years. These targets should be the subject of regular debates here.</P>
      <P>There is an obligation on all of us to assist those in the energy industry who are doing their utmost to bring energy into the country. I congratulate the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who has done his utmost wherever a dispute has arisen to put in place reasonable mediation where people with genuine grievances <Col N="1985"/>can make their views known. There is an onus on everybody to be reasonable and to help the maximum amount of energy reach this country which, as Deputy Coveney said, is at the end of the fuel chain.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. While the Government is doing much in the competition sector it needs to do more in the consumption area and needs to encourage, by subsidy or otherwise, the use and production of alternative fuels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. In his contribution the Minister of State said the new responsibilities of the CER include the regulation and promotion of natural gas safety. That is laudable. The Bill should also have provided for the safety of people, an issue about which I feel strongly. Five men from County Mayo spent 94 days in jail because of their fears concerning the safety of the Corrib gas pipeline. It is a retrograde step for the Government to be part of a process that does not take into consideration the safety of the people. Under the law people trying to ensure safety in their own homes are in fear of going to jail again through a process that has evolved. It is time to take stock and put people before profit.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Bill provides for steps to be taken by the CER in the event of something going wrong. The circumstances of the five men from County Mayo could not have gone more wrong in that their entire future and that of their families was jeopardised. The Bill is about the regulation and promotion of natural gas safety but should include provision for people safety because <i>homo sapiens </i>matters also.</P>
      <P>We have seen the provision of interconnectors and the Bill provides for more equipment for the distribution of natural gas. How often have those interconnectors been used not to bring gas into Ireland but to take it out of Ireland? In the case of Kinsale gas field, the oil companies played ducks and drakes with the Government and managed to manipulate the position. It is amazing that the interconnectors were built given that Ireland was running out of gas and would have to import gas for our needs. Is the interconnector being used to export our gas? As happened in the case of the Rossport five, the fear is that their rights will be trodden over for the purpose of bringing this gas to market. Instead of the interconnectors being used to bring gas into Ireland they will be used to export our gas.</P>
      <P>The Bill should contain a provision for the regulation and promotion of natural gas safety and for the safety of the people. It should ensure that if the natural resources of an area are removed there should be some <i>quid pro quo </i>for the people affected. We heard before the last election the great promise made by the Government that gas would be provided to the towns of <Col N="1986"/>Mayo. We have been told that again and again but it is an election ploy.</P>
      <P>The road from Castlebar to Belmullet is one of the worst dirt tracks in the area. One could hardly call it a road. If Ministers could visit the area more often and see what is happening and where the gas is being taken from they might understand the reason the people are so angry. The best road in the area is between two bogs, that is, the road between Ballinaboy and a bog a few kilometres down the road where it is intended to bring the peat to set up a 9 km terminal inshore, which is daft, and in the process bring this high pressure gas pipeline within a dangerous distance of people&rsquo;s homes. Children going to and from school and shops have to cross that pipeline many times a day. The best road in the area in the one between two bogs and it is for the convenience of Shell. That is a further indictment of Government.</P>
      <P Just="Left">While I agree on the need to regulate and promote natural gas safety, <i>homo sapiens</i> matters also. This is where the problem lies. As the independent regulator for the electricity market, the CER facilitates competition by authorising the construction of new generating plant and licensing companies to generate and supply electricity. In County Mayo many people were gainfully employed in Bellacorick, a turf fired electricity production station. Everything is all right if it is done elsewhere other than in the west. Two new turf based electricity generating stations are being provided in the midlands whereas Bellacorick will be closed with the loss of hundreds of jobs. There should be some provision in the Bill to ensure some degree of balanced regional development. The problem is that there has been a lack of balanced regional development and an inequality of treatment of the west compared to the rest of the country. Some provision should be made for Bellacorick. A questionable decision was made that Bellacorick should not be revamped because of insufficient peat to burn. That decision has been questioned by Professor Seamus Caulfield and others. The last census figures clearly show that west Mayo, which includes Ballina to Newport, is in serious decline. The Bill needs to take cognisance of the fact that there are people involved in this. While our energy needs are important the safety of the people is more important. It was utterly unacceptable that a number of individuals spent 94 days in jail. The right to bodily integrity under the Constitution, as affirmed in the Ryan case, does not appear to matter a whit when it is expedient to bring gas to market. While I have difficulties with regard to the benefits accruing to the State from the Corrib gas deal, my main problem is that lives are being jeopardised. This Bill does not address this issue.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that Shell has created a major pollution problem in Belmullet. What has the company achieved by its actions? Having been <Col N="1987"/>informed it would be impossible to build a pipeline facility on a bog, it proceeded with its daft plan to move thousands of tonnes of peat to another bog in an effort to establish foundations for the pipeline. This has placed people in jeopardy, for example, through leakage into the area&rsquo;s drinking water supply.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The underspend of national development plan funding in my area has been a source of great concern. I have raised this issue on many occasions in the House. I want a <i>quid pro quo</i> for Corrib gas to be included in the Bill. This should include provision for special incentive schemes for County Mayo, particularly the north-west of the county, the most socio-economically deprived region in the State. The region also requires greater investment in central infrastructure such as roads, rail and broadband and the front-loading of investment for projects such as the western rail corridor.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <P>The Bill focuses on energy and speakers have pointed to the need to make proper use of resources. The loss of freight services in Ballina and the escalating use of roads for freight transport creates problems. The proportion of freight transported by rail compared to road is minuscule. The Government has lost the plot in this area with oil consumption continuing to rise. Expansion of rail freight services would be a much more effective approach to reducing energy consumption. Instead, however, we are witnessing the complete meltdown of freight services, notably from Ballina to the south east. The Government, if it is interested in the proper use of energy resources, must take urgent action to encourage a return to freight services.</P>
      <P>A further problem is the unequal distribution of broadband and the refusal to sanction investment of &euro;29 million for Knock Airport. The promotion of the east and south to the detriment of the rest of the country will result in gross inefficiencies as energies are focused on already congested areas. The possibility of building a third terminal for Dublin Airport will perpetuate uneven regional development. At present, 29 million air passengers fly into the east and south, whereas only 500,000 air passengers fly into the west, with perhaps a further 10 million flying into the North. Imbalanced regional development of this nature does not make sense as only balanced regional development can deliver proper use of resources and energy. Nothing will change until such time as the Government drops its refusal to provide the &euro;29 million required by Ireland West Airport Knock to meet its infrastructural needs for 2006-07 and provides the &euro;365 million needed for the western rail corridor.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Despite its decentralisation plans, the Government has failed to deliver in the west. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, preaches about the need for balanced development in every <Col N="1988"/>budget. The time for talk is over and urgent action is needed. The mid-term review of the national development plan showed an underspend of &euro;3.9 billion in the Border, midlands and western region. Balanced regional development is necessary to achieve proper use of energy and development.</P>
      <P>I have raised on other occasions the need for the IDA to work harder for County Mayo. I specifically called for the introduction of a special tax incentive scheme for the county but this has not materialised. There is a bias in the distribution of infrastructural investment which I hope the Government will address. I am aware the Minister for Finance has indicated it will be possible to draw down NDP funding until 2006 and 2008 for projects co-funded by Structural Funds. When I questioned him on the issue he was honest enough to admit there is no plan for the underspend in NDP funds, which is much higher in the BMW region than in the southern and eastern regions, to be distributed as intended. This is regrettable.</P>
      <P>Under the previous Government, a group of western Ministers had regular contact with the then Minister of State with special responsibility for rural development and ministerial colleagues on matters of concern to the west and the Western Development Commission. I understand this group has been stood down. A concrete plan, separate from the national development plan, is required if we are to make proper use of our resources and draw down the funding intended for the BMW region.</P>
      <P>I hope a serious attempt will be made to address the gross underspend in the BMW region as it is falling further behind. When I highlighted this problem more than a year ago I was led to believe the Government would take action to address it but nothing has happened. I am amazed it does not have a plan in place to guarantee the underspend will be tackled. This is an indictment of the Government.</P>
      <P>The Government has squandered our natural resources, including natural gas. Ireland should look towards the example of Norway. Having visited the country, I was impressed by how it uses its natural resources and has managed, for example, to secure co-operation from the oil companies in ensuring the state received a proper return from its natural resources. In my discussions with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on this matter he indicated a windfall tax could be introduced if it transpires that the oil companies extract more gas or oil than originally envisaged. How much is the Government being told because the oil companies have played ducks and drakes with it in the past?</P>
      <P>The folly of not utilising our natural resources to our maximum advantage is manifest in the Government&rsquo;s policy on granting exploration <Col N="1989"/>licences to oil and gas companies for a maximum of five years. I have raised this foolishness previously. We have all heard of the pantomime story of Jack and the Beanstalk. Like foolish Jack, the Government gave away our natural resources for a handful of beans believing it would not get anything from the deal. Unfortunately, this is not a fairy tale with a happy ending because we are deprived of adequate resources. We only need consider the energy and revenue benefits to the country of having natural gas. In the west, people are lying on hospital trolleys and, in some cases, waiting for eight years to be called for a urology appointment by which time they may present with advanced cancer. People are waiting four to five years for rheumatology appointments so they miss the window of opportunity within two years to avoid being crippled for life. Mayo General Hospital does not have a rheumatology or urology unit due to lack of money.</P>
      <P>Think about what it would mean for this country if we utilised our energy resources as we should. BreastCheck will not be rolled out until 2009. Due to lack of funds it was not extended throughout the country in 2000 as it should have been. It has already been proven to reduce the death rate from breast cancer by 20% to 30%. At least 65 people in the south and west have died who should not have died. Before it is rolled out in 2009, a total of 250 people will be dead in the south and west unnecessarily. The reason given for not rolling out the service in 2000 was the intricacy and complexity of establishing such a service but that is balderdash. The service has been available in the North since 1993, where the death rate was cut by 20%. The rest of the country did not have the benefit of saving that 20% to 30% due to lack of money.</P>
      <P>We could utilise our natural resources by securing the return of money from the oil companies. This money could be used to buy a temporary breast screening service from the private sector. I am not a promoter of the private sector but until the Government can roll out the service throughout the country in 2009 for all citizens, there should be a temporary service. It would save 250 lives. It is a matter of money. The profit from our natural resources could make a major difference in this regard.</P>
      <P>Oil companies can hold a licence in this country for up to 19 years. That is a long time. The terrible reality is that we are giving the oil companies something for which they need not do anything more than promise to drill. In those 19 years they do not have to drill. That is ridiculous. Why not give the oil companies a licence for five years? At present, they do not have to do anything with the licence. I asked the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, about this and he said there are 121 exploration wells but only four have been successful. However, we do not know what <Col N="1990"/>the oil companies are doing. The Government should consider establishing an oil exploration company to harvest our natural gas and oil. Why do we not have the same confidence in ourselves as, for example, had the Norwegians?</P>
      <P>I am glad I had the opportunity to speak on the Bill. The House is now going into recess. Everything stops during the recess and that is wrong. There should be some means whereby we can ask questions. Parliamentary procedures should continue. I urge the Government to think about <i>homo sapiens</i> and to put people before profit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>One could be forgiven for not realising that we are discussing an energy Bill given the last speaker&rsquo;s tour through County Mayo, the west and every other issue. I admire the Deputy&rsquo;s energy and his ability to look after his constituents and to secure coverage on the radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>What is more important than people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a welcome Bill. Energy has shot to the top of the political agenda as a result of the crisis that arose over security of supply, particularly the conduct of Russia and Ukraine and the closure of the pipeline. The Minister&rsquo;s reference to the Government&rsquo;s evolving energy policy was a nice choice of phrasing. It is evolving and that is welcome. The provisions in the budget last year were particularly welcome and I look forward to more of the same in the next budget.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas committee is due to produce its energy document. We put a great deal of work into that. The Minister is also due to produce an energy document which we await with great anticipation. The Opposition has criticised the Government throughout this debate but I attended a conference yesterday on future energy and contributors to the conference commended the State for its foresight in preparing to deal with the issue of peak oil production and what that will cause. Only Ireland and Sweden have produced documents on peak oil production and how to deal with it. The Forf&aacute;s report was welcomed as a testament to the forward thinking of the Government. It is one plank in the Government&rsquo;s evolving policy.</P>
      <P>The most important aspect of this Bill is the redefinition of the role of the CER. I have been an active participant in the Oireachtas committee examining the energy issue and the single consistent issue we have encountered is criticism of the commission, from politicians on the committee, independent energy suppliers and, at times, the Minister. The provisions in the Bill which provide for the Minister to instruct the CER on policy are extremely welcome. Some of our problems arise from the moratorium that was placed on the wind industry by the CER in December 2004. We are <Col N="1991"/>only now feeling the results of that. At recent meetings of the committee, more independent suppliers have complained about this difficulty.</P>
      <P>Indeed, when the committee asked the commissioner for justification for this, he was a little shy in telling why he had chosen to do this. He could often hide behind his role as it was defined in the 1999 Act so the new provisions in this Bill are most welcome. Members would prefer that somebody who is responsible to the House, in the person of the Minister, give the policy directions and give answers to the House.</P>
      <P>I have been looking at the role and the function of the CER. In correspondence I have seen, the CER indicated that at times its responsibilities were sometimes in conflict with each other and the question was prioritising them. Political direction could not be given prior to this so, to be fair to the CER, the commissioner was doing his best. However, it is essential that there is political direction. It should come from a coherent policy and the ability of the Minister to direct the CER.</P>
      <P>One issue that worries me with regard to how the CER has performed to date is that the choices it made about who got grid connections and so forth have left us exposed in terms of gas supplies. The amount of electricity produced from gas is alarming. It is not what it should be, namely, a moderate amount with a variety of suppliers providing the electricity. Over 50% of our electricity is generated from gas. This leaves us very exposed. When the North Sea gas supplies run out, Ireland, like the rest of Europe, will be dependent on Russian supplies. We are at the end of that supply line so we can hardly expect our needs to be looked after before those of other countries along the route.</P>
      <P>The all-island market will deal, to a certain extent, with the dominance of the ESB. However, as we know from our recent deliberations with the CER, there is a long way to go in terms of how the two regulatory frameworks, North and South, will marry, as it were. I did not get the impression that the CER was confident that it would happen before the deadline. However, it will have to, so they will need to move on it and this legislation takes the right step.</P>
      <P>Rather than just consider an all-island market, we need to consider a regional market for the United Kingdom and Ireland. An all-island market does not provide enough competition for suppliers and for that reason we need to expand the basis of a new market that would be available through the UK and Ireland. To do this right and to provide opportunities for our island, we need better interconnection facilities. I welcome the fact that the Bill provides that somebody other than the ESB can provide such an interconnector. Independent energy companies are keen to provide this and I hope the Minister is favourable to it.</P><Col N="1992"/>
      <P>All of us who have attended energy committee meetings know that the dominance of the ESB is a major hurdle to true competition in this country. We must take strong action and be very careful how we proceed on the question of dominance. Already we have seen Airtricity indicate the market is not viable. The question of regulation, which changes so often, and the lack of a coherent policy make it difficult for companies to conduct business here. Therefore, I hope that this Bill, by providing policy direction from the Minister, will facilitate progress in this area.</P>
      <P>It has been said by independent providers that in the past the Commission on Energy Regulation has been hostile to renewable energies. A report in today&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i> answered the question on the cheapest source of energy by stating that wind power is the cheapest fossil fuel security. I hope this puts paid to the notion that wind energy is more expensive because of the issue of intermittency. I do not believe wind energy is the sole answer to Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply needs, but it is a source that has not been sufficiently explored.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats Party has set an ambitious target of 30% of energy needs from renewable sources by 2015. Some people may say this is not achievable. However, it is if we have the vision and will to develop it. We must have the capacity to understand the problem and the vision to seize the opportunity and provide funds through Government and private sources. I do not like the notion that the Government should deliver this on its own. If private industry is prepared to be involved &mdash; this is what competition and a liberalised market is about &mdash; we should allow it into the market.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The energy question is as great a challenge to the country as was the economy in the 1980s. Look where we are today. Who would have said that our economy would be the talk of every other country? Someone said to me this morning that it is only in this country that people think the country is going down the tubes. People in every other country wonder how we got our economic miracle together. We must recognise that this is an extraordinary country and that the challenge we faced in the economy in the 1980s was dealt with successfully.</P>
      <P>We can deal as successfully with the challenge presented by the energy question. We are in an isolated position but we need to recognise that we are in a country that is best placed, both geographically and otherwise, to harness wind energy. The Progressive Democrats target is 30% of energy needs to be provided by renewable resources by 2015. We need to see the issue of energy as a long-term issue. I was disappointed that Deputy Ryan&rsquo;s suggestion of an all-party group on energy issues was rebuffed by his supposed potential Government colleagues.</P>

It is sad that his colleagues who seek to form a Government are not coherent on this issue. I listened to what Deputy Coveney had to say and wonder whether he would have thought differently if he were the energy spokesperson and a committee member.</P>
      <P>By and large, parties do not hold differing opinions on this issue and it is an opportunity missed when we do not come together on it. Members of the joint committee have worked well together and when the committee launches its energy policy, I doubt there will be many dissenting voices. We have a good basis on which we can move forward.</P>
      <P>I would like to focus on research and development. On account of our location and the potential for wind and wave energy, many groups have commenced pilot schemes, for example, in Cork and off the Arklow Bank, where research is being carried out into new technologies. We need to seize this opportunity as we did in the information technology sector. The potential is enormous. At a future energies conference yesterday there was discussion on a possible &euro;6 billion investment, almost equating to the pharmaceutical sector. We need a wise Government to seize this opportunity. I welcome the fact that the Government has started along this path. There is a long way to go, but more than anything we need a belief in this future.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the biomass sector and the contribution transport fuels make to our CO2 emissions. Everybody talks in the same way about the opportunities. Our party held a conference in Portlaoise recently which was attended by 300 farmers who were keen to hear about the future of farming and biomass production, cellulose, miscanthus etc. We are all singing from the same hymn sheet.

Given the provisions of this Bill, the work of the committee on energy policy and the Green Paper, I believe the future is bright. We need to ensure we include all the necessary provisions and that we cut the red tape so that people can lead the way.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>if, further to his recent announcement that anglers now have a ten fish quota for the 2006 angling season with an all district total limit of 15,000 fish as per the scientific advice, the rule will still be in place which dictates that one fish can be caught by anglers per day to June first and three fish per day after that date; if compulsory catch and release will be implemented once 15,000 fish have been caught; the way in which the fishery boards will know when 15,000 fish have been caught; the way in which these measures will be policed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[13604/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister due to a family bereavement.</P>
        <P>The National Salmon Commission, informed by the National Fishery Managers Executive, has recommended that total wild salmon exploitation in 2006 should not exceed 106,367, with 91,367 allocated to the commercial sector and 15,000 to angling, thereby fully complying with the national conservation limits established by its standing scientific committee.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the fisheries boards that the total angling catch will be controlled primarily in two ways, by a reduction in the annual bag limit from 20 to ten fish and the imposition of mandatory catch and release in eight of the 17 fishery districts from the month of September.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I intend, by means of amendments to the Conservation of Salmon and Sea Trout By-law, No. 797, 2004, to limit the number of fish which can be caught per day to one per day until June and three per day until the end of September, subject to the maximum annual bag limit of ten fish. Once anglers have used all their tags they will be required to cease fishing.</P>
        <P>I intend, by making a further by-law, to introduce compulsory catch and release from 1 September in eight identified fishery districts that are not meeting conservation limits. These are Dundalk, Drogheda, Dublin, Wexford, Waterford, Shannon, Galway and Sligo. The fisheries <Col N="1995"/>managers have argued that there is an absolute need to conserve stocks in those districts. Given that commercial fishing ceases in the majority of districts on 31 July, they maintain that there is no reason that anglers should continue to kill fish up to the end of September.</P>
        <P>I am advised that enforcement will be undertaken in the normal way through fisheries officers checking individual anglers for compliance. The fisheries boards are exploring opportunities to develop and enhance their protection regime, making use of modern technology and management methods, including the assessment of district-based quotas for the angling sector.</P>
        <P>While I am relying on the assurances given by both the commercial fishing interests and angling representatives that they are fully committed to all measures associated with the conservation and protection of our valuable wild salmon stocks, I have, nevertheless, asked the fisheries boards to ensure that the new quotas are fully enforced. The fisheries boards will continue to monitor the fishery and I have asked them to keep me advised of necessary measures in the course of the season to ensure compliance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is no wonder that there is a significant degree of conflict between the commercial fishermen and anglers, given the difficulties, despite the best intentions, in regulating the angling sector. Will the Minister of State indicate how many licences were issued in 2005?</P>
        <P>If one looks at the situation with the River Slaney in County Wexford, only 376 salmon can be fished. There are 75 draft net fishermen on that river who, in effect, can only catch five salmon. With regard to anglers, there is no control whatsoever. An angler can buy ten tags in one district and a further ten in another district. The word of the angler has to be accepted that he or she has not bought tags previously. There is no central control system. Potentially, up to 21,000 licences will be on sale this year. If that figure is multiplied by ten, that would amount to 210,000 salmon, whereas the quota for anglers is 15,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I have read the reports of the National Salmon Commission and met the chairman. I have also met the fisheries managers, groups of drift net, draft net and snap net fishermen and anglers from all over the country. There is general agreement that stocks must be conserved. There was also a general agreement that we would accept the recommendations of the commission this year, even though the 2006 figures are slightly higher than what was recommended by the scientists. Next year we intend to move fully to the scientific figures, which will have further serious implications.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the situation on the River Slaney and the people in that area are not too happy with the fact that I am going to sign off on a <Col N="1996"/>decision that will mean they will be very limited in the number of fish they can catch. However, we must also take into account that while we have 21,000 anglers, a significant number of them do not fish or catch no fish. Furthermore, a certain number of the draft net, drift net and snap net fishermen do not fish.</P>
        <P>The decisions we have taken for this year will have to be fully complied with. The Minister and I will meet the fisheries board managers in the next two weeks to discuss serious enforcement and ensure that the 15,000 and 91,000 limits are fully observed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all in favour of the conservation of stocks and I am aware that the Minister has appointed a team to carry out an evaluation. However, if one wants to ensure fairness between commercial fishermen and anglers, the number of tags issued by the Department must be controlled. At present, there is no methodology whatsoever to regulate the number of tags sold or to prevent anglers buying multiple tags. In effect, if they so wished, anglers could buy 50 tags and there is nothing to prevent them from doing so. A system should be set up whereby anglers are given a registered number which is stored on a database and available to all tag outlets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Nationally, 106,000 tags will be issued this year. That takes into account commercial fishermen and anglers. Like the Deputy, I have heard anecdotal evidence of the abuses to which Deputy Perry refers. For that reason, we will meet the fisheries board managers in two weeks&rsquo; time to determine how we can strictly enforce the limits. We may look at new ways of doing so and perhaps take on board some of the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestions. We will also examine the utilisation of modern technology with regard to the issuing of licences, checking log books and so forth. There is much ambiguity which must be cleared up and I am determined to do that. I have been three weeks in this post. A decision has been made and I hope that we will get the support of the anglers and commercial fishermen this year. However, as in every walk of life, some people will want to break the law but we will take action against them.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>if he will provide details of the recent adoption of the recommendations of the National Salmon Commission; what the quota reductions will be; what will happen to salmon stocks after 2006; the remit of the three-person independent group to examine the implications, especially the financial ones, of the new regulations for the commercial sector in 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[13603/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I announced on 24 March that I had decided to adopt the recommendations made <Col N="1997"/>to me by the National Salmon Commission with regard to the total allowable salmon catch for 2006. This will involve reductions in the quota available to commercial fishermen and anglers in 2006. In doing so, I have also reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to fully align with the scientific advice provided on the management of the wild salmon fishery by 2007.</P>
        <P>Accepting the recommendations of the National Salmon Commission and the National Fishery Managers Executive, the total allowable catch in 2006 will be 91,367 for the commercial sector and 15,000 for angling, fully complying with the national conservation limits established by the standing scientific committee. These reductions in overall fishing effort are required to sustain and rebuild wild salmon stocks nationwide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I propose to amend the Conservation of Salmon and Sea Trout By-law, No. 797, 2004, to restrict the annual angling bag limit to ten fish per angler for 2006. While the National Salmon Commission had recommended a limit of 15 fish per angler, I believe the lower level to be necessary to contain the total harvest by anglers to 15,000 fish, given that there has been no appreciable reduction in the average angling catch in the last five years and in the interest of balanced treatment of all stakeholders.</P>
        <P>I intend to introduce a new by-law to provide for the introduction of compulsory catch and release from 1 September in eight identified fishery districts that are not meeting conservation limits. The fisheries managers have argued that there is an absolute need to conserve stocks in those districts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recognise the considerable efforts made by the commercial fishing industry in recent years to build a sustainable fishery and it has endured large cuts in the quotas available to it. I realise that these reductions have caused the industry difficulty and that full alignment with the scientific advice will probably compound these problems. For these reasons, I have decided to appoint an independent group to examine the implications of the new regulations for the commercial sector in 2007 and beyond and to make recommendations on the options available to address any financial hardship that may arise. The group will also determine the extent to which those stakeholders deriving economic benefit from the decision should contribute to any scheme, whether in cash or in kind, including improved tourist access.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have also accepted the National Salmon Commission&rsquo;s recommendation that measures should be considered to deal with the exploitation of multi-sea winter salmon stocks, including consideration of the length of the angling season. The fisheries managers, having considered the scientific advice, will identify appropriate measures in <Col N="1998"/>time for application in spring 2007. The scientists will also be asked to tender advice on the management of sea trout stocks over the coming months.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The standing scientific committee has indicated that mixed stock fisheries pose particular threats to the status of individual stocks and that fisheries operated in estuaries and rivers are more likely to fulfil national and international obligations. In this context, the National Fishery Managers Executive has identified a range of pilot projects to facilitate the commercial fishery to move from areas of indiscriminate mixed stock fishery exploitation. The feasibility of these projects will be evaluated by the Department in conjunction with the fisheries boards and the Marine Institute with a view to their implementation in 2007 and beyond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The scientific advice was released towards the end of January of this year and the narrow decision of the National Salmon Commission followed some weeks later. There is much confusion among fishermen, anglers and in fishing communities as to what will happen in 2007. The Minister of State stated the TAC for 2006 is 91,000, which is disappointing to many such as those in the Stopnow campaign. What will happen in 2007? Is the Minister of State indicating that commercial fishing for wild salmon will stop in 2007? Is there any intention to put in more salmon counters, given that there is not enough information on stocks?</P>
        <P>Has a division of the single stock management for salmon, the precautionary principle, as articulated in the report of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, been introduced? An expert group comprising Padraic White, Professor Collins and John Malone was appointed. Has the Department made any estimates of the total losses for commercial fishermen? I have seen estimates of &euro;7 million plus. Does the Minister of State have the figures?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will there be a buy-out in 2007? If so, will it be voluntary or compulsory? Will the same happen to commercial drift net fishermen as happened to Dublin taxi drivers? Will the Government appoint a hardship panel to award certain amounts of money in compensation?</P>
        <P>The wild salmon is a key national symbol but we have become a pariah in Europe because of our treatment of our salmon stocks. Everyone wants to see the commercial fishermen treated fairly in whatever mechanism is used. I welcome the establishment of the expert group which will report in August.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Over the years figures from &euro;30 million to &euro;150 million have been used in describing the financial implications of banning drift netting. When I returned to the Department in October, it was still an issue. I believed it was time to examine the implications of adopting the <Col N="1999"/>scientific advice for 2006. There will be severe hardships on the netmen with a quota of 91,000. There are already severe hardships considering their quota was 250,000. In 2006, the scientific advice was used to base the TAC and it will have serious implications.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and I put a proposal to Government for the appointment for a group of three learned men to examine the implications of financial hardship, compensatory measures and implications on coastal communities. It will report in early August with its recommendations. I have asked the group to examine all options, including voluntary and compulsory buy-outs, and the effects on fishing communities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The group will make a recommendation to the Minister of State which he will follow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It will make a recommendation that will be considered by the Department and will then go to the Government. If a financial recommendation is made, which I expect will happen, it will have to be approved by the Government.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the group by the Government means there is an expectation of some monetary compensation. The most recent figure I have been informed of is &euro;30 million. I have not told the independent group of this. Padraic White was involved with the scallop industry. John Malone was involved in drawing up compensatory packages in the farming sector. We should allow the fishing for this year with the TAC of 91,000. By early August we will have the report of the independent group and we can then make strong decisions on 2007.</P>

        <Quest>his views on whether Eircom needs to be re-nationalised and that the Government&rsquo;s decision to privatise it in the first place has proved disastrous.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The State has no plans to nationalise Eircom infrastructure or regain control of any part of it. The telecoms market is fully liberalised and independently regulated by ComReg in accordance with the EU regulatory framework. This is the case in all EU member states.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Privatisation of Eircom took place against a background of liberalisation of telecoms markets and was part of a broader trend, which was reflected across the EU. Several other former state-owned telecoms companies have either been fully or partially privatised by their governments. The State received over &euro;7 billion when it privatised Eircom in 1999. This provided money <Col N="2000"/>to the Exchequer for the public benefit. There is no guarantee that a State-owned Eircom would provide better competition, services or innovation in our fully liberalised telecoms market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the Minister used terms such as &ldquo;liberalisation&rdquo;. I take it the drift will continue in the provision of telecommunications services. Eircom was floated on the Stock Exchange and then was sold to a consortium which asset-stripped it. Those involved paid themselves a &euro;500 million dividend based on borrowing. It refused to invest in the national broadband roll out or a &euro;1 billion upgrade of the network. The consortium then decided to sell on the company on the Stock Exchange.</P>

	<P>Does the Deputy have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State accept that the sale of Eircom was a disaster? A few people made themselves very rich, most notably Sir Tony O&rsquo;Reilly, while the telecommunications infrastructure has been neglected and is in decay. How is it proposed to rectify the mistake of privatising Eircom? Will the Minister re-nationalise the company? Does he want to take a strategic interest as to what is happening in the telecommunications sector?</P>
        <P>Has the Minister examined the National Pensions Reserve Fund being allowed to invest in the company&rsquo;s network? Those individuals involved in buying-out the company did not give a damn about our knowledge-based economy and the roll out of broadband. Ireland&rsquo;s telecommunications infrastructure is languishing behind those of other countries in Europe. While we hold ourselves up as greatly advanced in our telecommunications, we are the laughing stock of Europe. People in Galway have difficulties in getting e-mail services. Will the Minister rely on the market and these private investors who are more interested in profit than the public good?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no plans to re-nationalise Eircom. There are some problems with Eircom services in every constituency. It is useful to reflect on the positive elements of the telecoms sector by examining ComReg&rsquo;s latest quarterly data, covering Q4 of 2005. It shows the telecoms sector in Ireland employs about 14,500 people and is worth around &euro;4 billion. For fixed calls Ireland is better than the EU average for both national and international calls for residential and business customers. Ireland has a mobile telephone penetration rate of 102%, which shows the appetite of consumers for these types of services and the variety of mobile services in the market including 3G services. The Irish broadband market more than doubled in 2005, more than twice the rate of growth of the EU broadband market.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="2001"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>We are coming from a low ebb on that. Considering the sell-off of Aer Lingus is being mooted, why did the State not hold on to this strategic share? Was it because that was part of the agreement with Sir Tony O&rsquo;Reilly who made huge profits from the company? Was it simply left to the private sector to roll out broadband? Was there any particular reason why the Government abandoned the development of telecommunication services after investing so much money and time through the years?</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concern expressed about the long drawn out delivery of broadband services here and the resultant economic consequences; if he, directly or through the regulator, will identify the cause or causes for the delay; if his attention has further been drawn to the critical nature of the report on broadband drawn up by the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources; if he has proposals or intends to issue instructions to address the issues raised in the report; his proposals to increase the number of service providers in this area with a view to accelerated delivery of services; if he has studied or identified implications for the industry such as local loop unbundling in the event of a sale or takeover of Eircom; if his attention has further been drawn to the urgent need for investment in telecommunications infrastructure; his views on the State re-entering this market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The development and roll-out of broadband technology is primarily a matter for the industry in a fully liberalised market. However, broadband providers in Ireland were slow in launching competitive, affordable broadband. The delays in broadband roll-out can be attributed to the lack of competition between providers and the reduction in investment in infrastructure in the aftermath of the dotcom crash.</P>
        <P>The report to which the Deputy refers has been examined in some detail. It recognises that availability is improving rapidly. The latest quarterly data report from ComReg on delivery rates indicates that broadband subscriptions increased by 103% from December 2004 to December 2005 and now stand at 270,700. The current level of take-up is consistent with the stage of development of the market.</P>
        <P>The report recognises that the roll-out of broadband infrastructure in rural areas needs to be maintained. The Government&rsquo;s regional <Col N="2002"/>broadband programme is tackling supply side issues and was a direct response to the lack of investment by the private sector. High-speed, open-access metropolitan area networks, MANs, are being constructed on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase one of this programme has delivered fibre-optic networks to 27 towns and cities. This programme has been extended to more than 90 towns nationwide. These metropolitan area networks allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>According to the report, one of the biggest challenges for the Government is demand or take-up, and Ireland continues to lag behind its OECD partners in this area. Earlier this year, my Department initiated a consultation process to examine the level of demand for broadband services in the Irish market, which concluded in March. The discussion document touched on key demand factors for consumers and asked for possible examples of demand measures by Government and industry, if any are necessary. More than 100 responses were received and a wide range of issues were raised which are being examined by officials in the Department for further action.</P>
        <P>The third conclusion is that Ireland requires strong competition in the market to maintain economic competitiveness. In 2004, there were more than 80 Internet service providers while today there are more than 150 such companies with at least 45 different broadband offerings. The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain ADSL connectivity. In addition, the development of wi-max offers considerable potential for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Delays have been experienced in the provision of broadband but did the Minister take any action about them? At least three years ago, the then Minister had discussions with a number of market providers in various communications areas with a view to establishing an accelerated programme. Why was some action not taken at that time, given that the alarm bells had begun to ring? Will the Minister of State indicate to what extent he and the Government have identified the causes of the delays and set about remedying them? The joint committee&rsquo;s report is a damning indictment of the process of providing broadband in this country. It compares most unfavourably with the dramatic results achieved in other jurisdictions in a shorter time by doing some of the things the Minister and his Department refused to do.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister indicate whether the number of potential service providers could be increased? What obstructions caused them to remain outside the market and can they be dealt with? To what extent is the Minister willing to examine local loop unbundling and other issues associated with market dominance? Economists have suggested it <Col N="2003"/>is vital for the State to have some control over elements of the telecommunications infrastructure, otherwise it will not be possible to meet future requirements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 18.7% of households have broadband. Obviously, there are some roadblocks and the Minister initiated a discussion document in this regard. As I indicated, more than 100 responses were received which are being reviewed by officials in the Department to see how some of the roadblocks can be lifted.</P>
        <P>The 27 MANs projects have now been handed over to the people who will manage them. In addition, 575 communities in the group broadband scheme, which is being rolled out, will cover a population of 420,000. The Minister is examining how we can speed up implementation of the broadband project.</P>
        <P>The Deputy referred to the privatisation of certain areas. It must be borne in mind, however, that as regards all the broadband areas in which the Government has invested, including the MANs project and the rural areas project, the infrastructure will remain within the Department&rsquo;s control. While people will be allowed to operate the system, the actual infrastructure will be under the control of the Department.</P>
        <P>Deputy Crowe raised an important issue earlier. The Eircoms of this world were not prepared to become actively involved in infrastructural development for broadband. The Government decided to do that through the Department and as a result, we have had huge investment in the schools, MANs and rural broadband projects. All that infrastructure will remain under the control of the Department.</P>

        <Quest>his plans to provide fibre-optic broadband to serve the hub town of Tuam, County Galway, in order that the town is provided with a world-class broadband service to enable it achieve its potential as envisaged under the national spatial strategy.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market. The Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructural deficit by building high-speed, open access broadband networks in association with the local and regional authorities. Some 27 metropolitan area networks, MANs, have been completed on time and under budget under phase one of the MANs programme. These completed networks are being managed independently for the State by Enet, the <Col N="2004"/>management services entity, and offer wholesale open access to all service providers.</P>
        <P>In planning the next phase of the MANs programme a review of the availability of DSL broadband in the regions showed that more than 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and more were not being offered a broadband option by the private sector. These towns were selected for investment under phase two of the MANs programme. A number of regional towns, including Tuam, already had DSL broadband on offer from the service providers, so priority was given to the provision of essential broadband infrastructure in those towns where none existed.</P>
        <P>Five towns in County Galway will have MANs constructed under this phase: Athenry, Ballinasloe, Clifden, Gort and Loughrea. The detailed design stage is already under way, project managers have been appointed and construction is expected to begin over the coming months. The cost of the projects in Galway is more than &euro;7 million and the Department will provide grant aid of more than &euro;6 million. These networks should be completed within 12 to 18 months thereafter. Tuam is not part of the current roll-out but may be included in further phases subject to the necessary approvals and Exchequer funding being made available.</P>
        <P>Galway County Council has submitted a strong case for a MAN project to be built in Tuam and this is being kept under review. Broadband is available in Tuam. The Department&rsquo;s sponsored website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>, which facilitates consumers trying to locate broadband service providers in their area, lists 12 Internet service providers offering broadband on digital subscriber lines, DSL, one company offering it via wireless, and 11 satellite broadband providers.</P>
        <P>The Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the county and group broadband scheme. The scheme is technology neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area. To date, a total capital investment of &euro;2.19 million has been made in GBS projects in Galway involving a total of &euro;533,000 in grant aid to implement these projects.</P>

      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>The bottom line here is very simple because Tuam is designated as a hub town in the national spatial strategy. It has also been designated as a RAPID town for growth by Galway County Council. Does the Minister agree that growth cannot happen without fibre optic broadband? In his reply, the Minister of State indicated that Tuam has broadband. That is no excuse. It is like stating Ireland has a road network and then it transpires those roads are boreens in places where dual carriages are required.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State agree this is a prime example of the disconnection between various Government strategies? The national spatial strategy designated Tuam as a hub town, and <Col N="2005"/>decreed that Government and State agencies would tailor and design their policies to underpin the national spatial strategy. In this case we find that Galway County Council made a submission to the Department for six towns in County Galway, five of which were approved. The one not approved was Tuam, which is the only one designated as a hub town in the entire county of Galway. Does the Minister agree that Tuam simply cannot achieve its potential, attract foreign direct investment or develop as envisaged in the national spatial strategy without fibre optic broadband? The Minister of State&rsquo;s Department refuses to allow Tuam to achieve its potential by not granting the installation of fibre optic broadband.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact that Tuam and other large towns throughout the country, including three in my county, had DSL meant the Minister decided to invest in towns without DSL. It is now acceptable that the MANs programme and networks far exceed the DSL programme. For that reason, towns such as Tuam, Thurles, Shannon, Enniscorthy, Naas and Ennis are being considered by the Department. The capital involved to bring these towns up to the level of a MANs project is approximately &euro;60 million. The Department is in discussions with the Department of Finance to advance this issue.</P>
        <P>I accept what the Deputy stated. DSL is inferior in ways and large towns such as the Deputy&rsquo;s need a MANs project. The Department is examining that. The overall cost will be approximately &euro;60 million. We must convince the Minister and the Department of Finance to advance that money to the Department. The phase 2 programme will come to an end shortly and we will strongly push to have a MANs project in Tuam and other towns throughout the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State take the situation in Tuam seriously? I will give an example of how important it is. The IDA invested &euro;3.5 million in the purchase of land and the development of a business technology park in Tuam, which was completed more than two years ago. To this day, not one operation has set up in that park. One of the main reasons is the absence of high-speed broadband technology. Will the Minister of State take that message back to his officials and deal with Tuam as rapidly as possible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I will certainly have discussions with the officials. The Deputy can take it that we are anxious that towns such as Tuam will be brought up to the same status as MANs programme towns. We will put every effort into securing the finances for that.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>if he will report on the recent frontier Slyne-Erris-Donegal licensing round; his views on reviewing the current terms for the exploration and exploitation of natural resources here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[13610/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Five applications were received for frontier exploration licences in the recent Slyne-Erris-Donegal licensing round which closed on 15 March. These applications were from Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited with Shell E. &amp; P. Ireland Limited as a partner, Serica Energy (UK) Limited, Grianan Energy Limited and two applications from Island Oil &amp; Gas plc with Lundin Exploration BV and Endeavour Energy (UK) Limited as partners. A total of six full blocks and ten part-blocks were applied for under the licensing round. These applications are being considered by officials of the Department. Awards of licences are not expected to be announced until early June.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and I are pleased with the response to this licensing round and hope that it will, in time, lead to new petroleum discoveries. In Ireland, we import 80% of our natural gas requirements and 100% of our oil requirements. It is therefore extremely important that we try to reduce or eliminate this high level of dependency on petroleum imports. For that reason we need to continue promoting and encouraging petroleum exploration in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s terms are kept under constant review by the Department in light of the international market in which Ireland seeks to attract exploration companies. Ireland has yet to make the breakthrough needed to establish its prospectivity. The awards to be made under the current round will be issued under the 1992 licensing terms. When this round has been completed, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, will turn his attention to the question of whether the 1992 licensing terms remain appropriate in this age of high gas and oil prices and the emerging tight supply position in Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, told us last autumn that he was considering re-examining the licensing terms for our oil and gas reserves. We have not heard a word from him since. During the earlier discussion today, I thought we should do an audit of how much taxpayers&rsquo; money the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has lost. I mentioned the voting machines and the climate levies. Perhaps we also <Col N="2007"/>have serious possible losses to the Exchequer from his dilatory behaviour on these licences.</P>
        <P>I welcome the five licences to which the Minister of State referred. Looking at our frontier territory, I notice that two thirds of the blocks in the north-west have yet to be awarded. As any oil and gas found belongs to companies which only pay 25% corporation tax, it leads to the possibility of grave losses for this country. The companies do not even have to land the oil here. The 1992 licensing terms are extremely generous.</P>
        <P>Approximately one year ago, the Minister gave Providence Resources and Sosina Exploration an exclusive licence to explore and exploit the so-called &ldquo;Dunquin&rdquo; area off the south-west coast. The great Dr. &mdash; or Sir &mdash; A. J. F. O&rsquo;Reilly has a 7% interest in those companies, which one of his journalists estimated may now be worth &euro;20 billion. Those companies simply transferred 80% share in the licence to ExxonMobil. Why could the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, not have done that? Why could he not have made an arrangement from the start to get the maximum possible benefit for the people with the larger exploration company?</P>
        <P>The real point of the Slyne-Erris concession is that once again we are sleep-walking and giving away vital resources and reserves from the people. I brought forward a Bill on behalf of the Labour Party, which would include an annual report to Parliament, such as the climate report requested by our Green Party colleagues, to keep terms constantly under review.</P>
        <P>My great predecessor, Justin Keating, instituted a much fairer regime in the 1970s, which the Minister of State&rsquo;s Government and predecessors wrecked and left us in the helpless free-for-all situation we now have. It is time we had urgent reform of Irish offshore licensing in the best interests of the country. This week Forf&aacute;s stated we have a dangerous oil dependency, are addicted to oil and the country is vulnerable until our renewable energy sources are brought up to scratch. We must take care of our indigenous resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I should have included in the reply that a strategic environment assessment is being undertaken for the Slyne-Erris-Donegal basins. The result of this will be known by early April. However, it is subject to a public consultation process during April and May and no licence will be awarded until after this time.</P>
        <P>Regarding a review, the Deputy will be pleased to know that the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has agreed to have a review in the Department, which is under way. Ireland has yet to establish itself as a petroleum province. The details for the Slyne-Erris-Donegal round state that licences will be issued under the 1992 licensing terms. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, requested that a thorough and compre<Col N="2008"/>hensive review of licence terms be completed as quickly as possible, and work is progressing on this review. He will engage consultants to participate in this process to ensure an independent perspective on work completed to date in the review, and to consider the overall terms.</P>

	<P>Have lessons been learned from previous exploration experiences, for instance in respect of the development of the Corrib gas field?

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Broughan made the point this morning that we need to be sensitive in making decisions and to take into account people living in the area. In respect of the Slyne-Erris-Donegal round, a strategic environmental assessment is under way which will go to public consultation before licences are issued. I worked in this Department in the past and saw that companies are not in any great rush to get involved in exploration &mdash; there was no interest in one of the previous rounds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>At that time I met the union and had several discussions about reviewing the terms. I am pleased that the Minister has decided to carry out a comprehensive review and to involve consultants to ensure an independent point of view, although sometimes we complain about consultants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it possible to include a condition in the licensing arrangement that any oil or gas found would be landed and processed in Ireland, or is it possible that someone could discover oil or gas in our waters and process and land it elsewhere?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point and will put it to the officials to see if it is being considered in the review which covers all issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>If the uptake is so poor why is the gas or oil not left in the ground, given that it is of no benefit to us? Were no lessons learnt about the individuals involved in negotiations on behalf of the State? Part of the problem regarding the Corrib gas line may have been that certain individuals had their own interests at heart, rather than those of the State. What is the benefit in giving away an asset for the benefit of private companies if the Irish people will not benefit? There are very few jobs in this area so the Minister of State cannot use employment as an excuse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that leaving the oil or gas in the ground is the answer. The cost benefit analyses in respect of the Corrib gas line <Col N="2009"/>found it would be important to bring the gas ashore. That would create many jobs but as Members said this morning, if we bring it ashore we need to take account of the sensitivities involved. We need to learn lessons from what has happened and make decisions based on what is before us. We also need to take into account the importance of finding gas and oil at a time when we import 100% of our oil and 70% of our gas.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 30 and 106 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully-liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>In comparison with other European states, broadband providers in Ireland were slow in launching competitive, affordable broadband. The lack of competition between providers and the reduction in investment in infrastructure in the aftermath of the dot-com crash weakened the initial roll-out by providers here. The situation, however, is improving rapidly and the level of uptake is consistent with the stage of development of the market. Ireland is now the fastest growing broadband economy in the EU. The latest ComReg quarterly report states there are 270,700 broadband subscribers as of end-2005. This is equivalent to 6.6% of the population. There are also an estimated 600,000 narrow band users.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Home Internet penetration figures stand at 18.7% of households. Almost 140,000 new broadband subscribers were added in 2005, a growth <Col N="2010"/>rate of 106% in 2005. This compares to 100,000 new broadband subscribers in 2004. The Government target is 400,000 by end-2006, namely, almost 10% of population or 27% of households. The Minister&rsquo;s challenge to industry is 500,000 broadband subscribers by end-2006, that is, approximately 12% of the population or 34% of households. This is the lowest cost country in the OECD for international connectivity, our regional broadband pricing is on a par with the best in Europe, and the price of basic broadband access is at the EU average. Furthermore, Ireland is now one of the cheapest locations in the world for international leased lines.</P>
        <P>The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high-speed open access metropolitan area networks, MANs in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase 1 of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country, which were built on time and under budget.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This programme has been extended to a further 90 towns in various locations nationwide. Design and procurement has already commenced in several regions and construction is due to start over the coming months. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007. These MANs will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>The Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities to become self-sufficient in broadband through the county and group broadband scheme. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area. To date, over 150 projects have been approved for funding under this programme.</P>
        <P>A joint industry-Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the broadband for schools programme, which will provide every school in the country with broadband by the first half of 2006. The construction and installation phase is under way, and the project is on target for completion within the set timeframe.</P>
        <P>Full details of the regional broadband programme can be found on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dcmnr.gov.ie</i>.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State not accept that the State&rsquo;s broadband coverage is shameful and as a result the Government has decided to privatise Eircom? In the Six Counties, 100% broadband saturation has been reached, compared with the figures of 1.7% coverage in the Twenty-six Counties last year.</P>
        <P>The European Commission recently criticised Ireland for being one of the slowest movers in the provision and usage of Internet technology. If the Government is committed to the idea of a knowledge-based economy why is broadband take-up <Col N="2011"/>in Ireland among the lowest in the European Union?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State puts it down to lack of competition but are we not awaiting the goodwill of private companies and relying on private investors? If the Government had held on to the Eircom shares it could have invested those hundreds of millions of euro that went to private speculators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The State is providing funding for the roll-out of broadband. As outlined, the MANs project is going to 120 towns and cities nationwide, with phase 1 completed and phase 2 under way. The Government-funded schools broadband project will be completed this year. The county and group broadband scheme is grant-aided by the Government and my Department.</P>

	<P>Notwithstanding the Minister of State&rsquo;s explanation for the slowdown in the dotcom sector, does he agree that the real reasons for the slow provision and take-up of broadband were Government inertia and ineptitude, its failure to recognise that the situation had changed, the lack of investment in the infrastructure and the lack of a driving force in the Department? The dividends drawn from the infrastructure as a result of the new situation should have been re-invested in the infrastructure instead of the other way around. Does the Minister of State accept that the Department, which should have been the driving force, failed to recognise the danger signs and let matters run along?</P>

	<P>As I stated in my reply, the Department&rsquo;s target for this year is 400,000 by the end of the year.</P>

	<P>It is the same target as last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>We have invested substantial sums of money in the MANs, rural areas and school projects and this investment will continue. As I outlined earlier, we are seeking a further &euro;6 million to continue to invest in major towns throughout the country where the MANs project does not operate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not true that when Deputy Noel Dempsey became Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, he stated during a visit to UCD that he wanted 600,000 lines by the end of 2006? He then changed his target. He is only halfway there. Every Deputy receives e-mails, or telephone calls in the case of people who do not have e-mail outside work, in respect of broadband. One such call I received <Col N="2012"/>this week came from a newly expanding area in Wexford. The person who contacted me was very irate because they had done everything possible to obtain a broadband connection but still had not been connected, despite the fact that a Minister comes from the area in question. It is very embarrassing for all of us that the situation regarding broadband services is so poor.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister of State consulted the Australian venture capitalists, Babcock &amp; Brown? Representatives from the company visited Dublin in recent weeks and sought out Opposition spokespersons and other relevant individuals. Babcock &amp; Brown appears to have a very clear vision of what it wishes to do, which is to re-organise the network as a separate company which is not connected with the retail division and Meteor. Has the Minister of State met the company? What are his views in respect of the possible impact on the network of a takeover of Eircom by Babcock &amp; Brown?</P>
        <P>When will the Minister of State bring forward legislation relating to ComReg, which we have sought for a long time? When does he plan to strengthen ComReg? We receive all its press releases but everything in them is aspirational. Why can we not have a real regulator like Ofcom in the UK?</P>
        <P>What is the Minister of State doing to stimulate demand? He spoke about the schools programme but is it not pathetic that we do not have a dedicated educational programme? Why can we not give every child a laptop and produce new pedagogical material that reflects how teaching will be revolutionised in the new era? If it is not possible to introduce such measures now, why does the Minister not announce that the next Government will introduce them?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>his preferred options for the development of local radio in view of the development of the industry in recent years with particular reference to sales or takeovers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[13829/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The licensing of local radio is a matter for the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, which carries out its functions under the Radio and Television Act 1988. In this regard, the BCI is charged with the orderly development of sound broadcasting services and with ensuring the appropriate development of the sector. Independent radio and community radio undertakings have all performed well over the past decade. It could be concluded that the overall framework and structure is suitable as is and should not be significantly altered. However, it is the case that services and markets will change over time and it is likely that a static approach to the development of the radio licensing framework will not, in the long run, serve the listener well.</P>
        <P>With this in mind, in late 2003, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources initiated a review of radio licensing in Ireland. This review culminated in a study by sectoral experts entitled the Ox report. The report indicated that additional radio licensing is possible in Ireland, given the availability of spectrum. The report raised some concerns regarding the viability of some local radio franchises given their market size. The report also considered issues around ownership and control of radio stations and the need for balance in this regard. Options with regard to financial charges such as spectrum levies and royalties on radio stations using scarce spectrum were also discussed. In developing the legislative proposals which will establish the broadcasting authority of Ireland, the Minister will consider the findings of the Ox report and developments in the local radio sector generally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the recommendations of the Ox report be implemented in full or will they be kept secret? Will the Minister of State share the report with his colleagues in the House for the betterment of the industry? Notwithstanding the success to date of the local and private broadcasting sector, it is now necessary to review in the context of the broadcasting Bill, which should have been put before the House by now, the developments which have already taken place in the public broadcasting sector and which are likely to take place in the private broadcasting sector. Given the movement of the marketplace, <Col N="2014"/>the degree to which takeovers, sales or buyouts are likely to take place in the local broadcasting sector could have an impact on the degree to which local broadcasting remains an entity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>All the issues raised by Deputy Durkan were addressed in the Ox report and have been considered by the Minister. There is nothing secretive about the report. In it Ox Auction Experts examined four different tools which could be used to generate a financial return to the State. These were auctions, which is a mechanism to assign a licence to the highest bidder; market-based spectrum fees or royalties; clawback arrangements, a method used to ensure that a portion of any windfall profits earned as a result of spectrum ownership are shared with the Exchequer; or a combination of these mechanisms. All these issues have been put forward and are being considered by the Minister. He has not made a final decision but all of these mechanisms are up for consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State not accept that there are grave concerns that a number of dominant companies are gaining control of significant numbers of stations and that, ultimately, viewers and listeners will be left with restricted choice? Is this not the core point which the Minister must address?</P>
        <P>In that context, will the Department make any announcement on digital audio broadcasting, DAB, which operates in the UK. DAB provides additional free to air services. I am unaware of any DAB services in Ireland. Why have we not taken some initiatives in respect of DAB which is a very exciting development in UK media circles?</P>
        <P>I wish to make a slightly parochial point, although I am the Labour Party&rsquo;s national spokesperson on this issue. There is grave disquiet in the Dublin region over the decision by the very successful local radio station, NewsTalk 106, to apply for a national radio licence. This station covers all aspects of social and economic life in Dublin very well and has been especially valuable for Dublin public representatives. There is grave concern that the service provided by NewsTalk 106 to the Dublin region, which is replicated by between 30 and 40 other regional radio stations throughout the country who perform so admirably, will be lost if NewsTalk 106 becomes a national station. We need a Dublin-based public affairs station like NewsTalk 106.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very important that a station like NewsTalk continues to broadcast and is available to Dublin. We have South East Radio and other stations around the country are very much regionally or locally based. It is important that cities also have locally based radio stations. I will bring the Deputy&rsquo;s views to the Minister. The report of Ox Consultants is with the Minister and, hopefully, some decisions will be made shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure. Perhaps my colleagues across the country could hear the wisdom of Deputies in Dublin. NewsTalk has added to public debate. It was a significant risk and endeavour to try to set up a talk radio station of high standard and NewsTalk should be recognised for doing so. I would be concerned if it went national and lost some of its Dublin impetus but, at the same time, there is room for such a national talk station to rival RTE Radio 1. I would have asked the Minister of State about whether he has any knowledge of when a decision will be made on this matter but, from his final comment, the answer would be &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Is it purely for the commission to make the decision or can any reference be made to the Minister?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The BCI is the governing body. It is obligated to consider the desirability of allowing any person or group of persons to have control of or substantial interest in an undue amount of communications media in an area specified when considering the award of a licence and to take account of local needs. The BCI will take into account the issues raised by Deputy Eamon Ryan. In my part of the country, we have local radio stations. I am sure it is the same elsewhere. We also have Beat 102-103, which was recently set up as a regional station and has proven successful. I am not the final decision maker but I do not see a reason cities should not have local stations also.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10, 34, 51, 58 and 85 together.</P>
        <P>The State has no plans to invest in Eircom&rsquo;s infrastructure or regain control of any part thereof. Representatives of Babcock &amp; Brown, a global investment and advisory firm founded in 1977 and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, met with representatives of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on 22 February. Babcock &amp; Brown sought to introduce itself to the Department as a courtesy and advise of its interest in Eircom. As Eircom is not a State company, the Department has no role in any talks between the companies.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications infrastructure and services is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. However, recognising that a principal reason for the slow roll out of broadband services has been the lack of investment by the private sector in the necessary infrastructure to deliver broadband to all areas, the Government is addressing the infrastructural <Col N="2017"/>deficit in the regions by building high speed, open access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide. Phase one of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country. </P>
        <P el="10">
          <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>. </P>
        <P>This programme has been extended to over 90 towns in various locations nationwide. It is expected these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007. These networks will allow the private sector to offer world class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>The Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the county and group broadband scheme. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area. To date, more than 150 projects have been approved for funding under this programme. These initiatives are co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund under the national development plan. Funding under the plan also assisted Eircom and BT to enable more than 50 exchanges to provide broadband services and also co-funded the construction of a national backbone network by ESB Telecoms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should expand on the Department&rsquo;s preferred options now that an opportunity appears to have arisen for someone to take over or buy Eircom. Does the Minister of State agree there are implications for the consumer? For example, is it likely that the provision of broadband facilities will continue at a slow pace or will there be a low investment level in infrastructure? Will the Minister of State comment on the opinion expressed by a number of economists that the State should have control of certain vital elements of the telecommunications infrastructure? Has this been given any consideration or is it likely to happen? Must we wait to determine what will occur in respect of who owns Eircom?</P>
        <P>Let us assume a company other than Babcock &amp; Brown decides to take over Eircom without a plan. For example, Babcock &amp; Brown has proposed the separation of two elements of the service provision, which would leave one part under the control of one company and the other part under the control of another group without having common board members. Would it be possible for the State to examine what is about to happen and determine whether there are implications for the future so it could become involved?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The State has no plans to re-invest in the Eircom infrastructure. Babcock &amp; Brown has approached the Department and explained its interest in Eircom. I am sure that other companies will also be interested and <Col N="2018"/>inform the Department accordingly. The Government has no interest in reacquiring Eircom. It will be for private investors to get involved. In recent months, Babcock &amp; Brown Capital Limited has acquired shares in Eircom Group plc.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the crucial role of Eircom in respect of our telecommunications infrastructure and broadband, would it be possible for the Government in discussions with the possible new owners &mdash; there are many discussions that must take place, including with people representing the ESOT and other stakeholders &mdash; to request of them under the universal service obligation to operate the network in a way that would be beneficial to the final broadband enablement of Ireland? Is it good enough for the Minister of State to tell the House he is just a bystander? The Taoiseach, who is usually where the Minister of State is sitting, is always a bystander, the man in Croke Park watching the match. He is never the man who must take responsibility or run the team. In reality, he is the man who runs the team, as seen in the case of Aer Lingus where he made the decision to privatise the company. If the takeover occurs, does the Minister of State agree there should be a precondition set in respect of the shambles that is the roll out of broadband?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has spoken about the mysterious &ldquo;Project Dingle&rdquo;. Perhaps that should be &ldquo;Project Daingean&rdquo;. As far as we on this side of the House have been able to determine, &ldquo;Project Dingle&rdquo; means that all of the broadband infrastructure of the semi-State bodies would be brought together under a single leadership. A dynamic person in the industry has recently taken over the running of Enet. With such a track record, what are the implications for &ldquo;Project Dingle&rdquo;? Will it go ahead or was it only conceived of by the Minister when he was answering questions in the House?</P>
        <P>Given recent developments in respect of the Australian venture capitalists, is it not incumbent on us to speed up the introduction of new powers for ComReg, in particular regarding the regulation of the network, so the mess we have got into in the past six or seven years under this Administration will not continue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is always important that we have the most modern powers in place to deal with our actions and decisions. Babcock &amp; Brown approached the Department. We have no say in the purchase of Eircom but, if Babcock &amp; Brown did purchase it, we would hold discussions with that company in respect of the development of broadband.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Did Babcock &amp; Brown ask the Department about what the new legislation will include?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="2019"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation is being prepared in the Department. We want to engage with any company that takes over Eircom to help develop and roll out broadband and determine what are the company&rsquo;s aspirations and views. I am sure we will do so. There may be other Babcock &amp; Browns that will become involved in the purchase of Eircom. We will not get involved in any way, shape or form at this stage. I am sure that if the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, stated that &ldquo;Project Dingle&rdquo;, as the Deputy called it, will be rolled out and implemented, that is what will happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government might be rolled out first.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I told Deputy Durkan to wait until next May.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will be rolled out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As Eircom has been scrutinised by so many groups, I am unsure whether there are many with which Members are unfamiliar. Does the Minister of State not agree that while he has stated that the State would not buy Eircom, no one has suggested that it should. Babcock &amp; Brown appears to propose splitting the company in two. Hence, while Eircom would continue to act as a supply and mobile telephone company, the network would be available. Is there a possibility of buying back the wires rather than buying Eircom? Such a network could then be operated on an open basis for companies like Eircom and other suppliers. Is that a possibility?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State noted that there might be another purchaser. However, I understand that Babcock &amp; Brown&rsquo;s shareholding is sufficient for it to be in a commanding position to determine whether another bid would be successful. This makes the possibility of another purchaser extremely unlikely.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State agree that effectively, at present the State is engaged in establishing its own independent separate network? He lauded the significant financial investment that has been made in alternative fibre networks, very little of which has been lit up. To an extent, this investment went against some of the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. In terms of an alternative network, it did not make sense to replicate fibre networks that were already in place.</P>
        <P>Hence, rather than spending hundreds of millions by building an alternative network and adopting the Minister&rsquo;s &ldquo;Project Dingle dell&rdquo;, it might be worthwhile for the State to consider setting up a single fibre optic network on which all companies could co-exist. Is Ireland big enough to have two fibre optic networks? That does not <Col N="2020"/>seem to make economic sense. If Babcock &amp; Brown buys the company and divests itself of the network, it might be worth considering the possibility that it would be cheaper to buy it than to build our own separate network.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State accept that Eircom has come full circle? Once it was a fully listed company on the Stock Exchange with a fixed line and mobile network service. Later, it sold its mobile network service. Subsequently, it delisted from the Stock Exchange before floating again last year and since then it has talked about buying another mobile telephone company. It appears to have gone in a circle. Perhaps the circle to which Members should return is consideration of the question of public ownership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The only company which has an interest at present of which I am aware is Babcock &amp; Brown. It has significant shares in Eircom at present. I am certain that at present, the State has no plans to invest in Eircom&rsquo;s infrastructure or to regain control of any part thereof.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 38, 83, 178 and 210 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are probably aware, a number of residents living close to the onshore upstream pipeline for the Corrib gas field have been expressing concerns regarding its safety. To allay the fears of the residents, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, commissioned an international consulting company, Advantica, on 25 August 2005 to carry out a thorough and independent safety review of the proposed upstream onshore pipeline. Advantica is a world leader in the area of advanced hazard and risk assessment technologies of gas pipelines.</P>
        <P>In parallel with this safety review, the Minister established a public consultation process to ensure that the concerns of the community would be fully addressed in the review. As part of this process, a two day public hearing was held in Geesala on 12 and 13 of October, chaired by Mr. John Gallagher SC, during which the community was given the opportunity to express its concerns directly to the consultants. The consultants also made a separate site inspection of the pipeline route and subsequently took the local concerns into account when carrying out their review. The review also critically examined all relevant documentation relating to the design, construction and operation of the pipeline and associated facilities, as well as to conclude whether the proposed installations would comply with recognised international best practice and would deliver a facility that it is fit for its purpose. Advantica was also asked to identify any deficiencies with regard to the safety of the pipeline and to make recommendations as to how these, if identified, would be remedied.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>The draft safety review was presented to the community on 8 December 2005 and published on the same day. Comments were invited on the draft, with a closing date of December 22. The final report of the safety review was received in the Department recently and will be published shortly, together with recommendations arising from it made by the Corrib pipeline technical advisory group within the Department.</P>
        <P>The Deputies will also be aware that the Minister has, after consultation with relevant parties, nominated a mediator, Mr. Peter Cassells, to work with the parties. This process is ongoing and <Col N="2022"/>entirely independent. However the Minister will obviously take account of any specific recommendations which might arise and are relevant. The Minister will publish the Advantica report, the technical advisory group report and recommendations arising from them. In addition he will consider consents for phases five and six of the project, which must be decided on the basis of the Advantica and technical advisory group recommendations, in due course.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The main benefits to the State will be that Ireland will again have a significant indigenous energy supply. This will result in a reduced dependence on gas imports for some three to four years at a time when our main supplier to date, the United Kingdom, will become a net importer of natural gas, due to the depletion of its reserves. Other benefits to the State from this discovery would be that the Corrib field may act as a catalyst for the possible extension of the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann gas distribution system to towns in the north-west region, as well as providing tax revenue to the State and encouraging investment in oil and gas exploration.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to bring this issue before the House and I thank, in anticipation, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for taking the matter.</P>
        <P>I raise an issue pertaining to community child care groups which have been allocated large-scale capital funding under the equal opportunities child care programme. The groups to which I refer are located in west Limerick and are based in Kilcolman, Newcastle West, Broadford and Rathkeale. These groups must be in a position to sign contracts with Pobal within a 12 month period and the timeframe ranges from June to November 2006. However, each group must meet specific pre-contract requirements to be in a position to draw down funding, including a revised capital work plan that demonstrates how the project can be achieved with the approved funding. The principal obstacle for these groups is that <Col N="2024"/>they received approvals for significantly smaller budgets than those for which they applied.</P>
        <P>Between December 2004 and December 2005, the four community groups, all based in west Limerick, have been allocated funding. As I have stated, each project received approval for significantly less than was required. Thus, St. Colman&rsquo;s Childcare Service, Kilcolman, received approval for &euro;1.1 million, whereas the required total comes to almost &euro;1.4 million. The Desmond Complex Ability Resource Centre, Newcastle West, received approval for &euro;1 million, while its original budget was for &euro;1.8 million. Broadford Voluntary Housing Committee, Broadford, received approval for &euro;1 million, while its original budget was &euro;2.13 million, and Rathkeale Childcare Limited, Rathkeale, was allocated &euro;1.4 million, whereas its original budget was almost &euro;2.9 million.</P>
        <P>Pobal, which was previously known as ADM, has advised each group that it should be able to implement its project at a cost of &euro;20,000 per child care place without reducing the number of child care places originally targeted. Pobal argues that other community groups have been able to develop child care services for a cost of &euro;20,000 per child care place. However, examples given by Pobal are not comparable to the projects in question as they all received some additional support, such as, having a site purchased and developed by the county council, already owning a site or receiving other funding. However, this is not the case for the groups in question.</P>
        <P>In recent months, the groups have worked on their architectural plans and their costings in order to meet the funding requirements. Only one group, namely, the Desmond Complex Ability Resource Centre cr&egrave;che, is in a position to proceed with its project at present. This is mainly due to the fact that the child care project is part of a larger project and costs have been reduced. For instance, its site purchase and development costs are significantly lower than for a stand-alone child care project.</P>
        <P>The groups have met County Limerick Childcare Committee and its partner agencies and have agreed to explore how costs may be cut. However, they have also made the case to Pobal and to the Office of the Minister for Children for additional funding to make up the shortfall. I also make that case today.</P>
        <P>All four applications, including architectural plans, were submitted between December 2002 and December 2003. No consideration has been given to the subsequent rise in site and building costs. The groups waited for almost three years for their applications to be processed by Pobal and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P Just="Left">County Limerick Childcare Committee can find no example of a group that has developed a child care project for &euro;20,000 per child care place. When groups applied for funding, the &euro;20,000 benchmark was not being used by Pobal or the <Col N="2025"/>DJELR. All four groups have already invested significantly in the development of architect plans required as part of their application. The new child care investment programme announced in December 2005 does not require architect plans for an application. An in depth needs analysis was carried out by all four groups prior to submitting applications to Pobal. One of the groups, Broadford Voluntary Housing Committee, has significant experience developing infrastructural projects, including a social housing and day-care centre, and has always delivered within budget. The EU component of the equal opportunities child care programme funding must be spent and reported by June 2007. A number of community capital projects approved but not implemented are under review by Pobal and may have their funding decommitted. This funding could be used to make these projects viable. If groups cannot proceed with projects, &euro;4.5 million in infrastructural investment will be lost to west Limerick. The time and effort the groups have invested on a voluntary basis will be lost to a need which has been carefully researched and identified. The implementation of the four projects would have enormous benefit for the areas outlined and the west Limerick region in general.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputies are aware, I have responsibility for child care under the newly established Office of the Minister for Children. I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter.</P>
        <P>Deputy Neville referred to particular groups in County Limerick who were approved capital grant assistance under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006. The programme has both an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective. It aims to increase the supply of centre-based child care places by 55%, or 31,300 additional places, by the end of the programme. Current forecasts of impact suggest that it will ultimately create at least 40,000 new child care places, of which more than 26,000 are already in place. The allocation for the equal opportunities child care programme is now almost &euro;500 million. As the Deputy is aware, the four child care projects to which he referred in his motion have been approved a total of &euro;4.5 million in capital grant assistance.</P>
        <P>Many child care services throughout Limerick city and county have benefited from grant assistance under the programme. To the end of December 2005, funding of more than &euro;28 million was allocated for child care in Limerick city and county. This funding is leading to the creation of more than 1,700 new child care places and supporting almost 1,500 existing places throughout the city and county.</P>
        <P>In the case of the community-based not-for-profit capital projects approved under the programme, the value for money criterion referred to by the Deputy which is being applied is that the <Col N="2026"/>maximum cost per place created should not normally exceed &euro;20,000. Given the enormous sums being invested in child care facilities by the Government, and the ongoing and welcome development of new projects throughout the country, I am sure the Deputy will agree that there is an onus on us to ensure that value for money remains a key criterion to be used when assessing project proposals.</P>
        <P>The four projects in question have been approved indicative amounts of funding, subject to further development of the proposals and external appraisal by a building specialist. All four groups have been in contact with and are receiving support from Limerick County Childcare Committee. They have met other groups in the area that have been approved indicative funding. I understand they are working together to reduce the costs of their projects. I further understand that Limerick County Childcare Committee has been supplied with a list of large-scale capital projects that have progressed within the &euro;20,000 per child care place limit. There have been in excess of 200 large scale capital projects approved under the programme to date, all of which were subject to the value for money criterion. Applicants were able to provide child care places within the criterion, and in some cases for significantly less than the &euro;20,000 maximum.</P>
        <P>I also note that the amounts approved to the four projects in question are at the higher end of the scale in terms of large-scale capital grants approved, varying from &euro;1 million to &euro;1.4 million. Only 24 groups nationally have been approved a capital grant in the region of &euro;1.4 million or more. Deputies will appreciate that if the benefits of the programme are to be felt throughout the country, it is important that funding is not concentrated on a small number of projects and that a national and regional spread of approvals is achieved to meet local needs.</P>
        <P>I understand that one of the groups in question is in a position to proceed soon. I hope the current contacts with Pobal will allow the groups to agree revised plans in the not too distant future. It is open to any group to formally appeal the level of funding approved. However, I am not aware that any of the groups in question has done so to date. I hope contact will be maintained with Pobal to ensure these projects become sustainable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is only fair to emphasise that the child care programme has been central to the development of child care in Ireland. I expect the new national child care investment programme, which will run from 2006 to 2010, and which was announced in this House by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, in his Budget Statement last December, will be equally effective.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is taking a serious and long-term approach to child care by developing sound policies and substantial programmes of investment which will ensure the future welfare of our children and assist their parents in their daily <Col N="2027"/>lives. The Government has fully demonstrated its commitment in this regard and it is my intention to demonstrate my personal commitment to these issues during my term as Minister with responsibility for children.</P>
        <P>The two Senators from the west Limerick area raised the matter in the Seanad this afternoon. Deputy Cregan has also raised the matter with me. I will examine it to see how progress can be made.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will be aware of the daylight robbery of &euro;1.5 million cash in transit in the past three weeks and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform wringing his hands in dismay at the failure of his nonsensical voluntary code to prevent it happening. It is totally unacceptable that there is no statutory code in place to regulate the delivery of large sums of money by private security firms. Many of the large private security firms operating here are not even licensed to operate here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Private Security Services Act was passed in 2004, the purpose of which was, first, to licence the private security industry, which we all know to be a burgeoning industry with numbers far in excess of the combined Army and Garda, and, second, to establish proper standards for the industry. However, the Minister&rsquo;s intervention and meddling in the work of the Private Security Authority has resulted in a voluntary code of practice being established which is honoured more in its breach than in its observance by the security firms. The security firms have been laughing all the way to the bank. The &euro;1.5 million has been stolen with ridiculous ease because none of the &ldquo;gentleman&rsquo;s agreement&rdquo; with the Minister was implemented by the firms delivering the cash. They agreed the agreement but they did not bother to implement it, and the Minister did nothing to ensure they would implement it.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Likewise, the Minister&rsquo;s stewardship of the Garda has been just as haphazard and inefficient. There was no Garda escort on any of the three recent large deliveries amounting to at least the &euro;1.5 million which was stolen. Just as it might be in &ldquo;Keystone Cops&rdquo;, the local garda&iacute; where the large sums of money were being delivered were not informed about the deliveries in their area of jurisdiction. They were totally ignorant of the delivery. Once again, the Minister&rsquo;s ineptitude and arrogance has put the lives of security personnel at risk and given another victory to the criminals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Private Security Authority, which is up and running for some time, is obliged under the law to provide a strategic plan and lay it before this House. As this has not been done, the authority is in breach of its own statutory requirements. We have been working on this legislation <Col N="2028"/>since 2001. I had to raise the matter with the Taoiseach on a couple of occasions to get the Minister to move on it. Eventually it was passed in 2004. It took the Minister until 2005 to set up the authority, and having done so, he provides a voluntary code rather than the statutory code provided for under the legislation. Nothing has come before this House in terms of the plan of the authority in regard to licensing practices and standards that must be implemented. It appears that we are passing legislation in this House, the Minister is bypassing it and the body set up to ensure the matter came before the House once the plan had been drawn up has not done so. We must have answers as to what is happening in this area before more lives are put at risk and more cash is stolen.</P>

	<P>I am giving this reply on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell.</P>
        <P>The Minister shares the Deputy&rsquo;s concern and that of the public in general, with regard to the recent robberies of cash-in-transit. He condemns utterly the three recent robberies. Deputies may be aware that another robbery was attempted on a security van in north Dublin this morning, which the crew were thankfully able to foil. The gangsters who perpetrate these acts cannot and will not be allowed to commit such crimes with impunity. Deputy Costello went a little far in suggesting that the Minister shares some culpability with regard to these events.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister utterly condemns what they do. He welcomes the opportunity initiated by Deputy Costello to state the present position regarding standards within the cash-in-transit industry, and the moves that have been and are being made to ensure that such incidents will not succeed in the future.</P>
        <P>Last year the Minister called on the main players in the cash-in-transit sector of the industry, which included the financial institutions, security companies, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Central Bank, to draw up an agreement on a voluntary basis for handling cash deliveries in a safe, secure and efficient manner. The agreement was signed last June and the Minister understands that progress towards implementation had been made in the course of the past year. This code of practice represented a major step forward in this area and set out an integrated end-to-end solution for major cash movements in the State.</P><Col N="2029"/>
        <P>On Monday, in the wake of the recent robberies, the Minister met Garda Commissioner Noel Conroy and the chief executive of the Private Security Authority, Geraldine Larkin. While noting that progress has been made in terms of implementing the code of practice, the Minister expressed his deep concern that recent robberies highlighted the fact that procedures within the code appeared to have been flouted by security companies. The Minister finds these lapses in standards completely unacceptable. These incidents raise serious questions about how the cash-in-transit business is to be managed and regulated in the future. Having heard the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s report on these recent incidents, it is clear to the Minister that a voluntary code, which encompasses standards of safety and good practice, is not working.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what it was set up for.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister called on the Private Security Authority to press ahead with its plans to introduce licensing for security companies operating in the cash-in-transit sector. Adherence to the provisions in the code of practice will form an integral part of any licensing regime. Any company not in compliance with the standards in the code will not be licensed to operate within the cash movement sector.</P>
        <P>The Private Security Authority established in 2004 puts the regulation of the Irish private security industry on a statutory footing for the first time. It is already an offence for unlicensed companies to operate in sectors such as door security and security guarding, and the authority continues to roll out licensing on a phased basis for companies involved in other parts of the private security industry.</P>
        <P>There is provision within the Private Security Services Act 2004 for mandatory licensing of the cash-in-transit sector. It was intended to introduce licensing of the sector at the end of a voluntary compliance period where the industry would be given time within which to bring its standards up to the requisite approved standards, which would form the basis for licensing. The Minister finds now that radical lapses in standards have occurred and, as a result, he has been advised by the chief executive of the Private Security Authority that she will bring forward proposals for the introduction of mandatory licensing as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>

	<P>It was for licensing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister has further called a meeting with key stakeholders including the <Col N="2030"/>major banks, the security companies and the Garda for tomorrow morning, which he hopes will show that a continuous strategy of improvement is under way. This meeting will give various stakeholders an opportunity to report on progress in implementing the code of practice and to flag particular areas of difficulty. The Minister is willing to listen to what the industry has to say but is not willing to accept any shortfall in standards of the kind witnessed in recent robberies. He has asked me to reassure the House that he knows only too well that the proceeds from these robberies go on to fund further organised crime. These crimes cannot be regarded as victimless as they represent a tangible threat to the stability of both civil society and our economy. The Government, through the new measures being put in place, will play its part in ensuring that such crimes become a thing of the past.</P>

I am calling on all Members of the Oireachtas to support my demand to hold a fresh inquiry into the terrible fire, and to support the families in their quest for truth and justice. This is not a time for sitting on the fence or for more talk. Now is the time to support the families with action.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fire that engulfed Dublin&rsquo;s Stardust nightclub in the early hours of St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day 1981 killed 48 young people and injured and disfigured many more. Countless others will continue to suffer the emotional scars of loss and grief for the remainder of their lives.</P>
        <P>The official inquiry into the disaster found that the Stardust owners had acted with &ldquo;reckless disregard&rdquo; for the safety of their customers, but no charges were ever brought against them. They went on to win substantial damages for the loss of the nightclub complex. The inquiry did not go far enough. Why, despite numerous inspections of the Stardust by Dublin Corporation, now Dublin City Council, were the owners able to get away with repeated breaches of fire regulations and building by-laws? What caused the flames to spread across the vast nightclub so rapidly? Why were so many prevented from escaping by locked or chained fire exits? Why were steel plates fixed all over the toilet windows?</P>
        <P>Eamonn Butterly, who owned the original Stardust club, wanted to re-open the club 25 years to the week after the disaster, on the same site, using the Stardust name. How coldhearted can one get? The Stardust victims want the site to honour the 48 people who died and not to see it become another profit-making pub for the owner, who was responsible for locking the emergency <Col N="2031"/>exits on the original Stardust. They want a full, independent inquiry to re-examine the causes of the disaster, given that new evidence has now been uncovered. They also want the Garda in the Phoenix Park to hand over the post-mortem photographs to their legal team to expedite matters. They are 99% ready and want to move on with the details, with their legal team.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to use his clout to expedite this issue. When discussing it, we should remind ourselves that people with families are involved. Let us all remember the victims by supporting their families in a practical and sensible way. Each day, the families hold a vigil and a picket on the Stardust site. This will continue until their demands are met. Fudge or silence from the Government or politicians is not an option. I am challenging all Deputies to support the call for a proper inquiry. The facts speak for themselves. The new evidence is there, and any self-respecting government or opposition would act on it.</P>
        <P>I welcome the families into the D&aacute;il today. They are in the public gallery, and again I commend their courage and dignity. I also thank my Independent colleagues, Deputy Cowley from Mayo and Deputy Gregory, for their great support for the families on this issue. The Independent Deputies will stand by the families of the Stardust.</P>
        <P>I urge all Members to support my call for a full inquiry into the Stardust fire tragedy. We owe it to the victims, their families and future generations.</P>

	<P>I respond to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell.</P>
        <P>I join in what Deputy Finian McGrath said about the relatives of the victims of this terrible tragedy, which all of us who lived in north Dublin at the time remember all too well. I can well understand why the relatives wish to establish by all possible methods more facts and more examination of what led to this terrible tragedy.</P>
        <P>As the Minister has previously set out, discussions between his Department and representatives of the families led in 2004 to the presentation to the Department of a submission prepared on behalf of the Stardust victims committee and which examined a range of issues relating to the fire and its investigation. That submission was examined by the Garda Commissioner and the Forensic Science Laboratory but was found not to contain new evidence.</P>
        <P>To be more specific, the Forensic Science Laboratory concluded that the report in question amounted to a different interpretation of matters already brought to the attention of the tribunal. Similarly, the Garda response concluded that no new evidence was forthcoming that would warrant the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na revisiting the investi<Col N="2032"/>gation and that the matters raised in the report had been addressed by the tribunal of inquiry.</P>
        <P>At a subsequent meeting between the Stardust victims committee and officials of the Department, the committee was informed of this position and advised that in the absence of compelling new evidence, the establishment of a further tribunal of inquiry could not be recommended. It was made clear, however, that any further submission the victims committee or its representatives wished to make would be carefully examined. The Minister has reiterated this undertaking on numerous occasions since but as of yet, no further submission has been received. The Minister is more than willing to examine any further submission which the Stardust victims committee or its representatives wish to make.</P>
        <P>As well as remaining open to examining any submission which might be forthcoming, the Minister has arranged for a copy of the February &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme to be referred to the Forensic Science Laboratory for analysis, with particular reference to whether it includes evidence or addresses issues not examined by the original tribunal of inquiry. That report is awaited and upon its receipt will receive careful attention and evaluation. It will also be made available to the victims committee and its representatives. The Minister has also indicated that he will meet the committee in the event that there is some new evidence which could form the basis of a productive discussion.</P>

      <sTitle>Schools Building Projects.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important issue for the Adjournment and the Minister of State for replying.</P>
        <P>Cavan No. 1 national school plays an important part in the education of young people in the busy town of Cavan. It is a Church of Ireland based school but many of its pupils are from different backgrounds and nationalities. I first got involved with this school more than ten years ago when numbers were small and the building was in an impossible situation for modern education. Money was provided for restructuring and heating but since then, as the figures will show, it has an enrolment of 61 with up to 20 on a waiting list. There are two teachers, with the principal dealing with 36 children, covering four classes in one room. There are 25 children in the other room.</P>
        <P>They welcome the fact that they have been provided support under the devolved grant but, unfortunately, when the issue is being dealt with in a listed building, costs are very high. For example, under the regulations insisted on by An Taisce, wooden windows must be fitted all around the building even though only one wall can be seen from the road since the building is in a courtyard. They had hoped to get a summer grant scheme but that did not materialise.</P>
        <P>It appears the voluntary sector will have to raise up to &euro;200,000, which in a small parish is <Col N="2033"/>unacceptable. For the particular project the voluntary committee, led by the principal, has raised more than &euro;30,000 and is in the process of organising a major auction in the next few weeks. Is it fair that a principal helping to organise this project, overseeing the building work and teaching full-time leaves the school at 12 midnight and is back at 6.30 a.m. to ensure everything is done and in order?</P>
        <P>Since devolved grants were first introduced I have supported the system and believe it has delivered good value for money to the Department and to schools. The cost per pupil is only a fraction of the Department&rsquo;s system but in this case sufficient money has not been provided to take into account the structure of the building and the fact that it is a listed building and all that entails.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The past history of the school shows clearly that the chairperson, principal, other teachers and parents have more than met their obligations and will compare with any school in Ireland. I hope that common sense will prevail and that realistic additional funding will be made available to ensure that a usable good structure will be put in place.</P>
        <P>It is likely that the numbers will justify a fourth teacher within the next 12 months, leading to the necessity for prefabs, which will curtail further the play area. This means the front space used for car parking will have to be drained, tarred and secured to have a decent playground.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since this was a listed building an architect who specialises in the field had to be employed to meet An Taisce and Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regulations and added more than &euro;60,000 to the cost. Structural engineers, quantity surveyors and archaeologists had also to be employed. The type of building and the working timescale under the devolved grant limited the number of new builders interested and increased the cost.</P>
        <P>In a letter to the Department, the principal said there was a need to provide access to all areas and a toilet for a child with spina bifida enrolled in September. The easiest option, because of its location, was to convert the school office and relocate that office. The principal is trying to deal with all situations.</P>
        <P>When the devolved grant was granted there were a small number of non-English speaking children but September saw a large increase for all schools in Cavan, including Cavan No. 1 national school. The school now has a full-time language teacher but no classroom. She shares a room with a language support-resource teacher who is in attendance 17.5 hours per week. If the residence were furbished, it would house two rooms suitable for language teachers, learning support and so on.</P>
        <P>The school is growing. Within the parish numbers are increasing dramatically. I ask that the position be looked at in a compassionate and <Col N="2034"/>caring way. The original quote which was more than &euro;600,000 has been brought down to &euro;500,000 but the grant will not meet it. This group has engaged in fund-raising in the past for previous projects. This project has raised more than &euro;30,000. It hopes to raise more at the auction but it is not possible to raise &euro;200,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I reply on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin. I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline the position of the Department in regard to the building project at Cavan No. 1 national school, County Cavan.</P>
        <P>The school is accommodated in a listed building of Georgian design. It has an enrolment of 61 pupils and a staffing of a principal teacher, one assistant teacher, one shared learning support-resource teacher and one language support teacher. I join in Deputy Crawford&rsquo;s tribute to principals of schools. The work they do is extraordinary. In a smaller school of this type the principal must perform teaching duties and the entire burden of administration falls on her shoulders. All that is done diligently and without complaint by the principals who serve the Department so well in that regard. In the larger schools the principal does not have to engage in intensive teaching duties. In those cases there is a large staff and pupil enrolment to manage.</P>
        <P>The school was offered a devolved grant of &euro;345,000 under the small schools scheme in 2005 to extend and refurbish the school. The board of management accepted the grant offered and proceeded with the architectural planning of the project. Generally, the Department of Education and Science is moving towards a model of devolving funding, responsibility and authority as appropriate for building projects directly to school management authorities. I agree with Deputy Crawford that, in general, the system has worked well. Devolving of funding to school management authorities allows them to have control of their projects, assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction and can also deliver better value for money. The assistance of the principals, the chairs and members of boards of management are invaluable with their local knowledge and their willingness to give of their time to forward these projects.</P>
        <P>The small schools scheme was originally introduced on a pilot basis for 20 schools in the 2003 schools building programme. Owing to the positive response from schools the scheme was extended in the schools building programmes of 2004, 2005 and 2006. While appropriate for many schools, the Department is aware that the scheme is not necessarily suitable for all national schools seeking to refurbish their school building or to build new accommodation. It is not the intention of the scheme to leave schools with massive fund<Col N="2035"/>raising requirements. Rather, the level of funding should determine the scope of works undertaken. However, in some cases the school site or building can be problematic and this appears to be the case in the school in question. In other cases, the extent of the required work is too great for the funding available under the scheme. In such circumstances, schools have a number of choices. They can reduce the scope of intended works, fundraise to cover the shortfall or withdraw from the scheme and be considered for inclusion in the mainstream school building programme in line with the project&rsquo;s priority band rating.</P>
        <P>As I stated, the board of management of Cavan No. 1 national school accepted the grant offered and proceeded with the architectural planning of the project. The extent of the building which the board of management can construct is determined by the sensitive location and nature of the site. The school subsequently applied for and received planning permission for the construction <Col N="2036"/>of two new classrooms, ancillary accommodation and external works subject to a number of conditions, including the requirement that all works be supervised by a suitably qualified archaeologist. Construction work commenced in December 2005 and is ongoing.</P>
        <P>The board of management has submitted an application for additional funding which was considered by the appeals board which requested that further inquiries be made regarding the application. When the inquires are completed the application will be re-examined by the appeals board. The Department will continue to work with the school management to ensure an appropriate solution is found for the school and departmental officials will be in contact with the school shortly. I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the electricity regional initiative recently launched by the European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas, ERGEG. This initiative is aimed at accelerating the single European energy market by promoting seven electricity regional energy market projects. The European Council conclusions encourage the acceleration of regional energy co-operation within the EU and facilitating the integration of regional markets. <Col N="2038"/>As one of the most peripheral markets in terms of the EU energy market, Ireland has a great deal to gain from such initiatives.</P>
        <P>This regional market initiative by the European regulators is welcome. It builds on the work of the Department and the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, along with counterparts in Northern Ireland, in developing an all-island energy market and specifically the single electricity market by 1 July 2007.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that regional markets will act as stepping stones towards a single European energy market which will allow the benefits of liberalisation to reach electricity consumers across Europe in the form of competitive prices, secure supplies, innovation and choice.</P>
        <P>Under the initiative, the national regulator at the centre of each regional market has been designated as the lead regulator to define the geographic scope of the project, and to chair a small regional co-ordination committee of regulators. As part of the ERGEG electricity regional initiative, Ireland, along with the UK and part of France, is included in one regional electricity market. Within this regional framework, the UK regulator, OFGEM, will co-ordinate the work and direct working groups made up of the other regulators, including the CER, the transmission system operators and, where appropriate, market operators.</P>
        <P>This initiative does not impact on or replace the role or the statutory functions of the CER in regulating the Irish electricity and gas markets. The initiative is designed to complement, not cut across, existing frameworks or national Government efforts to integrate markets. The key objective of the regional electricity initiative is to identify and seek to remove barriers, which may be hindering the growth of competitive electricity markets.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 31 together.</P><Col N="2039"/>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for electronic communications policy but has no responsibility for the actions of persons conducting bullying or intimidation activities over electronic communications networks or the transmission of pornographic images. Neither does the Minister have responsibility for the development of technology, which is primarily a matter for the mobile phone operators.</P>
        <P>Much of the criminal activity perpetrated using electronic communications networks is legislated for according to the offence and not the medium by which it was committed. Some legislation actually predates the advent of electronic technology and legislating to combat these offences does not always fall under this Department&rsquo;s remit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy should be aware, however, that legislation already exists to tackle the issues to which he refers. It is an offence under section 13 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951, as amended by the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983, to send by phone any message or other matter which is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character; and it is also an offence under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 to harass a person by use of any means including by use of a telephone. Anyone who has information in relation to these matters should bring it immediately to the attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for criminal investigation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In so far as issues relating to children are concerned, as previously stated, legislation is already in place but the role of parents in decisions concerning the purchase and use of mobile phones by their children cannot be emphasised enough. They should ensure that their children use them appropriately. This is ultimately the best way of safeguarding them from the perils of abuse of such technology. In addition, the Deputy may be aware that the Irish Cellular Industry Association, ICIA, an alliance of the mobile operators &mdash; Vodafone, O<?oasys _of8- ?>2 and Meteor Mobile Communications and the mobile handset manufacturers Nokia and Siemens &mdash; has taken many steps to promote the safe and responsible use of mobile phones.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The Deputy may be interested in the ICIA&rsquo;s publication entitled A Parent&rsquo;s Guide to Mobile Phones, which aims to inform parents of some key safety tips that will encourage responsible and secure use of mobile phones by their children. The guide seeks to educate parents and guardians in the ways in which they can gain greater visibility of their child&rsquo;s mobile usage and the services they access, for example, the facility provided by operators, which allows authorised access for parents to a child&rsquo;s account. The guide also addresses the subject of bullying and <Col N="2040"/>malicious communications. A copy of the guide is available on the ICIA website at <i>www.icia.ie</i>.</P>

        <Quest>if he or others, with or without his authority, have entered into discussions with RTE or those in the private sector in the context of the likely contents of the proposed Broadcasting Bill; if agreements or conclusions have been arrived at; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The priority issues to be addressed by the Broadcasting Bill are as follows: the establishment of a single content regulator for commercial, community and public service broadcasters; the establishment of RTE as a company under the Companies Acts; the provision of a statutory mechanism for future adjustments to the level of the television licence fee; and the development of the right of reply mechanism, allowing persons whose reputation and good name have been damaged by an assertion of incorrect facts in a television or radio programme to gain redress.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s intention in framing the legislative proposals that will form the basis of the new Broadcasting Bill will be to ensure that the broadcasting regulatory environment continues to encourage the parallel development of high quality broadcasting by Irish public service, commercial and community broadcasters.</P>
        <P>In the context of the development of broadcasting policy, our officials and the Minister have cause, on a regular basis, to meet with the various interests that comprise the broadcasting sector including, but not limited to, commercial broadcasters, public service broadcasters and independent producers. At many of these meetings the issues to be addressed in the forthcoming Broadcasting Bill, given their relative importance to the sector, have been raised and discussed in general terms.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I can advise the Deputy that provision is made in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006, currently under consideration by this House, for full gas market opening no later than 1 July 2007 deadline set by the<?oasys _jy ?>EU.</P>
        <P>Since July 2004, the gas market has been open to all customers excluding domestic customers. This amounts to 86% of the market by volume. There are currently four suppliers serving the competitive element of the market.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, regulates the natural gas grid through the transmission and distribution licences. This includes approval of capital and operating expenditures and approving network tariffs. It also involves bench-marking of service levels, development of operating and technical codes and resolving disputes in relation to access and charging.</P>
        <P>Under SI 760 of 2005, provision has been made for the legal unbundling of the transmission and distribution system operations of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, BG&Eacute;. Under the provisions of this statutory instrument, BG&Eacute; is effectively required to establish a subsidiary company with responsibility for operation of the natural gas grid.</P>
        <P>In 2005, all oil imports into Ireland were sourced from the North Sea. These imports were sourced specifically from the UK, Norway and Denmark. Natural gas imports were all sourced from the UK.</P>
        <P>In relation to expected natural gas demand, the CER is required under EU regulations to prepare and publish an annual gas capacity statement. The function of this statement is to advise of the adequacy of capacity in the Irish gas transmission network over an eight-year period. The statement forecasts capacity, flows and customer demand for natural gas and provides an indication of likely investment projects required over the statement period. The latest statement covers the period up to 2012 under a number of scenarios. Current projections made by Sustainable Energy Ireland forecast that gas demand is expected to continue to increase by 5% per annum to 2020. This will result in gas accounting for up to 35% of primary energy consumption. There is no reliable data available thereafter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 17 and 109 together.</P>
        <P>Security of energy supply is a key imperative for Ireland and the European Union. The relatively small size of the Irish electricity market underlines the need for greater interconnection as a means of enhancing security of supply, promoting competition and integrating the Irish electricity market into the wider European market. In this context, the east-west electricity interconnector project remains a key priority for the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The priority need for enhanced interconnection across Europe has been highlighted by the EU Commission and endorsed by the spring European Council on 24 March. The European emphasis on interconnection is very much in keeping with our own national priorities.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be bringing the matter to Government shortly for a decision as to the most appropriate mechanism to secure east-west interconnection in terms of financing and developer selection. His recommendations will be informed by the advice of the Commission for Energy Regulation. Decisions are needed now to ensure that the target date of 2011 for operation of the interconnector is met. In this context, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Second Stage of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions Bill) 2006 has been introduced in the House. The Bill will provide the necessary legislative powers for the CER, with the Minister&rsquo;s consent, to secure the construction of an interconnector by means of competitive tender, authorisation process or inclusion in the development plans of the transmission system operator. The Bill provides for the possibility that costs related to the interconnector could be recouped through the transmission use of system charge. The Bill will also address a present anomaly facilitating a regulated interconnector not owned by the ESB.</P>
        <P>In relation to possible outflows of electricity, east-west electricity interconnection will allow for the potential export of wind-powered electricity, which could be surplus to national requirements due to the variable nature of the wind resource. However, the overall amount of wind-powered capacity which could be safely connected to the national grid after the commissioning of an east-west electricity interconnector would depend on a variety of factors. These include the amount of wind-powered capacity connected in the UK, the nature and point of the interconnection and protocols for operating the interconnection and accessing or allocating the available capacity.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 27 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left"><?oasys _ic14- ?>As the Deputy may already be aware, there are no specific legislative impediments to commercial broadcasters which wish to broadcast to the Irish community in Britain, or elsewhere in the European Union, on a purely commercial basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards public service broadcasting, RTE&rsquo;s statutory mandate, as defined in section 28(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2001, provides that RTE&rsquo;s radio and television services shall be made available, in so far as is reasonably practicable, to the whole community on the island of Ireland. As such, RTE&rsquo;s statutory mandate does not extend to the provision of radio or television services to Irish communities living in Britain or elsewhere. As a consequence, RTE may not use the proceeds of the television licence fee to provide such services. However, it should be noted that many people living outside the island of Ireland already enjoy access to a considerable quantity of RTE&rsquo;s television programming by way of the Internet and to RTE&rsquo;s radio services by way of satellite, LW and MW and the Internet.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the light of the recommendations of the task force on emigration, the issue of amending RTE&rsquo;s public service remit to include the provision of television services to Irish communities in Britain is currently being considered in the context of development of the legislative proposals that will form the basis of the proposed Broadcasting Bill. It is anticipated that these legislative proposal will be published in the coming months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos 20, 100, 214, 215 and 232 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An interdepartmental biofuels group was established in 2004 to ensure close co-operation and communication between the relevant players on biofuels and biomass development and related policy initiatives. The group comprises representatives of the Department, the Departments of Agriculture and Food, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Finance and Transport and Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI. The Minister has asked the Department to give particular priority to maintaining and enhancing a fully holistic approach across Departments to progressing the biofuels-bioenergy agenda and addressing supply and demand challenges and opportunities in a strategically planned way.</P>
        <P>The 2005 pilot mineral oil tax relief scheme for biofuels has resulted in eight projects being awarded excise relief and will result in 16 million litres of biofuels being placed on the Irish transport market by next year. Building on the success of this scheme and following extensive discussions with industry and relevant Departments and agencies, the Minister agreed with the Minister for Finance a further targeted package of excise relief valued at &euro;205 million, which was announced in the budget. The new excise relief programme, which is subject to State-aid approval, will be rolled out from this year to 2010 and will enable us to reach the initial target of 2% market penetration by biofuels by 2008. When fully operational the relief is expected to support the use and production of some 163 million litres of biofuels each year. The Minister is also providing funding towards the capital cost of developing biofuels processing facilities, which will critically underpin the excise relief package.</P>
        <P>The potential for using existing facilities for the production of biofuels and switching to the production of energy crops is ultimately a commercial decision for developers and farmers. The new excise relief programme will provide a framework in which farmers and potential developers can consider all such options. The Minister will continue to work closely with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, in ensuring an integrated approach to bioenergy issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The draft heads of the electricity Bill to provide for the conversion for ESB to a public limited company status are being progressed and the timeframe for its reinstatement on the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme will be kept under review during the year. The Minister does not consider that the revised timetable for the Bill has implications for commercial or strategic decision-making by ESB.</P>
        <P>The key deliverable within the all-island energy market framework is to have an all-island wholesale electricity market in place by 1 July 2007. A critical immediate priority, therefore, for both Governments is to ensure that an appropriate legislative framework is in place to underpin this market. This necessitates the enactment of parallel legislation in both jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>The draft scheme of the single wholesale electricity market Bill is currently being developed by the Department in consultation with Northern colleagues, the CER and the Office of the Attorney General. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, expects to be in a position to seek Government approval for detailed priority drafting by the end of April. The delivery of such parallel legislation by the July 2007 deadline represents a very challenging timeframe for all concerned. The relevant officials are working intensively with their Northern colleagues and the two regulatory authorities to ensure that this target is met.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is favourably disposed towards the introduction of postcodes because of the case made that a national postcode system would offer significant potential benefits for the postal business, public utilities, business and consumers and the general public, including addressing the issue of non-unique addresses.</P>
        <P>To examine the introduction of a postcode system in Ireland, the Minister established a working group comprised of people with experi<Col N="2047"/>ence of the postal sector, together with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which is the lead Department for the Irish spatial data infrastructure initiative to examine the issue of the introduction of a postcode system in Ireland. This group produced its report last year. The report found that the introduction of a publicly available postcode could deliver many potential benefits. The purpose of a postcode system would be to improve efficiencies and quality in the postal sector, stimulate mail volume growth, assist utilities and emergency services and address the problem of non-unique addressing. These improvements collectively will boost the country&rsquo;s competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Following on from the recommendations of the working group report, the Minister asked the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, to appoint project managers to support the postcode project by providing technical and economic advice including assessing the costs and benefits of the introduction of a postcode. ComReg, following an open and competitive tendering process, appointed both technical and economic consultants. A National Postcode Project Board, comprising representatives of Departments, together with public and private sector organisations that he appointed last year, is managing these.</P>
        <P>One constituent part of the consultants&rsquo; work programmes is that they engage in a process of stakeholder consultation with a view to arriving at a postcode model that best meets the needs of the stakeholders and measures the likely costs and benefits of the introduction of such a postcode. The technical advisers to the project engaged in a consultation process with key stakeholders late last year and at the beginning of this year with a view to making a recommendation as to the postcode models to progress to full cost benefit analysis. An extensive consultation process is currently being conducted by the cost benefit consultants with a view to calculating the net benefits that might accrue from the introduction of each particular postcode being examined.</P>
        <P>It is expected that the consultants will present, by the second quarter this year, a proposal to the National Postcode Project Board that describes in sufficient detail the most appropriate postcode system for Ireland, along with a detailed implementation plan. The board will then present its recommendation to the Minister for his consideration.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 35 and 47 together.</P>
        <P>Following pressure from the Taoiseach, the European Council emphasised the importance for competitiveness and ease of travel of reducing roaming charges.</P>
        <P>This is an issue that affects many people travelling throughout the EU and is a clear example of impediments to the Single Market negatively affecting the citizens and businesses. The roaming charges for voice calls, text messages and data are very significant and we would like to see them reduced or preferably eliminated.</P>
        <P>We strongly welcome the announcement by Commissioner Viviane Reding of her draft proposals for a regulation to tackle roaming, which will require approval by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. We look forward to working with her towards the implementation of the regulation. I am particularly pleased that the Commission is taking action following requests from the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to Commissioner Reding.</P>
        <P>In the all-island context, roaming is an issue that both the UK Government and Ireland have highlighted in the context of enhancing North-South co-operation.</P>
        <P>In regard to the implementation of revised prices for international roaming, while this is a matter for the mobile phone companies which operate in a fully liberalised market overseen by ComReg, Ireland&rsquo;s independent regulator, I very much encourage the operators to move quickly to reduce roaming charges or preferably to eliminate them.</P>
        <P>I welcome recent announcements by Vodafone Ireland, O<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> Ireland and 3Ireland to tackle roaming charges and I would hope that they would now address text messaging, data transfer and pre-paid customers. These initiatives followed interventions with the operators by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and his Northern Ireland counterpart, Minister Angela Smith, as well as Ofcom and ComReg.</P>

	<P Just="Left"><?oasys _ic14- ?>I refer the Deputy to the following appendix that outlines the information requested on the number of post offices converted or closed since the Minister came into office in September 2004. The opening, conversion and closure of individual post offices is a matter for the board and management of the company.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the post office network, as clearly set out in the programme for Government, this Government and the board of An Post are committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network. Notwithstanding the commercial remit of An Post, there is a clear Government recognition of the social benefits of maintaining the nationwide post office network. Accordingly, An Post development strategies for the network continue to take full account of these benefits.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s objective to maintain the largest, economically sustainable post office network possible. The challenge for all stakeholders in An Post is to generate sufficient profitable business to maintain the network at its current size. While the Government will support the network in any way it can, the way forward is for An Post to enhance existing services and, building on existing strengths, to develop new product offerings.</P>
        <P>The network has a high footfall and to capitalise on these advantages it is essential that existing and new services are developed to meet customer requirements. The network also has the capacity and potential to deliver more private business especially in financial services and opportunities are actively being pursued by An Post in this area. Indeed, on foot of substantial investment in computerisation, a significant amount of extra business has already been obtained for the network in terms of banking and utility business. At present, 95% of An Post&rsquo;s business is conducted through automated offices.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has also asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long term viability of the post office network and in this light, An Post is currently working on a new initiative which could see the development and expansion of the range of financial services that it can deliver through its network of post offices. If successful, it could lead to a significant <Col N="2050"/>increase in post office business and contribute to the viability of the network.</P>

        <Quest>the position regarding the development of the all-island energy market; the role renewable energy technologies will play in this integrated market; the way in which the two regulators will co-operate in a single market; his views on the establishment of a single all-island regulator; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Government policy in regard to the creation of an all-island energy market is set out in the all-island energy market development framework which was jointly launched in November 2004.</P>
        <P>The key priority within the framework is to put the all-island wholesale electricity market in place by 1 July 2007. The two regulators have already agreed the high-level principles governing the operation of this market and are now working on the detailed rules. This process involves close consultation with stakeholders.</P>
        <P>A critical immediate priority for both Governments is to ensure that an appropriate legislative framework is in place to underpin the single electricity market. Delivery of the new single market by July 2007 presents a very challenging timeframe in which the necessary parallel legislation must be enacted. Officials are working intensively with their Northern colleagues and the two regulatory authorities to ensure that this target is met.</P>
        <P>At present, the two regulatory authorities co-operate on progressing all-island electricity market issues on foot of a memorandum of understanding agreed between them in August 2004. The way in which the two regulators will work together in the context of the single electricity market will be provided for in the under<Col N="2052"/>pinning legislation. In the context of the all-island energy market development framework, the development of a single regulatory body is signalled within the detailed development programme as a longer-term strategic goal. An examination of the benefits and requirements for the creation of an all-island regulatory body is scheduled for 2009-2010.</P>
        <P>Work is under way to develop a long-term strategy for renewable energy on an all-island basis. A joint North-South public consultation on an all-island vision for renewable energy by 2020 and beyond has been undertaken. We will develop an agreed joint policy paper this year on long-term sustainability of energy supplies, with a particular focus on renewable electricity generation. As part of this work, a major grid study is under way to address the implications of significantly increased renewables in the electricity mix on the island of Ireland by 2020.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has recently published the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006. This Bill, which builds on recent secondary legislation to implement the electricity and gas market EU directives, will enhance competitiveness within the energy market and bring consequent benefits to the consumer. The Second Stage of the Bill was introduced to the House earlier today.</P>
        <P>One of the key provisions of this Bill is to expand the functions of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, to underpin its work on an all-island energy market. The new market will, over time, remove market distortions and should impact positively on the wholesale cost of electricity. It should also make Ireland more attractive as a location for new electricity generation investment and help improve the security and reliability of electricity supplies throughout the entire island.</P>
        <P>Another key feature of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 is the provision enabling the Minister to introduce full gas market opening by ministerial order in advance of the EU deadline of 1 July 2007. The opening of the natural gas market has been implemented in phases in line with EU policy requirements. This final phase of market opening will extend the benefits of liberalisation, previously enjoyed by industrial and commercial consumers, to all natural gas customers who will be able to shop around for their supplier and get the best value. <Col N="2053"/>The electricity market in Ireland fully opened on 19 February 2005, when all 1.8 million customers became free to shop around for their electricity supplier. This date is well in advance of the July 2007 deadline for full liberalisation of the electricity markets as set down by the EU in the second Electricity Directive 2003/54/EC.</P>
        <P>There are currently five active independent suppliers in the electricity retail market who have tended to focus to date on large to medium sized customers. Competitive activity in that segment is strong with 33% of total energy now being supplied by independents. Over time, as suppliers target the domestic market, those benefits are expected to be extended to the domestic customer. The all-island single electricity market, which is scheduled for 1 July 2007, will see new market and trading arrangements in place which will facilitate and enhance competition.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 108 together.</P>
        <P>As a member of the International Energy Agency Ireland is required to maintain emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net imports of crude oil equivalent in the previous year. The EU imposes a similar requirement based on consumption. The National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, is responsible for holding Ireland&rsquo;s strategic oil reserves.</P>
        <P>It meets its obligations through a combination of stocks owned by NORA both at home and abroad, stocks &lsquo;ticketed&rsquo; by NORA and operational stocks held in Ireland by the oil industry and large companies. At 1 February 2006, Ireland&rsquo;s oil stock reserves were estimated at 101 days net imports of which NORA stocks accounted for 37 days.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that oil storage capacity held by the Irish oil industry and oil consumers amounts to 98 days. The question of increasing the capa<Col N="2054"/>city of oil companies and oil consumers is one for the companies themselves.</P>
        <P>The Minister is satisfied that Ireland&rsquo;s emergency stock levels are sufficient to ensure that we would be in a position to participate effectively in any internationally co-ordinated response in the event of an international oil supply disruption, or manage any short-term disruption specifically impacting on the Irish market.</P>
        <P>Under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has the function of licensing natural gas storage facilities. In carrying out its functions, the commission must have regard to the need to ensure that there is sufficient capacity in the natural gas system to enable reasonable expectations of demand to be met; and to secure the continuity, security and quality of supplies of natural gas.</P>
        <P>Marathon Oil Ireland Limited is developing natural gas storage facilities at south west Kinsale. CER is finalising the licensing regime and it is planned that the storage facility will be operational in summer 2006.</P>
        <P>A common all-island approach on storage and liquefied natural gas in the context of the all-island energy market development framework is being progressed. Work is under way by the Departments and regulatory authorities North and South with a feasibility study being commissioned as a first step.</P>
        <P>In the case of peat, Bord na Mona holds stocks of 6.6 million tonnes of peat against annual requirement of 3.3 million tonnes based on usage of the three peat stations and the two briquette factories.</P>

	<P>The Government is supporting the development of the seafood industry through a number of integrated schemes designed to secure a sustainable future for the industry under the aegis of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
        <P>The two successful fleet renewal programmes and the recent introduction of a decommissioning scheme with a budget of &euro;45 million over the next two years will together deliver the necessary restructuring, renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet, which is designed to bring a modern, safe and efficient fleet into balance with the available fishing opportunities.</P>
        <P>The scope for the continued further development of the industry will be determined in the context of the next national plan for the period 2007-2013. In this regard, extensive discussions have already been held at EU level regarding a new European fisheries fund to apply over the period 2007-2013. The terms of the new European fisheries fund have not yet been agreed at EU level. The proposal is the main item on the Fisheries Council planned for 25 April 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and I will meet the fishing industry representatives in the near future to commence the process of developing a strategy for the fishing industry that will provide for a long-term sustainable future for the fishing industry and support the livelihoods of coastal communities dependent on fishing.</P>

        <Quest>the timetable for construction works in the development of Greencastle harbour announced at the end of January 2006; the projected total costs for the works; the amounts that will be provided by his Department and the local authority in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The harbour at Greencastle is owned by Donegal County Council and responsibility for its maintenance and development rests with the local authority in the first instance. In 2006 the Department has allocated funding of &euro;2.4 million towards the commencement of the first phase of a development project for Greencastle harbour under the fishery harbours development programme. Under that programme the Department provides 75% funding and the local authority pays the balance of 25%. The total expenditure envisaged for 2006, including the county council&rsquo;s contribution, is &euro;3.2 million. The proposed development at Greencastle has received full planning permission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first phase is the construction of a 290 m long rock breakwater; the cost of this phase is currently estimated as &euro;16.74 million. The second phase involves the construction of 100 m of berthage for mussel dredger boats; the current cost estimate of this second phase is &euro;4.56 million. The third and final phase would be the construction of a 250 m long deepwater pier whose current estimated cost is &euro;16.74 million. The total estimated cost of the project comes to &euro;38.04 million at current costings.</P>
        <P>The 2006 works will consist of access road construction to the proposed new breakwater site and the carrying out of environmental impact <Col N="2057"/>mitigation measures at neighbouring residential properties.</P>
        <P>The question of providing further funding to the project in future years depends on the amount of Exchequer funding available for fishery harbours and overall national priorities.</P>

        <Quest>the proposals which exist for increasing the number of certified installers of renewable heat systems that qualify for the new domestic renewable energy grants; and the reason the support measures for solar panels under this scheme are based on the size of the panels rather than on their relative efficiency standards.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The domestic grants scheme is being rolled out on behalf of the Department by Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI. The availability of trained and certified installers is an important element of the quality assurance mechanism and the grant scheme in general. SEI is facilitating consumers by maintaining a list of installers who qualify for use under the scheme.</P>
        <P>Actions to increase this number in the near term include running an advertisement in the national daily newspapers on 3 April 2006 and in industry-specific publications thereafter. SEI and Action Renewables, Northern Ireland, are currently involved in a North-South INTERREG funded initiative, which is providing for the development and delivery of renewable energy installer training courses in the INTERREG region. The first training courses under the programme are already under way and this will provide a platform in the longer term to support the development of a national training and certification infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The level of grant aid for the programme reflects a strong Government commitment to encourage people to install renewable heat technology in their homes. The mechanism for supporting solar systems in particular recognises that the level of water or space heating that can be achieved in any home is directly related to the size or number of panels installed.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In the December 2005 budget, funding of up to &euro;65 million over five years for renewable energy schemes was announced. The first stage of this funding is the greener homes scheme which was launched on 26 March 2006 <Col N="2063"/>and provides up to &euro;27 million in grant aid for domestic renewable heat technologies including the installation of wood pellet stoves and boilers, solar panels and geothermal heat pumps. Grant aid of &euro;1,100 to &euro;6,500 will be provided depending on the individual technology used. Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, implements the scheme and application forms are available via its website &mdash;<i>www.sei.ie</i>&mdash; and its dedicated lo-call telephone number.</P>
        <P>This builds on SEI&rsquo;s earlier schemes such as the house of tomorrow, HOT, programme which is still operating in parallel. This scheme has directed financial support to encourage developers of housing, both new-build and refurbishment, to incorporate design and technology features which deliver significantly superior energy and CO<?oasys _of8- ?>2 performance. By targeting developers of schemes of houses, from the private or social housing sectors, the aim is to establish a nationwide network of accessible examples of more sustainable energy design and technology practices.</P>
        <P>To date the programme has committed over &euro;9 million funding to 48 projects comprising a total of 2,269 housing units. All feature an integrated approach to design, orientation, building fabric and the supply and use of energy that achieves performance of at least 20% better than current building regulations and, in the majority of projects, 40% better. The sustainable energy features across the range of projects funded include: solar hot water systems, ground source heat pumps, condensing boilers, group heating schemes and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery along with higher levels of insulation.</P>

<Col N="2064"/>        <Quest>the reason, with regard to recent revelations that the European Commission was not informed about the fishing vessel lost at sea scheme, this Deputy was told in response to Question No. 6 of 15 June 2005 that it was impossible to re-open the scheme due to EU regulations; if the Government ever approached the EU to ascertain if it was possible to re-open the said scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware the fishing vessel lost at sea scheme was introduced in June 2001, following consultation with the fishing industry representative organisations. The purpose of the scheme was to enable qualifying applicants, who were otherwise unable to do so for financial or related reasons, to provide replacement capacity for the purposes of introducing a replacement vessel in respect of fishing boats lost at sea between 1980 and the establishment of the fishing boat register in 1990, in order to continue a family tradition of sea-fishing. The scheme did not provide financial support for the acquisition of a fishing vessel itself and took into account the requirement that Ireland was required to keep within EU limits on the size of national fishing fleets.</P>
        <P>The European Commission was not informed about the introduction of the scheme in 2001 because it was not considered necessary to do so as the scheme was in compliance with relevant European Community requirements then in force.</P>
        <P>The position changed with the introduction of the new Common Fisheries Policy framework, enshrined in Council Regulation 2371 of 2002, which provides that the entry of new capacity into the fleet without public aid is compensated by the previous withdrawal without public aid of at least the same amount of capacity. This provision is regarded as a cornerstone of the new Common Fisheries Policy in so far as it ensures that the capacity of member states fishing fleets do not increase beyond the level in place on 1 January 2003.</P>
        <P>Clearly, the allocation of further capacity under the scheme would be in breach of Council Regulation 2371 of 2002. In these circumstances, I do not consider it appropriate to approach the EU Commission to ascertain if it is possible to re-open the scheme.</P>

        <P>The Minister has no function in regulating pricing for services or quality of service in the telecommunications market. The provision of telecommunications services is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market.</P>
        <P>The regulation of telecommunications operators, including regulating of pricing and quality for mobile phone services is the responsibility of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in accordance with the requirements of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and regulations which transpose the EU Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications.</P>
        <P>I have no information to say that Irish mobile charges are generally the highest in Europe.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I announced on 24 March that I had decided to adopt the recommendations made to me by the National Salmon Commission, NSC, on the total allowable salmon catch for 2006. This will involve reductions in the quota available to both commercial fishermen and anglers in 2006. In doing so I have also reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to fully align with the scientific advice provided on the management of the wild salmon fishery by 2007.</P>
        <P>Accepting the recommendations of the National Salmon Commission and the National Fisheries Management Executive, the total allowable catch in 2006 will be 91,367 for the commercial sector and 15,000 for angling, fully complying with the national conservation limits established by the standing scientific committee. These reductions in overall fishing effort are required in order to sustain and rebuild wild salmon stocks nationwide.</P>
        <P>The standing scientific committee has indicated that mixed stock fisheries pose particular threats to the status of individual stocks and that fisheries operated in estuaries and rivers are more likely to fulfil national requirements and international obligations. In this context the National Fisheries Management Executive has identified a range of pilot projects to facilitate the commercial fishery to move from areas of indiscriminate mixed stock fishery exploitation. The feasibility of these projects will be evaluated by the Department in conjunction with the fisheries boards and the Marine Institute with a view to their implementation in 2007 and beyond.</P>
        <P>I recognise the considerable efforts made by the commercial fishing industry over the past number of years to build a sustainable fishery and they have endured large cuts in the quotas available to them. I realise that these reductions have caused them difficulty and that full alignment with the scientific advice will likely compound these problems. For these reasons, I have decided to appoint an independent group to examine the implications of the new regulations for the commercial sector in 2007 and beyond and to make recommendations on the options available to address any financial hardship that may arise.</P>

	<P>The Department, the Commission for Energy Regulation and relevant national players monitor developments and potential developments in international energy markets that may impact on the Irish market. This includes developments in the British wholesale market.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, BGE, has advised that the gas balancing alert in question resulted from an atypical coincidence of events: supplies of gas from Troll Gas, the biggest supplier of Norwegian gas, were down on normal production; production from the North Sea gas fields was down; and supplies from the Rough gas field &mdash; a key <Col N="2069"/>storage facility in the UK &mdash; were down. The situation was exacerbated by industrial relations problems in France involving workers at the liquefied natural gas storage facilities. Finally, the unseasonably very cold weather in the UK was a factor in that last month was the coldest March since 1947. As a result volatility was experienced in buying and selling of gas on the market, leading to a spike in prices. However, prices began to fall back towards normal levels very shortly after the alert.</P>
        <P>The Minister is advised that there were no immediate price or supply implications for Ireland following the gas balancing alert. If such a scenario were to continue however, measures are in place in both jurisdictions whereby gas would be shared out to all sectors depending on a ranking system. On price, BGE&rsquo;s gas purchases have different profiles &mdash; a proportion of gas is bought months in advance, while other supplies are bought only weeks and days in advance. While there will always be a small impact, daily spikes in price do not have a material effect. Most large gas purchasers, such as ESB, have similar purchasing profiles.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 73 together.</P>
        <P>The future development and continued viability of An Post and its services is, in the first instance, a matter for the board and management of An Post.</P>
        <P>The welcome resolution to the company&rsquo;s recent industrial relations difficulties has, the Minister understands, facilitated all parties to sign off on the change programme, implementation of which is essential for the future viability of the company.</P>
        <P>The Minister believes that there will continue to be a key national role for An Post, both in delivery of mails and as a quality service provider of Government and financial services through its nationwide network of post office outlets.</P><Col N="2070"/>
        <P>As a commercial company, the challenge ahead for An Post is to develop a strategy that satisfies the needs of existing customers into the post office. An Post has already had some success in winning new business and continues to benefit from a considerable amount of Government business, especially in the areas of social welfare payments and savings products. In addition, a pilot project was recently completed which involved the automation of ten small post offices.</P>
        <P>I understand also that the Minister has asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long-term viability of the post office network. In this light, An Post is currently working on a new initiative which would see the development of An Post financial services, APFS. Its aim is to supply a wide range of retail financial services through the branch network. If successful, it could lead to a significant increase in post office business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I can inform the Deputy that the Minister engages the Department in regular discussion with all market players on energy issues, including electricity market liberalisation.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, established by the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, is the statutory body with responsibility for regulation of the electricity market in Ireland. Under the Act, the CER may grant or refuse to grant a licence to generate or supply electricity. The CER must require the system operator to give priority to generating stations using renewable, sustainable or alternative energy sources.</P>
        <P>The conditions for competition are being created through progressive liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets. In the opening of the electricity market, the position is that liberalisation of the electricity market has proceeded on a phased basis since February 2000 under the regulatory oversight of the CER.</P>
        <P>The market has been open and contestable since February 2005, in advance of EU directive requirements. The CER advises that it has ensured that the support systems and processes are in place to enable new entrant electricity suppliers to serve any customer in Ireland. To date suppliers have primarily focused on larger customers because this was the first segment of the market to open to competition &mdash; a pattern <Col N="2071"/>that is common in other newly liberalising markets. Over time the CER expects to see those benefits extended successfully to the domestic customer.</P>
        <P>In an all-island context, work is progressing on the development of a single electricity market, SEM. In June last year the CER and the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation published their high level decision relating to the proposed design for the SEM. The market is planned to go live on 1 July 2007.</P>
        <P>The potential benefits of a mature SEM include: a larger, single market with competitive prices; open and transparent competition at all levels of the marketplace; a stable and attractive investment location; improved competitiveness; greater security of supply; robust, integrated infrastructure; a more diverse energy mix; greater energy efficiency and consumer choice; and longer-term savings.</P>
        <P>Within the context of the all-island energy market development framework views were sought on how the electricity infrastructure on the island might best develop to allow the maximum penetration of renewable energy.</P>
        <P>The consultation paper identified that further information was required on the resource potential for different renewable electricity technologies on the island of Ireland in 2020, the extent to which partially dispatchable and non-dispatchable generation can be accommodated, network development options and the economic implications of the policy options outlined within the paper.</P>
        <P>A working group was established to specify and oversee the completion of studies that would provide more detailed information on the above issues. The working group recommended an all-island grid study and work is progressing on this project a priority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department is examining the regional interconnectivity issue at present. It is recognised there are obstacles in ensuring that customers in regional towns can gain access to quality broadband services at competitive prices. Although the newly constructed metropolitan area networks, MANs, ensure that there is significant capacity available at extremely competitive <Col N="2072"/>rates in the urban areas of these towns, where this was previously not the case, there is still limited national competition on backhaul, that is, the onward transportation of this traffic to other destinations and on to the international Internet exchanges in Dublin, to enable businesses in regional locations attain an affordable quality of service. The Minister is determined to address this imbalance in regional cost and infrastructure deficiencies by exploring our options, including those in respect of State-owned companies-agencies that currently own telecommunications infrastructure. Our aim is to improve cost and promote choice and competition among the various regional backhaul providers.</P>
        <P>A team of advisers was engaged in April 2005 to examine the various issues and they submitted a feasibility report last December setting out the available options. The team reported that, while technically feasible, there would be considerable financial, legal and management challenges in harnessing and enhancing the existing state owned infrastructures. The Minister is actively considering the report&rsquo;s conclusions in the context of developing strategies to improve backhaul connectivity to the regions.</P>
        <P>It is clear to the Minister from discussions with people involved in the MANs and group broadband scheme, GBS, initiatives that backhaul pricing and availability is a critical issue for regional Ireland. Backhaul charges are making affordable high-capacity broadband in the regions difficult to achieve. This undermines the prospects for employment growth in regional and rural Ireland. If the market does not provide affordable national backhaul, this is a strategic weakness for Ireland, which we ignore at our peril. The Government will have no alternative but to examine all available options to resolve this difficulty.</P>
        <P>The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access MANs in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase one of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country, which were built on time and under budget.</P>
        <P>This programme has been extended to a further 90 towns in various locations nationwide. Design and procurement has already commenced in several regions and construction is due to start in the coming months. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007. These MANs will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>In June 2004 the contract for management of the Government and local authority regional metropolitan broadband networks was awarded to E-Net, a company based in Limerick. The term of the contract is 15 years. E-Net operates as a wholesaler of access to the MANs and offers a <Col N="2073"/>full suite of products including ducting, sub-ducting, dark fibre, high level managed capacity, co-location facilities and relevant auxiliary services. Under phase one, 27 networks have been completed and handed over to E-Net. Activity has now begun on the networks with several customer contracts being signed by E-Net, including arrangements for backhaul.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 107 together.</P>
        <P>The problem of dealing with high fossil fuel dependence as carbon constraints become more pressing is not unique to Ireland. At EU and international level, energy policy is increasingly focusing on the development of alternative renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency and managing energy demand in response to the need to limit CO<?oasys _of8- ?>2 emissions. These are also key imperatives for Irish energy policy.</P>
        <P>We are on target to meet our objective of increasing electricity generated from renewable sources to a minimum of 13.2% of total consumption by 2010. Wind generation is likely to remain the dominant technology in the short term for delivering this target, while research and development into other renewable energy sources, including wave technology, is being undertaken as a priority.</P>
        <P>Targets beyond 2010 will be determined in the context of the development of an all-island electricity market. The aim is to develop a long-term strategy to support increased renewable energy penetration on the island as a whole. As part of this work a major grid study is under way to examine the implications of significantly increased renewables in the electricity mix on the island by 2020.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 98 together.</P><Col N="2075"/>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully-liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>A principal reason for the slow roll-out of broadband services generally has been the lack of investment by the private sector in the necessary infrastructure to deliver broadband to all areas. The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high-speed, open-access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide. Phase one of this programme has delivered fibre-optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country.</P>
        <P>This programme has been extended to over 90 towns in various locations nationwide. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007. These networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>The Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the county and group broadband scheme. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area. To date, over 150 projects have been approved for funding under this programme.</P>
        <P>A joint industry-Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the broadband for schools programme, which will provide every school in the country with broadband by the beginning of 2006. This is a crucial strand in the strategy of integrating ICT into teaching and learning, and the Department&rsquo;s wider vision of promoting the use of broadband technologies in local communities around the country. The construction-installation phase is now under way and the project is on target for completion within the set timeframe.</P>
        <P>In 2004 there were over 80 Internet service providers; today there are over 156 companies, with at least 45 different broadband offerings. Wireless broadband technology is improving rapidly, and the lowering of equipment prices has made this technology much more attractive of late. The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain ADSL connectivity, and the development of Wi-Max offers considerable potential in the future.</P>
        <P>In late 2004 the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, set targets for the industry &mdash; to increase subscriber numbers to 400,000 by the end of this year and 500,000 by the end of 2007. When he set this target, there were only 100,000 subscribers. Current rates to December 2005 stand at 270,700 &mdash; 6.6% penetration rate &mdash; and the Minister hopes that these targets will be achieved.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Buncrana harbour is owned by Donegal County Council and responsibility for its maintenance and development rests with the local authority in the first instance. Donegal County Council submitted an application to the Department for funding to construct a breakwater to prevent siltation at the ferry slipway and a proposed boat harbour south of the existing pier. The proposed development would include an RNLI berth with 24-hour unrestricted tidal access in the boat harbour. The estimated total cost of the project is &euro;1.65 million. In 2006 funding of &euro;300,000 was approved to initiate the construction of the breakwater at Buncrana. Some 75% of this funding will be made available via a grant from the Department while Donegal County Council will provide the remaining 25%.</P>
        <P>The Department gave approval in March 2004, subject to the resolution of an issue over rental charges, for a foreshore lease to allow construction of a marina and associated works at Buncrana and a foreshore licence to allow dredging to take place. The finalisation of the lease and licence has been delayed, as the rental issue has not yet been resolved. Donegal County Council has been contacted about this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I recently announced proposals for revisions to the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme for the 2006 season. In doing so, I also reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s intention to introduce measures to align fully the management of the fishery with the scientific advice for 2007. Following careful consideration, I have decided to adopt the recommendations made to me by the National Salmon Commission, NSC. This will involve reductions in the quota available to both commercial fishermen and anglers in 2006. Reductions in the overall fishing effort are required to sustain and rebuild salmon stocks nationwide. The standing scientific committee of the NSC has indicated that mixed stock fisheries pose particular threats to the status of individual stocks and that fisheries operated in estuaries and rivers are more likely to fulfil national and international obligations. The National Fishery Managers Executive has identified a range of pilot projects to facilitate the commercial fishery to move from areas of indiscriminate mixed stock fishery exploitation. The feasibility of these projects will be evaluated by the Department in conjunction with the fisheries boards and the Marine Institute.</P>
        <P>Many of the existing salmon fishermen are already engaged in diverse inshore fishing activity. The salmon fishing effort takes place mainly in July and August and this effort could be redirected towards inshore stocks in the future. I recognise the considerable efforts made by the commercial salmon fishing industry over the past number of years to build a sustainable fishery and that the industry has endured large cuts in the quotas available. These reductions have caused difficulty and full alignment with the scientific advice is likely to compound these problems. For these reasons, I have decided to appoint an independent group to examine the implications of the new regulations for the commercial sector in 2007 and beyond and to make recommendations on the options available to address financial hard<Col N="2078"/>ship that may arise. In the context of ensuring a sustainable future for inshore stocks, I have asked Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, to work with local inshore groups with a view to putting in place strengthened management and conservation measures for inshore stocks around the coast. BIM is working actively with local groups and will be bringing forward appropriate measures for inshore stocks.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65, 67, 212 and 213 together.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy is to encourage further exploration for hydrocarbons while maximising the value added to the Irish economy. With regard to oil and gas, this has been done in the past, and is and will continue to be done in the future, by offering licensing opportunities in frontier areas through licensing rounds. A licensing round for the north east Rockall area was held last year and two licences were awarded. A licensing round for the Slyne-Erris-Donegal area has just closed and it is hoped to issue licences for the area in early June. There is an open door policy in respect of non-frontier areas whereby companies may apply for authorisations in these areas at any time.</P>
        <P>Contracts have been signed for the delivery of gas from the Corrib field into the national grid. Gas from the Seven Heads field has not reached <Col N="2079"/>planned levels of production. Utilisation of future commercial discoveries as yet unfound will be determined by negotiation between the developers and gas suppliers and large users. The Corrib Gas field is the only discovery that can be said at this stage to have a definite commercial viability. Seven Heads production has not reached planned levels of production. The Corrib Gas field is the only discovery that can be said at this stage to have commercial viability. Seven Heads production has not reached planned levels and further drilling is proposed later this year. A positive outcome of this drilling would be to increase existing production levels. The results of the Dooish discovery are still being assessed.</P>
        <P>With regard to non-petroleum minerals, I refer the Deputy to a parliamentary question the Minister answered on 21 February 2006. New exploration is continuously undertaken as part of my requirements on holders of prospecting licences, of which there are currently 262. Details of these licences can be found in the six-monthly report to the Oireachtas, which the Minister is obliged to lay before the Houses under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999. The last such report was in respect of the six-month period ended 31 December 2005, which was recently laid before the Houses.</P>
        <P>No new economic deposits of non-petroleum minerals have been discovered in recent years. However, there have been some encouraging results. Exploration adjacent to existing base metal mines at Navan, County Meath &mdash; Tara Mines Limited &mdash; and Galmoy, County Kilkenny &mdash; Arcon Mines Limited &mdash; has discovered additional resources which have the potential to extend the life of those mines. The Minister has recently granted new State mining licences to Arcon for extraction of part of these additional resources.</P>

	<P>The Minister met Energy Commissioner Piebalgs on the occasion of his recent visit here. The Commissioner outlined the main priority areas of the Commission&rsquo;s Green Paper, European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy. He emphasised the need for Europe to respond more cohesively to the many challenges facing it in the energy area. Commissioner Piebalgs also gave an update on discussions with Russia, particularly in the context of the current Russian presidency of the G8. He welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s intention to publish a national energy review. He underlined the Commission&rsquo;s strong commitment to ensuring completion of the internal energy market.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister underlined to the Commissioner the importance of energy infrastructure projects for a geographically peripheral country such as Ireland and the difficulties inherent in attracting market interest in financing these projects. In that context, the Minister looked forward to further debate on how the Commission sees the major investment projects in interconnection, network and storage facilities being delivered and funded, including the handling of potential state aid issues, on a Europe-wide basis. During the Minister&rsquo;s recent visit to California, he met the special adviser to the Californian governor. These discussions ranged across security of energy supply, the operation of California&rsquo;s wholesale electricity market, energy efficiency measures to curb demand, the potential for wave and tidal power and the future potential of the hydrogen economy.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The CHP policy group established in 2004 has reported on the most suitable and appropriate environments in which CHP can usefully be implemented in Ireland, so as to maximise energy efficiency. The group comprised representatives of relevant Departments and agencies and industry representatives. Its recommendations are being considered in the context of the development of overall renewable energy policy and the Minister will launch the group&rsquo;s report in the coming weeks. In budget 2006 a &euro;65 million multiannual package for renewable technologies was provided which also includes a grant aid package to incentivise the installation of CHP in the industrial, commercial and public services sector. The Department and Sustainable Energy Ireland are finalising the detailed measures and the Minister intends to launch the CHP programme as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>Plans to develop and streamline <Col N="2082"/>the gas industry are under way. These involve three main strand: the further liberalisation of the gas market to include domestic customers; the extension of the Commission for Energy Regulation&rsquo;s, CER, mandate in the gas industry to include responsibility for the regulation of natural gas safety; and the unbundling of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann as a vertically integrated utility. Under provisions outlined in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006, currently before the House for consideration, it is proposed to extend the gas market to domestic customer level. This will ensure all customers will be able to shop around for their natural gas supplier and the market will be fully contestable. The legislation proposed includes a commencement provision which ensures that the market will be fully open no later than the 1 July 2007 deadline set by EU Directive 2003/55/EC. The Bill also proposes to expand the functions of the CER to include the regulation and promotion of natural gas safety, and to promote consultation with the National Standards Authority of Ireland regarding gas safety standards.</P>
        <P>The Bill sets out in detail how the CER will carry out these functions by establishing and implementing a natural gas safety framework and by directing natural gas industry players to advise customers and the public on natural gas safety issues. Provision has also been made for the legal unbundling of the transmission and distribution system operations of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, BG&Eacute;. Under the provisions of the relevant statutory instrument, BG&Eacute; is required to establish a subsidiary company with responsibility for management of the natural gas transmission and distribution grid. This will further facilitate the operation of third party players in the market.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 76 and 103 together.</P>
        <P>Future energy policy for Europe was the central issue for this Council with the discussions focusing on the European Commission&rsquo;s recently published Green Paper, A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy. The discussions on energy were very much a first step in what promises to be a long and complex process. It is without doubt an issue of central importance to Ireland and the future success of our economy. National energy regulators have found it challenging to deal with cross-border issues and mechanisms to remedy this situation are required. In the absence of further detailed analysis from the Commission, we have taken the view that it would be premature to agree in principle to the concept of a single regulator. We welcome the recent initiative taken by the European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas, of which the CER is a member, which offers a mechanism which will actively involve all stakeholders in a co-ordinated approach to progressing integration issues for regional markets. Ireland agrees with the broad thrust of the Commission&rsquo;s Green Paper and we look forward to making a positive contribution to the debate in the coming months. The paper sets out the formidable challenges facing Europe in the energy arena and offers a wide-ranging set of proposed actions for discussion. The Minister intends to publish a Green Paper on energy policy in the coming months, which will take account of EU developments in addressing the complex challenges for Irish energy policy in the medium to longer term.</P>

The Department keeps a number of issues, both supply and demand, under constant review. Earlier this year, the Department initiated a consultation process to examine the level of demand for broadband services in the Irish market, which concluded in March. The discussion document touched on key demand factors for consumers and asked for possible examples of demand measures by Government and industry, if any are necessary. More than 100 responses were received from diverse groups such as political parties, Internet service providers, regional development agencies, regulators, pressure groups and interested citizens.

There has been considerable growth in broadband connectivity in the last 18 months with a 103% increase between December 2004 and December 2005. The report also accepts that broadband availability and platform competition has increased and prices have dropped accordingly. The report recognises that the roll out of broadband infrastructure in rural areas needs to be maintained. The Government&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is tackling supply side issues and was a direct response to the lack of investment by the private sector. High speed, open <Col N="2086"/>access metropolitan area networks, MANs, are being constructed on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase one of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities. This programme has been extended to more than 90 towns nationwide. These MANs allow the private sector to offer world class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>According to the report one of the biggest challenges for Government is demand or take-up and Ireland continues to lag behind its OECD partners in this area. Earlier this year, the Department initiated a consultation process to examine the level of demand for broadband services in the Irish market, which concluded in March. The discussion document touched on key demand factors for consumers and asked for possible examples of demand measures by Government and industry, if any are necessary. More than 100 responses were received and a wide range of issues were raised, which are being examined by officials in the Department with a view to further action.</P>
        <P>The third conclusion is Ireland requires strong competition in the market to maintain economic competitiveness. In 2004 there were more than 80 Internet service providers whereas today there are more than 150 companies, with at least 45 different broadband offerings. The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain ADSL connectivity, and the development of Wi-Max offers considerable potential in the future. The Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the county and group broadband scheme. To date, more than 150 projects have been approved for funding. A third phase of the scheme is to be announced shortly which will attempt to provide service in problem areas identified by the regional co-ordinators of the programme. A joint industry-Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the broadband for schools programme, which will provide every school in the country with broadband during 2006.</P>

	<P>The Minister is aware of the recommendations in regard to security of oil and gas supply expressed by Engineers Ireland in its recent submission to the Department of Finance on the National Development Plan 2007-2013. As <Col N="2087"/>a member of the International Energy Agency, IEA, Ireland is required to maintain emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net imports of crude oil equivalent in the previous year. The EU imposes a similar obligation based on consumption. On 1 February 2006 Ireland&rsquo;s oil stock reserves were estimated at 101 days net imports. This comprised 32 days stocks held in Ireland by the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, some 33 days also held in Ireland by oil companies and oil consumers, with the balance of 36 days being held abroad either directly by NORA or on its behalf. On 1 February 2006, therefore, 65 of the 101 days stocks were held in Ireland. While the Minister is satisfied that the level of stocks held by Ireland is fully in line with international obligations he is mindful of the desirability of incrementally increasing the volume of NORA stocks held in Ireland having regard to storage availability and value for money.</P>
        <P>Under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has the function of licensing natural gas storage facilities. In carrying out its functions, the commission must have regard to the need to ensure there is sufficient capacity in the natural gas system to enable reasonable expectations of demand to be met and to secure the continuity, security and quality of supplies of natural gas. In the context of the all-island energy market development framework, a common approach on storage and liquefied natural gas within a timeframe of 2005 to 2007, is being progressed. Work is progressing on a bilateral basis involving the Departments and regulatory authorities, North and South, and a feasibility study is being commissioned in the first instance. This work is all the more timely, given EU and international developments that underline the need for enhanced strategic approaches to security of gas supply. In addition, Marathon Oil Ireland Limited is developing natural gas storage facilities at south west Kinsale. The CER is finalising the licensing regime and it is planned that the storage facility will be operational in summer 2006.</P>

	<P>Digital television is available in Ireland. Both cable-MMDS operators and satellite operators provide subscription digital tele<Col N="2088"/>vision services. Free-to-air analogue television services are provided on a terrestrial basis. Over time it is expected that analogue terrestrial services will migrate to digital terrestrial services in most countries. This migration is happening on a significant scale in a number of European countries. The Minister has proposed that a digital terrestrial television pilot programme be developed in Ireland. This pilot is nearing the end of the procurement phase. The purpose of the pilot is to bring further momentum to the transition to digital terrestrial broadcasting and to test and trial various aspects of the service. The Minister expects the pilot to become operational in autumn 2006.</P>

Local loop unbundling is mandated by a European Council Regulation and responsibility for its implementation is a matter for the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, under the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and the transposed EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services. Telecommunications legislation is being prepared in the Department, which will,<i> inter alia</i>, provide for greater enforcement powers for ComReg, including provisions for indictable offences for serious infringements of the regulatory framework and for continuing fines, where appropriate. These powers will give ComReg the necessary muscle to enforce regulatory decisions to support the development of competition in the market. I hope to publish the Bill shortly.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Catch reporting by member states to the Commission consists primarily of six separate reports that are designed to cover a wide range of aspects of fish landings. The reports relate essentially to quota and non-quota species, the nationality of the fleets concerned both from the EU and third countries and also the place of landing. Two of these reports are monthly and four are quarterly.</P>
        <P>The most important report in providing data on the main fishing operations of the Irish fishing fleet is a monthly report to the Commission on catches of quota species. This report has been transmitted to the Commission for each of the years outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question. For some of the other reports, however, particularly for the early part of the eight-year period concerned, the reporting situation has been less complete, reflecting in particular the greatly increased complexity and scale of the reporting requirement generally under the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, which took place from the 1990s onwards. Due to staffing shortages and the need to develop new technology to respond to this more complex reporting requirement, it did not prove possible to submit all of the various reports for all years. However, the Department recognised that there was a need to secure improved delivery of the necessary reports and it kept the Commission periodically apprised of its plans to secure such improvement.</P>
        <P>Such improvement has been secured. This has resulted from, first, advances in staffing terms from a complement of 27 administrative and specialist control staff in 1999 to a planned 101 by early next year. Second, there has also been considerable investment on the installation of new technology in the form of the integrated fisheries information system, IFIS, which embraces all the key information requirements on catches. Through a combination of these two developments in particular, which have involved extensive work over a period of years, Ireland is in position to discharge its reporting obligations. For instance, all 38 catch reports for 2005 were submitted on schedule throughout last year and, in so far as 2006 is concerned, I am confident this satisfactory position for 2005 can be repeated this year and in future years.</P><Col N="2090"/>
        <P>In so far as fisheries control and surveillance is concerned, all fishing vessels operating within the Irish fisheries patrol area are subject to checks by Irish control authorities, at sea or in Irish ports. Checks at sea include an inspection or records and catch on board to ensure the proper recording of catches in the EU log book. The Department&rsquo;s land-based inspectorate also conducts regular checks of all vessels landing into Irish ports. Detailed rules and regulations are in place governing the recording of catches of fish stocks and for landings by EU fishing vessels. Misreporting and underreporting of catches is considered a serious infringement of the CFP and there are significant penalties in place for such contraventions. Responsibility for overfishing specified catch limits clearly rests with the individual fishing vessels concerned and such a practice is to be deplored. In this regard, I stress the great importance which Ireland attaches to compliance with the rules of the CFP including the reporting obligations on fishermen.</P>
        <P>As part of the drive to increase the effectiveness of fisheries surveillance, major enhancements to national fisheries control and enforcement capabilities have been implemented in recent years and a recruitment process is under way for additional sea-fisheries protection officers. This commitment is also demonstrated by the recent decision to establish an independent body charged with the enforcement of national, EU and international sea-fisheries law. This independent body is an important feature of the new sea fisheries legislation, recently enacted by the Oireachtas. The legislation is intended to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to provide a dissuasive code of deterrents and sanctions to address overfishing and all illegal fishing activity. In addition to potential penalties that individual fishermen may face under national law, under the CFP, member states also have a clear legal responsibility to ensure that vessels flying their flag comply with the rules. It is therefore open to the Commission to initiate court action or infringement proceedings against member states in the event of over-fishing occurring or inadequate implementation of the CFP generally. Such proceedings may ultimately lead to fines being imposed directly on member states in the event of a judgment by the European Court of Justice.</P>
        <P>In so far as recent overfishing reports in the media and elsewhere is concerned, these are matters, which are the subject of an investigation by the Garda and I do not, therefore, consider it appropriate to comment further in these circumstances. The Government is committed to the development of the sea fisheries industry on a sustainable basis. We are supporting the development of the seafood industry through a number of integrated schemes designed to secure a sustainable future for the industry under the aegis of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P><Col N="2091"/>
        <P>The two successful fleet renewal programmes and the recent introduction of a decommissioning scheme with a budget of &euro;45 million over the next two years will together deliver the necessary restructuring, renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet, which is designed to bring a modern, safe and efficient fleet into balance with the available fishing opportunities. The scope for the continued further development of the industry will be determined in the context of the next national plan for the period 2007 to 2013. In this regard, extensive discussions have been held at EU level regarding a new European fisheries fund to apply over that period. The terms of the new European fisheries fund have not been agreed at EU level. The proposal is the main item on the Fisheries Council planned for 25 April 2006. The Minister and I will meet fishing industry representatives in the near future to commence the process of developing a strategy for the fishing industry, which will provide for a long-term sustainable future for the fishing industry and support the livelihoods of coastal communities dependent on fishing.</P>

	<P>Within the electricity market, the renewables Directive 2001/77/EC obliges Ireland to develop and implement a programme capable of increasing the amount of electricity from renewable energy sources to 13.2% of total consumption by 2010. The Minister has stated his firm commitment to ensuring Ireland meets the target. Targets beyond 2010 will be determined in the context of the development of an all-island electricity market. The aim is to develop a long-term strategy to support increased renewable energy penetration on the island as a whole. To this end, a consultation paper entitled, 2020 Vision for Renewable Energy, was published in July 2005. The responses to this paper are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and will inform future policy in this area. As part of this work, a major grid study is under way jointly with Northern Ireland to asses the implications of significantly increased renewables in the electricity mix on the island by 2020.</P>

        <P>The digital hub project, managed by the independent Digital Hub Development Agency, has been and will continue to be successful in developing a digital industry cluster, as well as in regenerating an historic community area in the heart of Dublin by operating a number of significant community and educational initiatives as part of its role in the digital hub district.</P>
        <P>In November 2005, the Minister announced the acceptance of tenders for two sites in the digital hub, with a combined area of almost 5.6 acres for approximately &euro;118 million. In return for the land, the State will receive a combination of &euro;72.4 million in cash and &euro;45.7 million in high quality offices, which is equivalent to over 13,000 m<?oasys _of7- ?>2 of office space that will accommodate digital enterprises as the digital hub grows.</P>
        <P>The digital hub has engaged with local community interests on the project from the very beginning. The consultation takes place through the unique community, public, private partnership, CPPP, process, which is chaired by DHDA board member Peter Cassells. As a result of the consultation, the two private developers are required under the terms of the development <Col N="2094"/>contract to engage with the local community through the CPPP process.</P>
        <P>Regarding industry development, the agency has been successful to date in growing the cluster with about 50 companies now employing approximately 500 employees in the hub. These enterprises are involved in a range of activities including games software development, mobile technology, animation and TV production.</P>

	<P>The report to which the Deputy refers has been examined in some detail. In its report the Commission recognises that, outside the metropolitan areas of the EU, population scarcity and distance can discourage commercial investment in telecommunications. It concludes <Col N="2095"/>that states should intervene to deliver infrastructure in these markets in a well-targeted manner compatible with state aid rules.</P>
        <P>Ireland welcomes the Commission&rsquo;s initiative to align its Structural Funds, regional policy and competition policy to facilitate state investment in broadband infrastructure and services in rural and low population areas that are suffering market failure. Moreover this is in line with the Commission&rsquo;s recent decision to endorse the Irish Government&rsquo;s broadband strategy to invest in metropolitan area networks in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In many circumstances, mainly in cities, the market will provide competitive broadband services. This announcement by the Commission recognises that an under-supply of broadband infrastructure can occur in rural areas. In Ireland, the lack of infrastructure investment by the private sector is leading to a gap in broadband services in rural parts of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Irish Government through the regional broadband programme is taking specific action to address broadband market failures, and will continue to review options in this area, particularly in peripheral and rural areas. Improved broadband coverage is a priority for the Irish Government because of its important implications for business competitiveness and productivity as set out in the Lisbon Agenda.</P>

	<P>This digital sister city initiative is designed to stimulate economic development by connecting cities from around the world through advanced technologies. Digital sister cities identify ways to positively impact the global economy and, in so doing, strengthen their own economic foundation.</P>
        <P>The digital hub is very enthusiastic about opening new collaborative channels for digital hub companies and research activities. It already has an established mechanism to source and disseminate information on Irish digital media enterprise and resources to manage and administer the process.</P>
        <P>With the hub&rsquo;s existing connection to Dublin City Council, the third level sector and the creative and enterprise participants in their project, the digital hub has the right mix of capabilities to drive some pragmatic initiatives to happen within the digital sister cities framework. It will use those resources to support the sister initiative.</P>
        <P>The hub has already indicated it would welcome the opportunity to explore how international collaboration could facilitate innovative <Col N="2097"/>exhibits and increase visitor numbers and will pursue this with its sister counterparts.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>Under the sister initiative, a Digital Media Advisory Council, DMAC, will be established in each location. The purpose of the DMAC is to act as a voice for all the Irish organisations that may wish to participate in the sister initiative. A group with representation from digital media enterprise, education, arts and culture and the city of Dublin will be established in the first instance. The possibility of involving other Irish digital media based collaborations will be examined.</P>

	<P>The marine tourism grant scheme, which was a sub-measure of the tourism measure under the national development plan aimed specifically at supporting marine access infrastructure for tourism purposes, was suspended in December 2002 due to budgetary constraints. This scheme remains suspended and is now unlikely to be reactivated. There is no other fund<Col N="2099"/>ing available in this department for marine leisure projects.</P>
        <P>The funding available to the Department under the port infrastructure improvement programme of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 is directed at projects that improve infrastructure and facilities at key strategic fishery harbours and the construction and improvement of berthage and related facilities at smaller harbours and landing places, with a key role in maintaining jobs in fishing, aquaculture and ancillary activities. The funding of marina projects at fishery harbour centres does not come within the scope of that programme.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for small regional harbours operated under the Harbours Act 1946 has been transferred to the Department of Transport with effect from January 2006. Those remaining regional ports and harbours which do not form part of the national maritime transport system for trade and travel are being transferred to alternative uses under local control by that Department, as provided for in the Harbours Act 1996. Funding for marinas in such harbours is a matter for the Department of Transport, or where ownership has been transferred, the relevant local authority.</P>
        <P>Within the five fishery harbour centres, Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Rossaveel and Killybegs, directly owned and operated by this Department there is an existing marina with approximately 260 berths at Howth. Discussions are ongoing with a private developer regarding making available a site for a marina development at Killybegs with up to 100 berths. A major infrastructure development project is under way at Dunmore East and consideration is being given to a planning application by the Department to include provision for a 50-berth marina development in that overall development project. There are no plans for development of marinas at either Castletownbere or Rossaveel at present. This position will be reviewed following the completion of current development works under way at those fishery harbour centres. I have no plans at present to bring forward any additional measures to encourage the development of marinas at fishery harbour centres.</P>

        <Quest>if, in view of the recent views raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, he has plans to carry out a performance assessment of his Department for the period of the present Government concerning the invigilation and management of the national sea fisheries resource and fishery harbours; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to outline in detail the background and context to this matter as well as indicating the current position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 2005 raised two key issues in connection with the five fishery harbour centres owned by the State and operated by the Department at Killybegs, Castletownbere, Ros a Mhil, Howth and Dunmore East, in accordance with the Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1968. These issues related to a delay in the provision of annual accounts for the fishery harbour centres for the years 2000-03 and the Department&rsquo;s oversight of the five fishery harbour centres and in particular the collection of outstanding harbour dues.</P>
        <P>The relevant legislation provides that the annual accounts of the fishery harbour centres are to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. There had been a delay in the provision of annual accounts for the years 2000-03 due to exceptional pressure on the Department&rsquo;s accounts branch. This was due to changes in the Department&rsquo;s functions during the period. A schedule for submission of the accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General was agreed with his office in November 2004 and the draft accounts for the years 2000-04 were submitted by the Department to his office for audit in May 2005.</P>
        <P>As regards oversight of the fishery harbour centres and debt collection, the Comptroller and Auditor General had raised a number of questions regarding departmental oversight of the fishery harbour centres and in particular progress made to eliminate the levels of debt.</P>
        <P>The fishery harbour centres are funded through rents for properties at the harbours and through charges for usage of harbour facilities, mainly by fishermen and fishing industry operators. It is in my view important that these strategic harbours meet their operating costs in order to provide a sustainable service to the fishing industry. The Exchequer fully provides the capital funding required to ensure their ongoing maintenance and development.</P>
        <P>Prior to 2003, charges had not been increased since 1990. There has been strong resistance from <Col N="2101"/>the fishing industry from time to time to harbour charges, particularly following the introduction of the new charges in 2003. While the challenges facing the fishing industry are appreciated it is important that the facilities provided to them are maintained on a sound financial footing. Since 2001 there have been a number of initiatives to enhance recovery of receipts and arrears. This included the hiring of external services to assist with collection. Debt control procedures have also been introduced, including the options of detention of vessels, refusal of harbour services and, where appropriate, legal action for recovery of moneys owed.</P>
        <P>In addition, new financial management systems are being rolled out for the harbours which, among other things, enable the efficient issuing of invoices and also enables the debtors&rsquo; position to be monitored more effectively. These new systems will also enhance the quality of service provided to the fishing industry at the fishery harbour centres by enabling more clarity in relation to the charges being imposed.</P>
        <P>The benefits of the charges introduced in 2003 are now being realised. The accounts for 2004 and the draft accounts for 2005 show a small operating profit for the five fishery harbour centres. This compares with operating losses in previous years. A substantial reduction in the level of debt is expected to be seen this year.</P>
        <P>Harbour masters, or acting harbour masters, are now in place at all of the fishery harbour centres. The Department is also reviewing the structures, roles and responsibilities, work practices and procedures with regard to management of the harbours with a view to improving the level and efficiency and service provided as well as ensuring an ongoing sound financial position. I am confident that these measures will enable the Department to better focus on maximising the value of the assets available at the fishery harbour centres for the benefit of the fishing industry, the local communities in which they are situated and nationally.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, in the light of the foregoing circumstances, which point clearly to a wide range of important steps and measures to address certain shortcomings, and bearing in mind that sea fisheries resource management is an entirely separate issue operating in a totally different policy context, I do not believe that an assessment of the type suggested by the Deputy is warranted.</P>
        <P>In so far as management of sea fisheries in concerned, there is an ongoing investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into alleged over-fishing and I consider that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on that aspect in these circumstances.</P>

	<P>The development of ocean energy possibilities is currently being progressed by Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, and the Marine Institute.</P>
        <P>The Marine Institute and SEI, in conjunction with the Department, recently opened a wave energy test site a mile and a half off the coast of Spiddal, County Galway. The 37-hectare site will be open to entrepreneurs and engineers to test prototype ocean energy generators. The first wave energy generator, &ldquo;WaveBob&rdquo;, has been deployed on the Spiddal site. The Minister intends to publish an ocean energy strategy shortly, which will set out a development path for ocean energy technology in Ireland.</P>
        <P>SEI and the Marine Institute are currently supporting a number of ocean energy technologies including the wavebob, ocean energy buoy, the McCabe wave pump, wave tank and air turbine design, and are providing research and development support for three separate wave energy device developers, including support for wave tank testing of model devices. Other projects and studies funded to date include: assessment of the tidal energy resource; assessment of the wave energy resource; development of a quarter scale test site in Galway Bay; assessment of economic benefits from development of ocean energy; and participation in IEA ocean energy implementing agreement.</P>
        <P>In addition to the ocean energy strategy, I will be publishing an energy policy consultation paper by mid-year which will set out medium and long-term perspectives for national energy policy and which will take account of the considerable and complex challenges for Irish energy policy.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the T&aacute;naiste and I regard the support of older people to stay in their own homes and communities as a key policy priority, thereby moving away from the practice of placing people in residential care as a first option. This is the expressed wish of the majority of our older people. Additional funding has been allocated for services for older people and palliative care amounting to &euro;150 million in budget 2006, with &euro;110 million allocated for 2006 and &euro;40 million more for 2007. The investment package is a major step in focusing new resources on home care first and foremost, while still supporting appropriate residential care.</P>
        <P>For those who require residential care, the nursing home subvention scheme was introduced in 1993 on foot of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the regulations made thereunder to give some financial assistance towards the cost of private nursing home care. It was never intended that the scheme would subsidise the full costs of private nursing home care. The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 are administered by the Health Service Executive. There are currently three rates of subvention payable, &euro;114.30, &euro;152.40 and &euro;190.50 for the three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum, respectively.</P>
        <P>The HSE has discretion to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual&rsquo;s level of dependency where, for example, personal funds are exhausted. The application of these provisions to an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention and is subject to the pro<Col N="2106"/>visions of the Health Act 2004. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates. Additional funding of &euro;20 million was provided for the administration of the nursing home subvention scheme in 2006, bringing the total available budget to &euro;160 million. This additional funding will help to ensure the consistent delivery of the subvention scheme nationwide and will help to eliminate any discrepancies in the scheme.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister S&eacute;amus Brennan established a working group to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care. The report of the working group on the future financing of long-term care has been presented to the Government and is currently being considered by the Cabinet.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the T&aacute;naiste and I regard the support of older people to stay in their own homes and communities as a key policy priority, with appropriate residential care provided where necessary. This marks a move away from the practice of placing people in residential care as a first option and is in line with the expressed wish of the majority of our older people. This Government is committed to developing the various community and home support schemes, which are vital to maintain older people in their own homes for as long as possible. An investment package of an additional &euro;150 million has been put in place in budget 2006 for services for older people and palliative care, with &euro;110 million allocated for 2006 and a further &euro;40 million for 2007. This is the largest ever increase in funding for services for older people and palliative care. Reflecting the new emphasis on home and day care, almost three quarters or &euro;109 million of the full year costs are being committed to community care supports, including home care packages, &euro;55 million; the home help service, &euro;33 million; sheltered housing, &euro;1 million; and day and respite care, &euro;9 million.</P>
        <P>Additional funding of &euro;20 million was also provided for the administration of the nursing home subvention scheme in 2006, bringing the total available budget to &euro;160 million. This additional <Col N="2107"/>funding will help to ensure the consistent delivery of the subvention scheme nationwide.</P>

This was to take account of the Mercer report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland, which was commissioned by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme by Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea. This group presented its report to the Government and it is now under consideration. The objective of the group was to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, including improvements in community care. In the context of that report, the Health Service Executive have been asked as a matter of urgency to assess the long-term residential care capacity needs of older people.</P>

	<P>The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services were considered in the context of the work of the expert group on mental health policy. The Government published the group&rsquo;s report, A Vision for Change, on Tuesday, 24 January 2006. The Government has accepted the expert group&rsquo;s report as the basis for the future development of the mental health services. The expert group&rsquo;s report makes recommendations on the re-organisation of mental health catchment areas and the recommendations made by the Inspector of Mental Health Services will need to be considered in this context.</P>
        <P>The management and delivery of health and personal social services, including mental health services in north and south County Tipperary, is <Col N="2110"/>a matter for the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, the Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The Health (Repayment Scheme) Bill 2006 was published on 16 March 2006 and the Second Stage reading of the Bill commenced in the D&aacute;il on 30 March 2006. The Second Stage of this Bill is due to resume in the D&aacute;il on 27 April 2006. It is my wish that the important legislative proposals contained in the Bill will have a speedy passage through the Oireachtas prior to the summer recess. This will enable the implementation of the scheme and ensure the repayments are made swiftly to those eligible for repayment following the completion of an uncomplicated application process. It is currently envisaged that repayments will commence shortly after the Bill is approved and signed into law and an outside company has been appointed to make the repayments. The timescale determined by the Health Service Executive for the selection process including the appointment of the successful company is the end of April 2006, with repayments to claimants likely to commence in June 2006.</P>

	<P>In April 2005 it came to my attention that some hospitals had been charging the statutory inpatient levy in the case of patients occupying trolleys in accident and emergency departments. On 28 April 2005, I instructed the Health Service Executive to ensure that patients should not be charged the levy unless they had been formally admitted to a hospital. This instruction included not charging patients in accident and emergency departments who occupy trolleys. However, the decision to admit a patient is taken locally and practices regarding the point at which formal admission occurs and charging commences may vary between hospitals. I wish to ensure fairness and consistency of approach across all hospitals and have asked the HSE for a report on hospitals practices in this regard. I will revert to the Deputy when I have received the HSE&rsquo;s report.</P>

	<P>An integral part of the national disability strategy is the implementation of the provisions of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. The multi-annual investment programme for disability services, published in December 2004 by the Government, contained details of specific commitments relating to the provision of specific high priority disability services over the period 2005 to 2009. This programme, together with the enhancement of other key support services, will be a key factor in building additional capacity in health services, including mental health services.</P>
        <P>The cumulative value of the multi-annual investment programme when published was &euro;900 million, with the bulk to be spent on health services. In this regard, in 2005 the Department made available an additional &euro;15 million revenue for the further development of mental health services. An additional &euro;25 million revenue is being made available in 2006 for the further enhancement of our mental health services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In general, the current policy relating to Garda vetting is to expand the vetting service so that it is available to any organisation whose staff or volunteers would have access to children or vulnerable individuals. In this context, and as a result of the recent expansion of the Garda central vetting unit and the streamlining of existing vetting application procedures, plans are well under way for the extension of the vetting service on a phased basis to many more statutory and non-statutory organisations.</P>
        <P>Garda clearance is already available to a large number of organisations whose staff have access to children or vulnerable individuals. Under procedures agreed in 1994 and 1995 Garda clearance arrangements apply in respect of candidates for paid employment in the health services where they would have access to children and vulnerable individuals and in services for children and vulnerable adults provided by external agencies but funded by the Health Service Executive, HSE. Among the standards in the national standards for children&rsquo;s residential centres is one that states that all staff, students and volunteers are appropriately vetted, to include references and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and-or police authority criminal record checks, before taking up duties.</P>
        <P>The Child Care (Special Care) Regulations 2004 provide that the HSE or voluntary body or any other person providing or maintaining a special care unit will ensure that staff or others who have access to children are appropriately vetted, that is, by obtaining references and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and-or other police authority criminal record checks. The social services inspectorate and the registration and inspection units of the Health Service Executive inspect children&rsquo;s residential services and the special care units within their remit against such criteria. A similar provision is being considered for the child care sector.</P>
        <P>Currently, vetting is only available in respect of child care staff funded under the equal opportunities child care programme. The Child Care <Col N="2119"/>(Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations 1995 and the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995 require that foster parents or relatives, respectively, with whom children in the care of the HSE are to be placed give authorisation to allow the HSE to obtain a statement from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to whether there are any convictions against them or any relevant member of the household and to provide the names of two referees for reference purposes.</P>
        <P>It is worth stressing that, irrespective of whatever clearance arrangements are in place, it will continue to be necessary to bear in mind that criminal record checks, while being capable in appropriate circumstances of making a significant contribution to ensuring that unsuitable persons do not secure positions of trust, are not the sole answer to ensuring applicants&rsquo; suitability for jobs whether paid or voluntary particularly where children or other vulnerable persons could be open to abuse. There will continue to be a particular onus of care on employers-organisations to maintain good practice both during the recruitment stage, for example, good interviewing practice and checking references, and when it comes to ensuring adequate supervision arrangements post-recruitment are in place both for staff and volunteers. This has been highlighted to the Health Service Executive in guidance issued by my Department on the recruitment of staff who come within its remit and have access to children and vulnerable adults.</P>
        <P>In addition, a publication entitled Our Duty to Care was issued by my Department in 2002. Essentially it promotes good practice and procedures for organisations dealing with children and consists of a booklet and fact-sheets covering areas such as safe recruitment practice, developing safe management practices and policies and raising awareness of child abuse among volunteers and staff.</P>

The review, which was published in full along with all of the other reviews on 6 February 2006, concluded that the relief in its present form should be maintained and that conclusion has informed my policy approach in this area.</P>
        <P>The review also raised a wide range of other policy options for general consideration, including the option of replacing the tax free status of woodland gains with higher up-front grants and premium payments.

	<P>Under the Investor Compensation Act 1998, the Investor Compensation Company Ltd., ICCL, is required to establish or maintain a fund or funds out of which payments are made in accordance with the Act. The industry is responsible for funding the compensation scheme. The scheme provides that compensation paid to eligible investors is the lesser of &euro;20,000 or 90% of the net losses suffered through the default of the investment entity in question. This is the minimum level of compensation required by the investor compensation directive, Directive 97/9/EC of 3 March 1997, and is in line with the compensation levels which apply in the majority of other member states.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my earlier reply to a question from Deputies Higgins and Deenihan on the issue of private sector debt taken on 23 February 2006.</P>
        <P>Within the implementation of the overall legislative framework, private sector credit growth and debt levels are, in the first instance, a matter for the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. This follows from its role as part of the European System of Central Banks and its functions, as the Financial Regulator, in relation to the prudential supervision of financial institutions and the protection of the consumers of those firms.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has already drawn attention to the need for lenders to act prudently in extending credit, especially for house purchase, and for borrowers to carefully consider their ability to service borrowings. The Financial Regulator, with its statutory consumer mandate, has developed a number of specific initiatives to help consumers make informed choices in terms of the financial products they choose, the amount of risk they take on and the cost of financial products. These initiatives have been developed through the framework of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s It&rsquo;s <Col N="2125"/>Your Money campaign and have involved publishing consumer guides on credit products, fact sheets, cost surveys on personal loans, all of which are intended to assist borrowers in making the most appropriate credit decisions given their circumstances.</P>
        <P>While the level of indebtedness of Irish households has been increasing, the Central Bank&rsquo;s most recently published financial stability report concludes that a range of fundamental factors such as growing employment, rising real incomes, falling inflation and low interest rates have supported the pattern of mortgage growth and associated debt levels in the economy. The report does, however, emphasise the importance of responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders, and the need to factor into their financial decision-making the prospective impact of <?oasys _ch ?>potential changes in the future economic environment.</P>
        <P>In evaluating the financial position of the private sector, it is too narrow an approach to consider the level of indebtedness in isolation from the asset side of the private sector&rsquo;s balance sheet. A high proportion of household indebtedness in Ireland, which accounts for approximately 46% of private sector indebtedness overall, relates to borrowing for house-purchase which, in turn, involves the acquisition of an asset for the households. In the same way, borrowing by the business sector generally underpins investment and the creation of business assets yielding future income. It therefore reflects the strong performance of the economy and confidence in Ireland&rsquo;s economic prospects.</P>
        <P>As far as looking after the interests of the individual borrower and the individual investor is concerned, the function of Government is to provide an appropriate legislative framework for regulation of the financial services sector &mdash; one that is both comprehensive and robust. On foot of the progress made over recent years, especially in establishing the Financial Regulator with a particular focus on the interests of the consumer, we have such a framework in place.</P>
        <P>As far as overall economic and financial stability is concerned, an overall measure of credit encompasses both public and private sector credit and debt levels. The Minister for Finance has a key role in this regard in ensuring prudent management of the budget and overall sustainability in the public finances. In this context, Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal performance is among the best in the developed world with Government indebtedness the second-lowest in the euro area. Responsible budgetary policy has made a significant contribution to economic performance overall and to the achievement of record employment levels.</P>

	<P>The Financial Regulator is responsible for the prudential supervision of Irish-licensed financial institutions and the Minister for Finance does not get involved in matters of day-to-day supervision. I do, however, welcome the supervisory attention which mortgage lending is receiving from our Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>This technical prudential measure reinforces the message consistently conveyed to lending institutions by the Financial Regulator that mortgage lending policies and practices should be prudent and responsible. It is a targeted and proportionate measure signalling the need for responsible lending by requiring financial institutions to put more capital aside for higher loan to value, LTV, loans. Part of the context for the action is, I note, changes in accounting and provisioning practices brought about by new accounting standards.</P>
        <P>This action is fully consistent with the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s functions in relation to the effective supervision of financial institutions. The Financial Regulator is best placed to make the assessment that the measure is necessary in view of its expertise in prudential supervision.</P>
        <P>The measure accords with best regulatory practice internationally. It also reflects the recommendations of international commentators such as the OECD which recommended increased loan provisioning in its recent report on the Irish economy. When economic and financial conditions are quite favourable, it is sensible for the Financial Regulator to require mortgage lenders to make increased provision for loans that are riskier.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the costs relating to the National Aquatic Centre and the companies associated with it. However, as I indicated in my reply to a similar question put down for answer by the Deputy last Wednesday, the Revenue Commissioners are precluded for reasons of confidentiality from dis<Col N="2127"/>closing any details of the affairs of an individual taxpayer and for this reason it is not possible to give a detailed reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the general position is that capital allowances can be claimed in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the provision of machinery or plant under section 284(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. A claim for allowances under this provision will typically be made by an owner of machinery or plant who operates the machinery or plant in the course of his or her own business. There is also provision for allowances to be claimed where machinery or plant is leased. Under section 298 of the same Act, a lessor who has incurred capital expenditure on the provision of machinery or plant may claim capital allowances in respect of that expenditure provided that the burden of wear and tear falls on the lessor.</P>
        <P>Alternatively, if the lessor chooses not to claim, the lessee of the machinery or plant may, under section 299 of the same Act, claim the allowances subject to a number of conditions. To qualify, the lessee must use the machinery or plant for the purposes of his or her trade. The machinery or plant must be let to the lessee on such terms that he or she is bound to maintain the machinery or plant and deliver it over in good condition at the end of the lease and the burden of wear and tear must in fact fall on the lessee. However, whether allowances are being claimed by an owner and operator of machinery or plant or by the lessor or lessee of that machinery or plant, allowances are only available in respect of expenditure incurred which is not met directly or indirectly by the State. Section 317 of the Consolidation Act provides specific provision for denying allowances in respect of any expenditure so met by the State. This section does not apply in respect of a company carrying on a food processing trade on the purchase of certain machinery or plant for use in that trade.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that claims for capital allowances are generally made in the annual return of income submitted by taxpayers under the self-assessment system. All returns are subject to check and audit to ensure that, <i>inter alia,</i> any allowances are correctly claimed.</P>

	<P>Following the announcement by Revenue clarifying the stamp duty treatment on purchases of shares underpinning the contracts for differences, CFDs, my Department received strong representations that there would be severe consequences for the liquidity of the Irish stock market and thus, on the ability of Irish firms to raise capital and potentially on the viability of stockbroking here.</P>
        <P>I considered these representations carefully and, as they seemed to have some substance, I came to the view that the matter needed to be examined in more depth to assess the full consequences of any change, taking account of the international nature of stock markets and the fact that stamp duty on shares traded in Ireland and the UK is collected for the Exchequer via a payments system common to both jurisdictions, CREST.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, and having regard to the fact that the relevant stamp duty legislation predates the development of the CFD market, I decided to have the matter reviewed in advance of the next budget, and issued a statement to that effect.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the light of the planned review, with a view to budget 2007 announcements, and of the surrounding circumstances, they decided to allow the existing practices of CFD issuers to continue pending the review. They further advise that, as CFD business could otherwise have simply transferred to non-Irish equities, there is unlikely to be any net loss of stamp duty.</P>

        <P>Future energy policy for Europe was the central issue for this Council with the discussions focusing on the European Commission&rsquo;s recently-published Green Paper, A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy.</P>
        <P>The discussions on energy were very much a first step in what promises to be a long and complex process. It is without doubt an issue of central importance to Ireland and the future success of our economy. As Ireland shares many of the challenges facing the EU in the energy area, we will participate actively in the EU debate.</P>
        <P>The Polish Government&rsquo;s specific proposals around an energy treaty to deal with energy security of supply challenges were not discussed in detail. The European Council agreed to increase security of supply through among other things ensuring common operational approaches to address crisis situations in a spirit of solidarity, taking subsidiarity into account.</P>
        <P>The Government is progressing the development of an all-island energy market on a joint basis. In the longer term, enhanced interconnection with other EU markets will deliver improved security of supply and greater consumer choice.

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ireland currently has approximately 790 MW of renewable capacity connected. This consists of approximately 520 MW of wind powered plant, 240 MW of hydro powered plant with the balance, approximately 30 MW made up of different biomass technologies. The renewables directive, Directive 2001/77/EC, obliges Ireland to develop and implement a programme capable of increasing the amount of electricity from renewable energy sources to 13.2% of total consumption by 2010.</P>
        <P>The target of 13.2% approximates to 1,450 megawatts of installed generating capacity to be operational to the electricity network by 2010. The additional new capacity required to achieve the 1,450 MW target will be delivered by a combination of projects under the previous AER V and AER VI competition, the new renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT, programme, the greener homes domestic grant scheme and the mineral oil tax relief scheme.</P>
        <P>The REFIT programme will move from competitive tendering, AER, to a fixed price based system. I expect to be in a position to launch the programme shortly, following a public consultation process which has usefully informed the shape of the new programme.</P>
        <P>The multi-annual financial package for renewable energy announced in budget 2006 provides funding of up to &euro;65 million over a five-year period for renewable energy schemes that will include grants for a range of renewable heat, electricity and transport initiatives. The programmes cover the biofuels, biomass heating, combined heat and power, CHP, and domestic energy sectors. The first part of the programme &mdash; the greener homes domestic grants scheme &mdash; was launched on 27 March 2006 and provides up to &euro;27 million in grant aid for domestic renewable heat technologies, including wood pellet stoves and boilers, solar panels and heat pumps.</P><Col N="2131"/>
        <P>In 2005 a pilot mineral oil tax relief scheme for biofuels was rolled out and has resulted in eight projects being awarded excise relief. This will result in 16 million litres of biofuels being placed on the Irish transport market by next year. Building on the success of this scheme I have agreed with the Minister for Finance a further targeted package of excise relief valued at &euro;205 million, which was announced in the budget. The new excise relief programme, which is subject to State-aid approval, will be rolled out from this year to 2010 and will enable Ireland to reach the initial target of 2% market penetration by biofuels by 2008. When fully operational the relief is expected to support the use and production of some 163 million litres of biofuels each year. I am also providing funding towards the capital cost of developing biofuels processing facilities, which will critically underpin the excise relief package.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that development work has ceased temporarily on the proposed onshore pipeline for the Corrib gas field because of concerns relating to safety. Work on the offshore pipeline has been deferred to late 2006 while the construction work on the terminal has been suspended due to concerns about workers&rsquo; safety in relation to site access. With regard to the onshore pipeline safety issue, I commissioned an international consulting company, Advantica, on 25 August 2005, to carry out a thorough and independent safety review of the proposed upstream onshore pipeline. In parallel with this safety review, I established a public consultation process to ensure that the concerns of the community would be fully addressed in the review.</P>
        <P>As part of this process, a two-day public hearing was held in Geesala on 12 and 13 October, chaired by Mr. John Gallagher SC, during which the community was given the opportunity to express its concerns directly to the consultants. The consultants also made a separate site inspection of the pipeline route. They subsequently took the local concerns into account when carrying out their review. The review also critically examined all relevant documentation relating to the design, construction and operation of the pipeline and associated facilities as well as concluding whether or not the proposed installations would comply with recognised international best practice and would deliver a facility that it is fit for purpose. Advantica was also asked to identify any deficiencies in relation to the safety of the pipeline and to make recommendations as to how these, if identified, would be remedied.</P>
        <P>The draft safety review was presented to the community on 8 December 2005 and published on the same day. Comments were invited on the draft, with a closing date of 22 December. The final report of the safety review was received in the Department recently and will be published shortly, together with recommendations arising <Col N="2132"/>from it made by the Corrib pipeline technical advisory group within the Department.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I have after consultation with relevant parties, nominated a mediator, Mr. Peter Cassells, to work with the parties. This process is ongoing.</P>
        <P>I hope the mediation process, augmented as needed, by the results of the safety review will allow all those concerned to work together to resolve the difficulties that have arisen. I will ensure that the outcome of all of these initiatives is fully taken into account in making forthcoming decisions on the project. Should the pipeline development works recommence in the near future the developers hope to bring the gas ashore by mid to late 2008.</P>
        <P>I have no function in the utilisation of the gas from the Corrib gas field. This is a matter for the developers.</P>
        <P>With regard to non-petroleum minerals, exploration and development is undertaken by private enterprise and regulated under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999. All extraction of minerals under the Acts is subject to payment of royalties to the State. While it is my intention to consolidate and update those Acts in a new minerals development Bill currently in preparation, I do not propose to change that policy. The awards to be made under the Slyne-Erris-Donegal round will be issued under these licensing terms. When this round has been completed, I will turn my attention to the question as to whether the current licensing terms remain appropriate in this age of high gas and oil prices and the emerging tight supply position in Europe.</P>
        <P>Under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has the function of licensing natural gas storage facilities. In carrying out its functions, the commission must have regard to the need to ensure that there is sufficient capacity in the natural gas system to enable reasonable expectations of demand to be met and to secure the continuity, security and quality of supplies of natural gas.</P>
        <P>In the context of the all-island energy market development framework, as part of the strategic goals enunciated, scope for a common approach on storage and liquefied natural gas within a timeframe of 2005 to 2007, has been identified. Work is progressing in bilateral discussions in both jurisdictions involving the Departments and regulatory authorities on this matter.</P>
        <P>In addition, Marathon Oil Ireland Ltd has planned the development of natural gas storage facilities at south west Kinsale. Procedures for the storage of gas in those facilities are a matter for the leaseholder and do not fall within my remit. The CER is finalising the licensing regime and it is planned that the storage facility will be operational in summer, 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Plans to develop and streamline the gas industry involve three main strands: the further liberalisation of the gas market to include domestic customers; the extension of the Commission for Energy Regulation&rsquo;s, CER&rsquo;s, mandate in the gas industry to include responsibility for the regulation of natural gas safety; and the unbundling of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann as a vertically integrated utility.</P>
        <P>Under provisions outlined in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 it is proposed to extend the gas market to domestic customer level. This will ensure that all customers will be able to shop around for their natural gas supplier and the market will be fully contestable. The legislation proposed includes a commencement provision which ensures that the market will be fully open no later than the 1 July 2007 deadline set by EU Directive 2003/55/EC.</P>
        <P>The Bill also proposes to expand the functions of the regulator to include the regulation and promotion of natural gas safety, and to promote consultation with the National Standards Authority of Ireland regarding gas safety standards. The Bill provides for the way the CER will carry out these functions by establishing and implementing a natural gas safety framework and by directing natural gas industry players to advise customers and the public on natural gas safety issues.</P>
        <P>In the recent Statutory Instrument 760 of 2005, further implementing national and EU policy on the development of the gas market, provision was made for the legal unbundling of the transmission and distribution system operations of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, BG&Eacute;. Under the provisions of this statutory instrument, BG&Eacute; is required to establish a subsidiary company with responsibility for management of the natural gas transmission and dis<Col N="2136"/>tribution grid. This will further facilitate the operation of third party players in the market.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Within the electricity market, the renewables directive, Directive 2001/77/EC, obliges Ireland to develop and implement a programme capable of increasing the amount of electricity from renewable energy sources to 13.2% of total consumption by 2010. The Minister is firmly committed to ensuring that we meet the target. Targets beyond 2010 will be determined in the context of the development of an all-island electricity market. The aim is to develop a long-term strategy to support increased renewable energy <Col N="2137"/>penetration on the island as a whole. To this end a consultation paper entitled, 2020 Vision for Renewable Energy, was published in July 2005. The responses to this paper are available on the Department&rsquo;s website and will inform future policy in this area. As part of this work a major grid study is under way to examine the implications of significantly increased renewables in the electricity mix on the island by 2020.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The security of supply of energy is a key policy objective. The relatively small size of our national electricity and gas markets underlines the need for greater interconnection as a means of enhancing security of supply, promoting competition and integrating the Irish electricity and gas markets into the wider European market.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to progressing the development of an east-west electricity interconnection as a matter of priority. The Commission for Energy Regulation, at the Department&rsquo;s request, has been engaged in a process of rigorous exploration of the options for such development. The Minister will be bringing the matter to Government very shortly for final decision on the mechanism to secure an east-west interconnection in terms of financing and developer selection, informed by the advice of the CER.</P>
        <P>In November 2004, the British and Irish Governments jointly endorsed plans put forward by the CER and the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation for the construction of a second north-south electricity interconnector. Planning for the construction of the interconnector is underway by the transmission system operators and it is estimated that the interconnector will be operational by 2012 at the latest.</P><Col N="2139"/>
        <P>The additional east-west and north-south interconnectors will provide enhanced system security and reliability and competition. The north-south interconnector development will also critically underpin the all-island single electricity market.</P>
        <P>Our established interconnection with the UK, which encompasses two gas interconnectors, ensures that Ireland has sufficient importation capacity from external sources. A south-north pipeline is also under construction and is scheduled for commissioning in October 2006. The pipeline will extend from Gormanston, County Meath to Belfast.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services and the development and roll-out of telecommunications technology is primarily a matter for the industry itself. The telecoms market is fully liberalised and regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions, in accordance with the provisions of the Communications Regulations Act 2002.</P>
        <P>In comparison to other European counties, private broadband service providers in Ireland were relatively slow in launching competitive, affordable broadband. However, the situation is improving rapidly. In late 2004, the Government set a target of 400,000 broadband subscribers to be achieved by the end of 2006, that is almost 10% of population or 27% of households. The Minister&rsquo;s challenge to the industry is 500,000 broadband subscribers by the end of 2006, which is approximately 12% of the population or 34% of households.</P>
        <P>The latest ComReg quarterly report states that there are 270,700 broadband subscribers as of the end of 2005. This is equivalent to 6.6% of the population. Almost 140,000 new broadband subscribers were added in 2005, a growth rate of 106%. This compares to 100,000 new broadband subscribers in 2004. The Minister is hopeful that the Government target can be met.</P>

	<P>Expenditure at the digital hub since 2000 is approximately &euro;127 million. This includes &euro;76 million invested in property and infrastructure as well as &euro;51 million in operational costs.</P>
        <P>The Digital Hub Development Agency has been, and will continue to be, successful in developing a digital industry cluster, as well as in regenerating an historic community area in the heart of Dublin by operating a number of significant community and educational initiatives as part of its role in the digital hub district.</P>
        <P>During 2005 the Department provided &euro;3.35 million to the Digital Hub Development Agency. Future costs will be kept under review by the Department and will be subject to negotiations with the agency.</P>
        <P>On 5 October 2005, the agency announced a competition to develop land in the digital hub. This land is to be developed as a mixture of residential, commercial and retail properties, in addition to public spaces. The private developers competed on the basis of bids of cash plus office space.</P>
        <P>On 22 November 2005, the Minister announced the acceptance of tenders for two sites, with a combined area of almost 5.6 acres for approximately &euro;118 million. In return for the land, the State will receive a combination of &euro;72.4 million in cash and &euro;45.7 million in high-quality offices, which will accommodate digital enterprises as the digital hub grows. The breakdown of the tenders means that the digital hub will receive over 13,000 square metres or 140,000 square feet of office space.</P>
        <P>The agency has been successful to date in growing the cluster with approximately 50 companies now employing an estimated 500 people in the hub. These enterprises are involved in a range of activities including games software development, mobile technology, animation and television production.</P>
        <P>The digital hub has engaged with local community interests on the project from the very beginning. The consultation takes place through the unique community, public, private partnership process, which is chaired by Mr. Peter <Col N="2141"/>Cassells. As a result of the consultation, the two private developers are required, under the terms of the development contract, to engage with the local community through the partnership process.</P>
        <P>The successful tenderers will be required to make a planning application within six months and, on receipt of planning permission, to construct the office space offered. They must engage with interested parties through the partnership process. The office space will facilitate the future expansion of the digital hub by accommodating digital media enterprises. The amount that will be used for residential or other commercial purposes will be a matter for the tenderers and the planning authorities.</P>

	<P>According to ComReg there are over 150 companies in the Irish market with at least 45 different broadband offerings across a variety of technologies, including digital subscriber lines, fibre, cable, leased lines and satellite technology. In essence, there are broadband technologies that can deliver broadband to any broadband consumer in Ireland right now.</P>
        <P>In order to stimulate the market and to address a national infrastructure deficit, the Government, in partnership with local authorities, is funding the construction of high-speed metropolitan area networks in 120 towns and cities nationwide. These fibre optic networks are being made available on an open-access basis, which means that telecommunications operators can enter the broadband market without the need to build their own networks. Phase one of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country and a number of operators are already using the metropolitan area networks to provide enhanced broadband services to their new customers.</P>
        <P>The programme has been extended to a further 90 towns in various locations nationwide. Design and procurement has already commenced in several regions and construction is due to commence in the coming months. It is expected that these metropolitan area networks will be completed during 2006 and 2007 and will allow service providers to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>The Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities to become self-sufficient in broadband through the county and group broadband scheme. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform or service provider for the area. To date, over 150 projects have been approved for funding under this programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A joint industry-Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the broadband for schools programme, which will provide every school in the country with broadband by the first half of 2006. The construction or installation phase is now under way and the project is on target for completion within the set timeframe.</P>

	<P>The terms governing the licensing of petroleum exploration and development are kept under constant review by the Department in light of the international market in which Ireland seeks to attract exploration companies. Ireland has yet to make the breakthrough needed to establish its prospecting.</P>
        <P>The awards to be made under the Slyne-Erris-Donegal round will be issued under the existing licensing terms. When this round has been completed, the terms will be reviewed against the increased level of oil and gas prices in the international market and taking account of related developments in terms elsewhere.</P>
        <P>With regard to non-petroleum minerals, exploration and development is undertaken by private enterprise and regulated under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The conditions for competition are being created through progressive liberalisation of the electricity markets. Liberalisation of the electricity market has proceeded on a phased basis since February 2000 under the regulatory oversight of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Eligible Customer) (Consumption of Electricity) Order 2003, on 19 February 2005, the <Col N="2148"/>market opened fully to competition. From that date, all customers have been eligible to source their electricity from any licensed supplier and the entire market became contestable. Scope now exists for all customers, household and non-household alike, to seek out keener prices in the competitive market. This is well in advance of the July 2007 deadline set down in electricity Directive 2003/54/EC.</P>
        <P>The opening of the market has benefited customers by broadening customer choice. Already some 42% of the market by volume is supplied by independent suppliers.</P>
        <P>The CER is the independent statutory body responsible for regulating and overseeing the liberalisation of the electricity sector in Ireland under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. Since full market opening the CER has ensured the support systems and processes are in place to enable new entrant electricity suppliers to serve any customer in Ireland. To date suppliers have focused on larger customers because this was the first segment of the market to open to competition. This is a pattern common in other newly liberalising markets. Over time as suppliers target the domestic market, the CER expect to see those benefits extended to the domestic customer.</P>
        <P>In an all-island context, work is progressing on the development of a single electricity market. In June last year the CER and the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation published their high level decision relating to the proposed design for the single electricity market.

	<P Just="Left">The renewables directive, 2001/77/EC, obliges Ireland to develop and implement a programme capable of increasing the amount of electricity from renewable energy sources to 13.2% of total consumption by 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The target of 13.2% approximates to 1,450 MW of installed generating capacity to be operational to the electricity network by 2010. Currently Ireland has approximately 790 MW of renewable capacity connected. This consists of approximately 520 MW of wind powered plant, 240 MW of hydro powered plant with the balance, circa 30 MW, made up of different biomass technologies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The additional new capacity required to achieve the 1,450 MW target will be delivered by projects under the previous AER V and AER VI competitions and the new renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT, programme.</P>
        <P>The new support programme will move from competitive tendering, AER, to a fixed price based system known as the renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT. Following a public consultation process which has usefully informed the shape of the new programme, I expect to be in a position to launch the programme shortly.</P>
        <P>The Electricity Regulation Act 1999 provides for the liberalisation of the entire electricity market for green electricity providers with effect from February 2000. Developers may apply directly to the Commission for Energy Regulation established under the Act, for authorisations to build wind energy electricity generating stations and licenses to generate and supply electricity direct to final customers. Nobody is excluded from the process and any individual or group, including rural and farming communities, may invest in renewable energy projects if they so wish. However, this is a commercial decision for those involved and not one in which the Minister has a function.</P>
        <P>The multi-annual financial package for renewable energy announced in budget 2006 provides funding of up to &euro;65 million over a five-year <Col N="2152"/>period for renewable energy schemes that will include grants for a range of renewable heat, electricity and transport initiatives. The programmes cover the biofuels, biomass, CHP and domestic energy sectors.</P>
        <P><?oasys _ic20- ?>As part of the programme the domestic grants package, the &ldquo;Greener Homes&rdquo; scheme, was launched on 27 March 2006 and provides up to &euro;27 million in grant aid for domestic renewable heat technologies which includes the installation of wood pellet stoves and boilers, solar panels and heat pumps. Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, is rolling out the scheme on behalf of the Department. Details of the scheme and application forms are available on the SEI website, <i>www.sei.ie/greenerhomes</i>, and a dedicated lo-call phone line is also open, as follows: 1850 734 734.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
        <P>In addition to these initiatives, Sustainable Energy Ireland administers a series of programmes aimed at supporting the integration of renewable technologies and sustainable energy practices across all sectors of the economy. Its programmes include: the house of tomorrow programme, which supports sustainable energy practices in Irish housing, by providing grant aid to developers of groups of housing; the public sector buildings programme which supports the development of energy efficient public sector buildings; the renewable energy research development and demonstration programme which aims to stimulate deployment of renewables close to market and address the need for information and education; the large industry energy network which promotes sustainable energy best practice in industry; and the low income housing programme which aims to upgrade low income households with energy efficiency features.</P>
        <P>The 2005 pilot mineral oil tax relief scheme for biofuels has resulted in eight projects being awarded excise relief and will result in 16 million litres of biofuels being placed on the Irish transport market by next year.</P>
        <P>Building on the success of this scheme, the Minister agreed with the Minister for Finance a further targeted package of excise relief valued at &euro;205 million, which was announced in the budget. The new excise relief programme, which is subject to State-aid approval, will be rolled out from this year to 2010 and will enable us to reach the initial target of 2% market penetration by biofuels by 2008. When fully operational the relief is expected to support the use and production of some 163 million litres of biofuels each year. The Minister is also providing funding towards the capital cost of developing biofuels processing facilities, which will critically underpin the excise relief package.</P>

	<P>The conclusions of the recent spring European Council as well as the Commission&rsquo;s green paper, A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy, both emphasise the imperative for additional physical capacity in order to complete the European internal energy market, with interconnection identified as being particularly important.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s policy objective to ensure that existing interconnection is augmented in the long-term interests of security of supply and market development, particularly in light of our small size and peripherality.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to progressing the development of east-west electricity interconnection as a matter of priority. In line with the Government&rsquo;s priority wish, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, at my Department&rsquo;s request has been engaged in a process of rigorous exploration of the options for such development. The Minister will be bringing the matter to Government shortly for decision as to the mechanism to secure east-west interconnection in terms of financing and developer selection, informed by the advice of the CER.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Further North-South interconnection has also been identified as essential to underpin the proposed all-island energy market. In November 2004, both Governments jointly endorsed plans put forward by the CER and the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation for the construction of a second South-North electricity interconnector.</P>
        <P>Planning for the construction of the interconnector is underway by the transmission system operators and it is estimated that the interconnector will be operational by 2012.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the fully liberalised private sector, regulated by ComReg, the independent Commission for Communications Regulation.</P>
        <P>The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase one of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country, which were built on time and under budget. This programme has been extended to over 90 towns in various locations nationwide including 15 towns in County Cork. Cork is developing projects in respect of the following towns: Bantry, Blarney, Carrigaline, Charleville, Cobh, Dunmanway, Fermoy, Kanturk, Kinsale, Midleton, Mitchelstown, Passage West, Ringaskiddy, Skibbereen and Youghal.</P>
        <P>Design and procurement has already commenced in the Cork region and construction is due to start later this year. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007.

        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully-liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high-speed, open-access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide. Phase one of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country.</P>
        <P>This programme has been extended to over 90 towns in various locations nationwide. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007. These networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>The Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the county and group broadband scheme. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area. To date, over 150 projects have been approved for funding under this programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A joint industry-Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the broadband for schools programme, which will provide every school in the country with broadband by the beginning of 2006. This is a crucial strand in the strategy of integrating ICT into teaching and learning and the Department&rsquo;s wider vision of promoting the use of broadband technologies in local communities around the country. The construction and installation phase is now under way and the project is on target for completion within the set timeframe.</P>
        <P>Broadband subscriber numbers have increased hugely in the last year. Almost 140,000 new broadband subscribers were added in 2005, a growth rate of 103% in 2005. This compares to 100,000 new broadband subscribers in 2004. The latest ComReg quarterly report states there are <Col N="2156"/>270,700 broadband subscribers as of end-2005. This is equivalent to 6.6% of the population. There are also an estimated 0.6 million narrow band users.</P>
        <P>Home Internet penetration figures currently stand at 18.7% of households. DSL dominates the Irish broadband market with a 75% market share. However, FWA and cable are growing strongly, albeit from a small base.</P>
        <P>The official Government target is to have 400,000 subscribers by end-2006, that is, almost 10% of the population or 27% of households. The Minister&rsquo;s challenge to industry is 500,000 broadband subscribers by end-2006, which is about 12% of the population or 34% of households.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>It has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband, so the Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high speed fibre based broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These metropolitan area networks, MANs, are open access fibre based trunk networks that will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs. Some 20 MANs are now completed, including the Wexford town MAN.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department also administers a group broadband scheme which is designed to promote the rollout of broadband access through the establishment of sustainable broadband services in towns, villages, rural hinterlands and under-served areas of larger towns on the basis of local and regional authority co-ordination and community driven initiatives. Under this scheme, broadband projects have been approved for Craanford, Monaseed, Kilanerin, Ballyfad, Ballythomas, Coolgreany, Bridgetown, Kilmore, Kilmore Quay, Ballyhogu, Galbally, Bree, Ramsgrange, Campile, Wellington Bridge, Fethard-on-Sea, Duncannon, Ballyhack, Clongeen, Arthurstown, Ballycullane, Saltmills, New Ross rural, Gorey rural, Courtown, Riverchapel, <Col N="2157"/>Ballygarrett, Ballycanew, Ballymoney, Killenagh, Camolin and Ballyoughter, County Wexford.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.broadband.gov.ie </i>gives full details of broadband availability in all areas, including ADSL, cable, fibre, satellite and fixed wireless. The website also lists prices of the various service levels on offer and contact details for each service provider.</P>

	<P>There is no stipulated quota for the percentage of staff in Government Departments who are required to be able to provide services through Irish. However, my Department does have staff who can provide services through Irish when required. By way of an indication in this regard, the latest figures available show that approximately 8% of the overall staff of my Department are either currently deemed to be proficient in Irish, in accordance with the terms of relevant Department of Finance circulars, or claim proficiency in the spoken language.</P>

	<P>The case to which the Deputy refers relates to five Cuban citizens who were convicted in the US, in 2001, on charges ranging from espionage to first degree murder. A panel of three judges from the 11th circuit court of appeals in Atlanta overturned the 2001 convictions on 9 August 2005 and ordered a retrial based on new evidence.</P>
        <P>The Miami district attorney duly filed an appeal against the decision of the 11th circuit court of appeals. The appeal was heard on 14 February 2006 and the decision is expected shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government, in common with our partners in the European Union, believes that the US economic embargo on Cuba seriously hampers the economic development of Cuba and negatively affects all of its people. EU companies account for at least half of all Cuba&rsquo;s foreign trade. The EU rejects unilateral measures against Cuba, which are contrary to commonly accepted rules of international trade.</P>
        <P>In the United Nations General Assembly, Ireland and our EU partners again voted, on 8 November 2005, in favour of the annual Cuban-tabled resolution entitled Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba.</P>
        <P>The EU&rsquo;s policy on Cuba is as set out in the common position agreed on 2 December 1996, during the then Irish Presidency. The General Affairs and External Relations Council reaffirmed the validity of the 1996 common position on Cuba on 13 June 2005. The Council&rsquo;s conclusions on Cuba, which were also adopted on 13 June 2005, reiterated that constructive engagement remains the basis of the EU&rsquo;s policy with the ultimate aim being to encourage a process of transition to pluralist democracy in Cuba.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the ongoing large-scale violation of human rights in Cuba and the unacceptable attitude of the Cuban government towards some resident EU embassies in Havana are a serious impediment to the further development of relations with Cuba.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 45 departmental staff members are sufficiently fluent in the Irish language to be able to provide services through Irish. This represents about 3% of our staffing complement, leaving aside staff locally recruited by Irish missions.</P>
        <P>The Department is currently in the process of preparing a scheme under the Official Languages Act 2003, which will outline proposals to ensure better availability and a higher standard of services through Irish for our customers. The Department published a notice in the national press in March of this year inviting submissions from interested parties concerning the preparation of the Department&rsquo;s scheme. All submissions received will be considered in the course of preparing the scheme, which is due to be sub<Col N="2159"/>mitted to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs before the end of July next.</P>
        <P>The Department has already taken action to improve the level of service it provides through Irish. An Irish language sub-committee of the Department&rsquo;s partnership committee, the Fochoiste Ghaeilge, has been established to consider the implications for the Department of the Official Languages Act and to develop proposals to meet the challenges posed by the Act concerning the delivery of services in Irish to the public.</P>
        <P>The Department also facilitates the attendance by staff at Irish language classes run by both Gaeleagras and Conradh na Gaeilge, and pays for officers to attend week-long immersion courses in the Gaeltacht that are organised each summer by Gaeleagras.</P>
        <P>Arrangements are also in train to provide lunchtime in-house Irish classes for departmental officers who wish to improve their Irish language skills. It is expected that these initiatives will, over time, lead to an increased level and quality of service provision through Irish for our customers.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s passport offices in Dublin and Cork, and our consular section in Dublin, as well as our press section and a number of our larger missions, including those in London and Washington and the permanent representation to the EU in Brussels, have officers assigned to them who can provide services through Irish.</P>

        <P>Modern technology is used extensively at present in the production of finding aids to the archives and to control the provision of archives to the public. However, it is available for use by the public in only limited ways. It is envisaged the public areas of the new building will take advantage of ongoing technological advances so that technical developments may be fully utilised to the maximum possible extent.</P>

	<P>My Department is carrying out an expenditure review of the local authority swimming pool programme, which is examining, among other things, how it has worked to date, the benefits which have accrued to the areas where pools have been built under the programme and what amendments, if any, are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme. On completion of this review, the question of re-opening the programme will be considered.</P>
        <P>The local authority swimming pool programme provides grant aid to local authorities in respect of the capital costs of a new swimming pool, a replacement pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool. The closing date for receipt of applications under the current round of this programme was 31 July 2000 and since then a total of 57 projects have or are being dealt with. Of the 57 projects within the programme, 18 have been completed and 14 pool projects are now under construction or are about to start construction. In addition, 25 other projects are at various stages in the programme: six at tender stage, 11 at contract document stage and eight at preliminary report stage.</P>

This percentage does not include the staff of the National Archives who form part of my Department but which is designated as a separate public body in the First Schedule to the Official Languages Act 2003.</P>
        <P>The main focus for staff is the provision of verbal services through Irish to telephone callers and personal callers to the Department. While some staff provide services concerning written correspondence and documents in Irish, translation is provided in the main by external translation services.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is one of the early movers under the decentralisation programme and as a result there are ongoing changes in staff in my Department to facilitate the transfer of staff wishing to decentralise to Killarney. The percentage of staff able to provide services through Irish is therefore subject to ongoing change.</P>

	<P>Irish trade with Cuba is marginal and tends to fluctuate considerably. Exports to Cuba in 2005 amounted to &euro;678,000. The principal exports were cork and wood products, and beverages. Imports from Cuba in 2004 amounted to &euro;308,000. The principal imports were fruit and vegetables, tobacco, coffee, tea and cocoa. The table below shows the value of exports and imports between Ireland and Cuba in respect of the years 2001 to 2005.</P>
        <P>There does not appear to be any significant Irish investment in Cuba and there is no Cuban investment in Ireland. Enterprise Ireland is the agency of my Department with responsibility for the development of indigenous industry in Ireland, including trade promotion abroad. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client companies do not regard Cuba as a priority market. Resources are concentrated on markets that show better prospects of development at this stage. Ireland does have an air transport agreement with Cuba.</P>

	<P>The household benefit package of free schemes comprises the electricity and gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence and is available to people living permanently in the State who satisfy specific qualifying criteria. The telephone allowance is applied as a cash credit on recipients&rsquo; telephone bills. The value of the allowance is set at &euro;20.41 per month &mdash;&euro;40.82 per two months &mdash; excluding VAT. Applying the allowance in this way assists the recipient in managing their household budget.</P>
        <P>A survey carried out as part of the review of the free schemes and published in 2000 indicated that the majority of respondents favour retaining the household benefit package of free schemes in preference to a cash payment. The respondents stated that they would not be able to avail of the <Col N="2163"/>services covered by the schemes without the benefit of the household benefit package.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is referring to situations where a new baby is hospitalised for an extended period after birth and implications arising from that situation where entitlement to maternity benefit and maternity leave is of a defined duration. Entitlement to maternity benefit is contingent in the first instance on entitlement to statutory maternity leave. The right to maternity leave is established under maternity protection legislation, which is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>This issue was considered in conjunction with the social partners in the context of a review of maternity protection legislation in 2001. The recommendation was that in the event of hospitalisation of a child, an employee should be able to return to work after a minimum of 14 weeks maternity leave, retaining her entitlement to take the balance of her leave when her baby was discharged from hospital. With effect from October 2004, the legislation was amended to provide for these situations. Where maternity benefit has been in payment for a minimum period of 14 weeks, payment may be postponed where the baby has been hospitalised.</P><Col N="2164"/>
        <P>The legislation requires that an application to postpone payment must be made in writing; that the maximum duration of the postponement of benefit will be six months, and that payment will resume within seven days following written notification of the baby&rsquo;s discharge from hospital. Payment will then resume until the full duration of benefit is completed. Any further amendments to these provisions would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider in the first instance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to equity release products. These and other similar products allow home owners to benefit from some of the capital tied up in their homes, while continuing to live in them. The introduction of these products has implications for social assistance payments where the claimant is aged 65 years or over.</P>
        <P>Social assistance payments are designed to provide financial support for people who do not qualify for one of the contributory pension or benefit schemes. Entitlement to these payments is based on a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those most in need. Accordingly, any resources that a claimant and his or her spouse or partner may have are assessed. These resources may include cash income, property or an asset which could bring in money or provide the claimant with an income.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sums of money raised through equity release schemes are assessable under the Department&rsquo;s capital assessment rules. Under this method the first &euro;20,000 of the capital is disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;1 per &euro;1,000; the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per &euro;1,000 and any sums remaining in excess of &euro;40,000 are assessed at &euro;4 per &euro;1,000. These allowances are doubled in the case of a couple. Sums of money which are spent or disposed of immediately are not included in the means assessment.</P>
        <P>The sale of residence provisions, to which the Deputy also refers, are designed to facilitate certain persons in receipt of a means tested payment from this Department in selling their principal residence for the purpose of buying or renting alternative accommodation; moving into a private nursing home; moving in with a carer in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit in respect <Col N="2165"/>of them or moving to sheltered or special housing in the voluntary, co-operative, statutory or private sectors. The remaining balance of the gross proceeds of the sale of the residence is exempt from the means test, subject to a ceiling of &euro;190,500.</P>
        <P>These provisions apply to recipients of disability allowance, blind person&rsquo;s pension and those over 66 years of age who receive a means tested payment from this Department and are intended to facilitate choice for certain people who might previously have been living alone or in unsuitable accommodation. In contrast, equity release arrangements are designed to provide an income stream for older people and it is considered appropriate that these should be assessed for means test purposes.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>the implications in terms of primary and secondary benefits for a carer pensioner on a contributory old age pension who switches to carer&rsquo;s allowance in view of the fact that the rate of the latter is now higher; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[14089/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The carer&rsquo;s allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who provide certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit. From January this year the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance for a carer over 66 years of age increased from &euro;169.80 to &euro;200 per week. The maximum rate of the old age contributory pension increased to &euro;193.30 per week.</P>
        <P>While the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance is higher than the maximum rate of old age contributory pension, a number of secondary payments can be paid with old age contributory pension which are not paid with carer&rsquo;s allowance. These include qualified adult allowance, living alone allowance and fuel allowance.</P>
        <P>From June 2005, the respite care grant scheme was extended to all carers who provide full-time care to a person who needs such care. This means the grant is now paid to carers who provide full-time care and who are either in receipt of a social welfare payment such as old age contributory pension or carer&rsquo;s allowance or those who do not receive a weekly social welfare payment from the Department.</P>
        <P>Therefore, it may be more advantageous for a person to remain in receipt of old age contributory pension. If a person wishes to have his or her eligibility for carer&rsquo;s allowance assessed under the current rules, he or she should contact carer&rsquo;s allowance section, Government Buildings, Ballinalee Road, Longford. A person who qualifies for two social welfare payments will always receive <Col N="2166"/>the payment which is more advantageous to him or her.</P>

	<P>My Department recognises the rights of customers under the Official Languages Act 2003 to be dealt with in Irish if they so wish and every effort is made to ensure that service through Irish is available and of a very high standard. In line with our responsibilities under the Act, staff of front-line areas have been encouraged and facilitated to attend training courses in Irish language usage. In 2004 and 2005 a total of 235 staff from front-line areas attended training courses which varied from week-long courses in Gaeltacht areas to &ldquo;tailored&rdquo; in-house courses of six days duration. The training programme for my Department for 2006 includes further Irish training courses and it is planned to continue such courses in the future.</P>

	<P>The new rail station in the Docklands will connect to the existing Maynooth line and will allow Irish Rail to run two additional peak services from Maynooth into the station when it becomes operational at the end of 2007. The proposed Clonsilla to Dunboyne line is expected to reopen in 2009 and at that point all services from Dunboyne will also serve the Docklands station.</P>
        <P>The station will not cater for services on the Kildare line. However, the needs of commuters along the Kildare line catchment areas will be addressed through the Kildare route project, involving quadrupling the critical section of track between Cherry Orchard and Hazlehatch. This work will allow separation of long distance and commuter services and thus improve speed and capacity for commuter services as well as for Intercity services.</P>

        <Quest>the basis for his conclusion that the existing number of driver testers plus ten new recruits is sufficient to meet the underlying demand for driving tests, in view of the fact that 130,000 people are on the waiting list and a further 270,000 people hold provisional licences.</Quest>

	<P>In the past, the core of driver testers were in a position to meet the underlying demand for tests within a ten week waiting time. The present backlog of more than 130,000 tests is due to a period of exceptional demand in 2003. However, the underlying level of demand has returned to its pre-2003 level. While the number of testers can deal with the number of applications coming in they cannot deal with the backlog. That is why I brought forward proposals to address the backlog.</P>

	<P>Prior to obtaining a passenger licence from my Department, an applicant must first obtain a public service vehicle licence from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda must be satisfied that the character and previous conduct of the applicant are such that the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold a licence; the vehicle is safe for the carriage of passengers and complies with roadworthiness regulations under the Road Traffic Acts and the use of the vehicle as a public service vehicle is covered by insurance.</P>
        <P>My Department issues three categories of passenger licence, and the details and cost of each are set out in the 1932 Act. An annual continuous licence operates every week of the year and the fee is &euro;7.62. An annual seasonal licence operates for the season to which it relates, such as that applying to a tour or college, and the fee is &euro;5.08. An occasional passenger licence operates for a specific event and expires once the event, such as a concert or race week, finishes. The fee is &euro;0.63 for one event or &euro;5.08 for more than one event such as a race week. These fees will be revised as part of the reform of the 1932 Act.</P>
        <P>From 1 January 2005 to date, my Department issued 161 licences to private bus operators, the breakdown being 28 annual continuous licences, 56 annual seasonal licences and 77 occasional licences. These licences are granted under the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932. Proposals to provide for the replacement of that Act with a modern legislative code, which will result in the development of a new regulatory framework governing public transport generally, are being advanced in my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 283 to 285, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="2176"/>
        <P>The definition of peat soils used by my Department is taken from the Peatlands of Ireland, Soil Survey Bulletin by R.F. Hammond, 1979. It constitutes a peat layer greater than 30 cm on drained peats and greater than 45 cm on undrained peats.</P>
        <P>Based on research and the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, an emission factor of 14.66 tonnes of carbon dioxide, per ha., per year for the first four years following afforestation is applied to peat soils. This amount is deducted from the carbon dioxide uptake by the growing forest.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance, soil emissions are not applied to forest land which is harvested. The estimated areas of peat soils afforested each year from 1990 to 2004, and projected over the period 2005-12, used as the basis for calculating carbon sequestration over the period 2008-12, the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, and supplied in connection with Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol are set out in the following table.</P>

        <P FLI="0">My Department&rsquo;s analysis shows a downward trend for planting on peat soils over the period 1990 to 2003 from 56.7% to 29.9%. The figures supplied for 2005 to 2012 were estimates, with the area of peat soils afforested fixed at 29.9% rep<Col N="2177"/>resenting a no-change scenario. In reality, it is expected that the downward trend will continue and the above figures will be adjusted in the light of information from the planting programme, the national forest inventory and research.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>As regards my policy on the afforestation of peat lands, my Department has very strict procedures in place. These procedures effectively rule out grant aid for planting on intact raised bogs of the midlands, or the impoverished, oligotrophic deep blanket peats of the west.</P>

Subsequent to the reply to the previous parliamentary question to which the Deputy refers, further issues arose, which required to be satisfactorily resolved before the application could be processed to a conclusion. The issues related to the conversion of the special condition entitlements to standard entitlements. Special condition entitlements were established where applicants under the livestock premia schemes during the reference period were not obliged to submit an area aid application. As advised in the terms and conditions of the scheme, farmers who were allocated special condition entitlements could convert these to standard entitlements by farming and declaring a sufficient number of hectares in 2005.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 204 alleged cases of illegal felling have been reported to the forest service in the three years 2003 to 2005 inclusive. Within the same period, a total of 14 cases were found to warrant prosecution. Of these, seven have been successfully prosecuted to date and a further six cases are awaiting hearing through the courts. Proceedings in three more cases are being considered. In only one instance in the last three years has my Department failed to secure a successful prosecution, where the District Court dismissed the case on its merits. Overall, I believe the rate of successful prosecutions achieved is satisfactory.</P>
        <P>My Department views the illegal felling of trees with the deepest concern and investigates every case that is reported to it. Where prosecution is considered feasible, my Department actively pursues all such cases. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that the Department can pursue prosecution of offenders through the courts only where the facts of the case and legal advice support such action. In many cases the allegations are either not substantiated, following investigation by the forestry inspectors, or, there has been no breach of the provisions of the Forestry Act 1946. To illustrate the latter point, in nearly one fifth of the 204 reported cases of illegal felling, it was found that a notice to fell trees was not required because of the provisions of Article 37(4) of the Forestry Act 1946. This provision of the Act excludes specified felling events from the notification requirement.</P>
        <P>The felling section of the forest service comprises five administrative staff, whose duties include the processing of reports of alleged illegal felling.</P>

	<P>My Department pays an annual grant to the Irish Countrywomen&rsquo;s Association, ICA, and at the request of the ICA, it also pays a grant to Country Markets towards the cost of a full-time organiser to help members in rural areas develop co-operative markets for the sale of garden, farm and home produce. The grant assistance for 2005 for Country Markets was &euro;4,200 and &euro;10,200 for the ICA. Those grants were paid in May 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For 2006, the grant paid will be &euro;4,500 for Country Markets and &euro;10,500 for the ICA and my Department has written to the association outlining other possible sources of public funding including the Leader programme, which funds local development projects and the support programme for community development groups operated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P>Guidelines concerning food hygiene are set out by Country Markets Ltd., and suppliers are subject to periodic inspections from Country Market officials. Country Markets Ltd., the National Standards Authority of Ireland and regulatory authorities have worked very closely to produce a guide to good hygiene practice, IS 344: 2002. This guide is primarily for use by domestic producers who prepare or produce food for sale in country markets.</P>
        <P>The EU regulations to which the Deputy refers, are the new food safety measures, known as the hygiene package, which came into force on 1 January 2006. The main purpose of these regulations is to clearly define the responsibilities of all operators in the food chain to ensure maximum food safety for consumers. The new regulations are not intended to stifle trade but the importance of food safety cannot be compromised. If any operator has difficulty with the detail of any regulation or the measures being <Col N="2181"/>used for its implementation, this can be discussed as appropriate with my Department or with the other agencies involved in food safety controls such as the Food Safety Authority or the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The numbers of food markets in Ireland is increasing. Since February 2005, the number of markets has increased by 25% which suggests that the development of these markets is not being unduly affected by EU regulations.</P>
        <P>In addition to country markets, several farmers&rsquo; markets operate in Ireland. The most recent listing provided by Bord Bia shows that there are 100 such markets on the island of Ireland. Farmers&rsquo; markets differ slightly from country markets in that they are usually outdoors and sell different product range from the offering at country markets. Farmers&rsquo; markets generally feature a country market stand which is staffed by representatives from the Country Markets organisation.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia has a dedicated person in its small business department to advise and assist producers and start-up companies who wish to utilise such markets from a sales, marketing, product development and consumer perspective.</P>

        <Quest>the measures she plans to sub<Col N="2182"/>mit to the European Commission as a result of its proposal to co-finance 50% of the cost of market support measures in the egg and poultry sector; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the EU proposal is expected to be adopted by the end of April; if she would agree that the egg and poultry sector is currently experiencing adverse marketing conditions and urgently requires support measures; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The position in regard to market support measures for the poultry sector is that the EU Commission has proposed a Council regulation that would provide a legal basis for such measures. This proposal will be considered by the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 25 April 2006. If adopted, the regulation will only contain an enabling provision of a general nature. It will then be necessary for the Commission to draw up a subsidiary regulation which would set out the types of measures that member states could propose to be brought into effect. This latter regulation cannot be adopted until after the Council meeting. Following adoption of this subsidiary regulation it will be necessary for member states, if they so wish, to submit proposals for support schemes to the Commission for consideration and approval.</P>
        <P>I have already written to the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Mariann Fisher Boel, outlining some of the measures I consider would be useful to have available to member states. The Commission will also be considering suggestions put forward by member states with a view to drafting the subsidiary regulation referred to above and I will be putting forward suggestions in this context also. The Commission has made it clear that its request for suggestions must not be interpreted as a commitment to co-funding. The Commission must have regard to budgetary considerations and to the importance of not creating imbalances in competitiveness between member states.</P>
        <P>I am interested in having a broad-ranging regulation that would accommodate various market options that exist or might emerge in the future and that would be sufficiently versatile to be useful to all member states. Useful measures would include aids to private storage, purchase for disposal of non-saleable stocks of poultry meat and measures to encourage reductions in throughput.</P>
        <P>What measures, if any, would actually be utilised in different countries would depend on the market situation and prospects at the time, the evolution of the avian influenza situation and the segments of the industry that were affected by the situation. This will also be the case in Ireland. The poultry industry generally is experiencing difficulties and the need for support measures is under continuous review in my Department in the context of the evolving situation here and the developments at EU level as already set out.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Internet is an international and world-wide phenomenon. It has no borders and no single organisation controls it. Measures to combat illegal materials and activities on the Internet are therefore hampered by a multiplicity of jurisdictions, differing legal systems, and differing societal norms. Furthermore, new developments in communications technologies allowing for Internet access by new means are a regular occurrence. These are largely positive developments but also bring particular challenges for those charged with protecting against its downsides. Combating illegal, harmful and predatory use of the Internet requires responses at national, EU and international levels. Ireland is fully committed to playing its part, at home and internationally, to both detect and prevent child pornography. Ireland&rsquo;s Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 is acknowledged as one of the most robust pieces of legislation anywhere. In terms of enforcement in Ireland as well as in most jurisdictions, what is illegal off-line is considered illegal on-line.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to the investigation of all cases of child pornography and the importance of investigating the child protection issues involved in such cases. The paedophile investigation unit, which is located within the domestic violence and sexual assault unit of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, is in existence since November 2002. This unit is tasked with the investigation and co-ordination of cases relating to the possession, production and distribution of child pornography, and any alleged sexual abuse pertaining to it.</P><Col N="2184"/>
        <P>On the structural side, a system of self-regulation by the Internet service provider industry is in place, the components of which include an Internet Advisory Board which promotes awareness of Internet downside issues and monitors the progress of self-regulation by the Internet service provider industry; a public hotline for reporting child pornography; and an industry code of practice and ethics setting out the duties and responsibilities of each Internet service provider.</P>
        <P>The Internet Advisory Board was established in February 2000. As well as overseeing a self-regulatory regime for the Irish Internet service providers, it encourages best practice procedures, provides advice and facilitates research in Internet-related issues, including child safety. My Department provides secretarial and other supports for the board&rsquo;s work.</P>
        <P>The hotline, <i>www.hotline.ie</i>, funded by the Internet Service Providers&rsquo; Association of Ireland with support from the EU Safer Internet Action Plan, was launched in November 1999. It accepts and investigates reports from the public in respect of child pornography and other illegal material on the Internet. Special protocols operate between the garda&iacute; and the hotline which maximise co-operation on law enforcement issues so that offences in the area of child pornography can be detected and prosecuted.</P>
        <P>The hotline works closely with and is a founding member of the international INHOPE Association, <i>www.inhope.org</i>, a network of European hotlines which is expanding to all parts of the world. The INHOPE Association develops procedures and shares information on the best practices for the tracing and tracking of illegal child pornography.</P>
        <P>The self-regulatory approach to Internet regulation is the norm at EU level and worldwide. The Internet Advisory Board helps and supports the Irish Internet service provider industry to deliver an effective self-regulation environment, in accordance with a code of practice and ethics for the industry agreed with the board in February 2002. The Irish code of practice and ethics is recognised throughout Europe as a model of its type.</P>
        <P>The European Union has taken a strong line on combating child pornography and other illegal and harmful uses of the Internet. Since 1999, under the Safer Internet Action Plan, the EU has provided financial and other supports for measures in the member states to combat illegal and harmful uses of the Internet, with particular emphasis on protecting children. A new EU action plan, Safer Internet Plus, which covers the period 2005 to 2008 and has a budget of &euro;45 million, was agreed under the Irish Presidency in June 2004 and is now in operation. My Department is represented on the management committee for the programme.</P>
        <P>The EU Council adopted a Framework Decision on Combating the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornography on 22 <Col N="2185"/>December 2003. While the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 is a particularly robust legislative measure, my Department is preparing additional legislative provisions to ensure compliance with this framework decision.</P>
        <P>In September 2001, the Council of Europe Ministers&rsquo; Deputies approved the first international Convention on Cybercrime. The main objective of the convention is to foster international co-operation in protecting society against cybercrime. The convention deals specifically with the distribution of child pornography on the Internet, infringements of copyright, computer-related fraud and violations of network security. Ireland signed up to the convention in June 2002.</P>

        <P>In addition, I would point out to the Deputy that the division&rsquo;s resources are further augmented by a number of Garda national units such as the Garda national immigration bureau, the criminal assets bureau and other specialised units.</P><Col N="2187"/>
        <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel throughout and within divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas. The allocation of such resources is determined by a number of factors including demographics, administrative functions, crime trends and other operational policing needs.</P>
        <P>The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P>As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources and in this context, the needs of the Clare division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda personnel strength of the information technology division in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, covering all ranks, is 66. In addition, <Col N="2188"/>there are 30 civil servants attached to the information technology division. I wish to point out to the Deputy that significant progress has been made on the implementation of the civilianisation programme approved by Government in 2001. A total of 113 civilian finance officers have been appointed and are carrying out the district finance officer duties which were hitherto performed by garda&iacute;. Moreover, the recent establishment of the Garda information service centre, GISC, in Castlebar, manned by civilian staff, and the pending transfer of civilian staff from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as civil servants of the State, are significant developments in the context of greater Garda civilianisation.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the GISC alone will, when fully operational, allow for the equivalent of up to 300 garda&iacute; to be freed up for frontline outdoor policing duties on a daily basis. A further review of civilianisation possibilities in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now under way with a view to securing many more redeployments of desk-bound garda&iacute; to frontline operational duties over the next four years.</P>

	<P>The Garda finance director, who is a qualified accountant, has responsibility for overseeing and implementing finance and procurement-related policy, structures and processes for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. There are 43 personnel in the finance directorate, of which 20 are members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and 23 are civilian staff. In addition, payroll duties for the Garda Vote are also provided by my Department&rsquo;s financial shared service centre.</P>
        <P>With the devolution of budgetary responsibility within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, all assistant commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents have a finance-related role at regional-branch, divisional and district level. At district level, all district officers-superintendents are responsible for notifying payroll transactions regarding payment of certain allowances, deductions from pay and redirection of pay regarding members assigned to their districts.</P>
        <P>There is sanction for 120 civilian finance officers, of which 112 are currently in place. Staff appointed to district offices have responsibility for the processing and administration of payroll and finance-related issues at district level. However, the duties of finance officers are not confined exclusively to finance matters as they are required to undertake a range of other duties, as assigned by the district officer-superintendent.</P><Col N="2189"/>
        <P>As finance matters are not totally mutually exclusive of all other functions conducted at regional-branch, divisional and district level, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the number of garda&iacute; and civilian staff in dealing with such matters. I wish to point out to the Deputy that significant progress has been made on the implementation of the civilianisation programme approved by Government in 2001. The recent establishment of the Garda Information Service Centre, GISC, in Castlebar, manned by civilian staff, and the pending transfer of civilian staff from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as civil servants of the State are significant developments in the context of greater Garda civilianisation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is currently no statutory entitlement to paternity leave. However, many employers in both the public and private sectors have arrangements in place providing short periods of paid paternity leave. Paternity leave was considered in the context of a review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 conducted by a working group chaired by my Department. The working group comprised the social partners, relevant Government Departments and the Equality Authority. The report of the working group on the review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 was published on 29 April 2002.</P>
        <P>Paternity leave was considered by the working group, taking into account the following issues: reconciliation of work and family life and balanced participation of men and women in work and family life; the cost to employers; and the comparative situation in EU member states. While acknowledging that a statutory arrangement to provide an entitlement to time off for fathers at the time of childbirth would enhance arrangements for the reconciliation of work and family life, the working group could not reach consensus on the issue. Subsequently, no agreement was reached on paternity leave by the social partners in the context of the negotiations on the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement.</P>

        <P>In response to Question No. 173 on 23 March 2006, I gave the Deputy a broad overview of the naturalisation process. I explained that, as part of that process, inquiries are made with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assist in determining if an applicant can be considered to be of good character. For example, if the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na report to me that any applicant is engaged in any criminal activity, which calls into question whether he or she is a suitable candidate to be naturalised, I will obviously give serious consideration to it when I am deciding on the particular application. Factors such as the nature of the activity, when it occurred and if it resulted in criminal proceedings and a conviction will be taken into account. Statistical information is not maintained in such a way that would identify the basis for the granting or refusal of applications for naturalisation.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women, NSC, was set up in 1997 to provide co-ordinated actions by the many statutory and voluntary bodies involved in responding to the problem of violence against women. My Department, in conjunction with the NSC, has conducted a series of successful awareness raising campaigns dealing with various aspects of this issue in recent years. The NSC is currently developing a strategic plan for its work over the next five to ten years, which will include the development of a long-term and wide ranging strategy for raising public awareness of the issue of violence against women. The strategic plan should be completed this year and will be widely circulated. This plan is expected to address the information and awareness needs of relevant public officials and health professionals in partnership with the training and education arrangements already in place for the groups in question.</P>
        <P>In the case of the Judiciary, which is independent in the exercise of its functions under the law and the Constitution, the Deputy should note that the provision of training and education is a matter for the Judicial Studies Institute established in 1996 for this purpose. My role in this regard is to support any programmes put in place by the institute through funding made available in the courts Vote, which is administered by the Courts Service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 330, 334, 343, 344 and 345 together.</P>
        <P>The Garda central vetting unit, GCVU, was established in 2002 and currently processes vetting requests in respect of, <i>inter alia</i>, prospective full-time employees of the Health Service Executive and certain agencies funded by the Health Service Executive as well as in respect of selected employments in other sectors.</P>
        <P>In 2004, an inter-agency working group on Garda vetting reported with a clear and focused strategy for enhancing national vetting arrangements. The strategy provides for an expansion of the GCVU&rsquo;s vetting service to all organisations that recruit persons having substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults. The implementation of the strategy is being overseen by an implementation group on Garda vetting comprising key stakeholders. The GCVU has been successfully decentralised to new, custom designed office accommodation in Thurles, County Tipperary. Since its decentralisation in November 2005, new liaison mechanisms have <Col N="2200"/>been successfully implemented in the Health Service Executive and are now being extended to all organisations previously registered for vetting. Significant changes have been made in the work processes of the unit in order to streamline the processing of vetting applications, and these have resulted in an improved service being provided.</P>
        <P>An additional 17 staff have been sanctioned for the GCVU to more than double its numbers from 13 to 30. As at 5 April 2006, the personnel strength of the GCVU is one Garda inspector, one Garda sergeant, one Civil Service staff officer and 23 Civil Service clerical officers. These numbers include staff of a newly established sub-unit, namely, the data protection processing unit, to process personal data access requests pursuant to the Data Protection Acts 1988-2003.</P>
        <P>The expansion of the Garda vetting service to new organisations and sectors will occur by means of a phased roll out to an increasing number of organisations in the child care and vulnerable adult care sector, including to child care workers in F&Aacute;S programmes. To this end, a phased expansion plan within current resource capacities has been prepared and accepted by the implementation group on Garda vetting. This has resulted in an increase in the number of Health Service Executive personnel being vetted in the first quarter in 2006, as well as vetting being introduced for the Private Security Authority. A number of organisations from the voluntary sector are currently being identified for vetting services.</P>
        <P>The expansion of the vetting service being provided by the GCVU is proceeding in a planned and structured manner in consultation with Departments responsible for child care. This expansion will continue until vetting is provided for all personnel working in a full-time, part-time or voluntary capacity with children or vulnerable adults. The vetting of persons whose country of origin is other than Ireland or who provide an address outside Ireland is dependent upon the timely co-operation of the relevant non-national authorities. Every effort is made by the GCVU to obtain this information.</P>
        <P>The GCVU is currently in receipt of approximately 2,250 valid requests for vetting per week. In addition, the unit receives approximately 250 applications per week that must be returned to the sender for further attention before processing can proceed. At any given time there are approximately 10,000 vetting applications on hand within the GCVU. These applications are currently being processed to a conclusion within approximately four weeks from the date of receipt of a valid application.</P>
        <P>For certain categories of person dealing with non-national authorities, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides a record of criminal convictions in the form of a police certificate. Specifically, police certificates may be obtained in respect of applicants seeking non-national visas, including those <Col N="2201"/>seeking non-national residence, to establish or register businesses in other member states of the European Union and non-national consular services, including those seeking non-national adoptions. Applications for police certificates may be made to the Garda superintendent in charge of the Garda district where the applicant normally resides or where the applicant normally resided in respect of persons now living abroad. Police certificates are not provided for child care clearance, as the latter is only available from the GCVU.</P>

	<P>The information required by the Deputy, in so far as the dates of appointment of members and the remuneration paid to each of them in each of the years since their appointment, is set out in tabular form. RAT members are appointed for a term of three years which is renewable.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is a statutory independent body established under the Refugee Act 1996 in order to deal with appeals against negative recommendations in respect of applications for refugee status issued by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC. The tribunal has been in operation since November 2000 and is comprised of a full-time chairperson and 33 part-time members. The tribunal has undertaken a significant job of work since its establishment, taking some 23,107 decisions up to the end of 2005. It has also been tackling on an ongoing basis the number of appeals on hand and moving from a situation where on 31 January 2004, it had some 2,596 appeals to clear &mdash; some 990 of which were six months old &mdash; to a situation at the end of February 2006 where it had 1,417 appeals on hand, 392 of which were over six months old.</P>
        <P>In line with the general downward trend in asylum applications from, for example, 11,634 in 2002 to 4,323 in 2005, the cost of the operation of the tribunal can also be expected to continue to fall. This will allow the continued redeployment of resources from the asylum process to support the capacity of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, to enhance service provision in the area of immigration &mdash; visas, citizenship, etc. &mdash; as well as increasing the number of persons found not to have a protection need being returned to their country of origin. </P><Col N="2201"/>

	<P>The Garda Commissioner is fully aware that I will continue to provide the necessary resources to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as requested by him, to enable them to carry out their duties in relation to our traffic laws.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are three types of breathalysers in use by that Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na &mdash; the blow-in-the-bag alcolyser and the alcometer, both of which are used for roadside breath testing, and the intoxilyser, which is installed in a number of Garda stations. The alcolyser and alcometer test for the presence of alcohol in the breath. The intoxilyser evidential breath testing instrument tests the driver&rsquo;s <Col N="2206"/>breath for the level of alcohol and eliminates the need for a doctor to take a blood or urine sample. Currently, there are 390 alcometers on issue to members in Garda district headquarters as well as the blow-in-the-bag type that are on issue in every Garda station. The breakdown of alcometers per Garda district is as set out in tabular form.</P>

        <P FLI="0">With regard to increased resources for the Garda traffic corps, as a result of the Government&rsquo;s approval of my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, the Garda Commissioner will be in a position, as each cycle of recruit training is completed, to assign additional new members to the areas of greatest need with particular regard to certain priorities. An assistant commissioner, Mr. Eddie Rock, was appointed on 22 February 2005 to head up the corps. Between now and 2008, the traffic corps <Col N="2211"/>will increase its numbers to a complement of 1,200 on the following phased basis: 2006 &mdash; 805; 2007 &mdash; 1,030; and 2008 &mdash; 1,200.</P>
        <P>It is intended that by the end of the first quarter of 2006 the numbers in the traffic corps will have increased by 60 and thereafter increased by a further 60 each quarter to reach a total complement of 805 at the end of 2006. The new members will be assigned to divisions which have been established, as a result of close analysis and evaluation of road safety issues, to be in most need of additional resources to pursue enforcement strategies.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am glad to see the reduction in number of garda&iacute; assigned to the Carriage Office as this means more officers are assigned to front line duties. I am anxious that this trend continues across the remit of the force. Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength, all ranks, of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as at 31 December 1997 and 20 March 2006 was 10,702 and 12,445, respectively. This represents an increase of 1,743, or 16.3%, in the personnel strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during that period.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as <Col N="2213"/>when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P>As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006. The Garda Commissioner will draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources and in this context the needs of the Carriage Office will be fully considered.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the <Col N="2214"/>Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that student probationer garda&iacute; receive the following training on drink driving procedure. During phase I, student garda&iacute; attend a classroom- based lecture on the legislation in respect of drink driving. The lecture covers the various offences under the Road Traffic Acts and the powers of arrest available to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in these circumstances. The time allocated to the delivery of this lecture to the students is four hours. The lecture also covers roadside procedure and station procedure regarding drink driving offences.</P>
        <P>During phase II, student garda&iacute; receive the following training with regard to drink driving offences: a two hour class presentation on drink driving procedure; two weeks attachment to traffic units, during which they undergo deep experiential learning and observation of drink driving cases; and a one week attachment to the local District Court or court procedures office, where prosecution of drink driving cases may be observed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During phase III, student garda&iacute; attend a further classroom-based lecture, with specific reference to a number of High Court and Supreme Court stated cases, on the legislation in relation to drink driving. This lecture focuses on the necessary proofs which must be established in court by garda&iacute; prosecuting drink driving offences. The time allocated to the delivery of this lecture to the students is one hour.</P>
        <P>A mock prosecution of a drink driving offence also forms part of the phase III individual case studies. A certain number of student garda&iacute; are required to role-play the prosecution of their case in this mock court setting. Good clear evidence and the necessary proofs are required by the &ldquo;prosecuting&rdquo; student garda&iacute;, who are &ldquo;cross examined&rdquo; by college staff. The students&rsquo; class colleagues also witness the prosecution and take part in an evaluation after the mock court. Students also attend a two hour training class on the Lion Intoxilyzer 6000 Irl. This class covers the workings of the intoxilyzer, the duties and responsibilities of trained operators and also refers to particular High Court and Supreme Court stated cases.</P>
        <P>During phase V, student garda&iacute; attend a further three hours of classroom-based lectures on drink driving legislation and necessary proofs which must be established in court by Garda&iacute; prosecuting drink driving offences. As part of the continuous professional development core programme for 2006, training in the use of evidential breath testing is provided.</P>
        <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the use of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as prosecutors in the case of drink driving convictions in all Garda divisions other than the Dublin metropolitan region has benefits for the oper<Col N="2215"/>ation and management of prosecutions. Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who must present the prosecution case in open court and who have to face the rigour of court procedures, judicial supervision and criticism are likely to be diligent in assembling and assessing evidence. In cases where senior Garda officers prosecute, the normal managerial supervision of performance is strengthened when the manager, in his role as prosecutor, must be comprehensively briefed by the investigating garda.</P>
        <P>I am also advised that it has been the tradition, because of demands made in the Dublin metropolitan region, to request the assistance of the chief prosecution solicitor in the prosecution of offences before the Dublin District Courts.</P>

Among the provisions of the new scheme will be an audit to identify the members of staff who wish to be involved in offering services through Irish.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that a previous skills survey completed in 2004 identified 67 staff who claimed a degree of proficiency in Irish. The audit which is due to be carried out later this year will identify staff who are interested in providing services through Irish. The Department will then address any training needs identified. It is then proposed that all staff, including switchboard and reception staff, in my Department and associated bodies will have access to a list of officers who will be able to provide services in Irish. In addition, language awareness will be included in induction and customer service training for both new and existing staff.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the proposed new scheme for my Department will further ensure the highest possible level of provision of services through Irish to those customers wishing to avail of such a service.</P>

	<P>The application form for the assistant chief officer stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Candidates will be required to reach a minimum standard on each test in order to be considered for Stage Two of the process. Candidates will be placed in order of merit and a number will go forward to Stage Two of the process. Because of the significant number of Officers eligible to apply, prior to the commencement of Stage I of the competition, the numbers going forward to Stage II (the Interview) will be agreed following discussions with the Irish Prison Service and the Prison Officers Association. An Officer reaching the minimum standard is not automatically entitled to proceed to an interview.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There was a predetermined criteria set by the firm of occupational psychologists as to what constituted the minimum standard. An agreement was reached with the Prison Officers Association that the first 150 candidates who had reached the minimum standard would be called for interview.</P>
        <P>On 6 December 2005, 310 prison officers were scheduled to sit a competency based exam as part 1 of the promotion process to assistant chief officer. The design and preparation of the exam was outsourced to a firm of occupational psychologists which supervised the running of the exam and marked the exam papers.</P>
        <P>There were two sessions held in two centres, that is, Dublin City University, DCU, and the Irish Prison Service training centre at Beladd, Portlaoise. Two parallel versions of the same test were used in each location, that is, different versions of the same test. The morning session proceeded without incident. However, the afternoon session for those 143 candidates sitting the second parallel version of the papers was aborted as two typing errors were identified in paper 2. The errors did not affect the correct answer, but apparently caused some anxiety among those sitting the exam at DCU. Those officers in the Portlaoise centre completed the test without drawing the attention of the invigilators to the errors on the exam. The invigilators took a unilateral decision to abort the test in DCU and contacted their counterparts in Beladd requesting them to do the same.</P>
        <P>In response to this development the Irish Prison Service, in consultation with the firm of occupational psychologists involved, arranged for staff who had attended the afternoon session on 6 December 2005 to re-sit the exam papers 2 and 3 on Friday, 3 February 2006. Officers in Beladd were asked to re-sit paper 2 as it was thought that although the errors were not brought to anyone&rsquo;s attention there they may have caused some difficulty in completing the test.</P>
        <P>The interviews will commence on 10 April 2006. While agreement was reached that those <Col N="2219"/>rated in the top 150 will be called for interview, a number of candidates tied on the same mark for 150th place and as result a total of 161 candidates will therefore be called for interview.</P>
        <P>All candidates provided their responses on computer readable sheets which were scanned and checked by a third party company. The results were sent back to the firm of occupational psychologists who compiled the final order of merit.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s 2005 third level student maintenance grant schemes the position is that, generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the prescribed conditions with regard to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. A mature student is defined for the purposes of the schemes as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.</P>
        <P>Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents or guardians. An independent mature student is defined as meaning a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents or guardians from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents&rsquo; or guardians&rsquo; income or address.</P>
        <P>When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the means test provision of the scheme specifies that the students&rsquo; means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student. It is not proposed, at present, to change the current definition of mature students.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 356 and 401 to 403, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann is responsible for the day to day operation of the school transport service on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>Over 135,000 children are carried on school transport services each day to primary and post-primary schools including approximately 8,000 children with special educational needs. The cost of transporting children with special educational needs, including grants, now accounts for about 33% of the overall allocation for school transport. The allocation for school transport in 2006 is &euro;152 million.</P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann endeavours to provide the best possible transport service for children with special needs. The size of vehicle required is determined by the number of special needs pupils requiring the service and the suitability of the vehicle to meet the requirements of the pupil. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not always possible to facilitate a child, by virtue of his or her special needs, on a regular school transport service. Furthermore, many children with special needs travel long distances from home to school and individual school transport, such as a taxi <Col N="2221"/>service, may be deemed to be the most suitable and appropriate mode of transport.</P>
        <P>In the education sector, vetting is available in respect of prospective employees of children in detention schools, as well as special needs assistants and bus escorts accompanying children with special needs. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced a doubling of the number of staff employed in the Garda central vetting unit, which has been relocated to Thurles under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, to ensure that it can handle a greater volume of requests from employers. The provision of additional staff resources will enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults. This will include teachers, caretakers, bus drivers and others working with children, whether on a full-time or part-time basis.</P>
        <P>My Department allocates funding to schools to enable them to employ escorts on school transport services. These escorts are specifically engaged by the schools to cater for children with special educational needs whose care requirements are such as to necessitate continuous support. These escorts are a valuable service for children with special needs who require assistance.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>the amount of public money which was spent on legal cases challenging families of children with disabilities in 2005 and 2006; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that my Department does not expend public funds in a process of challenging through the legal process the parents of children with disabilities. However, where the parents of children with special educational needs initiate litigation proceedings against the State in which my Department is a named party, every effort is made to resolve matters without the proceedings in question progressing to an advanced stage. In this regard, I wish to assure the Deputy that I am always conscious of my duty to ensure that funds allocated to my Department are effectively applied for the purposes intended in an economical and efficient manner.</P>
        <P>I wish to emphasise that legal costs incurred by the State in defending those cases which are brought to court are not met directly by my Department. In accordance with financial procedures in cases involving damages or compensation against the State, costs are generally <Col N="2222"/>charged to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office Vote as sanctioned by the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>My Department meets the legal costs of plaintiffs where there is a settlement or an order for costs against the State where my Department is named. The Department has spent the following amounts in 2005 and this year to date in special needs cases in which the Minister for Education and Science is a defendant, respondent or notice party. In 2005, a sum of &euro;1,600,009.11 was spent while a total of &euro;16,736.51 has been spent in 2006.</P>
        <P>There has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs. At primary level, approximately 5,000 teachers in our primary schools now work directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At second level, approximately 1,647 whole-time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to approximately 200 teachers who were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 532 whole-time equivalent learning support teachers.</P>
        <P>Enormous progress has also been made regarding increasing the number of special needs assistants, SNAs, in our schools who specifically cater for the care needs of children with special educational needs. There are over 7,300 whole-time equivalent SNAs in primary and second level schools supporting children with special needs.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department spends over &euro;30 million on school transport and over &euro;3 million towards specialised equipment and materials for pupils with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education and the education partners, ensure that all children with special educational needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P>

	<P>As outlined previously to the Deputy, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through the special education needs organiser, SENO, sanctioned a third pre-school <Col N="2223"/>or early intervention class for children with autistic spectrum disorders to the school concerned on 21 March 2006 to facilitate the enrolment of specific named pupils pending further investigation into appropriate education provision for these pupils. An additional teaching post was sanctioned on a temporary basis until the end of the current school year to support this class.</P>
        <P>In addition, the SENO sanctioned 11 part-time special needs assistants, SNAs, on 21 March 2006 to cater for the individual care needs of the children attending the pre-school or early intervention special classes. There are now 18 part-time SNAs sanctioned to the school to cater for the children attending these pre-school or early intervention special classes.</P>
        <P>I wish to also advise the Deputy that the two original temporary pre-school or early intervention teaching posts sanctioned by my Department to the school previously have now been sanctioned as posts of indefinite duration, formerly known as permanent posts, for as long as there are sufficient appropriately referred children to warrant these special classes.</P>
        <P>The need for the continuance of the third pre-school or early intervention class is being considered by the NCSE. Factors such as the needs of the individual children, levels of existing provision in the area and geographical location of the attendees are matters that the NCSE will need to take into account in making a decision on the matter.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education for children with autism and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education, ensure that all children with special needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P>

        <P>I understand that the child in question is currently accessing education provision through placement in a pre-school early intervention autism specific class in Scoil Mhuire national school, Ballyboden, Dublin 16. As the Deputy is aware, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is now operational. A specific function of the NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is to identify appropriate educational placements for all children with special educational needs, including children with autism. The SENO is a focal point of contact for parents and schools. My officials have liaised with the local SENO in the context of the child referred to by the Deputy. The parents of the child in question should make contact with the relevant SENO who can assist in accessing an appropriate educational placement for the child. Contact with the relevant SENO can be made by contacting the NCSE at 046-9486400 or alternatively by accessing the NCSE website at <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that Irish sign language, ISL, has formal recognition in the Education Act 1998. Under the Act, it is a function of the Minister for Education and Science to ensure, subject to the provisions of the Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person. This includes provision for students learning through ISL.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of initiatives which seek to promote, develop and implement ISL to ensure it will achieve greater recognition and use in the education system are currently in place. These include the following. The special schools for the deaf in Cabra, Dublin, have been encouraged to the use of sign language in class. In-service training is provided in the use of ISL. My Department has provided funding for an ISL weekly home tuition service whereby deaf tutors visit the homes of deaf pre-school children and deaf school-going pupils to provide training in ISL for the deaf children-pupils, their siblings and parents. My Department has sanctioned a pre-school for deaf children on a pilot basis. Programmes are delivered through the medium of ISL as a first language. My Department, through the Higher Education Authority, HEA, has established and fully funds a centre for deaf studies in Trinity College, Dublin, which provides diploma courses for ISL-English interpreters, for deaf tutors and in deaf studies.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 368 and 369 together.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal to the Secretary General of my Department where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses to enrol a student, suspends a student for more than 20 days in an academic year or expels a student from the school. Appeals must be dealt with within 30 days of receipt but an appeals committee may seek an extension of not more than 14 days.</P>
        <P>Appeals are processed under detailed procedures in three stages. The first stage, local resolution, lasting seven days, allows time for a local resolution to emerge. The second stage, facilitation, involves the appointment of an independent facilitator. The facilitator seeks to resolve the issue underlying the appeal to the satisfaction of both parties. Appeals which are not resolved at the local or facilitation stages progress to the third stage, appeal hearing, a full hearing before an appeal committee. An appeals committee consists of three people, one of whom is a departmental inspector. The committee members are drawn form a panel of experienced educationalists many of whom are ex-school principals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When an appeal has been determined, the appeals committee must set out its decision, its reasons for the decision and, where an appeal has been upheld, any recommendations to the Secretary General as to the actions to be taken to remedy the matter. If an appeal is upheld, the Secretary General may then give directions to the board of management to remedy the matter which was the subject of the appeal and the board is required by the Act to comply with such directions.</P>
        <P>In the case of a school established or maintained by a VEC, the appeal against the decision of the board of management of the school will be made, in the first instance, to the VEC. If the appellant remains unhappy with the outcome of this process at VEC level he or she has an entitlement to make an appeal directly to the secretary general.</P>
        <P>My Department has received 548 appeals against decisions to refuse to enrol pupils, and 279 of these appeals were either resolved prior to hearing or were withdrawn by the appellant. Of the 269 appeals which went to hearing, 156 were upheld in favour of the appellant and 113 were not upheld.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the maintenance grants scheme for post-leaving certificate courses 2005, grants are available to eligible candidates who are entering approved PLC courses for the first time in the 2005-2006 academic year. Candidates are ineligible if they already hold a FETAC level 5 qualification, formerly known as a FETAC, NCVA, level 2 qualification, a FETAC level 6 qualification, formerly known as a FETAC, NCVA, level 3 qualification, or a third level qualification at level 6 or higher. Notwithstanding this condition, candidates who already hold a qualification no higher than FETAC level 5, formerly known as a FETAC, NCVA, level 2 qualification, and are now pursuing a course that offers progression may be deemed eligible for grant aid.</P>
        <P>Under the scheme, a grant is tenable for the normal duration of the approved PLC course and is renewable annually subject to the satisfactory participation, attendance and the approval of the vocational education committee. A record of achievement is generally issued in respect of individual modules of a course, whereas a full award, FETAC level 5, formally known as a FETAC, NCVA, level 2 qualification-level 6 qualification, formally known as FETAC, NCVA, level 3 qualification, is issued were all modules of a particular course have been successfully completed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department understands that the candidate referred to by the Deputy has previously pursued an approved PLC course at FETAC level 5. However, she did not attain the terminal qualification on completing the course. In the circumstances, she may not be deemed as progressing under the terms of the PLC scheme.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management of the school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2005 was 68 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule, Circular 0023/2006, which has issued to all primary schools and is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006-07 school year will be a principal and two mainstream class teachers.</P>
        <P>Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools, there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn. It is open to the board of management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeal board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in Circular 0024/2006, Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Hard copies of this circular have been issued to all primary schools.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that the first meeting of the appeal board will be held in May 2006. Further meetings will be held in July and October 2006. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 12 May, 24 June and 18 October, respectively. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application <Col N="2231"/>form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department&rsquo;s website. The appeal board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeal board.</P>

	<P>The issue of quality of teaching within a school falls within the remit of the board of management and principal of that school. It is the duty of the board to provide, or cause to be provided, an appropriate education for all students attending the school. The Education Act requires that &ldquo;schools use their available resources to establish and maintain systems whereby the efficiency and effectiveness of its operation can be assessed, including the quality and effective<Col N="2232"/>ness of teaching in the school.&rdquo; The guidance and direction of teachers, the assignment of their teaching duties and the monitoring of the quality of learning and teaching on a day-to-day basis is the responsibility of the principal teacher of the school, who is accountable to the board. The inspectorate, through whole-school evaluation, monitors the performance of principals and boards of management in this regard.</P>
        <P>The inspectorate of my Department is responsible for evaluating schools, including the quality of teaching and the effectiveness of individual teachers. The framework for whole-school evaluations in both primary and post-primary schools includes the evaluation of teaching. In post-primary schools, inspectors also conduct an evaluation of teaching during the course of subject inspections. At primary level, inspectors evaluate the work of teachers on probation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2005, 253 whole-school reports, both whole-school evaluations and tuairisc&iacute; scoile, were conducted in primary schools and 53 whole-school evaluations were completed in post-primary schools. The inspectorate evaluated and reported on 1,611 probationary teachers at primary level in 2005, and at post-primary level 676 subject inspections were conducted. In addition to WSE, subject inspection, and evaluation of teachers on probation at primary level, inspectors periodically conduct thematic evaluations of specific aspects of educational provision, paying particular attention to the quality of teaching observed.</P>
        <P>Where, in the course of evaluations, under-performance of teachers is noted, the inspectorate draws the attention of the principal to this fact. At primary level, rule 161 of the rules for national schools outlines the evaluation procedures to be followed where the work of a teacher has deteriorated to such an extent that the estimate &ldquo;satisfactory&rdquo; is no longer merited. In the case of teachers employed by Vocational Education Committees, Department of Education and Science Circular 43/85 outlines the evaluation procedures to be followed in the context of adverse reports on teaching performance.</P>

The extra accommodation will meet the needs of the school&rsquo;s enrolment policy which operates a cut-off point. This cut-off point will result in the carry over of a small number of pupils to the next school year which is not uncommon where an <Col N="2235"/>increasing demand for enrolments manifests itself. In the case in question, the cut-off point does not contravene the requirements of the Education Welfare Act.</P>

In tandem, my Department is examining the demographics of the area to determine the optimum school size required. It has commenced consultations with the school authority in this regard.

	<P>The school to which the Deputy refers currently accommodates two junior infant classes. When fully occupied, it will operate as a two-<Col N="2236"/>stream 16-classroom school. To enable it develop in this manner, it can only enrol two junior infant classes annually. This incremental development is common to all newly established schools to ensure that a shortage of accommodation at the school is avoided by an over enrolment of junior infant classes in the early stages and crucially, to ensure that the enrolments and staffing levels in other schools in the area, where older pupils would inevitably be drawn, are not adversely affected.</P>
        <P>Typically, a new school commences in temporary accommodation. Accommodation is provided incrementally, thereafter, to meet the schools junior infant intake level each year in the context of junior infant accommodation available in other schools in the area. A new school would have achieved a certain sustainable growth level without affecting other schools before transferring to its permanent accommodation. Its developmental curve would continue on this basis until all its accommodation is in use.</P>
        <P>Because a building is available for the school in question at inception does not mean that an orderly growth can be abandoned given the effect that excessive enrolments will have on other schools in the area which have also been funded by the taxpayer. While enrolment policies are a matter for school authorities, the Department expects the enrolment polices of individual schools to complement the demand for pupil places in an area and, as in this case, to assist the growth of the new school in an orderly fashion. This is in the best interests of the schools, pupils and wider community alike. Accordingly, the issue is not a question of issuing a directive in relation to the enrolment policies of other schools. Fundamentally, the existing schools, which have served the community well, particularly by obliging with extra pupil places when there was severe pressure for such places in recent years, now have a certain level of accommodation and teaching allocations in place. This cannot be ignored because a new school and a new building have come on stream which will, in their own right, cater for the continuing growing needs of the area as time goes by as was always my Department&rsquo;s intention. The question is how to support the new school until it is in a position to operate within the confines of its own current funding resources which will grow year on year. This is under discussion with the board of management. Discussions with the relevant boards of management took place early last year in relation to the issue of enrolment.</P>

	<P>All recognised primary and second level schools are required to offer relationships and sexuality education, RSE. It is an integral part of the social, personal and health education or SPHE curriculum at primary level and at junior cycle second level where it has been made mandatory for all schools with effect from September 2003. In addition, all schools are required to have an agreed school policy and a suitable relationships and sexuality education programme in place for senior cycle pupils. Comprehensive guidelines for junior cycle and senior cycle have also been published and provided to schools by the NCCA to support the RSE aspects of the curriculum. An integrated SPHE programme at senior cycle incorporating RSE is being developed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The overall aims of the SPHE curricula are to foster the personal development, health and well-being of students and help them to create supportive relationships and become responsible citizens; to develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and skills that will inform their actions and decision making; and to establish and maintain healthy patterns of behaviour.</P>
        <P>At primary level, SPHE is one of the seven curriculum areas in the revised primary school curriculum that was introduced in 1999. SPHE has been implemented in all schools since September 2003 and is taught to pupils from junior infants class upwards to sixth class. One of the three strands within SPHE is &ldquo;Myself&rdquo;. The strand units within this include: taking care of my body; growing and changing; and safety and protection.</P>
        <P>This means that pupils from the beginning of their primary schooling learn, in an age-appro<Col N="2238"/>priate way, how their bodies develop, the importance of caring for one&rsquo;s body and that of others with dignity and respect and how to identify people, places and situations that may threaten personal safety.</P>
        <P>The SPHE modules at junior cycle in second level schools deal specifically with belonging and integrating, handling conflict constructively, dealing with peer pressure, influences on decision-making, relationships and sexuality in terms of values, reproductive system, tackling myths about sex and pregnancy, personal safety, substance use and the impact of teenage pregnancy. Two of the SPHE modules relate specifically to relationships and sexuality and personal safety. The aims of these modules include bringing students to an understanding of the physical changes that take place during adolescence and exploring with them procedures for protecting their personal safety along with appropriate responses when their safety is threatened. In third year, an awareness of help agencies is promoted and students&rsquo; skills for obtaining access to them are developed.</P>
        <P>For senior cycle students, all schools are required to have an agreed school policy and a suitable relationships and sexuality education programme in place.</P>
        <P>The RSE programme at senior cycle deals further with these issues and, in addition, addresses issues such as pregnancy, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual harassment, sexual assault, and accepting sexual orientation.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science has developed two sets of resource materials that are particularly relevant to this area for use with transition year and senior cycle students as part of an SPHE programme. These are BALANCE &mdash; Who cares? and exploring masculinities. These resources use a variety of materials and strategies to explore and discuss issues of gender equality.</P>
        <P>Specific attention is paid to addressing both sexual harassment and domestic violence in both resources. Also included in the exploring masculinities resources are materials on bullying and child sexual abuse. Finally, all second level schools receive ex-quota guidance counselling hours from my Department.</P>

	<P>The authorities of primary and post-<Col N="2239"/>primary schools are required to implement the child protection guidelines issued by my Department and I have no information to suggest that this requirement is not being met.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware that the inspectorate conducts whole-school evaluations or WSE on schools. As part of the WSE, the inspectors evaluate the implementation of the board of management&rsquo;s policies and procedures as part of the evaluation of management. They inquire about the procedures and policies the board has put in place arising from the adoption of the child protection guidelines; the name of the person who has been appointed as the designated liaison person or DLP for the school on foot of the guidelines; how the board communicates these policies to members of staff and to other members of the school community; and how the board reviews the effectiveness of the school&rsquo;s child protection measures.</P>
        <P>Where an inspector finds that a school is not complying with its obligations in relation to child protection, or has any other concerns about child protection measures in the school, the inspector discusses the matter with the board of management and the principal and makes recommendations for remediation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In-service training on the Department&rsquo;s child protection guidelines has been provided to primary and post-primary principals and teachers appointed as designated liaison persons or DLPs in relation to child protection. More than 4,000 primary teachers have availed of training and proposals are under consideration for further information and training seminars. At post-primary level, an estimated 75% of schools had availed of the in-service training programme by the end of the 2004-05 school year and it is anticipated that most if not all schools will have had a management or staff person trained in the guidelines by the end of the current school year.</P>
        <P>A follow-on half day closure for each post-primary school was approved to allow DLPs to brief school personnel on the Department guidelines. A telephone advisory service for DLPs has been established by the post-primary management bodies to assist them in delivering in-school briefings and in dealing with issues arising. In addition, a CD-ROM containing a resource pack for staff briefings was prepared by the joint managerial body for issue to schools.</P>

The devolving of funding to local level will accommodate school authorities to have responsibility and ownership of their building projects and assist in moving projects through the design process, to tender and construction at the earliest possible date. The school management authorities recently sought a meeting with the school building section of my Department regarding issues relating to their project and this meeting is being held today.</P>

	<P>In a survey of staff in my Department in early 2005, approximately 3% of administrative staff and 40% of the inspectorate indicated fluency in Irish. Almost 50% of staff in the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, said they could deliver a partial service through Irish. My Department has always actively promoted the development of Irish language competency skills by refunding fees for recognised Irish courses pursued in an officer&rsquo;s own time and supporting staff attendance at Irish-language courses conducted by Gaeleagras. To support the implementation of the Official Languages Act an intensive language training programme for staff began in October 2005 and is being delivered, in the first place, to staff in those sections identified as having the greatest requirement for the delivery of <Col N="2243"/>services through Irish. Priority has also been given to staff with a good level of Irish who need refresher courses. This should increase staff numbers capable of providing a service to the public through Irish. Training includes modules on letter writing and official/technical terminology and takes place one day per week for an eight-week period and is delivered in-house by an outside provider. The second of these training programmes is almost completed. They will continue to be rolled out on a section-by-section basis. In addition, Irish language information resources are being developed and made available for all staff on my Department&rsquo;s intranet site.</P>

	<P>Ensuring the protection, health and welfare of children is a key concern for the Government, for parents, for agencies that work with children and for society generally and I assure the Deputy that the Government is determined to do all that we can to keep our children and vulnerable adults safe. In the education sector, vetting is currently available in respect of <Col N="2245"/>prospective employees of children in detention schools as well as special needs assistants, SNAs, and bus escorts to children with special needs. My colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister of State with special responsibility for children, announced a doubling of the number of staff employed in the Garda central vetting unit, which has been relocated to Thurles under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme in order to ensure it they can handle a greater volume of requests from employers. The provision of additional staff resources will enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults. This will include teachers, caretakers, bus drivers and others working with children, whether on a full-time or part-time basis.</P>
        <P>As a first step in the expansion of services provided by the vetting unit, it is proposed that new staff employed in the 2006-07 school year will be vetted.</P>
        <P>In the case of new teachers, vetting will form part of the process of the registration by the newly established Teaching Council. The council will be responsible for submitting the applications to the vetting unit. In the case of non-teaching staff, it will be the responsibility of the relevant school authorities, including vocational education committees where appropriate, to submit the applications.</P>
        <P>My Department is engaged in discussions with the relevant interests &mdash; school management authorities, unions, the Teaching Council and the vetting unit &mdash; on the procedures and processes which will apply in relation to the vetting of persons in the education sector. Guidelines for school authorities are being prepared and will be issued shortly.</P>

	<P>Each year Ireland, in common with the other member states of the European Union, recruits and seconds primary and post-primary teachers to serve in the 12 European schools, including the three schools located in Brussels. The European schools provide education at first and second levels for the children of parents working in the European Commission or other European institutions.The costs for individual member states are solely connected to the secondment costs of teachers. The European Commission, as the employer of the parents of the pupils, provides direct financing for each <Col N="2246"/>school to cover the other costs of the schools, as the education of such children is free.</P>
        <P>The cost to my Department towards operating the schools in Brussels in 2005, by way of seconding teachers for that year, is currently being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as available.</P>

	<P>Arising from a recommendation made in 1990 by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces, the Gleeson commission, MSA was made pensionable in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990. As I have previously indicated to the House, this approach was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners.</P>
        <P>More recently, the final report of the commission on public service pensions, which was published in January 2001, was considered and broadly accepted by Government. In that report, the commission specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances, including the MSA, and the consequences for public service pensioners generally. However, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected, together with long-standing public service pensions policy in that context and the substantial cost implications involved, the commission did not recommend any increase for the pensioners concerned. Aside from pre-August 1990 Defence Forces pensioners, the other groups affected include certain retired members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Prison Service and retired teachers. No change in existing policy on this matter has been authorised or is contemplated and, accordingly, there is no scope for departing from settled public service pensions policy in the case of MSA.</P>

	<P>In law, the preparation of the register of electors is a matter for each local registration authority. It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the co-operation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register. Their work in this area includes the carrying out of house-to-house inquiries, delivery of registration forms and running local awareness campaigns.</P>
        <P>I share the concerns expressed on the quality of the register. My Department wrote to registration authorities on 14 July 2005 and requested them to take all necessary steps to secure significant improvement in the quality of the register. A national awareness campaign was conducted in November 2005 associated with the work on preparation of the register underway at that stage. Also in November 2005, my Department completed work on new and updated guidance for registration authorities on preparing and maintaining the register. The aim of the guidance is to secure significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register by setting out clearly the legal requirements in this complex area, and identifying best practice for registration authorities in their work on the register.</P>
        <P>The draft guidance has been circulated for comment to all registration authorities and <Col N="2250"/>returning officers and to the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government which, in December 2005, discussed the guidance.

Persons who are not members of a political party may enter on the nomination paper the expression &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; or may leave the space blank.</P>
        <P>These provisions are based on the premise that the expression &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; on the ballot paper indicates adequately that a person does not belong to a political party. There are no proposals for legislative change in this regard.</P>

	<P>The operation of public water supply services is the responsibility of the local authorities and I have no direct function in the matter. However, I understand that the source of supply for these areas of County Mayo is Sligo County Council&rsquo;s Lough Talt water supply scheme and that, as a result of ongoing improvements by Mayo County Council to the distribution network within its functional area, the quality of service to consumers in the <Col N="2251"/>areas concerned will improve. The works to the distribution network have been part funded under the national water conservation measure of my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2005-2007. The upgrading of the Lough Talt Water supply scheme, which is also included in that programme, is scheduled to commence construction in 2007 at a cost of &euro;1.9 million and will further improve service to consumers.</P>

	<P>The cormorant is a protected wild bird under the Wildlife Acts and my Department does not have a policy for controlling or limiting the cormorant population. Application may be made to the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department for a licence under section 42 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, to scare, capture or kill protected wild birds or protected wild animals that are causing serious damage to a fishery. Such applications would be determined by my Department having regard to all relevant considerations, including that of conservation.</P>

This applies also in respect of housing provided for letting by the voluntary sector. The needs of applicants on waiting lists are regularly reviewed and updated by local authorities.</P>
        <P>Housing provided by the voluntary sector is funded by my Department through two separate schemes. The capital assistance scheme addresses the special housing needs of persons such as the <Col N="2252"/>elderly, disabled, homeless and elderly returning emigrants. Under the terms of the scheme, assistance is available to approved voluntary housing bodies where 75% of the units to be provided are to be used as full-time residential accommodation for eligible categories of persons on local authority waiting lists. The remainder of the accommodation may be provided to other applicants in need of housing as determined by the approved voluntary housing body. In regard to the capital loan and subsidy scheme, which supports the provision of standard housing accommodation, it is expected that the units would be provided to persons on local authority waiting lists.</P>

	<P>Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, producers, that is, manufacturers and importers, of farm plastics, including silage bale <Col N="2253"/>wrap and sheeting, are required to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes to recover the waste in question. The Irish Farm Film Producers Group, IFFPG, is currently the sole approved body in Ireland for the purposes of implementing a compliance scheme for the recovery of farm plastics waste.</P>
        <P>Under the IFFPG scheme, producers apply a levy on the sale of farm plastics that in turn is transferred to the IFFPG for use in funding the collection and recovery of farm plastics waste. The IFFPG is a not-for-profit organisation and it is a matter for the company, under the terms of this producer responsibility initiative and in accordance with the polluter pays principle, to set a rate of levy which will cover its operational costs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The scheme has operated successfully to date. It is estimated that around 8,500 tonnes, some 55%, of farm plastics placed on the market in 2004 were collected for recycling. An estimated 55,000 farmers availed of the collection service in 2004. IFFPG estimates that more than 12,500 tonnes of farm plastics were collected in 2005. While responsibility for the collection and recovery of farm plastics rests with the compliance scheme, my Department monitors the scheme on an ongoing basis. I am anxious to preserve and continue the success of the farm plastic scheme. Discussions are taking place involving my Department and IFFPG to explore options for improvement to the scheme and resolution of outstanding issues.</P>

	<P>Under section 17 of the Roads Act 1993, the National Roads Authority has a general duty to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads and for that purpose the authority has overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads. The National Roads Authority <Col N="2254"/>operates under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Transport and his Department.</P>
        <P>The provision and improvement of non-national roads is a matter for local authorities to be funded from their own resources supplemented by State grants provided by my Department. There have been significant increases in recent years in the level of State aid provided to local authorities for the improvement and maintenance of non-national roads. State aid in 2006 for non-national roads, at almost &euro;558 million, is the highest ever level of funding available and represents a very substantial increase of 13% on last year&rsquo;s record allocation, or an increase of almost &euro;62.5 million. The 2006 allocation also represents an increase of 313% on the 1994 allocation and an increase of 154% on the 1997 allocation.</P>
        <P>Total road grant allocations to local authorities for each of the years 1994 to 2006 are set out in the following table. </P>

	<P Just="Left">The Local Government Act 2001 is designed to provide a modern legislative framework for all local authorities. Under the Act all town councils, including former town commissioners such as Bandon <Col N="2268"/>Town Council, may take action to promote the community interest; exercise a representational role, with an office of mayor and structured linkage to the county council; provide local amenities and raise a local community contribution; and make local by-laws and have statutory input to the local development plan process under the planning code.</P>
        <P>Certain town councils, other than former town commissioners, are responsible under the relevant statutory service codes, for certain mainline functions in the housing, roads and sanitary services areas. The Oireachtas, in its comprehensive review and restatement of local government legislative powers in recent years, did not extend <Col N="2269"/>responsibility for such mainline functions to additional town councils and legislation would be required to amend this position. I am keeping the position generally under review in the ongoing local government modernisation programme with the aim of ensuring good accessible service delivery at town and county level.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The loan limit for the shared ownership scheme was reviewed and increased with effect from 1 January 2006. The maximum loan which may be advanced by a local authority in respect of the share of the dwelling being purchased, at a minimum of 40%, is &euro;185,000. However, the cost of the dwelling may exceed this amount. Local authorities may also apply a limit that is lower than &euro;185,000 to reflect local market conditions, to ensure priority of funding for lower income groups and to avoid any significant impact on house prices in their area. The setting of a maximum house value and the level of mortgage finance advanced is a matter for local authorities subject to the maximum loan limit and the borrower&rsquo;s ability to repay the loan.</P>

	<P>My Department has been provided with significant investment for the social and affordable housing programme for the period 2006-08. Exchequer capital resources for the period stand at almost &euro;4 billion and this sum rises to more than &euro;6.5 billion when non-voted and current spending provisions are included. This money will be invested in response to identified need, with in the region of 23,000 new units of social housing to be commenced and 15,000 units of affordable housing to be delivered over the same period. In addition, further households will be assisted through the new rental accommodation scheme. In total, we expect some 50,000 households to benefit from various social and affordable housing measures over the coming three years.</P>
        <P>As part of this expanded provision it is expected that in the region of 6,000 starts will be achieved under the main local authority housing construction programme in 2006. The process of examining individual local authority housing construction programmes is currently under way and allocations will be made shortly. By the very nature of the programme delivery of units is dispersed widely across all local authorities and their many locations.</P>
        <P>The local authority housing programme is part of the wider social and affordable housing programmes for which the main strategy for delivery is the local authority five-year action plans for social and affordable housing. The action plans, now at their mid-way stage, are currently being reviewed. The review is focussing on examining how targets have been met in the first two years of the plan and on incorporating any adjustments required for the remaining years of the plan, in <Col N="2271"/>light of performance including expected 2006 outputs, and the results of the recent housing needs assessment. The outcome of the reviews will ensure that local authorities continue to have a framework for the integrated and cohesive planning and delivery over the coming years of specific social and affordable housing measures based on their relevant housing strategy.</P>

	<P>The recently published report on the financing of local government projects the future expenditure demands on local authorities and puts forward a number of recommendations in relation to the financing of the sector. Future expenditure will be met by a combination of the buoyancy in the existing funding system, some additional funding and the achievement of efficiencies in service delivery.</P>
        <P>As regards the existing funding system, there is significant natural buoyancy in the current revenue sources of local authorities. For example, at local level the valuation base is growing rapidly as a result of our continued economic growth. In addition, revenue from motor taxation, which is paid directly into the local government fund, continues to increase without any increases in the rates of this taxation. In 2006 the fund will amount to some &euro;1.4 billion. I was in a position to announce record levels of general purpose grants to local authorities from the fund, amounting to some &euro;875 million for 2006. This was an increase of more than 7% on the 2005 allocation and a 160% increase on, or 2.5 times, the 1997 level.</P>
        <P>To supplement the existing income sources, a number of initiatives will be pursued. First, I am considering ways of bringing planning fees, which are fixed by regulations, into line with the economic cost of dealing with planning applications. Second, I will introduce legislation to make commercial properties liable for rates from the date of valuation as opposed to the beginning of the following year. This will generate more than &euro;25 million extra a year. Third, to boost income to the local government fund, I am tackling motor tax evasion and will be examining a system of continuous registration of vehicles. Additional revenues will be complemented by a range of efficiency initiatives.</P>
        <P>In partnership with local authorities, I will examine the scope for greater sharing of services between authorities and my Department will develop a standard costing system for the sector to deliver enhanced management information, particularly in relation to unit costs. I am developing proposals to enhance arrangements <Col N="2273"/>for local audit committees in line with best practice. I will also continue to ensure that the value for money unit in my Department undertakes in-depth analyses of local authority activities and identifies best practice.</P>
        <P>The availability of good information is a key to good decision making and key financial data for local government is now being published on my Department&rsquo;s website. Some &euro;2 million has been set aside this year for an innovation fund to identify ways of delivering further efficiencies and to disseminate best practice in this regard to all local authorities. I will announce details of this during the year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 446 and 447 together.</P>
        <P>Management companies for residential developments are generally constituted under the Companies Acts and required to comply with the provisions of company law, which comes within the area of responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I understand also that many aspects of the establishment and operation of these companies are governed by the conveyancing documentation relating to particular developments. In many cases, day-to-day management and maintenance in apartment complexes or mixed developments is carried out by property managing agents, which are commercial entities engaged by management companies. I <Col N="2274"/>understand that the functions of the new national property services regulatory authority being established under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are to include the regulation of property managing agents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to planning conditions and management companies, the majority of planning authorities have indicated, in response to a request for information from my Department, that if they attach planning conditions regarding the establishment of management companies in mixed developments of houses and apartments, they generally do so only in relation to the shared private areas relating to the apartments. In a circular issued on 26 January 2006 regarding the taking in charge of estates, planning authorities were informed that the existence of a management company to maintain elements of common buildings, carry out landscaping etc. must not impact upon the decision by the authority to take in charge roads and related infrastructure of a housing estate where a request to do so is made. I am considering whether further advice should issue to planning authorities regarding management companies and planning conditions.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that a Law Reform Commission working group is examining a range of legal issues regarding management of multi-unit structures. The Government will consider the recommendations in its final report, including the need for any new legislation in this area.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>the plans in place to upgrade the water and sewerage services in Killaloe, County Clare; when he expects these to commence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[14173/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>No proposals have been received by my Department from Clare County Council for water or sewerage works in Killaloe, nor were any such proposals included in the list of schemes submitted by the council in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to local authorities in 2003 to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas. Accordingly, no provision has been made for a proposal for Killaloe in the Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have, however, recently been asked to carry out new assessments of needs and to review their water and waste water infrastructural priorities in light of economic, demographic and other developments that have taken place since the previous needs assessments were completed. New priorities emerging from this process will be reflected in future phases of the water services investment programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department&rsquo;s customer service action plan has the objective to ensure that persons who wish to conduct their business through the medium of Irish are facilitated and that correspondence received <Col N="2276"/>in Irish will be answered in Irish. At present, some 3% of staff surveyed in the Department are available to provide services through the medium of Irish. A number of other staff who may not be as fully proficient in the Irish language also provide limited services through Irish.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s scheme for the provision of services through Irish, prepared under section 11 of the Official Languages Act 2003, contains an ongoing commitment to provide appropriate training for all staff of the Department in the Irish language both during and outside office hours and to encourage staff to improve their Irish language skills. </P>
