   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before proceeding with the business, I wish on my own behalf and on behalf of the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to offer a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte, a most sincere welcome, to Ms Eileen Bell MLA, Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly. I express the hope that she will find her visit enjoyable, successful and to our mutual benefit.</P>

   <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the Irish adoption agreement with Vietnam under which the Irish Adoption Board, through the adoption mediation agency Helping Hands, permits the payment of US currency notes and US dollar bank drafts directly to the account of a named Vietnamese facilitator who, according to US court records, has a criminal record; how Garda clearance was forthcoming for this individual to fill the role of facilitating couples adopting babies in Vietnam; the status of all current adoption applications being processed; and how it can be ensured that inter-country adoptions with Vietnam will be completed in the best interests of the children and the prospective adoptive parents.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the need for the Government to start tackling the chronic congestion in Lucan and Clondalkin and the related west and south-west arterial routes caused by bad planning and the non-existence of public transport solutions, with nothing of substance planned until 2015, not to mention the additional congestion caused by National Toll Roads&rsquo; ludicrous <Col N="334"/>decision to restrict traffic coming from the N4 on to the M50 with tailbacks for a mile, and the need to deal with this as a priority.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the reason officials of Ballina Town Council are responsible for the dumping of tonnes of earth on a green area at Canalside, Ballina, which is protected as part of SAC 002298, known as River Moy, and on which green area they intend to construct a car park by taking it over, completely against the wishes of the local residents, although it is the only green area left in the locality, is occupied by swans and wild herons, is on the banks of the River Moy, and where the only two other green areas have been lost through rezoning for a nursing home for a private developer and for a car park for fishermen, and where there is no need to destroy the only remaining green area because there is already more than ample parking in the immediate vicinity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised I do not consider them to be in order under Standing Order 31.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 19, Health (Nursing Homes)(Amendment) Bill 2006 &mdash; Second Stage, resumed; and No. 2, National Oil Reserves Agency Bill 2006 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the report of the Committee of Public Account which showed that half the speed camera photographs taken were useless, with 20,000 drivers denying they were driving at the time and only 56% of notices issued resulting in payment being made by the end of 2003, does the T&aacute;naiste agree with the view of the former Taoiseach, the late Charles Haughey, that this is the worst Government in the history of the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because it cannot seem to get anything right?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has Deputy Kenny a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the first shot.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Missed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Three weeks ago we saw the Government in chaos, when the Taoiseach abandoned the country to go to America, Ministers could not get their stories straight and there was nobody in charge&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="335"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has Deputy Kenny a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and today we have some evidence of that in the newspapers. Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that on mid-summer&rsquo;s day, there is trouble in paradise? When can we expect the publication of the Harris report into the status of spoken Irish in primary schools?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow the third question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste wants to answer the other two as well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I would prefer if we did not have a debate on issues that are not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the T&aacute;naiste would too.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No legislation is planned on the second matter Deputy Kenny raised, to the best of my knowledge.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the T&aacute;naiste sure?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it a serious challenge?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike Fine Gael, we do not adopt a change of leadership strategy before elections.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the T&aacute;naiste denying the meeting took place?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a specific publication date for the Harris report and I will come back to Deputy Kenny on the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I shared a constituency with the T&aacute;naiste for many years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte would not like to lose her.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to explain that I do not switch sides and I express solidarity with her.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>She has Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s vote.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Returning to the Order of Business, is that what Deputy Rabbitte was going to say?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it a serious challenge?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>May I come back to the question raised, given the importance of the issue of road safety? What exactly is the Government&rsquo;s explanation for installing cameras, half of which are described as defective?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="336"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It does not arise at this stage. If Deputy Rabbitte wishes to raise the matter, there are many opportunities when he may do so today, or on Leaders&rsquo; Questions next week if he so wishes. It is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true, but the question of road safety is important. As the late Mr. Haughey said, nothing this Government does seems to work.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Rabbitte has a question appropriate to the Order of Business, we will hear it. Otherwise we can move on to Deputy Gormley.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There are electronic voting machines that do not work and a computer system in the health services that does not work. Are the cars travelling too fast for them to be photographed? What exactly is the problem?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte is out of order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps they did not take the lens cap off the camera.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Rabbitte has a question appropriate to the Order of Business, we will hear it. If not, we will call Deputy Gormley.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
	<P>The cameras are not working.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte is not working either.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there film in the camera?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue cannot be debated now. If the Deputy wishes to raise it later, the Chair will facilitate him. I call Deputy Gormley.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us have a photo call.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise another issue. The Taoiseach undertook to come back to me on the printing and publication of the Barr report on the shooting of John Carty. Has progress been made on that? Will it be published and will an opportunity be provided to debate the report in the House before it rises for the summer recess?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not be published before the D&aacute;il goes into the recess. The intention is to publish it during July and to have a debate in the House as soon as possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>This shooting happened in 2000 and Mr. Justice Barr concluded his inquiry in 2004.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="337"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We debated this yesterday and the Deputy is being repetitive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>No, we did not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Members are complaining about not getting on with the business of the House, but if we repeat the same issues&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the business of the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It was discussed yesterday.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>A citizen was killed in an incident about which we know well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>But it is not appropriate to debate it on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>How is it that reports will be churned out after the House goes into recess?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is out of order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The same is happening with the Dalton report. Every journalist in the country has a version of the Dalton report but it has still has not been made available to Members of this House weeks later.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot debate these issues. I ask the Deputy to resume his seat and to allow Deputy Gormley who has been called to proceed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair is very unfairly trying to clamp down on pertinent questions about road safety, the publication of reports and so on.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct. The Chair is clamping down on Members abusing the Order of Business. Members complain morning after morning that we are not doing the business we are supposed to do.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I greatly resent the claim&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has an obligation to ensure the time of the House is not wasted. I call Deputy Gormley.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Road safety is not wasting the time of the House and I resent the claim that we are abusing it. The Barr report is a matter of fundamental public interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>What is abusing the time of the House is trying to drag a coach and four through the Standing Orders.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and it is not right that the Government should deliberately contrive to publish it when the House is in recess.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="338"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise at this stage. The Deputy has other opportunities to raise the issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to two Bills promised by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, whom the T&aacute;naiste threatened to sack this week &mdash; the defamation Bill and the fines Bill. They were on the A list last session and this session but we are approaching the end of this session. Is the T&aacute;naiste planning emergency legislation to deal with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s ego, which is clearly out of control?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Both Bills will be published this session. The Minister is working hard on both.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Are they on the accident and emergency list?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister working hard on becoming leader?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the T&aacute;naiste trying to keep him occupied?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>He is working hard to deal with the Deputy in Dublin South-East.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>He will need to work very hard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>He cannot stop crime on the north side.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>He was not present for the division last night on the Poolbeg peninsula incinerator.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>He was around the House and he was not paired.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>A diplomatic absence.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the Dalton report has been unofficially published in various sectors of the media through leaks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a further leak only two days ago. Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that the Dalton report will be published before the D&aacute;il rises for the summer recess? Will time be made available to discuss it over the next two weeks?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism will bring the report to Government next week. It is hoped it will be published after that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it be debated in the House?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the intention if it is dealt with by the Government next week.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="339"/>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>One great legacy of the Government that my party leader did not mention is the massive bill the taxpayer must pay to people in nursing homes. It is estimated &euro;1 billion will be repaid and for this year alone, &euro;350 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question relevant to the Order of Business?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question if the Chair would give me a chance to ask it. A total of &euro;350 million will be repaid this year. When will the Supplementary Estimate come before the House? Is the T&aacute;naiste aware that the Health Service Executive is not complying with the Freedom of Information Act 1997?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Only this morning, I received a complaint about the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department in this regard. The T&aacute;naiste is responsible for the health service and she is also responsible to ensure it complies with the law.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are ways of raising these matters that are in order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The law is stated in the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is present as acting Head of Government, not as Minister for Health and Children.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>How does she intend to deal with the fact that the HSE is not complying with the law?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business. I call the T&aacute;naiste on the first question. The Deputy should table a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health and Children on the second matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not much point in us asking about legislation if it is not even being complied with by the HSE.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The normal procedure is to introduce a Supplementary Estimate later in the year to deal with the first matter. The Deputy is correct that approximately &euro;350 million will be repaid this year. We allocated &euro;400 million in the budget for this purpose and the intention is to pay the remainder next year. A company has been identified to handle the administration of this and a contract has been entered into with the HSE.</P>
    <P>On the second matter, there are clear lines of responsibility regarding who is responsible for enforcing freedom of information legislation and it is not Ministers. Under the Act, each Department or agency affected is required to have a des<Col N="340"/>ignated officer and they are obliged to adhere to the law. There is no discretion on that matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not doing it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I will pursue the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the continuing massive increases in house prices and mortgage interest rates, which are crucifying young, first-time buyers, will the Government bring forward the housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill to address a number of issues, including profiteering developers, unfinished estates and greater powers and resources for local authorities to provide homes for the 44,000 people on housing waiting lists? Will the legislation be brought forward this year?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No, next year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Defence (Amendment) Bill was published earlier. It was scheduled to be debated this time last week, even though it had not been before Cabinet or published. The Bill will be introduced in the Seanad where all Stages will be taken in the same week. It will then be sent to the D&aacute;il where all Stages will be taken in a day. However, the text of the legislation raises serious questions about whether our troops are deployed legally in Kosovo.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>A guillotine will be imposed on the legislation. Defence (amendment) Bills are not often introduced in the House. Will the legislation be rushed through both Houses during the final two weeks of the session without us having an opportunity to debate it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no proposal before the House to guillotine the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party has stated for the past few years that there is a serious question about the legality of the deployment of our troops abroad where there is not an established United Nations mandate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business. The Deputy will have an opportunity to raise that issue when the Bill is debated.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation is an attempt to legalise what was done previously and it is being rushed through the House without an opportunity to debate it.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="341"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation cannot be debated now. There is no proposal before the House about a guillotine.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the T&aacute;naiste assure the House that the Bill will not be guillotined and both Houses will have a proper opportunity to debate it?</P>

	<P>As a brief preamble, given that the record demonstrates that my preambles are quite short, it is mid-summer again and people as young as 12 can be seen drunk on the streets. They order from off-licences by getting other people to order their drink. In that context, I see it is proposed to publish the sale of alcohol Bill by mid-2006. It is now mid-2006 and, unless the Bill is published within the next two weeks, it will not be published until the autumn. Will it published within the next two weeks?</P>

Although the legislation exists, it has not yet been commenced and it should be.</P>
    <P>The second point relates to the Road Traffic Bill which is going through the House. Will further legislation be required.

   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Since I last spoke on this Bill and the need for a rights based approach to nursing home provision and clarification on the constitutional legal issues regarding the provision of a bed in a private nursing home for a public patient with a medical card, none of the questions I asked has been answered.</P>
    <P>I will refer to two communications. The first is from the HSE which I received yesterday and which states regarding Galway:</P>
    <P LI="1">Over the next five years there are no new Public Nursing Home spaces envisaged, however, a new Alzheimer&rsquo;s Unit, in partnership with the West of Ireland Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association, will be constructed in the grounds of Merlin Park, providing 25 extra beds.</P>
    <P FLI="0">In ten years in Galway, 49 public nursing home beds were provided &mdash; 12 in &Aacute;ras Ron&aacute;n on the Aran Islands, 17 in Carna and 20 in &Aacute;ras Mac Dara.</P>
     <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The second communication I received was from someone who sent me details of canvassing by private consortiums to build private hospitals in grounds owned by the public hospitals in Galway. Regarding this, Professor Drumm of the Health Service Executive issued a statement yesterday on the co-location of private hospitals on public sites which states, &ldquo;Expressions of interest were sought on May the 19th from interested parties to develop co-located hospitals on the grounds of 11 hospitals&rdquo;. The statement lists these hospitals which include Galway University Hospital, and continues, &ldquo;Expressions of interest are to be submitted to the National Hospitals Office by June 30th at which time short listing will take place&rdquo;. We will not debate it here. The statement continues:</P><Col N="348"/>
    <P LI="1">After the competitive dialogue stage, successful consortiums will be invited to tender for the provision of a private hospital on the above sites.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">Depending on the number of successful applicants, the HSE will move forward with the co-location of private hospitals on all or some of the above sites.</P>
    <P FLI="0">No one states how the successful applicants are to be chosen in any accountable or transparent way.</P>
    <P>The land available, originally given to the public hospitals in Galway, had a stipulation that it would be available for public health. This is a raid on public property by private hospitals and individuals. A Deputy from my constituency suggested this is all in the interest of public patients. When the classy private patients have been removed from public hospitals, more space will be available for public patients. This is the type of thinking offered by Deputy Grealish. At present, in preparation for the closing date, letters are being circulated to consultants in Galway asking whether they would like a bit of this. It is not that there will be one private hospital on public property in Galway, apparently there will be two.</P>
    <P>In ten years in the entire County Galway 49 public nursing home beds were provided. At the same time, we are told in a chilling sentence that there are no proposals for any public nursing home space in the next five years, except for some assistance to be provided to a voluntary organisation which has gathered pounds, punts and euro to provide spaces in the face of Government failure.</P>
    <P>Why are the public not in revolt at this appalling behaviour? Old people are entitled under any concept of citizenship to decent rights. The Government, the Department, the HSE &mdash; and the health boards before it &mdash; seek to hide from the public the implications of the Health Act 1970 and the constitutional case taken in the High Court which suggests that a person on a medical card is entitled to a public nursing home space and where it is not provided should be entitled to a bed in a private nursing home. Nobody in the administration wants to clarify the entitlements of an elderly person, while the rapacious supporters of the small rump of the Government, the PDs, canvass on how to steal public property from the public who want to see nursing home beds provided on public ground and step down facilities and who do not want rich people to be canvassed on how to steal from the public in the name of health.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always difficult to speak in the House after Deputy Higgins. However, I will try to rise to the challenge. I agree with what he stated on the rapaciousness which exists in particular elements of the Government regarding the provision of extra facilities which should already exist but sadly are still lacking.</P><Col N="349"/>
    <P>This legislation is badly needed. It has widespread support in the House as a legislative base for filling the gaps on an independent inspectorate for nursing homes. Unfortunately, a more embracing and holistic approach to legislation dealing with care of the elderly is necessary. This Government tends to make things up as it goes along, reacts to crises and introduces legislation to plug gaps which become apparent. It is unfortunate that given this is its ninth year in office, we have not had before us more embracing legislation to deal with the wider area of care of the elderly. Models and methods of looking after our ageing population exist and this Government should respond in innovative and better resourced ways. However, it chooses not to.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that at least this Bill will replace the extremely ineffective 1993 Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations under section 7 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990. We know to our cost it was particularly ineffective legislation. The inspection regime which followed from it was shown to be all too wanting, most notoriously in the case of Leas Cross. Many of us in this House suspect that Leas Cross is not an isolated example and many more such examples could exist in our system. We have not put in place a strengthened inspection system nor have we provided the resources to establish the extent to which these problems exist in our society.</P>
    <P>Many aspects of this issue involve societal problems and the Government cannot and should not be expected to solve all of them in the first instance. However, the Government does have a right and a duty to ensure at least basic standards apply. As Deputy Higgins stated, the philosophical approach of the Government on this must be questioned. It has been found wanting. This Government considers a problem in terms of the easiest possible solution in the quickest possible time. These problems are endemic and should be sorted out from the first base.</P>
    <P>In trying to introduce out of sight out of mind solutions, the Government&rsquo;s approach is to try to get as many elderly people as possible into nursing homes, provide as many nursing homes as possible by the private sector in locations far removed from family, community and wider society and then throw up its hands when we discover Leas Cross situations. The first source of possible solutions to these problems should be found within the community and family structures. The fact this Government fails to recognise that and fails to provide adequate resources means a band-aid approach exists among families and they find they are forced to use nursing homes. Social welfare rules restrict pensioners from receiving carer&rsquo;s benefit, and 50% of carers are over 60.</P>
    <P>A facility exists in my constituency which is a model that should be replicated around the country. It takes a holistic approach to care of the elderly. The Westgate Foundation in Ballincollig has independent living units, day care facilities and <Col N="350"/>bed and medical facilities for people who find themselves immobile and in need of medical attention on an ongoing basis. The Government&rsquo;s policy is to try to parcel it out, as is done with waste management. Perhaps that is a cruel analogy. The Government&rsquo;s approach to this problem, as with many other problems, is to see how the private sector with its profit motive can deal with and solve the problem. Neither I nor my party accepts that, nor do many other Members on this side of the House or the vast majority of people.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Green Party recently issued its policy document, Citizenship, Equality, Respect: A Policy on Ageing and Older Persons. If this Bill were more embracing and holistic, it would include many of the principles we are trying to advocate. In circumstances where elderly people find themselves in nursing homes on a long-term basis, or even to the end of their lives, is it enough for us to refer to legally enforceable standards of care and sanitation? Surely they deserve more, such as the right to the maximum quality of life, the feeling they are in an institution which they consider a home and the right to participate in the decisions that affect the community in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>We have legislation that gives parents the right to be involved in their children&rsquo;s education and there is even a role for student councils in secondary schools so students can be more involved in decisions that affect those schools. The nursing homes legislation should therefore refer to the elderly themselves. What role do they have when living in nursing homes and how do they articulate their needs and enforce their rights? Unfortunately the Government is continuing to enforce standards from the outside. It only ensures that minimum standards are maintained and then walks away for a given period.</P>
    <P>Inspections of nursing homes will be quite infrequent. Experience shows that inspections under the existing system very often occurred with the prior knowledge of the nursing home authorities. We need to know that this will not apply under the new inspectorate and that the spot-checks will be unannounced. The checks should ensure the standards that apply on the day on which they are carried out apply day in, day out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Higgins stated nursing homes are regarded as the first resort under Government policy although they should be the last resort. There seems to be no policy to deal with the intermediate circumstances in which people find themselves. Between the family home, the hospital and nursing home, there is an utter dearth of step-down facilities. With a bit of imagination and innovation we could prevent circumstances in which people effectively find themselves incarcerated in nursing homes throughout the country. Such people find themselves cut off without adequate support when their conditions <Col N="351"/>could be dealt with a little more effectively on a short-term to medium-term basis.</P>
    <P>The wider issue is that the Government&rsquo;s policy of continuing to depend on nursing homes as the main means of caring for the elderly, with which policy the inspectorate will have little to do, is very expensive, particularly when nursing homes are largely privately owned. Before the recess, we will have to deal with the short-term bill for nursing home charges, which will probably be in excess of &euro;1 billion. Upon a nod, the House will be expected to decide on the first tranche of this, which will amount to &euro;340 million, just to deal with the original payments. Ultimately, successive Governments, including the current one, made serious errors in this area. That the bill was allowed to accrue and that a wrong principle was put into practice does not escape the fact that the policy the Government wishes to pursue will result in a continuing added cost to society.</P>
    <P>We believe the money could be used more effectively by resourcing family units, the carer sector and community structures. The Government needs to come out of its shell on this issue. Does it not believe there is a more effective approach than throwing money at the problem in such a way that it only benefits a small number and barely affects those in need of care who are meant to benefit therefrom?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is cutting the home help service.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the effect of it.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I believe we will not only be revisiting individual care-related issues such as that which arose in Leas Cross, but that we will also be presented with a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General on how public money has been wasted and should have been used far more effectively to care for our ageing population.</P>
    <P>Consider how the Government responded to the child care problem. It was forced by policy initiatives and all Opposition parties into accepting that there should be direct payments to help with the care of children in family units. This principle should also be applied to families with ageing members. That we have a split standard shows the Government is again acting on a panic basis in respect of what is regarded as the most sexy political issue.</P>
    <P>If the Government is to think on a long-term basis, which it is incapable of doing, it needs to recognise that we have an ageing population. When I and my peers were being educated at third level, the IDA used to broadcast an advertisement saying we were the young Europeans and that 50% of the population was under 25. This figure has increased significantly but a time will come, in 20 or 25 years, when quite a large proportion of the population will be over 60. What are we doing now to anticipate their needs <Col N="352"/>and involve them in making the decisions that will meet these needs? In this regard, there is a dearth at the heart of Government thinking.</P>
    <P>My Green Party colleague Deputy Gormley, our spokesperson on health, stated the party supports the legislation as it stands but believes it is a stop-gap measure and that there are many more areas in need of legislative redress in order to recognise and meet the needs of the elderly. Unfortunately, I am not confident that the Government will be able to meet those needs.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The issues addressed in this Bill are creating many problems for the elderly and particularly for families who need to put one of their loved ones into either a private or public nursing home. I compliment Deputy Michael Higgins on his speech because what he says is correct.</P>
    <P>Everyday I see very vulnerable people who are not well off and have no resources of their own. Vulnerable families are assessed by the HSE and told by it that their loved ones need a long-stay bed. They face very serious problems and I hate to say they are being forced by the State to put their loved ones into private nursing homes. They are given a list of such homes and a subvention form. This is not correct and I want the Government to write to the carers of the elderly to clarify the law, which it does not seem to know. The Ombudsman, however, made it quite clear some years ago. When I was deputy spokesman for health, I highlighted on many occasions the Ombudsman&rsquo;s view that if one is over 70 and has a medical card, one is entitled to a State bed. If that is not correct, I ask the Minister of State to refute it. Doctors, nurses and the Health Service Executive should be aware of the law of the land. They should not intimidate people and pressurise them to put their loved ones into private homes when they do not have the resources to fund it. People are being pressurised on a daily basis. The State may not have enough beds but it is not the job of the families to provide them. That is the job of the State.</P>
    <P>The Sacred Heart Home in Mayo is an excellent, well-run home but in recent years all the Health Service Executive could do was reduce the number of beds in that home. A problem arose with the floor in the home and I understand, although I am open to correction, that it has not resolved that problem to this day yet it has no problem upsetting families when they are under pressure.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I could give many examples of people being pressurised who were unable to stand up for themselves. I am thinking of the woman who came to my clinic crying and saying she was being intimidated by a doctor. She said she was unable to put up with it any more. I had to write to that doctor, explain the law of the land to him and ask him to stop upsetting the woman who was in need of full-time care herself. She was trying to look after her sister but was unable to do it, yet she <Col N="353"/>was told that she must fill in the subvention form and that her sister must go into a private home. That is not the law of the land and that must be spelled out to the doctors and to the Health Service Executive. If people want to or have to go into private homes the procedures should be explained to them in a simple way. The options should be outlined to them and they should not be forced out of hospital.</P>
    <P>I made the point yesterday to Professor Drumm that the Health Service Executive cannot have it both ways. Some weeks ago it announced the home care package. I am sure the Minister of State heard about that because we had a big spin about it. All the spin doctors were out, and there are more spin doctors in the country than there are medical doctors. They were spinning as usual about the home care package, which is amazing because I have tried to get the home care package for some of my constituents or at least a copy of the guidelines, rules and regulations without success to date. I am waiting for many weeks for a reply to a D&aacute;il question, and it is no longer easy to get a reply from the Health Service Executive on the number of home care packages produced in Mayo. I know how many &mdash; none. There is little point in announcing fancy schemes and ideas without having the scheme approved, publishing the rules and regulations and having applications dealt with quickly. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot expect people to bring their loved ones home from hospital without any back-up or help from the State.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister of State another example of what is going on with the Health Service Executive when there is a small cut-back. Belmullet is approximately 70 miles from Castlebar, more than 100 miles from Galway and more than 200 miles from Dublin. Elderly people living there want to remain at home. Every report and statistic shows that people want to stay at home, be looked after in their own homes and die at home. They do not want to take up a State bed. They want to stay in their own beds in their own homes in their own part of the country. The situation now, however, is that many elderly people on social welfare payments who have no resources, money or family back-up must travel to Dublin or Galway to keep a hospital appointment. That is not their fault, nor is it their fault that their appointment is for 9 a.m. We have very little infrastructure to allow them get a train or a plane to bring them to Dublin. We have no Luas in Belmullet, Castlebar or Mayo. Our people cannot hop on the Luas to keep hospital appointments. They must travel more than 200 miles.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Executive in Mayo has new criteria. I raised this matter with Professor Brendan Drumm yesterday and I hope the Minister of State and his officials will raise it also. It has decided that it will provide transport to only three or four categories of patients. We now have a situation where many sick elderly people in need of hospital appointments will be unable to <Col N="354"/>take up those appointments because they do not have the resources or the money. In the past the former health boards supported them and arranged for them to be brought to hospital appointments. When I raised that yesterday with Professor Drumm he told me that there was no cut-back. If there is no cut-back I want the Minister of State and his Department to write to the Health Service Executive today and tell it to go back to the old scheme and abolish the existing scheme. What is going on is not right. We cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>I will outline what the former health board is doing in my county. They wonder about the reason State beds are taken up, accident and emergency units are over-crowded and the health service is in disarray. I will explain the reason. It is because we did not do our business in this House. Previous Ministers did not do their business. There are no step-down facilities available. There is no place for an elderly person to go when discharged from hospital needing a week or two in a nursing home to recuperate. There are no step-down facilities for those people. We cannot force people out of hospitals and into their own homes without back-up. We will not give them the necessary back-up at home and we will not give them the back-up in hospital.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I raised this problem with the Minister of State, and to be fair to him he wrote to me and did his best. He outlined all the extra money he provided for home help yet I am aware of elderly people in their 80s and 90s who previously got four hours home help a day but which has been reduced to two hours. The home help service has been taken from some of them. When I raised that with Professor Drumm yesterday I was told there were no cut-backs and that anybody who needs home help will get it. I know many people who need home help but they are not getting it. It is hypocritical of the State to say on the one hand that it cannot provide funding and does not have the beds yet the people who want to stay at home are not being supported or given the necessary back-up and resources.</P>
    <P>In the Sacred Heart Home I mentioned earlier there are two beds for cancer patients. That hospice unit has been open for many years but the beds are vacant. The Health Service Executive placed a number of advertisements for a doctor post in a newspaper and I wondered why no doctor would take up that job. I put down a D&aacute;il question on that matter, but it took a long time to get an answer. Eventually I had to threaten to make a freedom of information request. I am not sure whether I did that but eventually I got information on the advertisement, the salary the HSE was offering to pay the doctor who would take up the job. I now know the reason the job has not been taken up. It is because the pittance the HSE was offering was less than somebody would earn working on an island looking after ten medical card patients. We are not serious about dealing with health if that is the situation. People had to <Col N="355"/>leave my county to go to other counties in their last days to be looked after. That is sad. If we were serious about health and if the HSE was serious about filling that position in the Sacred Heart Home, it would be filled.</P>
    <P>I will give another example to the Minister of State. Since I became a Member of this D&aacute;il 12 years ago, we have been talking about providing a nursing home for Ballinrobe. It was an issue in every election for the past 12 years yet 12 years on there is not a brick laid to start building that nursing home in Ballinrobe. We urgently need nursing homes. I am talking about a public nursing home on which a commitment was given that it would be built, but it has not happened. If the former Western Health Board did its job properly, that nursing home would be up and running now and patients discharged from the old general hospital who still need full-time care would be in it. We cannot have it both ways. The State cannot lecture people about keeping their loved ones at home if it is not making any effort to provide for them.</P>
    <P>The time has come. People are depending on the private sector. We have an Alzheimer&rsquo;s unit in Ballindine provided by a man called John Grant. I take this opportunity to compliment John Grant and his staff on the efforts he has made over the years and the beds he has provided. He has done an excellent job for people who found themselves under pressure because the Health Service Executive was unable to meet their needs. They had to go to the private sector where people like John Grant operate, who through voluntary contributions raised money to provide an excellent unit in Ballindine. Compliment and say well done to people such as Mr. John Grant. We had no Ministers with the foresight he showed in erecting buildings and knowing that these additional Alzheimer beds were needed in Ballindine.</P>
    <P>I will finish on the topic of the elderly and I want to again raise this issue as regards the Ombudsman. I want to ask the Minister of State and the Government to spell out the situation for a person over 70 years of age with a medical card. Is he or she entitled to a State bed? The Ombudsman says such people are entitled to a State bed. On the question of subvention, why are these forms being thrown at them when they find themselves in need of a State bed? It should be explained to these people first that they are entitled to a State bed, while they might have to wait a while. In the meantime the Health Service Executive should be paying if it wants to put them into private sector beds, not putting pressure on the people who cannot afford it. The HSE takes their pensions off them and that is fine &mdash; I have no problem with this and that is how it should be. However, it should not be putting pressure on family members at home on social welfare or low incomes to try and meet the shortfall.</P><Col N="356"/>
    <P>As regards the Bill, I hope this will deal with what has been happening in recent years, particularly in the west where we get a lower subvention than people on the east coast. The time has come for this to be resolved. Whatever people get on the east coast should be replicated along the west coast. We cannot have two types of payment, one for the east coast and one for the west. In the west, of course, we are getting the lower and not the higher end of the payment. As regards people who are in private nursing homes, it is time for a stronger inspectorate, with more people on the ground visiting these homes on a daily basis to ensure, where the State is providing subvention, that we have an input into the level of care such people are receiving. These people are entitled to the assurance that there is somebody to protect their interests because, while sometimes the private sector homes do an excellent job, there will always be those willing to take short-cuts. We saw that in Dublin, in Leas Cross, and I am sure there are more nursing homes throughout the State where the care is not being given, even though they are being well paid to look after people. The inspectorate should be in place.</P>
    <P>The elderly built this State. If one listened to the media last week one would think only one person built up the State. That is not the case. Both men and women, who are now elderly, worked very hard and paid their taxes to the State. They raised their families and presumed, on paying their taxes, that when they reached the end of their days if they needed health care, nursing home beds or to be protected and looked after, the State would do that for them. They expected this because they paid their dues to the State. They are the people who went without many necessities during difficult times. They did what was right and the Minister of State and the Government should ensure they are protected. Whatever they need at the end of their days, whether a nursing home bed, a home care package, home help, or a doctor calling to see them on a regular basis, we should ensure they are protected because they have paid their dues.</P>
    <P>I want this to happen. We do not want lecturing any more. We do not want spin doctors. We want medical doctors and people to look after the elderly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute my tuppence worth to the state of nursing homes and what the Government is doing as regards care of the elderly. I am glad the Minister of State responsible, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, is here to hear my contribution. I hope he takes on board some of what I have to say.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I note in particular from the Minister of State&rsquo;s statement that when he introduced this Bill to the D&aacute;il he said, &ldquo;The aim of this scheme is to provide financial assistance to older people towards the cost of maintenance in private nursing homes&rdquo;. We all know there is something <Col N="357"/>called the nursing home subvention scheme. I am sure that many other public representatives, like myself, have been inundated, not so much by the elderly but perhaps neighbours, nephews, nieces or cousins on their behalf, who face a major dilemma as regards how this nursing home subvention and care for the elderly works in this country. The situation is as outlined by my colleague, Deputy Ring. If some elderly person is in hospital and a neighbour comes in to visit, at some stage he or she will be told the elderly person is ready to be discharged and asked if he or she is taking responsibility for the person.</P>
    <P>I came across a case recently involving a woman, Biddy, who was 85 and able to look after herself. A neighbour was told Biddy was being discharged the following day and it was expected the neighbour would look after her. This neighbour had looked after her over a long period out of the goodness of her heart. She would continue to look after her, but was being given total responsibility by the health services, although she was just a neighbour. She had no family connection with the woman and was not going to inherit her property. She would not gain any financial reward, and indeed did not want any. Nonetheless, this responsibility was being foisted on her.</P>
    <P>She felt like an outcast, she said, on telling the hospital ward sister that she had a family to care for as well, and that while willing to do the best she could, she was not prepared to take full responsibility. The enormous burden of responsibility was being put on her shoulders, she felt. Because she was not prepared to accept it she was made to feel she was dealing inappropriately with this elderly person, her neighbour.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State say whether this is what we are trying to do? Are we trying to force neighbours, distant relations and so on to look after the elderly? Again, as Deputy Ring pointed out, these are the people who built this State. All of these elderly people went through very difficult times in the formation of this State in the 1930s, the 1940s and the 1950s. I am not too old, but knocking on a bit, too, I suppose, like the Acting Chairman.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Not old enough to be retiring.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I recall the American wakes that took place in the small villages in the 1950s, where many of the people who are now very elderly saw their children emigrate to England and America, never to return in many cases. Those are the elderly people who made sacrifices, gathering a few bob to give their children the chance to go. As my mother used to say, they lived on &ldquo;the clippings of tin&rdquo; to keep alive. Times were extremely difficult in the 1950s and 1960s. Now, when such people have a dependency on the State, we are pulling the rug from under them. This legislation is being introduced as something of a sticking plaster job. We have had difficulties as regards the repayment of moneys to various <Col N="358"/>people, so the Government has decided to seal the door tightly in case of further crisis. Effectively, it is a battening down the hatches exercise, and that is why this is being introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State took the opportunity in his speech to outline what he believes will be a good propaganda campaign as regards how to look after the elderly. I know the Minister of State for quite a time and believe him to be a decent man. However, the way we are addressing the difficulties for the elderly is not up to standard at all. There was a flurry of activity towards the back end of last year, when the T&aacute;naiste announced there was a new package for subvention, and that the threshold for housing in the Dublin area would be &euro;500,000, as the cut-off point for nursing home subvention. In a rural setting the property valuation was to be set at &euro;300,000. Those were to be the cut-off points. I talked recently to an officer in the health board and we discussed the whole question of subvention, with reference to a particular case. I asked him to confirm that in a rural setting the first &euro;300,000 of income was to be disregarded. That was not the case, he said, but rather the perception. The spin doctoring made it sound like we were changing the system dramatically and that if one&rsquo;s property was worth less than &euro;300,000, it could be disregarded, while it could be disregarded in Dublin if it was less than &euro;500,000. Assets above that value would only be examined when assessing nursing home subvention.</P>
    <P>Nothing could be further from the truth. No change was introduced by the Minister. Instead of saying that if one&rsquo;s assets are worth more than &euro;90,000, one does not have a chance of getting subvention, we are saying that if one&rsquo;s assets are worth more than &euro;300,000, one has not got a chance of getting subvention. In between, we have changed nothing. The window dressing does not work and people are not fooled by this anymore.</P>
    <P>We must address the real issues. People would prefer to stay in their homes, if possible, or at least in their communities. We should facilitate them in doing that. If we look around the country, some excellent schemes have been built. A priest in County Clare pioneered a scheme with small villages where elderly people could live in sheltered accommodation within their community. This has worked very well and it has been done on a voluntary basis. It is the kind of model towards which we should move.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister examine what has been happening in the UK for a long time? There is a major problem in that country due to the great number of elderly people and it has been addressed in a good fashion. I am sure there are deficiencies, just like there are everywhere else. However, I am aware of a scheme which operates there, with which I am impressed, consisting of two-storey town houses joined together along a row. One entered an outer door into a long corridor and there were many self-contained apart<Col N="359"/>ment units at the bottom of the corridor which were relatively small, about 600 or 700 sq. ft. The first floor also had self-contained apartments. There were facilities for a live-in caretaker, nurse or administrator. There was an intercom system in each apartment and, every morning, the caretaker could call each apartment to ensure the occupier was up and about. Each apartment had a pull cord so that if an emergency arose, the caretaker could be alerted.</P>
    <P>The block also contained community rooms so that even though each unit was self-contained, the elderly people could come together on a regular basis to play bingo or to have their hair done. Lunch was available at a reduced cost two or three days a week. There were two or three extra available rooms which could be booked for family visitors. This system operated very well. It created its own little community and there was even an occasional wedding. People had come separately to the community, romance blossomed and couples went on to get married like Darby and Joan. Birthdays also added to the community spirit. There would be a little function in the community room with a birthday cake and so on.</P>
    <P>This system delivered security for the elderly because there was only one outside door. It created a sense of community and back-up when it was needed. The financial arrangements involved were suitable. A subsidy was paid by the state towards the rent of these units so that it was in the reach of ordinary people to be able to pay their rent. Their rent was akin to what they might pay in a council house, but the block was not owned by the council. It was privately owned and operated mainly by pension companies. The block of homes with which I am familiar was owned by the local pension board of the gas works. That board had built and operated it and was able to make returns on it, yet it was subsidised accommodation with all the advantages I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>Let us contrast that to what is happening here. We have been running down the number of beds available. We have been reducing the number of public beds available for elderly people. In Mullingar, St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital was built in 1841 and is one of two remaining in the country. The building is not ideal for a hospital and needs to be replaced, but it should be preserved as an administrative building or something. In recent decades, we have reduced the number of public beds from 250 to 120. We are making it more difficult for people to get in there.</P>
    <P>We are forcing elderly people into the nursing homes at a time when their number is increasing. In 1995, there were approximately 400,000 people over 65 in Ireland. It is projected that the number of people over 65 by 2020 will grow to around 700,000. That represents a 75% increase over a 25-year period, which is very high. Various Governments have identified this problem and decided that more nursing homes must be built.</P><Col N="360"/>
    <P>Incentives were given to the private sector to build nursing homes. Looking at the demographic trends, people in the private sector thought they would have many customers and they rushed to build nursing homes. However, many of these homes are finding it difficult to survive. I am aware of homes that are below capacity and are struggling to survive. I have a friend who runs a private nursing home and I am told that the critical mass for a nursing home is about 28 patients. To make it viable and to survive, 28 patients are needed owing to nursing cover and so on. Anywhere below that number leaves the owner in a difficult situation. Many beds are not being used, but the Government is not providing the wherewithal to use them.</P>
    <P>What is the standard cost in a nursing home? In my area, it costs between &euro;500 and &euro;600 per week, and there may be extras on top of that. How does an ordinary person survive? The old age pension is a maximum of &euro;190 per week. The subvention is a maximum of &euro;190 per week, if the person can jump all the hurdles put in his or her way. That makes &euro;380. A shortfall of &euro;170 to &euro;200 per week has to be met. From where can people get that and how can they manage to meet that cost? Based on what is contained in the Bill in terms of what the Minister proposes, some older people will have to sell their property and the assets it would realise would have to go towards funding their nursing home care.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Acting Chairman and I are familiar with people who go into nursing homes. I have yet to meet a person who when going into a nursing home would say, &ldquo;I am in here now to die &mdash; this is the last of it, the final furlong&rdquo;. Such a person would say, &ldquo;I am in here for a little while until I get a bit stronger; I am going to build myself up over the next two or three weeks and I will be back home then&rdquo;. Such a person expects that he or she will return to his or her own home. How then can one countenance a situation where one would have to say to such a person that he or she will not return to his or her home because it must be sold to keep the person in the nursing home? What kind of a blow is that to such people? Is it appropriate that we should do that bearing in mind what has been said about how our elderly people have built up this State?</P>
    <P>I wish to return briefly to the issue of St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital in Mullingar. The most recent Government announcement is that the 120 beds in that hospital will be replaced by two 50-bed units on the site of that hospital and by a further 50 bed unit in Castlepollard. The proposed unit in Castlepollard has been promised for 20 years and I am sure it is simply yet another promise but we will have to wait to see if it will be delivered.</P>
    <P>When our demographics point to our having many more elderly people in our State, should we be decreasing the number of public beds? There were 250 beds in that hospital and there are now only 120 beds in it. Will it be replaced with a 150 bed unit? I suspect that at some stage in the <Col N="361"/>future there will be a 50 bed unit in Castlepollard and one 50 bed unit in Mullingar and the provision of the second unit that was mentioned will be put on the long finger. That is not good enough and provision in this respect should be addressed at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a further point to which I ask the Minister of State to pay particular attention when replying to the debate. What is the position under the Health Act 1970 in regard to people who have to go to hospital or to a nursing home? We were promised in the 1970 Act, which is law, that hospitalisation would be free of charge for anybody, but that is not the case. It is not only I or other Members who have made that point, a former Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills, completed a specific report on this matter and obtained legal advice on it. He said that in his view the Nursing Home Act 1970, which is law, means people are entitled to be in nursing homes free of charge. How does the Minister of State reconcile that with what is in this legislation? How will he address that issue? Will he amend the 1970 Act to state that is not the case? We should not have such confusion. It will lead to further difficulties down the road. When a case on that basis is taken by a person and he or she cites the legal advice and the report of a former Ombudsman, will we all again be held indicted for not living up to our responsibility?</P>

	<P>The most contentious issue we associate with nursing homes and the care of elderly people is that which was highlighted recently, namely the nursing home inspections. Many of us have consistently raised this issue over many years, but it never received publicity until recently. A report may be on the desk of the Minister or someone else on how these inspections should be carried out and implemented. Given a year has passed since the bad publicity surrounding many private nursing homes, it is time a proper nursing home inspectorate was established. A considerable degree of good work is done by many nursing homes and many elderly and middle aged people are treated very well in them, but other nursing homes, particularly old converted buildings, convents or school houses, leave much to be desired. I have had relatives in nursing homes and I am familiar with the difference in standards across them. The standard in some is excellent and in others it is very poor.</P>
    <P>Many people in nursing homes are vulnerable. They do not have the wherewithal or a mechanism to make a complaint. In many cases, there are afraid to make a complaint because they believe they will be moved on. I am familiar with a case where an individual in my constituency made a complaint about a nursing home, following which the family was asked to take their elderly parent out of the home. The family was reluctant to follow up on the complaint. I have taken up this issue with the Department and <Col N="362"/>tabled parliamentary questions on it, but I found it difficult to get the bottom of it.</P>
    <P>New nursing homes should be single storey structures and we should not permit them to be two-storey or multistorey structures. I am aware of a nursing home in Kilkenny that is an old two-storey building which was converted for that purpose. There is a lift in it and when part of the lift was damaged the spare part needed to repair it had to sent from Italy. The lift was of out commission for several days during the summer and the elderly people on the upper floor could not come down to the lower floor or go outside. They were basically trapped in the building and I fear to think what would have happened if there had been a fire. New nursing homes should be only single storey buildings. I do not know the provisions of the building regulations in regard to them, although I admit that most nursing homes I have seen are single storey buildings. I would like the Minister of State to examine that point.</P>
    <P>In regard to the county development plan in Wicklow, where there are very restrictive planning practices, I put forward a proposal that nursing homes should be allowed to be located on greenfield sites, even if not connected to the main sewerage scheme. That proposal was accepted following much difficulty. An argument is often made that nursing homes should be located in towns where people have access to the church and other facilities. However, many people were reared and lived all their lives in a rural environment and they want to spend their time in a nursing home in a rural environment. Such provision should be encouraged. I am aware that some nursing homes are located in rural areas, although there are not many of them in my county, but I hope more will materialise in time.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this legislation is to put the concept of subvention on a legislative footing. Section 7B of the principal Act deals with that aspect under two issues, namely, dependency &mdash; in other words, the physical needs of a person &mdash; and the means of the applicant. I may have interpreted the section incorrectly and the Minister of State might clarify it. It refers to excluding 95% of the estimated value of the house and that 5% of the value of the house would be taken on board. I assume it will be taken on board as an income. If a person&rsquo;s house is valued at &euro;1 million, the income one would be assessed as having is &euro;50,000 a year. Perhaps I am misreading the section but that is my understanding of it. The section goes on to deal with the position in the case of threshold limits. For example, if a person has a principal residence the value of which is above &euro;500,000 and if it is located in the Dublin area, he or she would perhaps be refused subvention and if a person has a house valued at &euro;300,000 in an area outside Dublin city and county, he or she perhaps would also be refused subvention. I assume I am correct in my interpretation of that provision. This provision could exclude many people from qualifying for subven<Col N="363"/>tion. The average price of houses have increased by 270% in the past ten years across the country and in some places they have increased by<?oasys _jy ?>300%. Taking the value of a person&rsquo;s residence into consideration is not a very exact science. The taking into account of property valuations will impact on people across the board because such means is not a tangible asset for people who do not intend to sell their property. If that is the case under this legislation, it means people living in the greater Dublin area will never qualify for subvention. The Minister of State might be able to clarify that provision in case I am misinterpreting it.</P>

    <P>Deputy Paul McGrath mentioned in 1970 Act and a commitment that the State would be responsible for the welfare of older people and would provide facilities such as nursing homes. I have a letter from the Wicklow Active Retirement Association. The members believe that little or nothing has been done by the State to implement the commitment in the Health Act 1970, and it is difficult to disagree. They believe older people are being forced into private nursing homes, thus causing them and their families financial hardship. I do not have a difficulty with the many tax incentives put in place to encourage the building of private nursing homes. If people are willing to invest in them, that is fine. However, the amount charged for care is prohibitive. Given the tax reliefs and the subventions paid, the development of existing old district hospitals might provide better value for money.</P>
    <P>Many older people already attend day care centres at these hospitals, so it might be a natural progression for them to move into care there when necessary. Hardly a week passes without me being contacted by someone trying to get a place in their district hospital. It is not that they want free care, rather that they want to be in the vicinity of people they know and to remain in the environment with which they are familiar. Many parts of the country do not have private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>These district hospitals provide a good service and provide respite and step-down beds for people coming from acute beds thereby taking pressure off the main hospitals. However, the staff in these hospitals often have to struggle for resources. Despite the fact that facilities have improved tenfold over the past 20 years, the district hospitals face a constant struggle for more staff and beds. There are three district hospitals in County Wicklow: Baltinglass, Rathdrum and Wicklow town, and they are constantly looking for more resources. The local people want to use these hospitals rather than private nursing homes, irrespective of the payment issue.</P>
    <P>The break-up of the old Eastern Regional Health Authority brought a change in the catchment areas for district hospitals and, as a result, we now have an imbalance in Wicklow. Approxi<Col N="364"/>mately 90,000 people are in the catchment area for Rathdrum and Wicklow and about 12,000 in the Baltinglass catchment area. The Department should take another look at this. The policy of the Health Service Executive is to have no borders, so to speak. The catchment area for Baltinglass should revert to the old area because people in south Wicklow have attended day care there and had relatives there. Now that some of them may wish to access the hospital, they have been refused access and told to go on the waiting lists for Rathdrum or Wicklow. This makes little sense because there is already a greater demand on those two hospitals. If the numbers were broken down on a population basis, we would revert to the old system. I have raised the matter several times but have had no success to date. Therefore, I would appreciate it if the Minister would take the issue on board and do something about it.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Bill has nothing to do with sheltered housing, but the issue is related to Government policy. The Wicklow Active Retirement Association has asked what sheltered housing is available for the area and how the association can go about acquiring it. We all know excellent funding mechanisms are in place for sheltered housing and they work well. We have seen many parishes and communities avail of this funding to build sheltered housing on parish or community grounds.</P>
    <P>We should encourage the building of sheltered housing as an add-on or attachment to our old district hospitals because these already have a staff in place and provide a secure environment. Statutory bodies should be more proactive in this regard. Perhaps they should contact all the active retirement groups that have been set up in recent years and provide them with details on how to go about providing sheltered housing. There is possibly, if memory serves me right, 100% funding available for such schemes.</P>
    <P>Many people cannot survive alone in their house but they do not want to go into a nursing home. They would prefer a type of halfway house and sheltered housing would meet that need. There is an excellent sheltered housing scheme in Carnew, County Wicklow, and in many other places throughout the country. However, many areas do not have these facilities nor the wherewithal to provide them. If we provided the information to the active retirement associations on how to go about sourcing funding for sheltered housing, most communities would be willing to provide sites. Most district hospitals have extensive sites and the sheltered housing could be on them.</P>
    <P>Some people referred to the home care package which provides assistance to people in their homes. Many people do not want to leave their homes and would not have to if the home care package were enhanced and more readily available. Last year, I tried to source home care for some people in my area, but there was a limit on what was available and no more could be pro<Col N="365"/>vided. We should allocate more funding to this area to make life easier for elderly people, thereby taking the pressure off having to provide nursing home subvention.</P>
    <P>People often only need a mechanism to help them stay in their home. They might not want to go into a private nursing home, but they see no other solution and this often costs the State more. We must look after our elderly and our young people, and resources should never be the issue in this regard. We need to put this legislation and the infrastructure in place to provide people with an option. I repeat, not a week goes by without some family contacting me to find a place in the local hospital. Unfortunately, unless someone in a public bed dies, no place is available.</P>
    <P>I broadly welcome the legislation. I compliment the many people working in public nursing homes and hospitals and those working in the many private homes, especially the two Cheshire homes in Shillelagh and Tullow who work with people with disabilities. Facilities have improved, but this is mainly as a result of proactive chairmen or executives in charge who know how to source funding and go about these improvements.</P>
    <P>The Department should take a more proactive role in providing information to people on their entitlements, ranging from the small security alarm to family income supplement. There is a significant information deficit with regard to what is available. We often pat ourselves on the back for passing legislation, but the tangible results seldom filter down to the people because it takes so long going through the Department and the Health Service Executive that the people at the bottom do not get the information.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister of State about another issue which is not directly related to the Bill but is related to the health area, namely, the provision of community first responders and defibrillators. I know he was at a recent successful launch in Kilcullen. It should be a legal requirement for nursing homes and public hospitals to have these. Many do not have this equipment which only costs &euro;1,600. I have asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on several occasions over recent years to make it a condition of planning permission for buildings that will attract over a certain number of people that defibrillators are provided and that it be a legal requirement for staff to be trained in their use. This equipment saves lives and would be of particular value in nursing home establishments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, on bringing forward the Bill and on his commitment to older people since he became Minister of State.</P>
    <P>We owe it to our older people to ensure they can live out their lives in comfort and in the confidence that the system supports and respects them. <Col N="366"/>Some 11% of our population is over the age of 65. In 1986, we had approximately 390,000 people over 65 in the country. Today we have approximately 465,000, and that will have increased before the next census. It is estimated that by 2036 we will have more than 1 million elderly people. Government and State agencies face a major challenge to ensure that we put in place the services to cater for our increasing elderly population.</P>
    <P>We owe it to our older people to provide services. These people built up our economy and produced the present generation and we must give them every support possible. It has been Government policy going back to 1990 to support older people to stay in their own houses for as long as possible. The welcome introduction of subventions changed that philosophy to some extent. It created the impression that the Government and agencies were anxious that people should go into residential care. However, we need to strike the balance between the incentive for people to stay in their houses for as long as possible and go into residential care when they have no other option.</P>
    <P Just="Left">While people may have reasons for wanting to leave the homes and communities where they have lived all their lives and go into residential care, generally older people want to stay in their own houses where they have community and local support. They want to remain in their own houses for nostalgic and family reasons. They may have been born there and generations before them may have been born there. They know the geography and the environment of the house. As they get older they know how to move around the house without sustaining injury. They like to look after furniture and other possessions they may have bought years earlier and to which they may have sentimental attachment. The house could contain old photographs that are important to them. They have accumulated memorabilia etc. All these matters are important for old people and they cannot take them into residential care. They generally need to leave almost everything behind. While they can bring a photograph album, they cannot bring furniture or pottery, for example, which is a source of comfort for many old people. It is important to give them the option to stay in their own homes for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>Accommodation and hygiene facilities have improved considerably. In the 1960s many houses had no running water or toilet. Young people today would not understand that was the reality. There are now very few houses without running water, and basic toilet and bathroom facilities. However, they can be improved. A number of schemes are available to allow people improve their accommodation, including the essential repairs grant, disabled person&rsquo;s grant and housing aid scheme for the elderly. With the increase in building costs, at times it is impossible to get a builder to carry out house improvement or repair, because builders are so busy. Many of them are <Col N="367"/>not prepared to take on small jobs like putting in a bathroom, repairing a room or even replacing a roof on a house. While at one time builders appreciated getting these types of jobs, now they are not interested.</P>
    <P>The grant aid available is derisory compared with what should be available. An ordinary job is likely to cost at least &euro;10,000. Generally people would get a grant of &euro;5,000 for such a job, leaving them to make up the remaining &euro;5,000 somehow. It is very hard for an old person to go to a bank or credit union to get a loan. Obviously elderly people are at a disadvantage because they might not live long enough to pay off the loan. Older people do not like to borrow money to make up such a deficit. Essential repairs should be at least 90% funded, with a small contribution from the householder in order to ensure that people can live in comfort with a roof that does not leak and have a decent toilet. The essential repairs grant generally covers only windows, roofs and doors, and does not cover basic facilities such as toilet facilities and showers. Although the essential repairs grant has been improved considerably and it is possible to get up to &euro;20,000, it is still not adequate.</P>
    <P>Older people need to be able to get a hot meal each day and they need good hygiene conditions. They need an accessible shower even more than having a bath, as they find it difficult to get into and out of a bath. They should have a decent shower at least and should have the facilities to cook at least one hot meal a day. In such circumstances, people live longer, more comfortably, and in better health and humour. While the disabled person&rsquo;s grant scheme has been improved, it should be reviewed further and made more generous. A very small number of people will benefit from it.</P>
    <P>The housing aid scheme for the elderly, administered by the Health Service Executive, has been quite effective in the provision of storage heating, for example, and other minor repairs. It is not hamstrung by the same bureaucracy, as is the case with the essential repairs or disabled person&rsquo;s grants. It generally provides quick aid to elderly people to install heating, showers or for other minor jobs perhaps including adapting the house for disabled people. More provision should be made for the scheme. In my county the funds get exhausted after four or five months and there is a long waiting list. In some cases by the time people get the grant they may have already gone into residential care or may even have died.</P>
    <P>The other aids for elderly people are the home help scheme and the carer&rsquo;s allowance. Last year in the southern region the hours of home help provided were cut considerably. People who were getting one hour&rsquo;s home help found it cut to half an hour. Those getting four hours&rsquo; home help found it cut to two hours. When the country is flush with money, it is very difficult to explain to older people why the person, who comes to cook <Col N="368"/>the dinner, wash the clothes, clean the house, keep them company and keep them abreast of what is happening in the locality, can only come for two hours instead of four hours, when in reality it should be six hours. The provision of home help should be extended rather than cut back.</P>
    <P>I do not have the figure for the number of carers in the country. However, those in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance constitute only a small proportion of those who provide care and attention. Many carers do not receive recognition. They should have their work recognised within the PRSI system by treating it as an insurable occupation, even where the care is provided to a family member. Although the carer&rsquo;s allowance has been reviewed and improved and a more generous means test has been introduced with the result that more people qualify for the allowance, the scheme needs to be further reviewed to ensure more carers can access it.</P>
    <P>If a person&rsquo;s home setting is physically appropriate and personnel are available to provide home support, it will encourage him or her to stay at home rather than enter residential care. The benefit to society is that this option costs less. The cost to the State of residential care is in excess of &euro;1,000 per week. Keeping people at home, on the other hand, provides employment opportunities for local people who can supplement their income by offering home help services. The home help scheme is a good, well managed service offered by many community groups through F&Aacute;S. It should be extended and made more attractive.</P>
    <P>The community has a major role to play in home care. Every reasonably sized community should have a facility for older people who wish to have a shower or hot meal, read the newspapers or interact with their peers. I am involved in a project in Knockanure, County Kerry, where a derelict school has been renovated to provide facilities for older people. We have installed a state-of-the-art shower room, laundry service and kitchen, as well as a multi-purpose open area which can be used as a restaurant, for adult education and entertainment purposes and to host functions for funeral or party groups. It can also be used by the Health Service Executive with nurses, doctors, chiropodists, physiotherapists and other health professionals able to visit the facility. Similar facilities are in place elsewhere, for example, in Mulranny, County Mayo, but additional resources are required to develop more of them. The Knockanure project is a good example of how community facilities can succeed and could serve as a model for other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>When home and community supports are available, people are less inclined to enter residential care. However, for those with no other option, the nursing home subvention is not sufficient to cover the cost of residential care. Sufficient private nursing care beds are available, but an inadequate number of public beds means people <Col N="369"/>cannot afford nursing home care, even with a subvention. Those unable to afford private care should be given the option of a public bed, but this is not feasible because so few beds are available. The result is the practice whereby the Health Service Executive contracts beds from private operators.</P>
    <P>Residents of private homes must use their savings to fund the cost of care. Once these have been spent, they face the prospect of leaving the home either to return to their families or to avail of an alternative arrangement, of which there are few. The maximum subvention, including enhanced subvention, is approximately &euro;300. Nursing homes must charge in excess of &euro;500 just to survive and meet the costs of electricity, insurance, water and refuse charges, staff costs for nurses, carers, cleaners and so forth. For this reason, a number of them have closed in recent times.</P>
    <P>The level of nursing home subvention needs to be reviewed because it is insufficient to allow people to maintain themselves in residential care. I am sure the Minister of State will have heard stories of people being placed under severe pressure to meet the costs of care, including being forced to sell their homes and use their savings. If a person has &euro;100,000 in savings, it will be quickly eroded if the weekly cost of care, after subvention has been deducted, is &euro;300. This is a major problem.</P>
    <P>I recently learned of the retirement village concept, which has long been in vogue in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Scandinavia and, more recently, Britain. A typical retirement village is located in a parkland setting of between 25 and 40 acres. It will usually consist of 150 to 200 individual houses and apartments grouped in courtyard style and clustered around a central garden area. A central services complex contains a wide range of communal services, including shops, restaurant, bar, chapel, library, therapy pool, gym and meeting and activity rooms. A nursing home with medium to high dependency care rooms provides 24 hour medical support to all village residents who also have access to physiotherapy and other services. All residential units have alarms connected to the medical centre and all residents are provided with a wide range of domestic and maintenance services. This type of retirement village is being developed for<?oasys _jy ?>the first time in Ireland in Carnelly Village,<?oasys _jy ?>Clarecastle, County Clare.</P>
    <P>The Department should examine the concept of the retirement village given its manifold benefits. For example, elderly people with a range of health problems and disabilities can live a normal domestic life in their own home with comprehensive back-up services. In addition, all services and requirements are met on site with residents having an option of accessible transport services to nearby towns, access to a wide range of activities, clubs and hobbies, 24-hour medical assistance and an on-site ambulance service. <Col N="370"/>Facilities also include a 24-hour on-site security presence and daily assistance with domestic chores as well as delivery of meals if required, emotional support and assistance from qualified personnel and other services.</P>
    <P>The best approach to care is to keep people at home for as long as possible for the reasons I have outlined, especially given the affinity of Irish people to their hearth and home. Home services and visits should be provided to ensure people are living comfortably and the community network, which provides support to those living at home, is strengthened. Where this is not an option, the possibility of moving to a retirement village or sheltered housing should be considered. The final option should be to move into residential care. Implementing this approach should be the Minister of State&rsquo;s objective. He has a further nine months in office in which to achieve it, after which he could well be replaced by Deputy Wall.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill offers the opportunity to discuss a major problem faced by Irish people, namely the age of our population. I cannot believe the Bill&rsquo;s provisions on means testing are not being opposed by my party. Throughout Ireland&rsquo;s history, people have always maintained that their home is their kingdom. This will be the only instance where the Government and its agencies will use the home as part of the means test. Senior citizens will be forced to have their houses evaluated before they can receive the care they need. It is unthinkable that a person may have worked a lifetime to obtain a family home and at the end, due to the necessity to sell their home, all the work done over the years and time and effort put into rearing their family in the family home may be put in jeopardy by this legislation.</P>
    <P>There are other worrying aspects to this. In recent months, I dealt with the case of a woman who had to leave an excellent job in England to return to Ireland to care for her mother. While looking after her mother, who lived in a house that had been improved by her family over many years, the woman received the carers allowance but when she later began to suffer ill-health, her mother had to be moved to a nursing home. The woman was subsequently paid a disability allowance, which was lucky because, if she was not, the old legislation would have probably required the sale of the home to pay for the mother&rsquo;s care and, despite all the effort and time spent caring for her mother, the woman would have had to seek alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>This Bill does nothing to allow someone who spent a lifetime caring for a loved one to remain in the family home, yet everyone seems to agree on its importance. The other day, Deputy Ring criticised a different Bill as being difficult to understand. I find it difficult to understand how we can allow this Bill through the House without a vote on Second Stage. What will happen to the people who live in homes which they consider as <Col N="371"/>their kingdoms? If the house is of a certain value, it may have to be sold when a family member needs care.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why we are being so selective in our decisions on who to exclude under the provisions of this Bill. It is not unusual that a relative could care for a loved one in the family home for 20 or 30 years without any payment, yet such a person is being excluded under this legislation because he or she is not a spouse or child of the applicant or a relative in receipt of disability or similar allowance. No heed is given to the relative who may have eked out an existence from a small family holding while also caring for loved ones. I hope, when this Bill is on Committee Stage, amendments are tabled to change that aspect of the means test because it is not acceptable in its present form to anyone who works with senior citizens.</P>
    <P>Who is to determine long-term care? The care may be short-term from the point of view of the family concerned. The care recipient may improve through medical care to the point where he or she can return home. However, we are insisting on including this as part of the means test.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Taoiseach lost his cool with Deputy Joe Higgins over the family home, yet today we are allowing this Bill to pass through the House. I wonder whether it is constitutional to allow the family home to be assessed in this manner. I will raise this matter with the Labour Party spokesperson on health and, if amendments are not brought, I will consider my response in terms of the amendments I can bring.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform admitted that he would like to charge senior citizens for their long stays in the general hospitals. I know people stay a long time because I have advised people to remain in hospitals because step down facilities were not available to them. They had no choice other than to try to go back to the family home where no one was in a position to care for them. There were two parts to the nursing home subvention. The first subvention amounted to &euro;192 and it was divided into three so that if a person was fit enough to shave, for instance, he would not receive the maximum payment. Yet, can anyone show me one nursing home that would assess a person on that basis? If a person could say his brother-in-law or sister-in-law was mobile, would a nursing home say they would be charged less? It has not happened and it will not happen. The maximum fee is charged for everyone.</P>
    <P>Enhanced subvention was later introduced, causing constant suffering for the unfortunate people who were trying to get the money together for care. It was a complex, pressurised situation because we did not have proper step-down facilities. There should be an orchestrated plan to provide step-down facilities rather than putting the family home, which is dear to everyone, under <Col N="372"/>threat. This Bill places the family home under threat, and we can like it or lump it. I have raised it at Labour Party parliamentary party meetings and will continue to do so. I will table amendments to have this legislation changed in that regard. I ask the Minister of State to examine the relevant section as well.</P>
    <P>St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Athy, should be developed to allow more step-down beds. A great team works there and the facilities of the wheelchair association, sheltered housing and a day care centre are available. It is an ideal location to link with Naas General Hospital and provide step-down facilities for senior citizens who will probably return to the family home.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should also consider those excluded by the means test. There is no logic to the treatment of the case I mentioned. After leaving a good job in England to return to Ireland, a woman became ill while caring for her mother. She was fortunate to be in receipt of disability allowance, otherwise the family home would have had to be sold. If she had been in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance, the family home would have been sold because of its value and the inability of this society to care for a person in those circumstances.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>Other speakers referred to facilitating older people in the family home. It is not easy because of the high percentage of people in employment. No one is critical of this but we must assure those who work that care of the older person is being provided in the home. This is not the case at present. I know of some people who have not been paid for the home care package for four weeks. What good is a home care package if it is not efficient and streamlined? This is a stumbling block.</P>
    <P>At local authority level, major problems exist with the disabled person&rsquo;s grant and the essential repairs grant. In many instances, insufficient staff are available to investigate the problems and consultants must be employed for this purpose. Small builders, who would do the job out of friendship, are losing out. Everyone involved must endure months of waiting, agony and torment. The person who needs the repairs is unfortunate because he or she could not afford it originally, everyone is on the builder&rsquo;s back because of the bills accumulated and the public representative is trying to co-ordinate matters but failing.</P>
    <P>This process should be streamlined because it is not working efficiently. The application for the disabled person&rsquo;s grant must be submitted to the council and be referred to the Health Service Executive, the medical director of services, back to the council and then to the engineer before the applicant must seek three quotations. The council must then choose one of the bids before informing the applicant that work can proceed. Forests in South America are in danger because <Col N="373"/>of the amount of paperwork involved in the disabled person&rsquo;s grant and the essential repairs grant. The person most worried of all is the senior citizen who cannot enjoy retirement without the necessary facilities. This Bill will create problems for everyone because taking the family home into account for assessment creates the doubt that the owner may not be able to pass it on to a family member and keep the family tradition in the community. The family home is one&rsquo;s kingdom and should never be considered in a means test. I hope common sense will prevail and that after Committee and Report Stages, the home will remain the pearl in family life. There should be no threat to the family home. It is unbelievable that the family home is under threat to protect a senior citizen or provide for a senior citizen in a long-term nursing home. The mind boggles.</P>
    <P>I hope mechanisms are put in place to access the disabled person&rsquo;s grant and the essential repairs grant. The HSE team that carries out necessary repairs could be increased to meet the demand for the disabled person&rsquo;s grant and the essential repairs grant. The team is very helpful to senior citizens. Streamlining this process and providing a home care package would represent value for senior citizens. These people have worked hard to provide for us and we will wish for the same level of care when we reach that age. I hope we will never see the family home considered as part of a means test of any payment.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>I was in the Chair before the current Acting Chairman and listened to interesting contributions on this matter. In a few years, care of the elderly will be near the top of the pile of major policy issues for the Government of the day and will be a challenge for the Department of Health and Children. The solution to the accommodation needs of individuals who are in their golden years will not necessarily be found in the policy initiatives that will come directly from the Department of Health and Children. There are other Departments which will play a role in that regard and the need for collaboration and co-ordination of public policy is fairly obvious.</P>
    <P>For a long time institutional care was seen by many families as the ready-made solution for the care of an elderly person with a certain level of dependancy who, where family help was not available, could not be looked after in a family setting. With the development the private nursing home matrix across the country, we all are aware that the cost of nursing home care is substantial. A stay in a nursing home, particularly on the east coast, is very expensive. In one way or another, either the families who have a responsibility for the elderly person or perhaps a combination of the families and the State through the contribution of the subvention scheme, are paying substantially for that care in a nursing home.</P>
    <P>The effect of virtual full employment on the availability of family support means the extent of <Col N="374"/>family help available in the home setting is not what it was in previous years. I remember talking to an official, originally from Sweden, at an OECD function somewhere in Europe ten or 12 years ago when I was a Minister of State in the then Department of Agriculture. When the subject of the care of the elderly came up in general chat, he told me that in Sweden family help to look after the elderly was no longer available and they had to look after the elderly in institutional care. In Ireland at the time, which is relatively recently, the thrust of family attitudes towards elderly parents was to keep them in a home setting as long as possible and I hope this continues to be the underlying attitude of family members. It is not always possible. We must be realistic. If people must go out to work and do not have helpers available to look after their elderly parents, the option of putting them into a nursing home is obviously considered.</P>
    <P>With advances in medicine people are living longer. The longer people live, the greater the level of dependency increases. Once the level of dependency increases, it can be difficult to look after the elderly in a home setting.</P>
    <P>A number of today&rsquo;s speakers raised the issue of day facilities and Deputy Deenihan referred to the development in County Kerry. There are two good examples of day facilities of which I am aware and they are ideal models for any development of such facilities. One is in the Acting Chairman, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s, constituency in Ballincollig in County Cork and the other is in Summerhill in County Meath. These are excellent examples of where, through the combination of the statutory and voluntary sectors, the provision of transport and a day care outlet can help considerably to keep senior citizens in a home setting. If people can be looked after in a day care facility when siblings are at work, it makes it much easier to look after them in the home setting for a much longer period. I am sure the officials and the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, are aware of these two projects. Lessons are clearly there to be learned from the experiences gained and gleaned from those involved with the development of these two projects. They provide a template to copy for people who are interested in developments in this area in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>There is a number of relevant schemes available such as the housing aid for the elderly scheme and the disabled person&rsquo;s grant scheme. We in County Louth have an excellent co-ordinator dealing with the housing aid for the elderly scheme who is getting great value for money and helping out many families by stretching his budget considerably through his good organisational and co-ordinating skills. Perhaps the scheme is not so successful in other parts of the country and there may well be a need to look at it to see whether it can be streamlined, enhanced or made more helpful to those who need modifications or adjustments to their home setting.</P><Col N="375"/>
    <P>House design can pose a serious problem where an elderly person or a person with a degree of immobility or disability lives in a two-storey house, with deep stairs, where all the bedrooms are upstairs. In one case in Dundalk of which I am aware, a widow lived on her own in a fine three-bedroom house which was built in the late 1950s by the then Dundalk Urban District Council. The three bedrooms were upstairs and because of her arthritic condition she simply was not in a position to use those bedrooms and temporary sleeping accommodation had to be provided on the ground floor. There is a number of observations one can make about that. First, she was living in a three-bedroom house and there was serious underutilisation of the house as a unit and, second, the temporary accommodation led to conditions which were clearly unsatisfactory. While the housing aid for the elderly scheme personnel made changes and modifications, these did not entirely meet the needs of that person. If there was greater flexibility in the availability of housing, the quality of life of the individual could be improved considerably and perhaps the dwelling could be freed up for a young family which might need housing in the area. I recall speaking to some of the officials about this issue, particularly in the context of planning and the layout and design of a housing scheme. If, rather than providing for one house design only in a housing scheme, they could design developments to include different models within the same housing scheme, people could start off in a conventional house and with the passage of time, move to more person-friendly accommodation such as an OPD designed or purpose-built house thereby freeing up their house for others. I realise that with the enhanced asset value of housing, it is not so easy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wall referred to sheltered housing of which there are some excellent models around the country. There are two in south Monaghan which come to mind, one of which, in Lisdoon, I visited recently. It is a credit to the local voluntary committee which planned, designed and executed the project. It has 14 two-bedroom units and a community house including bedroom accommodation at a reasonable cost for visitors of elderly relatives living in the scheme. Of course it has kitchens and facilities for visiting HSE personnel. It is clearly a model for other similar developments around the country.</P>
    <P>Local authority housing policy is also a relevant issue. For obvious reasons, local authorities think in terms of providing three-bedroom houses, whether through Part V or however, for young families, but houses for persons in their golden years are down the priority list. With the changes in demographics which are clearly coming and which have been quoted here by a number of speakers, it is necessary to examine the planning and design of housing schemes to make provision for the sheltered housing concept in as many villages and towns as possible, and to ensure people <Col N="376"/>live as near as possible to basic community facilities such as shops and the church, particularly in the case of the elderly, and the school. Sheltered housing developments should be located as near as possible to such community facilities and that is an obvious policy objective.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>I am another public representative who wrestles on a daily basis with the exigencies of the subvention scheme, which is, perhaps, too complex. I acknowledge that the State must bear a significant cost but the scheme is important in the context of helping families to support elderly relatives who need institutional care. It is a vital support, without which families would not get by. Means testing on the basis of the value of the family home is a thorny and sensitive issue but it must be recognised that, inevitably, such homes will be inherited and they are a significant asset. The State, in consideration of these matters, must take property into account. However, the simplification and streamlining of the means test as well as the widening of the eligibility criteria so that more people can avail of it should also be an objective. I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, who has a deep personal interest in developing this area. If he remains in office for a long time, his workload will increase given the impending demographic changes.</P>

<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for their participation in the debate over recent weeks. They covered many of the issues affecting elderly people and they are very much in touch with their constituents and the difficulties a number of them encounter. It is Government policy to help older people maintain themselves in their homes and communities for as long as possible, in line with their wishes, and to provide for appropriate residential care where this is no longer possible. The subvention scheme, which was introduced in 1993 on foot of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, provides financial assistance to older people towards the cost of private nursing home care. It was never intended that the subvention payment would cover the full cost of care.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to ensure that the existing subvention scheme for private nursing home care is firmly grounded in primary legislation. Once enacted, it will replace the 1993 regulations. The Bill will also go a long way towards helping the Health Service Executive to implement the scheme on a standardised basis across the country by ensuring increased clarity and reducing room for interpretation. Since it was established as a national body, the HSE has striven towards the implementation of common frameworks and processes throughout the State in regard to services for older people, including the subvention scheme, and the legislation contributes to that overall goal.</P><Col N="377"/>
    <P>Significant changes are projected regarding older people, especially in the medium to long term, to which a number of Members referred. It is estimated that, this year, 463,000 people will be aged 65 years and over. Latest population projections suggest that this figure will increase to more than 1.1 million by 2036, with an increase in the old age dependency ratio from 18% to 39%. The number of people aged 85 and over is projected to increase from 46,700 to 155,500 during the same period, and this trend is expected to continue until 2056 when the old age dependency ratio is projected to reach 60%. These demographic trends clearly demonstrate there will be an increase in the pressure for services and a corresponding increase in the cost of care. Funding the long-term care needs of older people, both in residential and community facilities, is among the most difficult and complex areas in the health sector. It is for this reason that an interdepartmental group was set up last year to examine the long-term care of older people, and its report is being considered by Cabinet. It deals with a number of the issues raised by Members.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made in increasing the funding available for services for older people in recent years and this increase, together with the investment package provided for in the 2006 budget, is indicative of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the ongoing development of health funded services for older people. Our focus is on keeping people in their homes and communities for as long as possible with the appropriate supports in place. This is what the majority of older people want and this will contribute greatly to their quality of life in their later years. I do not say everything is fine because services for the elderly were underfunded for a long time. However, the funding announced in the budget will be the beginning of major investment in such services. There will always be those who require residential care, and following the enactment of this Bill and in light of the deliberations of the working group on long-term care, we must consider the future of care for older people, both in residential and community settings. We will try to achieve an equitable, balanced approach, both for residential and community care and for public and private provision.</P>
    <P>I will respond to a number of issues raised by Deputies during the debate. Many of them referred to nursing home standards. Public consultation on the legislative proposals contained in the draft heads of the health Bill 2006 has concluded. Under the proposals in the draft heads, the health information and quality authority, HIQA, will set standards on safety and quality of services provided by, or on behalf of, the Health Service Executive and will monitor and advise the Minister and the executive on compliance with those standards. Provision is also being made to give the HIQA the power to investigate, at the <Col N="378"/>request of the Minister or the HSE, the safety, quality and standards of such services and to make recommendations it deems necessary. The chief inspector of social services will be required to monitor against standards set by HIQA.</P>
    <P>Standards for private nursing homes are set out in the Care and Welfare Regulations 1993 and private homes are also inspected under these regulations. The Department&rsquo;s focus is on protecting vulnerable older people and providing for the highest possible standards of care for older people in all long-stay facilities. In advance of the HIQA being fully established and functional, the Department set up a working group which is developing national standards that both private and public nursing homes will have to meet. This group is chaired by the Department and members include representatives of the Department, the HSE, the social services inspectorate and the Irish Health Service Accreditation Board, IHSAB. These standards are being developed in line with best international practice and will put the resident at the centre of care. It is intended that these standards will be ready in draft form in July and a consultation process will follow, thus enabling all interested parties to give their views. The IHSAB has developed accreditation standards which, when introduced, will be voluntary. There will not be a statutory obligation on a nursing home to comply with them. The accreditation standards are the very highest level quality of care which can be achieved in the setting and which all service providers should work towards. Thus, the standards being developed by the interdepartmental working group will provide a foundation that must be achieved and that enables organisations to aim for and work towards accreditation under the IHSAB scheme.</P>
    <P>The issue of standardising enhanced subventions was raised. The HSE continues to have discretion on enhanced subvention. Where a person cannot meet the costs of care without undue hardship, the HSE can pay enhanced subvention and is given discretion so that the granting of it can be flexible. Amounts of enhanced subvention vary from case to case and depend on the particulars of the case in question, the cost of nursing home care in the area and the resources available to the HSE. An additional &euro;20 million has been allocated to the nursing home subvention scheme in 2006 and the aim is to standardise means tests and bring greater consistency to the different levels of enhanced subvention support throughout the country.</P>
    <P>A number of Members also sought clarification on the operation of the subvention scheme. The Bill provides the framework for the subvention scheme and provides that the HSE must issue guidelines on how the scheme will work. For example, it must outline the process to be followed to decide the amount of subvention to be paid to an applicant. The Bill also provides that <Col N="379"/>these guidelines must be issued on the Internet. This will ensure the guidelines are easily accessible to those requiring information on how the scheme works.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Members raised a number of other issues and I will try to deal with them as quickly as possible. When the scheme was first introduced in 1993, &pound;5 million was provided for its operation. The following year, that sum was increased to &pound;15 million and this year, &euro;160 million will be spent on the scheme. I am aware the scheme is far from perfect and major changes must be made to it.</P>
    <P>In particular, I wish to raise the issue of the tenders sought from nursing homes in 2005. At the time, the Eastern Regional Health Authority sought tenders for high dependency and intermediate care. In that instance, nursing homes were being asked to provide for the needs of patients who had been inappropriately accommodated in acute hospitals. Such patients required specific care of a type that would not normally be found in most private nursing homes. Given the specific nature of the requirements, some applicants were not in a position to meet them and consequently, they were not granted a contract.</P>
    <P>However, that does not mean that such nursing homes are not in a position to provide traditional nursing home care. The inference that a large number of nursing homes are not in a position to provide care only serves to create undue worry for people. An inspection system is in place and, as I noted earlier, it will be improved. On its introduction, the new system will apply to both public and private nursing homes. However, it is unfair to create the impression that many nursing homes do not provide proper care.</P>
    <P>Members again mentioned home care packages today. It is completely incorrect to assert that the Government is doing nothing for the elderly as nothing could be further from the truth. In the last budget, it provided major resources to try to improve the lot of older people in respect of areas such as home help and home care packages. A total of 1,100 home care packages were allocated last year and the Government has provided sufficient money to allow for 2,000 additional home care packages, which will be spread nationwide.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring questioned whether any packages had been allocated to County Mayo. As I cannot confirm this, I will investigate the matter and report back to him. However, I would be surprised if they have not been so allocated, certainly by the end of the year. It is intended to spread them throughout the country as they are of major benefit and can keep people out of nursing homes or hospitals. Moreover, having the proper home care packages in place can help those who wish for an early discharge from hospital. The packages have been tested on a pilot basis and as they worked exceptionally well, <Col N="380"/>the Government will continue to invest in them. Deputy Ring also mentioned Ballindine and the great work carried out by John Grant and his staff there. I had the pleasure of visiting that facility quite recently and I agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s statements in this regard.</P>
    <P>The issue of the differing subvention rates paid around the country was raised, as was the issue of enhanced subvention. As I noted earlier, the HSE has discretion to pay a higher rate of subvention in cases in which a person would suffer undue hardship. The level of enhanced subvention is at the discretion of the HSE and depends on individual circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s contribution mentioned the wonderful facilities to be found in the Carnew community care village and I will have the pleasure of visiting it within the next two weeks. I am sure the Deputy is correct and I look forward to the visit.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Government provided approximately &euro;120 million for home help. This year, that sum has been increased by &euro;30 million. While I am aware that Members have cited cases in which home help hours have been reduced, this can depend on a person&rsquo;s individual circumstances. It can be difficult to try to explain this and I hope it will not happen this year. The Government has provided a significant increase in this regard. It is a facility that can mean much to people, can give them great comfort and can allow them to live in their own communities.</P>
    <P>A number of Members asked about the cases pertaining to people who were eligible for public nursing home care but could not access one and were forced to enter a private nursing home and to pay for it. A number of legal cases are pending in this regard, which the State will defend. However, as we must await their outcome, it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wall laid a heavy emphasis on the inclusion of the family home in the Bill. While I appreciate this is a sensitive issue for families, this is not a new provision. It existed in the regulations for the subvention scheme when it was first introduced in 1993. Nevertheless, I realise this is a sensitive issue. One must consider whether a person who occupies a house worth several million euro should be in a position to make some contribution. A group has been studying the financing of the long-term care of older people. This matter is under serious discussion by the Government and announcements will be made in this regard in the near future. Hopefully, the issues raised by Deputy Wall and other Members will be addressed.</P>
    <P>I thank Members again for their contributions, most of which were extremely constructive. I look forward to the further Stages, at which time the views put forward by Members will be considered <Col N="381"/>in detail. I commend the Bill to the House and thank Members for their participation.</P>

    <P Just="Left">Molaim an Bille um an nGn&iacute;omhaireacht Ch&uacute;ltaca Ola N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta don Teach. For the convenience of the House, a detailed explanatory memorandum has been published, which pro<Col N="382"/>vides a synopsis of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions. I do not propose to focus on the detailed provisions of the Bill at this stage. Instead, I will focus on the backdrop against which this Bill is being introduced, as well as the general policies outlined therein.</P>
    <P>As a commodity traded on global markets, the market determines the price of crude oil. Despite recent geopolitical uncertainties in oil producer regions, supply continues to exceed demand and has not been disrupted. Growing global energy demand is likely to result in high prices remaining with us for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>As the second largest energy market in the world, the EU has a growing dependency on energy imports. The sharp rise in oil prices also impacts on jobs and economic growth. Europe has also been to the forefront in embracing the issue of climate change and has set ambitious targets on emissions reductions, promoting new and renewable energy sources and developing low carbon technologies.</P>
    <P>The issue of security of energy supply is one of the priority areas identified on the European Commission Green Paper on energy published earlier this year. The Green Paper sets out the framework for a common energy strategy encompassing security, sustainability and competitiveness. The Government welcomes the new focus at EU level on energy issues, while welcoming the recognition that certain decisions including energy mix remain the prerogative of member states.</P>
    <P>Irish energy policy is set in the global and EU context. While we share many of the same challenges, Ireland has a number of specific characteristics. We are geographically isolated from the main EU market and small in scale with a customer base of less than 2 million. Geography also presents challenges in terms of security of oil supply. As an island with no indigenous oil production or interconnecting pipeline infrastructure, we rely on sea-borne imports mainly from refineries on the UK west coast. We have little in the way of proven indigenous fossil fuel resources and unlike some other European countries there are no significant hydrocarbon resources.</P>
    <P>Ireland has grown increasingly dependent on oil to fuel its economic growth. Continued economic growth is expected to give rise to further increases in the volume of our energy requirements, even as the relative importance of oil to output continues to decline. Oil continues to be the dominant energy source, with that dominance increasing from a share of 46% in 1990 to 58% in 2005. Car usage has grown substantially in Ireland in recent decades, powered by a rapid growth in affluence. The amount of oil used for transportation in Ireland has more than tripled between 1972 and today, leaving Ireland consuming at least 50% more <i>per capita</i> than the EU average.</P>
    <P>Alongside these constraints significant opportunities also exist. The creation of an all-island energy market is an opportunity to increase the scale of the energy market and enhance compe<Col N="383"/>tition, in the interests of consumers North and South. This is the first step towards the creation of a regional energy market within the EU.</P>
    <P>In line with the global shift to renewable energy technologies, in terms of natural resources and research capabilities Ireland is well placed to develop renewable energy. This will have important environmental, economic and social benefits. Action on energy efficiency will have direct benefits for the economy, the environment and individual consumers.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s forthcoming energy policy Green Paper will set out the framework for national energy policy for the medium to long term. The policy proposals will be informed by projections on growth in energy demand and related economic and demographic trends as well as the key imperative to ensure sustainability and security of energy supplies and fuel diversity. Successful delivery of national energy policy objectives requires a sustained and cohesive effort across Government, in conjunction with all stakeholders. A key plank of policy to address the challenges, is to move towards greater deployment of renewable energy and a more energy efficient economy.</P>
    <P>An ambitious agenda across the three principal renewable energy sectors, namely, renewable electricity, transport and heat, provides supports to develop the various renewable technologies. As the Irish economy continues to grow, giving rise to increased energy demand, energy security remains one of the key concerns facing Irish business. Our ability to continue to attract high levels of foreign direct investment and to provide a supportive environment for Irish industry generally will depend on our capacity to deliver a secure and uninterrupted energy supply. This Bill will allow the Government to enhance arrangements already in place in regard to security of oil supplies.</P>
    <P>Oil is a global market and the management of major oil supply disruptions requires an international response. At international level, EU member states and member countries of the International Energy Agency, IEA, have had significant obligations to maintain emergency oil stocks. As a member of the IEA, Ireland is required to maintain emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net imports in the previous year. The EU imposes a similar requirement based on consumption. For some years the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, has been delegated responsibility for maintenance of emergency stocks.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Ireland also has an associated obligation to maintain contingency plans, including arrangements for the release of strategic oil reserves, so as to minimise the adverse effects of an oil supply disruption within the framework of a coordinated international response.</P>
    <P>Ireland has undertaken to operate demand restraint measures in certain circumstances by <Col N="384"/>entering into the agreement on an international energy programme under which the IEA was set up. The agreement obliges participating countries to cut oil consumption by 7% if there is a reduction in supply of at least 7% and by 10% if the supply loss is of the magnitude of 12% or more. Compliance with the agreement guarantees participants a fair share of available oil stocks.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has wide powers under the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts 1971 and 1982 in the event of an emergency to restrict the sale and distribution of petroleum products in order to conserve stocks. The Department actively engages with the National Oil Reserves Agency, and the oil industry on an ongoing basis on contingency planning issues. In the event of oil supply disruption, there would be immediate liaison with industry at the highest level to evaluate the local situation and arrange for a coordinated Irish response within the international framework.</P>
    <P>Ireland&rsquo;s response to an oil supply emergency declared by the IEA, would be either the drawdown of NORA stocks or demand restraint measures or a combination of stockdraw and demand restraint measures. Stockdraw on its own can be authorised by the Minister. Other measures, such as control over the oil companies&rsquo; stocks or the introduction of demand restraint measures, would require formal Government approval under the Fuels Acts 1971 and 1982.</P>
    <P>The Fuels Acts provide for significant State intervention in the market in the event of a major oil supply crisis. Under this legislation, the Government may make an order authorising the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to intervene whenever the Government is of the opinion that &ldquo;the exigencies of the common good necessitate the regulation or control by the Minister on behalf of the State of the acquisition, supply, distribution or marketing of fuels&rdquo; held by the private sector oil companies.</P>
    <P>Once the Government order is made the Minister is empowered to make an order or orders in respect of a certain fuel or fuels. This means that in effect, the stocks held by the oil companies become part of the totality of emergency stocks under the Minister&rsquo;s control and direction. Detailed provisions in the orders give the Minister, for example, powers to regulate the sale of individual products to prevent hoarding or unnecessary topping up of fuel tanks by setting out minimum and probably maximum sales of particular products, especially petrol.</P>
    <P>At this point it is useful to outline the background to the setting up of the National Oil Reserves Agency. Prior to 1995 the oil companies in Ireland were obliged to meet a substantial portion of Ireland&rsquo;s oil stockholding obligations. This system proved unsatisfactory however and, under the European Communities (Minimum Stocks of Petroleum Oil) Regulations 1995, responsibility for the maintenance of strategic stockholding was vested in the National Oil Reserves Agency.</P><Col N="385"/>
    <P>For pragmatic reasons the agency was established as a subsidiary of the INPC. Since 1995, NORA has acted as the agent of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources with the function of arranging for the holding of strategic oil stocks at a level determined annually by the Minister.</P>
    <P>NORA has proved successful in dealing with its remit in a transparent and cost-effective basis. Its establishment in 1995 coincided with the emergence of the Celtic tiger and the phenomenal increase in the country&rsquo;s oil consumption since 1990. This increase has impacted on the volumes of strategic stock required to meet the 90 days obligation of the IEA, and the EU.</P>
    <P>At 1 April 2006 Ireland&rsquo;s oil stock reserves were estimated at 108 days, a figure well in excess of the 90 days obligation. In the event of an international oil supply disruption, this level of emergency reserves is considered to be sufficient to ensure that Ireland could participate effectively in any internationally co-ordinated response. Given the disposal of the Bantry oil terminal and the Whitegate refinery in July 2001, NORA is the sole remaining subsidiary of the INPC. The INPC has had no operational capacity since July 2001. Its current activities are limited to finalising residual issues arising from the 2001 transaction and meeting requirements under company law arising from its role as parent company to NORA. It is against this background that the Government agreed that NORA should be established as an independent body under the aegis of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and should continue to have responsibility for the maintenance of emergency oil reserves.</P>
    <P>In accordance with company law requirements, the Bill provides that the INPC shareholding in NORA will be transferred to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The agency will continue to operate as a private limited company under the Companies Acts. The primary function of the agency will continue to be the maintenance of emergency oil stocks in line with the State&rsquo;s oil stockholding obligations to the EU and the lEA. Ireland&rsquo;s emergency oil stocks comprise wholly owned stocks held in Ireland by NORA and industry or major oil consumers; wholly owned stocks held by NORA in other EU member states under cover of bilateral agreements; and stock tickets held by NORA in other EU member states under cover of bilateral agreements.</P>
    <P>The facility to hold stocks under cover of bilateral agreements is provided for in EU legislation. A member state may hold stocks in the territory of another member state, subject to a bilateral oil stockholding agreement being in place between the respective states. These agreements are government-to-government agreements. Under such agreements, the host country guarantees that it would not oppose the transfer of the oil in question to Ireland in the event of an emergency. <Col N="386"/>The practice of holding stocks abroad is therefore in line with international practice. In the event of a major interruption in oil supplies, there would be no question of Ireland or any other oil-consuming country attempting to deal on its own with an interruption in oil supplies. If such a crisis were to occur, the response, including the release of emergency stocks and the identification of alternative sources of supplies, would take place primarily within the framework of the formal emergency regime developed and maintained by the lEA. To provide for interruptions of oil supplies, the Bill includes provisions for the release of oil stocks held by the agency at the direction of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment in 1995, NORA has never received Exchequer funding. It has been funded by a combination of a levy on disposals of petroleum products and by borrowings from commercial institutions. Since 1995, oil companies and oil exporters have been liable for the levy when NORA was delegated with responsibility for maintaining strategic oil stocks. The levy, which funds the holding and storage of oil and other operating expenses of the agency, is charged at the rate of 0.476 cent per litre on sales of petroleum products. It is applied to oil companies that use petrol, kerosene, gasoil and fuel oil for their own consumption and-or sales of these products within the State. The levy remains unchanged since 1995. The legislative proposals envisage that NORA&rsquo;s operating costs and expenses will continue to be funded by the levy. NORA will continue to administer and collect the levy and will continue to be funded by borrowings from financial institutions to incrementally build up reserve stocks.</P>
    <P>The legislative proposals provide that oil consumer companies as defined in the Bill that hold reserves greater than 55-day reserves, based on the previous year&rsquo;s consumption, may claim an exemption from payment of the levy. This exemption is available to oil consumer companies under the European Communities (Minimum Stocks of Petroleum Oil) Regulations 1995.</P>
    <P>Ireland&rsquo;s obligations to the EU and lEA require the provision of monthly returns relating to oil imports, exports and consumption, together with details of oil stocks held by NORA. These returns allow the EU and the lEA to monitor member states&rsquo; compliance with stockholding obligations. The Bill includes provisions requiring the making of specific written returns by oil companies and oil consumers, and by NORA, within specific timeframes. The proposals on data provision do not include obligations on companies over and above obligations currently imposed. Provisions are proposed to provide for inspection and monitoring of oil companies and major oil consumers and provision is made for summary offences in the event of conviction for non-compliance.</P>
    <P>NORA will continue to operate as a private limited company governed by the Companies <Col N="387"/>Acts and independent of the INPC. In line with corporate governance obligations applicable to State bodies, and in the interest of transparency, NORA will be required to provide annual reports and accounts, together with such information as may be required by the Minister. To enhance the accountability of NORA to both the Minister and the Oireachtas, provision has been made for it to report to relevant Oireachtas committees. Overall, the Bill allows NORA to build on its existing strengths and provides it with the freedom to operate as a stand-alone agency delegated with responsibility for the holding and maintenance of national strategic oil stocks while at the same time ensuring appropriate public policy and corporate governance safeguards.</P>
    <P>The Bill is one of a number of measures which will allow the Government to continue to drive forward its energy agenda. I am confident that its focus on the enhancement of oil security will have considerable benefits for Irish economic development in the decades ahead. I hope I have given the Deputies a reasonable summary of the policies underpinning the Bill. The Minister will be glad to provide any further information they require to facilitate its early enactment. I therefore look forward to hearing the views of Deputies and progressing the Bill into law at the earliest opportunity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill. We have been requesting it for some considerable time on foot of general concerns over fuel and energy over the past 12 months. It has had a longer gestation than we expected, but I am glad it has finally emerged. We welcome it without any shadow of doubt because it gives us an opportunity to talk about the issue with which it is supposed to deal, that is, the availability of vital fuel supplies, especially in a changing world. Political and environmental changes often have an impact on fuel supplies and, consequently, on energy supply. The Bill highlights our need to comply with international agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol, examine the issue of carbon trading and determine its likely cost. We must evaluate the benefit of taking fundamental decisions on the development of our future energy policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to a medium-term energy policy, but if there had been a serious problem in the past six months, there would have been no sense in such a policy. The response would have had to have been immediate. Three plans are always needed and they need to dovetail into one another. One needs a short-term plan at all times for emergencies and it is not sufficient to say a plan will be created when the filling stations run out of fuel. That is too late because one must provide for alternatives in the short term. One must also have a medium-term plan &mdash; the Minister of State is correct in this regard &mdash; and a long-term plan. One grows into <Col N="388"/>the other and, as a result of having them, there will be greater security of supply. Security of supply is an issue causing much concern in this country at present and the more our economy develops, the more important it will become.</P>
    <P>The Bill merely updates and refurbishes existing legislation and puts some emphasis on the needs of today&rsquo;s world. I am a little concerned about access to stocks of fuel that might be stored outside the jurisdiction. The Minister of State referred to international agreements and the requirement to have a reserve that would last for 90 days. In emergencies, however, it may not always be possible for an island nation to obtain access to the stocks on which we rely, notwithstanding international agreements. When replying to the debate, I hope the Minister of State will reassure the House that whatever stocks are available, be they a three-month, 90-day or 108-day supply safeguard, it will be possible to access them at all times and that no country will review their international agreements and say that because they have a problem their supply safeguard will be reviewed and changed to 80 days, 70 days or whatever.</P>
    <P>The next area we must examine is energy because we rightly talk about dependency on oil and various forms of energy in the future. It is timely that the European Commission and the Irish Government has done so but I would have thought that would have happened four or five years ago and that more plans would have been put in place. At least we are doing something about it now.</P>
    <P>What happens from now on is important for a number of reasons. We recognise that our economy will continue to grow at its current rate. In those circumstances, it is likely that the demand for oil and various forms of energy will grow. What do we do about that? The obvious answer is to opt for renewables in so far as we can. It is not possible to do it in every case but they can dramatically reduce the impact in terms of the importation of fuels into this economy, with its associated costs. No fuel, regardless of where it comes from, is free. Nothing is free. We will have to pay for it but the degree to which we depend on imports can be reduced considerably by virtue of developing the alternatives, which come from a number of sources. Incidentally, all fuel is not necessarily road fuel. We can do little about road haulage costs unless we develop a new rail system.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Otherwise, our entire supply and transport system will become stuck. Ireland is not the most densely populated in Europe and, as a result, long distances must be covered in terms of deliveries. The very large delivery trucks that deliver to the multiples are evidence of that. They are on the road day and night and if they stop for 24 hours, the consumer will immediately feel the <Col N="389"/>pain through shortages. Not only will there be shortages of fuel, there will be shortages of everything. Incidentally, when the port tunnel opens, we will be unable to use those large trucks because they will not fit into it. We are heavily dependent on transport, especially the road transport fleet. There is very little we can do in that respect but we can do something in the development of technology.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the Government&rsquo;s recent announcement of its intention to put greater emphasis on developing the sciences, although it should have been done a long time ago and especially on the development of alternative fuels. Little or nothing has been done in that area. All the people involved in the development of alternative fuels in the past ten years have done so virtually on their own, with a certain amount of EU assistance in some cases. A number of the third level institutions took it upon themselves to take the job in hand. From what I am hearing from Government, it appears a serious effort will be made to provide funding for research and development and let science take over areas it should have taken over a long time ago to improve our knowledge in the creation of the alternatives that will be necessary in future. If we do not do that, we will have a serious problem because others will be doing it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the other alternatives, we are an island nation. Imports cannot come in underground; they must come in by air or sea. If we intend to keep up supplies of all commodities, we must rely on the transport sector, which means using fuel. Regarding the domestic motor sector, however, we can reduce that reliance by undertaking some simple tasks. We can encourage the use of vehicles that do not use as much fuel as other vehicles on our roads. I do not want to be critical of any particular type of vehicle but the emphasis should now be on manufacturing vehicles that will travel twice the distance on the same amount of fuel. The beneficial effects of that are manifold. We will not have to import as much fuel in terms of oil or as many alternative fuels.</P>
    <P>There is a notion that all alternative fuels are ozone friendly. That is not the case. Every fuel that burns has a residue that is harmful to the atmosphere to a greater or lesser extent. Generally speaking, renewable energies are about 45% more environmentally friendly than the fossil fuels to which we have become accustomed. There is a notion that once we change to alternative fuels, there will be no more pollution. That can never be the case. That applies to all fuels.</P>
    <P>The development of a more environmentally friendly motor engine is an area all governments throughout Europe must pursue vigorously. The Japanese have managed to do that, and I have spoken about this previously in the House. As well as this, a particular manufacturer &mdash; I will not mention the name &mdash; has spent time developing alternative engines that are not as <Col N="390"/>hungry for fuel, so to speak, as previously. It may not have achieved the ultimate yet but it is working on it. Japan has developed an electric engine for an ordinary domestic car that accelerates to the same extent and has the same qualities and properties as the conventional motor car. That is where the future lies in terms of energy conservation and environmental protection. Those two aspects must be kept together in the future because if we do not do that, we will end up buying carbon credits, which do nothing for the environment. All that means is that somebody else has them to offer. That is an area that can be developed.</P>
    <P>On the miles per gallon question, unfortunately, we have a problem with the heavy road haulage equipment which gives very few miles per gallon and has a very high consumption of fuel. Road haulage is a vital part of our economy, however, and we cannot get away from it, so we must examine what we can do in that regard. When I was a young fellow, the Acting Chairman will be happy to hear that I was curious. I am sure he was curious as well, as was everybody else in the House.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Do the Members present remember the three-speed gear boxes that were in cars at that time? They were in trucks as well but especially in cars. I remember asking why there were not four or five speed gears and an engineer told me that such a gear box could not be made. It could be done, however, and it was done. There is no problem with a six, seven, 16, 17 or 20-speed gear box, depending on the differentials of the ratios introduced. The road transport fleet has such gear boxes but, in the ordinary domestic motor car, there is no problem with six or seven gears. The effect of such a speed box on fuel consumption is major because one can shift gears in an area and get 23, 24 or 25 miles per gallon for an average car. A Volkswagen Beetle used to give approximately 28 miles per gallon. I still have one myself and know the mileage. Increasing the gear ratios and changing the gear box around can double the mileage. One can get twice as much mileage and perhaps even more for the same amount of fuel.</P>
    <P>There is a colossal saving to be made in the development of technology. If we address the issue and devote time to it, it can be done to a major extent. My party is not in favour of carbon tax because that is just like taking a tablet. One takes the tablet and then does the same as before. We will pay the carbon tax and continue on as normal. We must discourage the use of high consumption vehicles by introducing positive incentives and moving towards development of the technology to improve performance. At the same time there should be a financial bonus or incentive by simply going in the direction of the vehicles that are geared for that purpose.</P><Col N="391"/>
    <P Just="Left">On wood burning for domestic heating, which the Government is promoting, and geothermal heating there have certainly been improvements. These solutions are quite expensive, however. The lifespan will eventually determine how valuable they are. Based on my amateur investigations, domestic heating from home-produced oil is an area in which much more could be done in terms of biofuels of all descriptions such as biodiesel, bioethanol etc. These are very simple to introduce. As the Minister of State knows, the fact that biofuel may be home produced does not mean there is not some pollution. There is, and there is also pollution from wood burning, although people tend to regard this as carbon neutral. Carbon neutral, of course, can mean different things to different people. The blunt and short answer is that whatever carbons are trapped in a fuel are released when the fuel is burned. There are some who say they are released over a longer timespan, but in fact they are released quickly.</P>
    <P>There is considerable merit in examining home heating systems. It is important to recall that in the 1960s and 1970s houses were built in this country without chimneys. Everyone was opting for oil at that time and houses were much cheaper to build.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>They did, but as regards the houses without chimneys, it was suddenly discovered that when oil supplies became scarce there was a problem. People then had to build chimneys. Houses are now being built without chimneys as well, with an eye to the future. That is a very dangerous thing to do. Serious problems could arise in the event of there being a difficulty with supply for any reason.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We could find ourselves very glad to get a chunk of wood from a tree to throw into the back of a burner or a stove to keep the house warm. In the promotion of the various schemes, which are fine in themselves, we are all agreed it would be very wise to keep the chimney for a variety of reasons, including emergencies, in the event of a cutback in the supplies of fuel. It might always be easier to get a supply of a locally based fuel than to obtain it from a source 150 to 200 miles away, depending on what part of the country one lives in. I have already mentioned the <Col N="392"/>need for adequate and sufficient oil reserves. I hope the Minister of State will take that on board to ensure, for instance, that we have sufficient oil reserves, as required. At the same time we should develop alternatives and use them wherever they exist. If we do not do that we will face serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the need to develop clean energies for the future and this is important. This goes back to where I started, concerning the need for short, medium and long-term plans. One must start somewhere, so there must be a short-term plan. This should provide that within a specified period targets are set for achieving certain milestones in the first three to five years. Otherwise, if something happens in the meantime we will be in trouble. If that is done and scientific research and development takes over, we can have an important role to play in our own and other economies in future.</P>
    <P>Energy, fuel or power needs in this country should not be discussed without reference to our European colleagues. I say this in the context of the overall need for energy. Depending on where one lives in Europe, one will rely on diverse forms of energy. It is correct that we should develop alternatives. Many other European countries, however, do not tell us the alternatives they have. For example, some countries enjoy a great deal of hydropower, by virtue of the fact they have elevated areas, waterfalls and volumes of water in rivers which give them the advantage, and they can afford to provide a great deal of power in an environmentally friendly way in the production of electricity. A number of European countries have set a good example in terms of developing biofuels. They were ahead of us and I cannot understand this because we should have identified these problems a long time ago. We do not have as many varied alternatives, so we must develop them. They have developed targets and they have short, medium and long-term plans along with a blend of choices &mdash; hydro, fossil fuels, wind and nuclear.</P>
    <P>I shall take the last one first. Many newspaper articles in recent times theorise and highlight the merits and developments of nuclear energy. They quite blatantly assert that modern nuclear energy is clean, safe, reliable and environmentally friendly in every sense of the word. I am not so sure about that. I do not believe our European experiences in recent years do anything to reassure us and I should be very wary of taking that particular road at the current time, for whatever reasons. It might well be economically viable and a solid means of providing power. The safety issue arises all the time. One outcome must be balanced against the other. On the basis of performance to date, I do not accept it is an option at this stage &mdash; perhaps in 20 or 25 years time it will be but I do not know. Technology advances all the time and there will be developments. One has just to recall what happened in the past and the technology is just the same.</P><Col N="393"/>
    <P Just="Left">At the accession of some of the new EU member states, the raft of ten, there were objections from some European countries to the fact that some of the former communist states had old-fashioned technology in terms of nuclear power. In fact they had the same technology as other states. It was no different and everything depended on how it was being maintained. We are not ready for nuclear energy and I do not believe we should go there. It is no reflection on anything we choose to do, but if we cannot build a swimming pool that keeps the water in, and a tunnel that keeps the water out, I should be very dubious about building a nuclear power station and locating a reactor here. There are so many aspects to the whole area, the safety factor in particular, that I am a long way from being reassured. I ask the Minister of State to keep that in mind. I know the Taoiseach has already said that, but that does not prevent speculation in some journals. The intent is quite clear. There are people who have an interest in promoting the nuclear idea. My reason for saying that is simply that this will affect the whole energy requirement throughout Europe. Many of our European colleagues already have a considerable reliance on nuclear energy, including those that are environmentally friendly. Since the technology is already in place, I will not comment on it. However, our situation is somewhat different. When we produce a balanced, reliable energy policy, we must have regard to the necessity to reduce fossil fuels, increase the use of renewable sources of energy and ensure we have a secure supply.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Wind energy is the cleanest energy possible, although some people object to turbines on hilltops. Turbines do not work so well in a valley, but they do on the slope of a hill. Some people are concerned about them, but I feel it is a clean means of producing energy. However, there must be a back-up if the national grid is to be maintained. That back-up is only as good as it is reliable. Many of our European colleagues are keen on nuclear energy, because they can marry the two and solve many problems. We are supposed to be talking about oil, but I have spent much time on wind energy because we will have to reduce our dependence on oil, whether we like it or not, notwithstanding the need to provide a secure supply for a limited period. We need to show intent. We need to give an indication on what we will do in the future. We need to tell our European colleagues about our intentions towards this blend of fuels.</P>
    <P>In the next ten years, there will be a major development in electricity-powered cars. The way in which electricity is generated is an issue that follows from that.</P>

	<P>The use of road transport for domestic traffic is not environmentally friendly, <Col N="394"/>so the use of railways for rapid transport will be the thing of the future. There will always be cars as we cannot walk everywhere and there are parts of the country that are not served by rail. There are many parts of my constituency that are not served by rail, even though many of the towns are so served. In future, facilities in car parks will be on-line to ensure parked vehicles are charged. That has huge potential and the whole way of life we have come to know will be changed. We will make many of these changes of our own volition, some of the changes will be forced upon us and we may have to respond to other changes as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    <P>I travelled into this city late this morning because I was at the opening of the new Intel facility in Leixlip. The tailback starts at the Newcastle Road junction beyond Lucan and continues all the way to the M50 interchange at Palmerstown. The person responsible for this should be asked to focus his or her attention on what is going on here. I counted trucks and cars for two miles moving a few feet at a time. They cannot get off the N4 to get onto the M50 and they are losing fuel at a great rate. At the same time, the ozone layer is going up in smoke.</P>

There is no bank or financial institution that could give a return on investment from a captive audience in the same way as that toll plaza. There are two options.

   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the long-delayed appearance of the National Oil Reserves Agency Bill 2006. I am glad the senior Minister for the Department has now turned up for this debate. There were gaps in the Minister of State&rsquo;s presentation. My understanding was that the target for national reserves is 120 days by January 2007. That is what the National Oil Reserves Agency informed the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources two or three years ago. According to the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, we only have 108 days of reserves. Effectively, a gap of nearly two weeks has appeared on the Minister&rsquo;s watch. I am aware the EU base target is 90 days, but we always felt that 120 days was the target towards which the Government was aiming. We find that the Government has failed in its target for oil reserves.</P>
    <P>There is also concern about the make-up of the reserves.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is misinformed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>When the representatives of the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications Marine and National Resources, they outlined the status of the reserves. The oil companies, the major consumers of oil, held approximately 33% of the reserves at that time and NORA held 33% of them, consisting of wholly owned stocks and 7% in rented stock tickets. The area about which we, as public representatives, were concerned and remain concerned is the percentage of NORA&rsquo;s stocks held abroad. My colleague, Deputy Durkan, raised the issue of the security of those stocks in the hugely volatile situation which could pertain in the future whereby 34% of those stocks are either wholly held abroad or by way of tickets for rented stocks. The construction of NORA&rsquo;s current holdings was dealt with by the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern. I ask the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, as a priority, to deal with this issue when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>We have been waiting for the introduction of this Bill for a long time. A number of energy <Col N="396"/>Bills, including this one, are long overdue and they have been repeatedly put on and taken off the D&aacute;il legislative programme. It has almost been like Lanigan&rsquo;s Ball. An electricity Bill was listed on the programme and then taken off, another electricity Bill was listed and we are told an energy Bill which was on the old list will be tacked on to that Bill as an amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, recently trumpeted his energy awareness credentials and proactiveness in this area, although in his press statements and presentations he was mostly recycling the announcements made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in the budget six months ago. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is now only belatedly getting around to publishing a Green Paper on the future of our energy needs in the dog days of this floundering and dying Administration.</P>

	<P>In the past five years most of our EU colleagues have establish landmark energy policies. As I said to the Minister when we debated the previous energy Bill, two reviews were produced in the past three years by Prime Minister Blair, and we are still waiting for this Administration to act in this area. The energy policy here contrasts badly with that of most of our neighbouring responsible governments.</P>

	<P>As we approach the summer recess, the Government has only got around to bringing forward the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. It appears that neither that Bill nor this Bill will be completed by the time the D&aacute;il goes into recess, which is a shocking scenario. In both of these Bills the Minister will be given emergency powers, which we in the Opposition consider are essential.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, NORA is finally being established as a stand-alone, non-commercial State body and is being given the ensuing commercial flexibility to act efficiently and effectively. I commend the Minister on doing that in this legislation. Since oil is the dominant fuel accounting for 60% in our energy mix it is critical for powering many aspects of our working and everyday life, with the transport sector depending almost 100% on oil for its fuel supply. With no indigenous sources of oil, we are completely dependent on imported sources to keep our economy moving, the lights on, and homes and businesses heated throughout the country. Global supplies of oil are also rapidly being depleted. We had a debate on whether we will approach the peak in oil production in two years&rsquo; time or whether that may happen during the term of office of the next Government or four Governments hence. This <Col N="397"/>Bill afforded the Minister a perfect opportunity to set out his vision for the country in regard to oil supplies.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>We need only contrast the Government&rsquo;s position with that of the Swedish Government. Sweden has put in place an ambitious target for that state to be free of oil imports by 2020. Although many Swedish commentators have questioned the achievability of this target, it is admirable to have such a bold and ambitious vision for that state&rsquo;s energy future and for it to have recognised the dangerous long-term vulnerability of state&rsquo;s such as our own, which are so addicted to oil as an energy source.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was amazed recently when an executive in a well known energy company referred to the competitive nature of the liquid fuels market &mdash; he was contrasting the liquid fuels market with the electricity market. Consumers would be entitled to ask the question, to what competitive market was that gentleman referring. When I travelled from Dublin to the Donegal South-West constituency and to a constituency in Limerick on business for the Labour Party recently, I was astonished to be presented with virtually the exact same price for petrol and diesel to the exact same decimal point from one end of the country to the other. Where is the competition in that market? There is no competition in the retail fuels market. There appears to be simply a cartel operating among a few large operators in each area of the market. We know for certain that cartels operate within the heating oil sector and recently there was a series of court convictions in that regard.</P>
    <P>We have heard news today that Topaz will take over the Statoil network of petrol stations, having taken over the Shell service stations last year. That means that Topaz will supply more than 400 services stations throughout this country and it will have a significant interest in oil importation and storage in Dublin, Cork and Galway. The latest news today means that Topaz will control 40% of the retail market and 45% of the commercial market. Does that not represent dominant market power? Do the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment not have grave responsibilities in this regard? This Bill could have presented an opportunity to set parameters for real competition in the domestic oil market. I am aware that the Bill primarily deals with the critical issue of oil reserves, but it could have been used as a vehicle to promote a truly competitive market. The Minister spoke in the context of our Labour Party policy of bringing forward measures in that respect in the communications Bill. Our policy is to give co-competition powers to ComReg and to <Col N="398"/>the Competition Authority to regulate broadband companies. Is there not also a strong case to give CER, the energy regulator, some co-competition powers, with the Competition Authority, over the oil market as the regulator has over the gas and electricity markets? We should consider expanding section 30 to allow NORA to transmit regular key information on the Irish oil industry and market to CER and the Competition Authority and to give those agencies a clear additional mandate to vigorously police the oil industry.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes the issue of fuel and energy poverty should be placed at the top of the political agenda, as I have said to the Taoiseach on the Order of Business on several occasions. Last winter we had the spectacle of vulnerable and low income elderly householders trying to avoid turning on their oil and gas central heating until as late as possible in the evening. I met some elderly people who were wearing overcoats in their homes in the afternoon because they could not afford to turn on the heating. People in rural areas in particular are heavily dependent on oil central heating. Is it not the job of the Minister and the Government to devise strategies to keep our senior citizens and other vulnerable citizens warm this coming winter? Last winter was the coldest one I remember. In so far as profiteering and market dominance in oil pricing is occurring, this Bill is a lost opportunity by the Government to help restore competitive markets.</P>
    <P>Section 16 permits NORA to establish subsidiaries which I warmly welcome. Given the enormous difficulties we have had in regard to the Shell Corrib field, will the Minister consider inserting a provision in this section whereby NORA might have a subsidiary interest in the area of exploration? The Corrib saga showed a total dearth of information &mdash; the Minister will recall our meetings at the early part of the Corrib crisis and the Private Notice Questions the Acting Chairman, Deputy Cowley, and I tabled &mdash; on Ireland&rsquo;s possible offshore oil and gas resources. The petroleum affairs division of the Department at that time seemed to be overwhelmed by the complexity of the issues. Is it not clear that Ireland&rsquo;s oil and energy security should be addressed in a holistic manner?</P>
    <P Just="Left">This State, like Norway, Denmark, Canada and many other oil and gas provinces, must be in a position to deal with the oil majors from a position of knowledge and strength &mdash; and knowledge is strength. A prerequisite for this could be to have an enhanced NORA with full powers to protect our oil security, including managing the likely exploration process in the best interests of the people. I might return to this aspect by tabling amendments on Committee Stage when the Bill is dealt with by the Select Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and the Minister might support such a proposal.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Forf&aacute;s recently released a report entitled A Baseline Assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s Oil Dependence: Key Policy Consideration. As the Minister <Col N="399"/>will remember, the report examined the extent of the vulnerability of the Irish economy to the peaking of oil production and the policies that were urgently necessary for preparing for such an event. The Forf&aacute;s report highlighted our over-dependence on imported oil and the increasingly vulnerable situation of our society and economy as the supply of oil peaks and dwindles. This is the reality. It is like climate change. We can no longer challenge this reality &mdash; only idiots challenge the reality of climate change or that of the peaking of oil production. They are happening. It is clear from the Forf&aacute;s report that Ireland has one of the highest rates of import dependency across the EU, and that our consumption of oil <i>per capita</i> has increased by more than 50% between 1990 and 2002. Imported oil and gas accounted for over 73% of primary energy used in 2004 compared with 45% in 1990, and oil is the most significant element in that mix. In 2004, oil accounted for 55.8% of Ireland&rsquo;s total primary energy requirement. Our requirement has remained relatively static over recent years, but without indigenous oil production, we are in a vulnerable situation. We are vulnerable to any disruptions in supply because of bad weather, problems with suitable transportation vessels, industrial action at a domestic or international level or the onset of a major crisis. Every few months we hear there may be another crisis.</P>
    <P>Energy planning by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government continues to take place in a haphazard and <i>ad hoc</i> manner. While I welcome any measure to enhance security of supply in the State, the Minister and his predecessor have not contributed to this security by their failure to act dynamically and urgently to diversify fuel mix &mdash; Deputy Durkan outlined well how it could do this &mdash; help break our total reliance on imported supplies of fossil fuels and contribute to actions to combat global warming.</P>
    <P>Under EU and IEA requirements, our basic requirement is to hold 90 days of strategic oil reserves. We were told our target was 120 days, but today we found out the Government has not met the target.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy was misinformed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Not for the first time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister can return to that in his response. The Government still has six or eight months left to achieve it. Ireland&rsquo;s IEA oil stock holding for 2006 is 2,278,800 tonnes of crude oil equivalent. According to the Department, this is higher than the EU obligation because of &ldquo;differing methods of calculation and different times for changing the year that the data is based on&rdquo;. We are also obliged to manage contingency plans, including arrangements for the release of national oil reserves to minimise the <Col N="400"/>adverse effects of a major oil shortage. I understand there is a 7% requirement in that regard. Will the Minister give the House some more information about that and the powers he will have under the Bill with regard to the release of oil onto the market?</P>
    <P>Last winter, when Britain experienced serious problems with its wholesale gas market and we had a series of amber alerts and a red alert in our electricity system, I asked the Minister what contingency plans were in place in the event of a disruption to supply in the Irish system. He was very reticent about his strategy in that regard and made wild allegations about scaremongering by Opposition Deputies rather than answer a perfectly reasonable question about the serious danger to our energy supply. Before 1995 the oil companies had to meet a substantial portion of Ireland&rsquo;s stockholding obligations. It is astonishing that while the national oil reserves agency, NORA, has existed since 1995, we are only getting around to legislate for its powers today.</P>
    <P>A large and growing body of opinion concurs with the view that we are approaching an energy watershed and that comprehensive plans must be put in place to deal with seriously reduced and more expensive supplies of oil and gas. Forecasts for how long the supply of oil will last are divided as to when the so called topping-out point or peak will arrive. Optimistic analysts, which generally include the oil companies and agencies, such as the US Department of Energy, estimate that there are perhaps 2 to 2.7 trillion barrels of oil left in known wells. In this scenario, oil production will peak somewhere between 2020 and 2040. Early &ldquo;toppers&rdquo; at the other end of the spectrum predict a much earlier peak of oil production. In their estimation, with just 1 trillion barrels of conventional oil remaining, production could peak as early as 2008. Our next Government may, therefore, have to meet a major challenge in this regard, yet we have only belatedly got around to legislating for NORA.</P>
    <P>Before coming to the Bill, I want to deal with the issue of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, INPC. In 1979, INPC bought the Whitegate refinery on behalf of the State after its then owners decided to pull out. In 2001, Whitegate oil refinery, Whiddy Island oil terminal and other INPC related assets were sold. When these were sold to the Tosco Corporation on 16 July 2001, the State&rsquo;s involvement with the INPC in operational aspects of the oil industry was concluded. Legal provision for this was provided under the Irish National Petroleum Corporation Limited Act 2001.</P>
    <P>I understand the company is still not in a position to pay its outstanding payments to the Exchequer. I have asked the Minister about this three times since he took office and also asked the previous Minister about it. The current office holder informed me that the INPC has paid approximately &euro;20 million to the Exchequer and that the total net return to the State from the sale <Col N="401"/>would be in the order of &euro;30 million. Where is the missing &euro;10 million? In a previous reply, the Minister told me the State would gain approximately &euro;35 million and when the Government announced the sale, media headlines reported we would get &euro;101 million. Where are the missing millions?</P>
    <P>In his response on this debate, will the Minister tell us what is happening with regard to the INPC assets that arose as we established NORA as the flagship State agency? Will we get any more money and what happened to our money? Is this a saga in which the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts should become involved?</P>
    <P>The primary function of NORA under the legislation is to facilitate the holding of strategic oil reserves at a level determined annually by the Minister and to meet EU and IEA obligations. The enforcement provisions of NORA in Part 6 of the Bill are welcome. This is perhaps an area under which we could conclude the outstanding issues relating to the INPC.</P>
    <P>We seem to get new energy scares every few days. Recently Polish newspapers reported a fresh Ukrainian gas crisis was looming as a result of low Ukrainian gas reserves. Our economic situation and our dependence on oil energy make us vulnerable. Oil prices have rocketed over recent years from &euro;25 a barrel in September 2003 to &euro;70 or more in recent times. What will happen to our economy if oil reaches &euro;100 a barrel and how will we exist? It could even reach, as predicted by some New York city brokers, &euro;200 a barrel. What impact will that have on us? There are numerous explanations for these increases, ranging from immediate concerns surrounding security of supply due to strikes and hurricane threats to oil platforms to general geopolitical instability that often encompasses this area.</P>
    <P>Meeting the global daily demand of 80 million barrels a day and our daily demand of 200,000 barrels is an enormous task. When we look at the reserve strategies adopted by other countries, including countries becoming more industrialised such as China and India, we realise the daunting task we face and that we should be more proactive.</P>
    <P>Section 35 of the Bill needs to clarify the issue of the release of oil stocks, especially with regard to price hikes. Perhaps the Minister will come back to that matter.</P>
    <P>Part 4 informs us that one of the key duties of the agency is the maintenance of stocks. One of the issues discussed in this regard is our high vulnerability. We need to know what percentage of our stocks are held abroad and whether, to enhance our security of supply, we should examine measures for holding a greater amount of our strategic oil reserves in Ireland. The difficulty for us is to ensure that the large amount of stocks held abroad on ticket, or however, are accessible to our economy, especially if there is disruption to the physical transportation of fuel supplies to <Col N="402"/>Ireland following a serious crisis. Sections 32 and 33 are areas to which the Labour Party may return with amendments.</P>
    <P>In answer to a recent parliamentary question the Minister stated:</P>
    <P LI="1" FLI="0">a number of bilateral oil stockholding agreements have also been concluded with other European Union member states &mdash; Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Sweden. Such agreements allow for the storing of Irish oil stocks within these jurisdictions under guarantee by the host country that it would not oppose the transfer of the oil in question to Ireland in the event of an emergency.</P>
    <P FLI="0">However, that guarantee may not seem so rock solid if a serious oil crisis arises or if there is a major disruption to the physical transport infrastructure to get the oil to our shores. I understand that Japan has a type of double protection with a strategic oil reserve under the control of the state with the oil companies also required to hold a certain percentage of oil in reserve. We should consider enhancing that element in section 33 covering holding contracts.</P>
    <P>In the overall communications, marine and natural resources portfolio we have had major debates about networks. In this regard I warmly welcome what the Minister is reported as saying at a recent conference on the future of the ESB, which seems to accord with the policy of the Labour Party, regarding the necessity of holding the network. We have heard today about the oil network and the market power Topaz is likely to gain. I have great concern about the recent surge in service stations that are closing down. As the Acting Chairman, Deputy Woods, will be aware, in my constituency no fewer than seven filling stations have closed, mainly in the east of the constituency. For instance the Statoil and Texaco filling stations at the entrance to Howth have closed. Two more filling stations close to Sutton Cross have closed and it is has recently been reported that a planning application has been made for development of the Maxol station on the Baldoyle Road. This may have already received approval. There have been further closures at Kilbarrack and Coolock.</P>
    <P>The only new petrol station to open in the constituency is the new Tesco service station at Clare Hall shopping centre. Dublin North-East seems to be typical of constituencies across the country and particularly the urban ones. The former service station owners are cashing in on the property boom as they seek to maximise the value of the filling station properties. The end result will be a considerably smaller network.</P>
    <P Just="Left">In a recent article in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>, the distinguished economist, Moore McDowell, indicated his belief that Dublin was set to follow in the footsteps of London and Paris, where the downtown areas have only a handful of petrol stations charging extremely high prices, which <Col N="403"/>they must charge to exist owing to the value of the land on which they are located. In these cases the customers are paying for the use of the land to get the service they need. Owing to the Government&rsquo;s failure to provide the necessary resources for public transport, people depend on their cars. The Minister can imagine what could happen if we had a major disruption or price hike. Price gouging would take place and the network would be too small to look after all the vehicles in the economy. The queues of cars could stretch for miles given the continuing haemorrhage of filling station business. The Minister should address the issue of the network in Part 8.</P>
    <P>I welcome the &euro;1 billion borrowing limit outlined in section 26. I will ask the Minister to give more detail on Committee Stage. The Houses of the Oireachtas through the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources should have an input into the five-year strategy. As we already asked the Minister to do regarding fisheries, he should bring the strategy to the House so that the elected representatives of the people and not just the oil interests can put forward their priorities.</P>
    <P>I will also table a number of smaller amendments on Committee Stage. I do not believe a chief executive should also be a director as outlined in section 14. The chief executive should report to the board. I note that the Minister failed to specify a gender requirement for membership of the board. The Labour Party proposes a 40% requirement for both genders on boards and I will table such an amendment. In the appointment of directors for this agency, the Minister should have made provision for avoiding any conflict of interest among potential appointees, especially among individuals who may have been or still are intimately involved in the global oil business. We remember previous appointments to agencies where conflicts of interest arose. Under the Scottish Executive system, the Commissioner for Public Appointments monitors all such appointments and no appointments can be made unless they have been scrutinised first by an assessor in the office of the commissioner. I will also propose an amendment to section 24 regarding a record of interests for directors and staff. Deputies and Ministers have been required to declare their interests for many years. It is vital that the same applies to this national agency.</P>
    <P>The Bill could have afforded the opportunity to address the issue of lack of competition in the oil market in addition to the issue of security of supply to ensure that price gouging does not take place. We have seen the massive economic power Russia has gained on the back of its great gas reserves. During the same period the world&rsquo;s largest publicly traded oil company Exxon Mobil posted a quarterly profit of almost $10 billion, which was the largest quarterly profit ever earned by a US company. Shell, BP, Chevron and Conoco Philips also experienced huge increases in <Col N="404"/>profit in the same period. When one views the websites of such companies, they all appear to have become &ldquo;green&rdquo; companies. They have adopted logos reminiscent of the Irish Green Party and they invite the viewer to work out his or her CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions. They appear to be &ldquo;green&rdquo; energy companies rather than oil and gas exploration companies. They are making so much money that they do not know what to do with it.</P>
    <P>The windfalls the oil companies are receiving are in stark contrast to the reality for Irish consumers of petrol, home heating oil and natural gas, the price of which is going through the roof. Last winter we had the spectacle of some of our senior citizens in Dublin North East wearing overcoats in the early afternoon because they were fearful of turning on their central heating. This agency, our oil company, should be able to address the issue. It is time to widen NORA&rsquo;s powers and allow it have a wider remit over key strategic energy issues.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I will return to the issue of the release of stocks. I welcome that the company is a self-financing commercial semi-State body, which has been possible because of the 0.476 cent levy that has been in place since 1995. I welcome the elements of enforcement introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party warmly welcomes the statutory underpinning of NORA, which is long overdue. However, it could represent a lost opportunity. We could have had a much more comprehensive oil strategy and could have emulated the Swedes. We need to review the issue of market dominance and the lack of competition. NORA should have a role, as it should in the area of exploration. Above all, we should be increasingly concerned about high oil prices and Ireland&rsquo;s worrying addiction to oil, which the country needs to break in coming years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will share time with Deputies Cowley, Connolly and Finian McGrath. I look forward to them coming into the Chamber. I speak in this debate in advance of our party&rsquo;s spokesperson, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who, I hope, will have an opportunity to contribute before conclusion of Second Stage. As a Deputy for Cork South-Central in close proximity to the Whitegate oil terminal, I have a particular interest in how the State structures its oil reserves and energy security. I start on this point because the Bill is typical of much of the legislation introduced in this area in that it reflects a patchwork approach to energy legislation and the absence of an overall national energy policy. While a State agency with responsibility for national oil reserves is necessary, establishing a State agency with overall responsibility for energy security should be an even greater priority as it would, as Deputy Broughan noted, take a more holistic approach to the energy equation.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the House must discuss legislation in a vacuum. This debate takes place <Col N="405"/>in the absence of the White Paper promised by the Minister and against the backdrop of a good report on energy issued by the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Our economy is still overly dependent on imported fossil fuels. The legislation should signpost what will be the nature of the oil reserve in future, including the volume of oil we will need to maintain current consumption and projected requirements for the next ten, 20 and 30 years.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Broughan noted, Ireland has failed to follow the example of Sweden which has made a commitment to have an economy free of fossil fuels by 2025. This legislation will, therefore, create another State agency which will persist with doing things as they have always been done. The only saving grace is that the new body is a State agency. Policy in this area has danced in and out between relying, in the first instance, on foreign multinational companies to build refineries and procure oil reserves, establishing a State agency to fill a gap and then selling it to multinational companies and, as the Government is doing now, defining a remit for another State agency. We have no reason to take pride in the lack of consistency in our approach to oil use throughout the history of the State.</P>
    <P>As one whose constituency office in Cork South-Central is located about 100 yards from the Whitegate oil terminal, I have continuing concerns about oil storage infrastructure. The Whitegate refinery is 30 to 35 years old and one hears regular reports about the condition of its fittings, frequent flare-offs and so forth. The sites in Whitegate and Whiddy Island are Seveso listed facilities which have the capacity, as we know from a previous incident at Whiddy Island, to cause tremendous damage because they store volatile substances. I seek clarity on storage capacity and the costs it will generate for the agency. Deputy Broughan referred to the capacity held outside the State and the ability to control and minimise this potential storage cost to ensure the agency is able to operate within its cost base.</P>
    <P>On the governance issue, I ask the Minister to explain a number of issues. The memorandum appears to question whether the House should even debate the legislation given the number of sections described as standard features or provisions. The proposed governance of the agency requires greater scrutiny. While I note the chief executive will be available to Oireachtas committees to explain the operations of the agency, scrutiny of the role of commercial companies is excluded from the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am a member. Although I accept the agency will operate on a self-financing basis, this is only by virtue of its power to collect a levy or tax. For this reason, the activities of the new body should be open to examination by the Committee of Public Accounts, not only on the grounds that it engages in financial transactions but also because it will have stewardship over an important national <Col N="406"/>resource. We cannot cede complete control in this area to a body which has a hands-off relationship with the Minister and is at even further remove from the House in terms of accountability.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan also referred to applying a gender quota of 40% to the composition of the board. I oppose the decision to give the Minister a sole appointing role in connection with the six members of the board, albeit not with the chief executive.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that appointees must have experience and competence in either oil or oil related industries, chemical or chemical related industries, finance, economics, legal matters, energy production and supply industries. As such, the criteria cover a wide range. The process of making appointments to public bodies needs to be radically overhauled. Despite the decision to lay down criteria for membership of the board of this agency, we all suspect that most public appointments are made on the basis of the political party to which the appointee belongs and the party that happens to be in government. While I accept that this Minister is fair and open-minded in this regard, experience shows that too many of those appointed to State boards are the wrong types of people and have been selected for the wrong reasons.</P>
    <P>This legislation will be applied by the current and subsequent Ministers. All legislation that provides for appointment to State bodies should include a provision requiring that appointments are made on the basis of high levels of scrutiny and accountability. For example, a chairman or chief executive should be interviewed by an appropriate committee of the House, either prior to his or her appointment or in the period between being appointed and taking office. In addition, appointments to the position of director should be ratified by a committee. Too much of our legislation provides for direct appointments by Ministers, which ultimately leads to ministerial and political patronage.</P>
    <P>Given what we know about the long-term future of fossil fuels, a question mark hangs over the long-term future of the proposed agency. Perhaps it is an exercise in whistling in the wind in the name of energy security that a body of this nature is being established when known reserves of fossil fuels may not last beyond the 21st century. For this reason, as I indicated, the remit and purpose of the agency must extend beyond oil and fossil fuels to cover energy security.</P>
    <P>On paper, the Government has commenced a discussion on addressing energy issues and the Minister, who has left the Chamber, deserves some credit for recent grant initiatives, even if they come several years too late. The new measures will have some effect, however small in scale. Grants available to assist in modifying houses to facilitate the use of wood chip, geothermal or solar energy will affect fewer than 10,000 houses in an economy in which 70,000 to 80,000 houses are built per annum. We are not even <Col N="407"/>playing catch-up in terms of delivering the type of energy-efficient housing we need.</P>
    <P Just="Left">On transport, an issue raised by Deputy Durkan, while the Government has introduced legislative measures, including two initiatives announced in the most recent budget, it shows no intention of implementing them. One, a tax relief for converting engines to flexi-fuel use, was announced in the budget and introduced in the Finance Act. To date, this relief has been availed of for only 12 vehicles. The second measure, a biofuel initiative was trumpeted more loudly than the first. A follow-up to a pilot programme which took 18 months to get up and running, it is still not in operation because the Government has not even bothered to ask the European Commission for its view on whether it constitutes a state aid. For the reasons I have outlined, I have little confidence that the Government will introduce the type of alternative measures required to enable us to take a more relaxed approach to energy security in the future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>Our oil and gas reserves constitute an enormously valuable resource, particularly at a time when fossil fuel reserves are in decline. Managing them will be perhaps the greatest challenge of the coming half century. Their potential should not be squandered but should be exploited within a coherent policy led context that seeks to maximise benefit for the people rather than them being developed according to the timetable and interests of private multinationals. I call for the development of a long-term strategic plan for the oil and gas industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>A number of matters should be considered in developing such a policy. In the event of international supply disruption, the Government must have the power to divert Irish supplies to the domestic market and increase the supply of gas and oil from Irish fields during that period. The fiscal terms governing oil and gas finds must be revised to ensure an adequate return to the State. High taxation, royalties and equity shares are required to compensate the people for the pollution and global warming effects of the exploitation of fossil fuels. These revenues should be ring-fenced and used for investment in and development of renewable forms of energy. In other words, energy policy should be directed towards the development of renewable sources with oil and gas finds used only as transitional fuels and to finance the transition.</P>
    <P>Communities affected by the exploitation of oil and gas finds require compensation and investment. The Grian&aacute;n model, whereby 10% of gross profits are diverted to affected communities should be enforced in legislation. The Shetland Islands model, whereby the local community exercises considerable control over the industry, also offers possible options. The debacle of the Corrib gas project illustrates what happens when community concerns are ignored by the industry.</P><Col N="408"/>
    <P Just="Left">The Government should develop a State oil and gas company which could take shares in new finds and develop the processing capacity to manage them. Such a company could act in strategic partnerships with multinational oil and gas companies or with new and emerging indigenous exploration companies. This company could be a key instrument of public policy, ensuring benefits that would include health, safety and investment in new forms of energy.</P>
    <P>On 8 May, I introduced a private motion on behalf of the Technical Group, which called on the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to investigate Ireland&rsquo;s exploration regime. During the debate on the motion, the Minister stated that he would seek tenders for an expert review of proposed changes to the Irish exploration and production fiscal regime. I welcome his commitment as a major change of heart and a victory for those who seek a change in the regime to the benefit of this country. The motion received great support in the House and the Government&rsquo;s amendment was only passed by a narrow majority of 61 to 55 votes.</P>
    <P Just="Left">A review of the exploration licensing terms is sensible in light of the increase in oil prices from $26 per barrel to more than $70 per barrel, with a corresponding increase in the price of natural gas. The potential returns to oil companies have greatly increased, so it is only proper that the terms be revisited. The resistance to the Corrib gas pipeline project has focused attention on how little County Mayo and Ireland will earn from the find. When the people of County Mayo see an offshore terminal in Kinsale and the proposal for a similar facility for County Donegal, they wonder why they are being treated like lepers. With an offshore terminal, the Corrib gas field could produce hundreds of permanent jobs and its gas could flow to towns and villages in County Mayo. North County Mayo has a deep water port and a power station located in that area could generate electricity for the national grid. The local resistance from the Rossport five, the Shell to Sea campaign and Ireland&rsquo;s true Independent Deputies are helping to bring Ireland closer to a balanced regional development strategy and a better deal from the exploration of our natural resources. Since the resistance campaign began, attempts have been made to go beyond the election promises made by successive Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies.</P>
    <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that the &ldquo;State needs to find more oil and gas&rdquo;, according to Fergus Cahill of the Irish Offshore Operators Association. Round up the usual suspects &mdash; once again vested interests want us to provide for them. Another article in the same edition reported: &ldquo;Irish exploration group Providence Resources and oil giant ExxonMobil have defined the location of the wells for the Dunquin prospect off the west coast, Providence chief executive Tony O&rsquo;Reilly Jnr. told shareholders yesterday&rdquo;. Providence Resources claimed the <Col N="409"/>Dunquin find &ldquo;has the potential to produce enough oil and gas to power the whole of western Europe&rdquo;. Where will this wealth go, however? The article goes on to state:</P>
    <P LI="1">Under the terms of the agreement, ExxonMobil will explore the site in return for 80 per cent of the prospect. Providence&rsquo;s existing 80 per cent stake will fall to 16 per cent, while its partner in the venture, Sosina Exploration, will see its stake fall from 16 per cent to 4 per cent.</P>
    <P FLI="0">In other words, the State is giving away natural resources to multinationals for nothing. Why should the State give the money away to private companies which merely sit back and reap the benefits? It is an absolute disgrace. In the article, Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">I would describe 2006 as a year of transition...It&rsquo;s a year of getting all our ducks lined up, bringing in new partners and working together on a drilling programme for next year.</P>
    <P FLI="0">He is lining up the sitting ducks of Ireland who have already been treated badly by these Irish and multinational oil companies, which presume they can take our resources without giving us anything in return. Maybe we should follow the example of County Donegal, in which a different Irish company is willing to share a 10% stake in its operations.</P>
    <P>We are getting very little out of these arrangements. Our 25% tax rate is the lowest in the world. No royalties or other production levies are demanded, oil companies are allowed 100% write-offs and we continue to issue frontier licences <i>ad infinitum</i>. In other words, we are being taken to the cleaners. Under Article 10 of the Constitution, the common good must be satisfied. Where is the common good when we are giving away our resources?</P>
    <P>We should learn from the example of Norway. The value of these resources are continually increasing, even where they remain in the ground. We are all in favour of exploiting the Corrib gas field but let us do it safely and make it benefit our people. The Minister is preparing to issue further licences to potentially rich oil and gas prospects off the west coast. Oil companies are cherrypicking these prospects without any benefit for Irish people.</P>
    <P>The full extent of the scandal is highlighted by the ExxonMobil saga. Exxon had Irish offshore interests in the 1970s and 1980s but had not applied for licences in recent years. Had Exxon been interested it undoubtedly would have been granted the licence that was instead issued in November 2004 to Sir Tony O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s companies, Providence Resources and Sosina Exploration. The US oil giant would have been given preference over Tony O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s company if it had applied at the time. However, because it did not, it is now paying a high price for coming in late. The fact that it is willing to pay that higher <Col N="410"/>price confirms the ridiculousness of the Government&rsquo;s licensing policy.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Providence and Sosina were able to demand a continuing 20% stake in the licence, although ExxonMobil will pay all exploration costs, estimated to be more than &euro;100 million. Had the Minister not issued the licence 16 months ago, he could have demanded a 20% stake for the people in any of ExxonMobil&rsquo;s finds. Instead, the 20% stake will be allocated to Providence and Sosina Exploration. In the meantime, it would be irresponsible for the Minister to issue any more offshore licences until the people are fully consulted and agree how much they wish to grant the oil companies. That is the people&rsquo;s prerogative but, under the current terms, they have no right to this. By the time 50% of Corrib gas has gone, the investors will begin, perhaps, to pay 1 cent in tax. Where is the logic in failing to reconsider the offshore licensing terms in light of spiralling energy prices and the recent Forf&aacute;s report on Ireland&rsquo;s oil dependency that highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s vulnerability to a looming crisis in liquid energy supplies? Enough is enough and too much has been given to corporate interests. The 1992 Act should be scrapped and a realistic tax take introduced, including royalties and a 50% stake in any oil or gas discovery. It is time the people demanded what belongs to them.</P>
    <P>This Irish company is run by people who do not have the interests of Ireland at heart. The company can approach the Government, receive permission to explore, sell that right to others who would carry out the work at a cost of &euro;100 million and still make a profit. It is a disgrace that the resources of Ireland are being given to people who do not have the interests of Ireland at heart. In areas such as health and waste, the Government seeks to give everything to the private sector to make money to the detriment of the Irish people. People lie on hospital beds or die while on waiting lists. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, has played a major part in the shenanigans that result in the disgraceful surrender of our natural resources. We owe it to our children to exploit these resources for the benefit of the people. I ask the Government to urgently reconsider this prospect. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources should attempt to recover what we had before.</P>
    <P>We are all in favour of Corrib gas but we want it to come ashore safely from a deep water port in north Mayo. A proper tax return should be included in this. The Irish people have an opportunity to retrieve what is theirs. Our resources are becoming more valuable and the oil companies are now trying to extract whatever oil and gas they can. There is so much available but they would have us believe there is little available. There is great dependency on oil and natural gas.</P><Col N="411"/>
    <P><i>The Economist</i> recently published an article on whether the world was about to run out of oil. It questioned whether the crisis point is as near as people suggest. It states:</P>
    <P LI="1">In 1894 <i>Le Petit Journal </i>of Paris organised the world&rsquo;s first endurance race for &ldquo;vehicles without horses&rdquo;. The race was held on the 78-mile (125km) route from Paris to Rouen, and the purse was a juicy 5,000 francs. The rivals used all manner of fuels, ranging from steam to electricity to compressed air. The winner was a car powered by a strange new fuel that had previously been used chiefly in illumination, as a substitute for whale blubber: petrol derived from oil.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">Despite the victory, petrol&rsquo;s future seemed uncertain back then. Internal-combustion vehicles were seen as noisy, smelly and dangerous. By 1900 the market was still split equally among steam, electricity and petrol &mdash; and even Henry Ford&rsquo;s Model T ran on both grain-alcohol and petrol. In the decades after that great race petrol came to dominate the world&rsquo;s transportation system. Oil left its rivals in the dust not only because internal-combustion engines proved more robust and powerful than their rivals, but also because oil reserves proved to be abundant.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">Now comes what appears to be the most powerful threat to oil&rsquo;s supremacy in a century: growing fears that the black gold is running dry.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">But is the world really starting to run out of oil? And would hitting a global peak of production necessarily spell economic ruin? Both questions are arguable. Despite today&rsquo;s obsession with the idea of &ldquo;peak oil&rdquo;, what really matters to the world economy is not when conventional oil production peaks, but whether we have enough affordable and convenient fuel from any source to power our current fleet of cars, buses and aeroplanes. With that in mind, the global oil industry is on the verge of a dramatic transformation from a risky exploration business into a technology-intensive manufacturing business. And the product that big oil companies will soon be manufacturing, argues Shell&rsquo;s Mr. Van der Veer, is &ldquo;greener fossil fuels&rdquo;.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">The race is on to manufacture such fuels for blending into petrol and diesel today, thus extending the useful life of the world&rsquo;s remaining oil reserves. This shift in emphasis from discovery to manufacturing opens the door to firms outside the oil industry (such as America&rsquo;s General Electric, Britain&rsquo;s Virgin Fuels and South Africa&rsquo;s Sasol) that are keen on alternative energy. It may even result in a breakthrough that replaces oil altogether. [The peak that was expected late last year never arrived].</P><Col N="412"/>
    <P LI="1" el="0">In fact, oil production capacity might actually grow sharply over the next few years (see chart 1). Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA), an energy consultancy, has scrutinised all of the oil projects now under way around the world. Though noting rising costs, the firm concludes that the world&rsquo;s oil-production capacity could increase by as much as 15m barrels per day (bpd) between 2005 and 2010 &mdash; equivalent to almost 18% of today&rsquo;s output and the biggest surge in history. Since most of these projects are already budgeted and in development, there is no geological reason why this wave of supply will not become available.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">It is true that the big firms are struggling to replace reserves. But that does not mean the world is running out of oil, just that they do not have access to the vast deposits of cheap and easy oil that are left in Russia and members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). And as the great fields of the North Sea and Alaska mature, non-OPEC oil production will probably peak by 2010 or 2015. That is soon &mdash; but it says nothing of what really matters, which is the global picture.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">When the United States Geological Survey (USGS) studied the matter closely, it concluded that the world had around 3 trillion barrels of recoverable conventional oil in the ground. Of that, only one-third has been produced. That, argued the USGS, puts the global peak beyond 2025. And if &ldquo;unconventional&rdquo; hydrocarbons such as tar sands and shale oil (which can be converted with greater effort to petrol) are included, the resource base grows dramatically &mdash; and the peak recedes much further into the future.</P>
    <P FLI="0">We must consider who is pulling the strings and who benefits. The Irish people are not benefiting and we must take the comments of offshore exploration organisations with a pinch of salt. They have a vested interest and experience shows that the Department has let us down in supervising the oil companies. The interests of the Irish people must be upheld. That has not been the situation to date and it must change. Otherwise the Irish people will lose out.</P>

    <P>The objective of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of the agency on a statutory basis as the agency with responsibility for the holding and maintenance of strategic oil stocks. The National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, was set up as a subsidiary of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation. In July 2001 the businesses and commercial assets of the INPC &mdash; the Whitegate refinery and the Whiddy Island oil terminal &mdash; were sold to Tocso Corporation, now ConocoPhillips. NORA did not form part of that transaction. The INPC has no operational capacity since the disposal of its businesses and commercial assets. The company&rsquo;s current activities are limited to finalising residual issues arising from the 2001 transaction and meeting requirements under company law including those arising from its role as parent to the National Oil Reserves Agency. It is considered desirable that NORA should be established on a statutory basis as a private limited company independent of the INPC. The provisions of the Bill will also allow the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to strengthen corporate governance obligations of the agency.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the transfer of the share held by the National Petroleum Corporation Limited in the National Oil Reserves Agency to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. It continues in existence the National Oil Reserves Agency. It defines its functions including those relating to oil stockholding obligations. It imposes a levy on relevant disposals of petroleum products and amends the Irish National Petroleum Corporation Limited Act 2001.</P>
    <P>The main responsibilities of the oil supply division of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural are: first, the development and implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s strategic oil supply policy with particular regard to the areas of contingency planning and Ireland&rsquo;s associated international obligations in order to ensure an effective system of security of supply at times of physical oil supply disruption, and second, the exercise of shareholder functions in the Irish National Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiary, the National Oil Reserves Agency, the latter being the body having operational responsibility for maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s strategic oil reserves.</P>
    <P>Its strategy objectives are: to devise appropriate structural and resource arrangements for NORA going forward so that national and international oil stockholding requirements can be <Col N="415"/>consistently met, to ensure effective operation of the NORA levy, to conclude and update oil stockholding bilateral agreements with relevant Governments to facilitate cover for NORA stocks held abroad, to participate in formulation of EU and International Energy Agency &mdash; IEA &mdash; policy, information and decision-making activities regarding oil stockholding contingency issues.</P>
    <P>Arising from membership of both the European Union and the International Energy Agency, Ireland has obligations to maintain 90 day reserves of national strategic stocks. The EU requires member states to maintain minimum stocks of 90 days based on inland consumption in the preceding calendar year in three categories: Category I &mdash; petrol, Category II &mdash; middle distillates &mdash; kerosine, jet kerosine, gasoil and diesel &mdash; and Category III &mdash; fuel oil). The IEA imposes an obligation on member countries to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil equivalent equal to at least 90 days of net imports in the previous calendar year.</P>
    <P>Ireland&rsquo;s EU oil stock holding requirement for 2005 &mdash; 2006 amounts to 1,870,000 tonnes. Ireland&rsquo;s IEA oil stock holding requirement for 2006 amounts to 2,278,800 tonnes of crude oil equivalent, that is, 2,110,000 tonnes of products, higher than the EU obligation due to differing methods of calculation and different times for changing the year on which the data is based. Ireland is also obliged to maintain contingency plans, including arrangements for the release of national oil reserves to minimise the adverse effects of a major oil shortage within the framework of a co-ordinated international response. On 1 February 2006, Ireland&rsquo;s oil stock reserves were estimated at 100 days net imports. This comprised 32 days held in Ireland by the National Oil Reserve Agency, NORA, 33 days also held in the State by oil companies and oil consumers, with the balance of 36 days held abroad by NORA or on its behalf. While the Minister is satisfied that the level of stocks held by Ireland is fully in line with international obligations, he is mindful of the desirability of incrementally increasing the volume of NORA stocks held in Ireland, having regard to storage availability and value for money.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>The agency is doing a good job and will do a better job when the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1995, oil companies in Ireland were obliged to meet a substantial portion of Ireland&rsquo;s stockholding obligations. Under the European Communities (Minimum Stocks of Petroleum Oils) Regulations 1995, this responsibility was vested in a new State body, NORA, which acts as an agent of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. NORA&rsquo;s function is to arrange for the holding of national strategic <Col N="416"/>oil stocks at a level determined annually by the Minister. Such stocks may be held directly by the agency or on its behalf by third parties at home or abroad. Ireland meets its EU and IEA obligations through a combination of stocks owned and held by the agency in Ireland or abroad; stocks covered by the agency under short-term commercial contracts at home or abroad with an option to purchase in emergency circumstances during the period of the contract stock tickets; and operational stocks held in Ireland by industry and large consumers but not including stocks within the distribution network, that is, at secondary depots or filling stations, which are deemed to be consumed.</P>
    <P>Ireland&rsquo;s emergency stock levels are sufficient to ensure it would be in a position to participate effectively in an internationally co-ordinated response in the event of international oil supply disruption or to manage any short-term disruption impacting on the domestic market. However, we should be mindful of the desirability of incrementally increasing the volume of NORA&rsquo;s stocks held in Ireland having regard to storage availability and value for money.</P>
    <P>As the agency bears the cost of purchasing, financing and holding strategic oil stocks other than those held by oil companies, it receives no funding from the Exchequer. It is funded by a levy of 0.476 cent per litre imposed on oil consumers and by oil marketing companies. The levy has been unchanged since the agency&rsquo;s establishment in 1995. It is paid by oil companies and oil consumers. For the purpose of the levy, an oil company means with respect to any month a company that in any of the preceding 12 months imported or purchased from Ireland&rsquo;s only refinery at Whitegate total quantities of not less than 2 tonnes of petroleum oil or own consumption or resale in the State. An oil consumer is defined as any person other than an oil company who in any of the preceding 12 months purchased not less than 1,000 tonnes of petroleum oil for own consumption in the State. To ensure accuracy, the Department validates data supplied by oil companies and oil consumers and cross-checks it against returns of oil imports provided by the customers&rsquo; authorities to ensure all companies and consumers that may be liable to pay the NORA levy are included.</P>
    <P>Information regarding oil products sought on a monthly basis by the oil supply division from oil companies and oil consumers under the levy returns provides the basis for the levy calculation by the Department. Returns are provided by the companies and the consumers detailing stocks held at the beginning and end of each month. The oil products involved are petrol, kerosene, gas oil and fuel oils. Details are also provided of the quantities imported and exported, wholesale sales and purchases, retail sales and own consumption together with details of any quantities used for marine or aviation purposes. The monthly levy due to NORA from each company or consumer <Col N="417"/>is calculated by the Department on the basis of a company&rsquo;s retail sales plus own consumption less sales to other oil companies and disposals of fuel for marine or aviation purposes.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and I wish it a speedy passage through the House. I welcome the fact that the Green Paper on Energy will propose a more ambitious target for electricity consumed to come from renewable sources by 2020.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The Bill has arrived at long last. In recent years, the oil supply issue has been to the fore. The debate gives us an opportunity to examine how our natural resources are distributed on behalf of the people. We are at a crossroads regarding our natural resources, given that our citizens want a fair share of them. They want equality, decency and honesty in their distribution. We should not be afraid to consider best practice in other states. Every Member should accept this as part of his or her responsibility as a legislator. I strongly welcome the contribution of the Shell to Sea campaign and the Rossport five over the past 12 months on this issue. They are a group of individuals concerned not only about health and safety issues near their homes, but also about how we deal with our natural resources.</P>
    <P>There is significant potential to develop such resources in the interests of the people, and other countries have adopted a sensible, commonsense approach. I am open to suggestions as to how such matters should be dealt with. However, I accept the genuine criticism of many people to the effect that in the past 20 years, many individuals have been allowed off the hook with regard to our natural resources. Members must be sufficiently brave to face up to and deal with the matter in hand.</P>
    <P>In the context of the wider debate on this Bill, it is of great importance that Members should listen to constructive points. I reject Deputy<?oasys _jy ?>Kelly&rsquo;s earlier remarks. In particular, I reject his attack on Deputy Cowley regarding such issues. Members with objections and concerns have every right to put them on the record of the House.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
     <Quest>whether he has received the report commissioned to examine the height entry requirement for females and males into the Defence Forces; and <Col N="418"/>if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[24178/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I have recently received the military authorities&rsquo; report, which I commissioned, on the minimum height standards for Defence Forces personnel. It was prepared in the context of encouraging more women to apply to join the Defence Forces and deals comprehensively with the complex issues relating to this matter. As such, it requires careful consideration.</P>
    <P>In the light of this report, I will review the height requirement for entry to both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force, and I expect to be able to make a decision on this matter shortly. It is also my intention to publish the report in the near future.</P>
    <P>Height is not the only issue to be considered in respect of encouraging more women to apply to join the Defence Forces and I have recently initiated some research in this regard. Tenders have been sought from companies willing to undertake research into the issue of recruitment and retention of women in the Defence Forces. The closing date for receipt of the tenders was 13 June 2006. It is intended that the research will test women&rsquo;s attitudes to military life and a career in the Defence Forces. I envisage that the research will include interviews with serving female members of the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force, as well as members of the public. The contract will be awarded for the research in the very near future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I realise the height requirement issue for females is only one among a myriad of issues pertaining to the difficulty in encouraging women to join the Defence Forces. Moreover, I realise the percentage of women who join the Reserve Defence Force is far greater than the equivalent percentage for the Permanent Defence Force. However, I regret the Minister has not presented a final decision to the House today. I tabled the question in anticipation that a decision would have been made, as the report has been in the Minister&rsquo;s possession for some weeks.</P>
    <P>It is time to move on from the issue. Can the Minister give Members any indication whether he intends to drop the height requirement altogether or intends simply to lower it? If so, will it be reduced for both men and women? The Minister should give some indication of his intentions because I am sure the report makes a recommendation. While height requirements may have been an issue for Deputy Glennon when he played rugby in the second row or whatever, they are irrelevant to the requirement to be able to carry heavy loads of equipment. The only scientific evidence available shows that the body mass index is the only physical attribute of concern.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>While it may be correct for Deputy Timmins to state that the report was completed <Col N="419"/>several weeks ago, I have only seen it in recent days. I have been busy doing other things and it may be that other people were also busy and did not hand it to me. I am engaged in consultations in this regard and can assure the Deputy that a decision will be made very quickly. I must resolve a number of difficult issues which arise from the report.</P>
    <P>As for Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s other remarks, the Department has received consistent medical advice to the effect that injuries in the lower back and limbs arising from carrying heavy loads appear much more frequently in people of small stature. Some research was carried out on the average load-carrying requirements for Irish troops when on overseas duty and they are approximately the same as those for the United States Marine Corps, namely, approximately 126 lbs or nine stone. The average height and weight of a United States marine is in the order of 5 ft. 9 in. and 170 lbs, respectively.</P>
    <P>I will consider the report over the weekend. I must discuss it with a number of people next week and I will make a decision very quickly thereafter. I hope it will be made before the House goes into recess.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that many nationalities have a limited height requirement? While I may be wrong, I understand the height entry requirement for the United States defence forces is 4 ft. 9 in. The Minister mentioned next week as a possible date for the decision. Can he provide Members with a final cut-off date in order that this issue may be put aside?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true that some armies, including the United States army, have significantly lower height requirements for entry than the Irish Army. However, the difference is that armies such as the United States army and the British army have a number of different divisions which are permitted to perform different tasks. Women do not have access to all activities whereas, uniquely, in the Irish Army, women are entitled to and are called on to perform the entire range of tasks performed by men. This is not the position in many other armies, especially those in which the height requirement is lower.</P>
    <P>As for Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s request for a cut-off date, to the best of my knowledge, the D&aacute;il will go into recess on 6 July. I promise that I will make the report available before 6 July and I will take a decision immediately afterwards.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
     <Quest>the legislative provision under which 1,000 Irish troops have been deployed in Kosovo; if he is satisfied that the mission in Kosovo was established by the United Nations; if so, when it was <Col N="420"/>established; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[24176/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The statutory authority for the dispatch of contingents of the Permanent Defence Force for service overseas is provided for in the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960 and the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993.</P>
    <P>The Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960, as amended by the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993, authorises, subject to the prior approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the dispatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service outside the State with an international force or body established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, Ireland participates in missions either established or authorised by the UN Security Council. The consistent advice of the Attorney General is that missions either established or authorised by the UN Security Council fall within the requirements of the existing Defence Acts. UNIFIL in Lebanon and UNMIL in Liberia are examples of missions established by the UN Security Council. KFOR in Kosovo, EUFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina and ISAF in Afghanistan are examples of missions authorised by the United Nations Security Council.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999 authorised the establishment of KFOR for an initial period of 12 months, to continue thereafter unless the UN Security Council decides otherwise. Ireland has participated in KFOR since August 1999, following Government decision S.16137Q of 29 June 1999 and the subsequent approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the necessary enabling motion on 1 July 1999. The Irish contingent comprises an infantry group of 213 personnel, including a variable number of personnel in staff posts at various headquarters. The infantry group was first deployed in September 2003 following the withdrawal of a transport group which had been deployed with KFOR since August 1999. I am fully satisfied that our participation in KFOR is in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Acts relating to such deployments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. My question does not imply that I am in any way opposed to our troops being deployed in Kosovo as long as their operation is in accordance with the legislation. The new Bill published today states &ldquo;International United Nations Force&rdquo; means &ldquo;an international force or body established, mandated, authorised, endorsed, supported, approved or otherwise sanctioned by a resolution of the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I must point out to the Minister that of the words in that definition, only &ldquo;established&rdquo; is in the original 1960 Act, which makes provision for the deployment of an Irish contingent abroad only if the United Nations Assembly or Security <Col N="421"/>Council establishes the force. The Minister already admitted that KFOR is in charge of the force in Kosovo, that it was not established by the United Nations but that it was authorised. However, &ldquo;authorised&rdquo; is not in the Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister corrects the situation in the new Bill by including &ldquo;established, mandated, authorised, endorsed&rdquo;. Clearly in the new legislation, the Minister admits he was wrong all along. The Minister must clarify&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be glad to.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and explain this because it is not good enough to state that &ldquo;established&rdquo; means &ldquo;authorised&rdquo;. It does not. By definition, &ldquo;established&rdquo; means the United Nations establishes the body and &ldquo;authorised&rdquo; means the body could be established by anybody such as NATO and the United Nations would subsequently authorise Irish troops to be there. Our legislation does not make provision for that.</P>
    <P>Considering the severe and important legal implications for the troops in Kosovo at present, who may not be operating under a legal mandate under the 1960 or 1993 legislation, will the Minister publish the Attorney General&rsquo;s legal opinion? That would give us clarity once and for all as to the legal status of those Irish troops who served abroad in the past and who do so at present but are under a legal cloud as to whether they were properly established or authorised under the UN mandate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not in any way suggest that Deputy Costello is opposed to the Irish presence in Kosovo. I did not mean to imply that at any time. Before we deploy troops abroad following a United Nations resolution, we take the advice of the Attorney General on whether, as the Defence Act 1960 as amended in 1993 stands, we are entitled under the wording of the resolution to deploy troops abroad. The clear advice of the Attorney General is that in every case where the United Nations authorises another party to put together a peace keeping force, we are covered. The word &ldquo;established&rdquo; in the Defence Act 1960&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not in our Act.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Attorney General defined it as including &ldquo;authorised&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>That is my question. Will the Minister publish the Attorney General&rsquo;s legal advice?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>He defined it as extending to &ldquo;authorised&rdquo;, but not extending to &ldquo;support&rdquo;, &ldquo;endorsed&rdquo; or &ldquo;calls upon&rdquo;. That is why I included that terminology in the new Bill. We will discuss that later. If I can obtain the Attorney General&rsquo;s detailed legal advice I do not see any <Col N="422"/>difficulty in publishing it. I will return to the Deputy on that matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>We will debate the new Bill, but it is appropriate that it arrived today. We have not seen it before. The Bill does not seem to be retrospective.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>What provision makes it retrospective in a case where doubt exists on legal status? Does the new definition of &ldquo;established, mandated, authorised, endorsed&rdquo; cover troops who were sent abroad prior to when we pass the legislation? The KFOR contingent was mandated in 2003. How does the legislation apply to them if there is any possibility of legal doubt?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The short answer is the legislation does not apply to them. It will only come into play from when the President signs it. I am satisfied they are abroad legally. The advice of the Attorney General on that matter is crystal clear. If I can procure that advice I will be glad to communicate it to Deputy Costello.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
     <Quest>if members of the Defence Forces serving in SFOR's military police company in Bosnia in 2002 were aware that the SFOR headquarters Camp Butmir in which they were based was misused by the US forces for activities incompatible with the SFOR mission and international human rights and humanitarian law, namely the extraordinary rendition of six Bosnian men of Algerian origin to Guantanamo where they remain until the present time; and if there was an investigation into the matter since then.</Quest>
     <QRef>[24182/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Between mid-1997 and January 2003, a Defence Forces military police contingent of approximately 50 personnel served in the NATO-led Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, following D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approval in July 1997. The force is known as SFOR. The Irish contingent formed part of the international military police company at SFOR headquarters in Sarajevo. The military police contingent was withdrawn from SFOR in January 2003. A small number of Irish personnel remained in service at SFOR headquarters during 2003, and 12 personnel continued to serve with the mission until December 2004, when it was replaced by the EU-led Operation Althea or EUFOR.</P>
    <P>The military authorities informed me that Irish personnel serving with SFOR in 2002 had no knowledge of US forces activities, which were or might have been incompatible with the SFOR mission, international human rights or humanitarian law. I am aware from recent media reports that socialist members of the European Parliament&rsquo;s committee investigating CIA activities in <Col N="423"/>Europe called for a NATO representative to appear before the committee to answer questions concerning the possible involvement of the NATO-led Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the abduction of six people from Bosnia. However, as I already stated, the information available to me from the Defence Forces, who were based in Camp Butmir, is that they were not aware and had no knowledge of the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I take on board that the Minister stated he has no knowledge. However, he stated the Irish role in SFOR in Camp Butmir in Bosnia and Herzegovina was of a military police nature. One would presume part of their job was to secure the camp. If so, they should be aware of the comings and goings at the camp. This case involves the abduction of six men from the camp against the direction of the courts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and an interim order placed by the human rights chamber by US forces at 6 a.m., not a time a substantial amount of movement would have taken place unless something drastic happened.</P>
    <P>When did our Defence Forces become aware of what happened, if they were not aware at the time? What steps have they taken since then to ensure their position and role in the facility of peacekeeping missions are not abused in this manner in the future? What protocol governs the response of Irish Defence Forces serving in international missions in the event of such a hostile act occurring on their watch? Is the Minister aware of the allegations by the men&rsquo;s lawyers that US officials threatened to cut aid to Bosnia unless it handed over the men originally?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The protocol is simply that the Irish troops would not countenance any such activity. Our troops regard such activity as beyond the pale. As to whether they should have been aware of what may have happened, a number of investigations are taking place at present. An investigation by the European Parliament will be discussed on 5 July and voted on the following day. The Council of Europe is conducting two investigations, the parliamentary committee of which will discuss the matter on 27 June.</P>
    <P>I spoke to the military about this. I wanted to know whether they had any knowledge or inkling of what allegedly happened. The answer was a firm &ldquo;no&rdquo;. I cannot answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question on when they first became aware of it. I presume it was through the news reports which are emanating now. Given that roughly 50 troops were in Camp Butmir at the time, I very much doubt that the information could have been kept secret. On this basis, I have no reason to doubt the military authorities.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="424"/>
   <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish military has a proud history and I hope nothing untoward will be shown to have happened. If it is true that the Irish military authorities only discovered that the six Bosnians were incarcerated in Camp Butmir when media reports emerged, I am concerned that it took so long.</P>

     <asker>Mr. Timmins</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
     <Quest>the legal basis under which Irish military personnel serving in Brussels as part of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to Partnership for Peace and other such operations are operating; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[24179/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputies will be aware, I established an interdepartmental group comprising representatives of the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General to examine all issues relating to Ireland&rsquo;s potential participation in an EU-led rapid response capability force. As part of its study, the group recommended changes to current legislation concerning overseas service. The main elements of these changes concern the updating of the Defence Acts in respect of UN-mandated peace support operations, humanitarian operations, overseas training and exercises and a number of avoidance-of-doubt provisions. The requirement for this amending legislation arises irrespective of our participation in battle groups.</P>
    <P>The advice of the Attorney General, contained in the report of the interdepartmental group, is that members of the Permanent Defence Force may only be despatched for service outside the State as part of an international United Nations force, that is, a force established or authorised by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations. However, as the Deputy will be aware, since the Defence Forces were established, members of the Permanent Defence Force have served overseas for many other reasons, including carrying out official representational duties, undergoing training, representing the Defence Forces at sports events etc. The deployment of personnel in Brussels as part of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to Partnership for Peace would fall within the ambit of these types of duties, as would the deployment of personnel in the permanent representation to the EU, the permanent mission to the UN and our representation to the OSCE.</P>
    <P>Ireland&rsquo;s presentation document for participation in Partnership for Peace was approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 9 November 1999 and, following D&aacute;il approval, Ireland joined on 1 December of that year. It is implicit in being a participant in any international arrangement such as Partnership for Peace that appropriate staff will be <Col N="425"/>deployed in the relevant liaison office. Currently, there are two military officers and one full-time and two part-time civil servants from my Department serving in the Partnership for Peace liaison office in Brussels. The part-time civil servants also have European Union responsibilities.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the advice from the Attorney General to the effect that there is no formal basis in the Defence Acts for the despatch of Permanent Defence Force personnel on such duties, I believe it important that the matter be put beyond doubt. I am taking the opportunity in the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2006 to do this. With the co-operation of the Oireachtas, I hope to have this legislation enacted before the summer recess.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue is similar to that raised by Deputy Costello but slightly different in that it appears the individuals serving with Partnership for Peace, who might be in New York, or involved in other such operations, would have been serving illegally abroad. This contrasts with the circumstances in Kosovo and the dispute over established and authorised personnel. Would section 3 of the proposed Defence (Amendment) Bill rectify the problem?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The advice of the Attorney General is that there is no reference to this sort of matter in the legislation. Successive Governments have presumed they are entitled to send people on ceremonial duty for seminars, sports events etc. when they are not part of a United Nations force. The defence legislation only refers specifically to circumstances in which troops are to be sent abroad as part of an international peacekeeping force.</P>
    <P>Since the Defence Forces were established, successive Governments have held the view that while the defence legislation does not mention the sending abroad of individuals in the circumstances I have outlined, it does not preclude their being sent. It could be an oversight in the legislation but it simply does not refer to them. In case it is argued that the only authority to send troops abroad stems from the defence legislation and that there is therefore no authority to send military personnel abroad in the aforementioned circumstances because there is no reference thereto in the legislation, I am taking the opportunity to include the necessary provisions in the amending legislation to avoid doubt. It is better to counter the argument before it is raised even though I do not believe it would succeed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe it has been the tradition of this State to enact precautionary legislation. Am I correct in assuming that the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice is that the personnel in question are serving illegally at present?</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>

     <QRef>[24177/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 16,760 claims have been received in my Department from current and former members of the Defence Forces in respect of loss of hearing allegedly caused during their military service. Of the claims, 15,605 have been disposed of, leaving a total of 1,155 outstanding. Some &euro;280.9 million has been paid in respect of hearing loss claims, including &euro;95 million in plain<Col N="427"/>tiffs&rsquo; legal costs. The plaintiffs&rsquo; legal costs include the fees of the solicitors&rsquo; firms as well as other costs such as those arising from counsel fees, medical reports etc.</P>
    <P>In general, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor pays the costs of the State&rsquo;s legal team. This includes counsel fees, medical fees and fees for expert witnesses, State solicitors, stenographers etc. These costs are charged to the Vote of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Chief State Solicitor has advised us that in the period 1998 to date, when the vast majority of Army hearing loss cases were finalised, it has paid a total of &euro;17.8 million in such fees. This included &euro;11.4 million for counsel fees. During this period, the Department of Defence directly paid &euro;2 million in other costs associated with the processing of hearing loss claims. These amounts do not include the costs of staff and overheads incurred in processing these claims in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence, which costs are currently estimated at &euro;23 million.</P>
    <P>The management of new and outstanding hearing loss claims was delegated to the State Claims Agency with effect from 1 September 2005. Since that date, my Department has paid a total of &euro;600,000 in plaintiff and agency legal and related costs to the State Claims Agency in respect of hearing loss claims.</P>
    <P>Since October last, 145 inquiries have been received by my Department from plaintiffs regarding the fees paid to solicitors in respect of Army deafness cases. Generally these queries refer to the amount of the award or settlement and the costs paid.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
    <P>As a matter of course, my Department advises the individual of the amount of the settlement or award, and the date on which payment issued. In addition, the amount paid by the State in respect of plaintiff costs, and the date of such payment, are also advised.</P>
    <P>Plaintiffs are advised, on foot of their inquiries, that they are entitled to obtain details of the costs in their cases from their solicitors under the provisions of section 68(6) of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994. These provisions oblige a legal representative to provide a summary of the legal services provided and the amount of expenses incurred in the provision of these legal services, as well as details of all charges that have been recovered. We also advise that the Law Society of Ireland is the statutory body entrusted with responsibility to investigate complaints against solicitors by any client and that it has procedures in place in this regard.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Law Society of Ireland at the time of the initial queries regarding solicitors&rsquo; charges in Army hearing loss litigation. In my let<Col N="428"/>ter, I asked what plans the society had to deal with any complaints regarding charging by solicitors in these cases. The society clarified that it was the statutory body responsible for dealing with such complaints and that it had procedures in place in this regard. The society has power to order a solicitor to repay any excessive amount charged and is anxious to investigate any complaints made against solicitors.</P>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I wrote again to the Law Society of Ireland recently and expressed my disappointment that a number of complainants have apparently been advised that their complaints cannot be pursued on the grounds that the bill concerned is over five years old, despite the fact that the complainants have only recently become aware of the potential overcharging. I requested the views of the society on the matter and any proposals it has to address this apparent anomaly.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the information, some of which is available consequent to the Estimates we dealt with some weeks ago. The extra information supplied today indicates that, of over &euro;280 million paid to claimants, &euro;95 million has been expended on legal fees. If one combines the fees, including ongoing overheads, paid by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Defence Forces, one will note that they amount to at least another &euro;20 million. Considerably more than &euro;120 million has been spent on legal fees. That is over 40% of the amount of the entire claim and a whopping chunk of money for the legal profession.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that 145 complaints have been made about the fees charged by their legal representatives. What is the nature of those complaints? What has the Minister done to pursue them and what has been the outcome of those complaints?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Costello that it is a fairly hefty percentage but these were party and party fees. In other words, if the costs were granted against the defendant, he would have been obliged by the Taxing Master to pay them if he was unhappy with the amount. These fees were barely sufficient to enable the plaintiff pursue his legal claim.</P>
    <P>The 145 complaints are from people whose fees were paid by the Department of Defence but who had money deducted from their settlement cheque by their solicitors. They want to know why that happened given that the State paid the fees. The Law Society of Ireland says there is such a thing as solicitor and client fees over and above the costs one recovers by winning a case. These are for extra expenses, for example, extra experts&rsquo; reports, time that the Taxing Master would not allow, etc. I wrote to the Law Society about that and it came back to me with the procedure where people can complain to the society. I have told the people concerned that if they <Col N="429"/>write to me, I will give them all the necessary information to make a case to the Law Society.</P>
    <P>I must admit to the House that the Law Society is now quoting a section of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994 which states it is not obliged to deal with any claims regarding costs charged if the case was settled more than five years ago. The majority of these cases, as the Deputies are aware, were settled more than five years ago but this matter only came to light recently after the revelations concerning the legal fees in the residential institutions redress matter. I pointed that out to the Law Society.</P>
    <P>I also pointed out to the society that it is obliged to furnish a bill of costs. In many of the cases where complaints arise a bill of costs is conspicuous by its absence. I also pointed out to the Law Society that solicitors are entitled to set out the basis of charge, under section 68 of the 1994 Act, when they first take on the case. I pointed out also that many of those initial estimates are also conspicuous by their absence. I am waiting for the Law Society to come back to me. My attitude is to help the claimant in every way by giving him or her all the necessary information we have, passing the matter on to the Law Society and following up the matter with the society if he or she wants to come back to us.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for that very helpful reply. Effectively, what has happened in those cases is that 145 people are claiming there was double payment, in other words, the fees were paid by the Department of Defence and then an extra payment was sought from the individual claimant. When the Department of Defence paid those legal fees, can the Minister clarify if it made any allowance for any expenses such as medical expenses or anything of that nature?</P>
    <P>The fact that the Law Society appears to be anxious to hide behind the Solicitors Act 1994 and prevent any examination of the validity of those claims is despicable. The society has said publicly that it is very concerned about any of its members who might be taking double payment from victims of abuse. That is happening in the Army deafness cases and the Law Society has now resorted to legislation to try to impede that investigation. Will the Minister comment on that?</P>
    <P>I am heartened that the Minister&rsquo;s office is prepared to provide assistance to claimants in processing their claims. I will be anxious to see how he will pursue that in the future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s first question, our Department provided for medical expenses, including audiologists&rsquo; reports etc. but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>It did provide expenses.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes but, generally speaking, in a case like that it would only provide for one medi<Col N="430"/>cal witness or one audiologist&rsquo;s report. In some cases more than one had to be procured to establish the case. That is the difference between party and party costs and solicitor and client costs.</P>
    <P>Regarding the 1994 Act, I have checked the Act and, unfortunately, whether by oversight or whatever, it does contain that section. I have the reference to it. If the Act were to be altered, that would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but I believe we have grounds for talking to the Law Society on the basis that the bill of costs was not been produced in many cases and on what is called the section 68 letter outlining the fact that there may be charges other than what is recovered from the defendants, namely, ourselves. I understand that was not issued in many cases.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
     <Quest>the position regarding the deployment of ten military personnel to the Congo to assist in national elections; the type of work the personnel will be engaged in during their time in the country; when they will be deployed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[23794/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1671 of 25 April 2006 authorised the EU to deploy a European Union Force, codenamed EUFOR RD Congo, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC, in support of MONUC during the electoral period in the Democratic Republic of Congo for a period ending four months after the date of the first round of the presidential and parliamentary elections there. The DRC authorities have welcomed the EU military support to MONUC during the electoral process. On 25 April 2006, the Council of the EU adopted a joint action to launch the EU mission in support of MONUC.</P>
    <P>On 9 May 2006, the Government authorised me, as Minister for Defence, to despatch up to ten members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the EUFOR RD Congo. Ireland offered up to ten staff officers for the headquarters. However, the mission is oversubscribed and, therefore, only seven of the ten will be deployed, five in Potsdam in the operational headquarters and two in Kinshasa in the force headquarters. The five Defence Forces officers assigned to the operational headquarters for the mission in Potsdam in Germany have been deployed. The deployment of the personnel to Kinshasa will take place shortly.</P>
    <P>The key tasks of the EU mission are to support MONUC to stabilise a situation in case MONUC faces serious difficulties in fulfilling its mandate within its existing capabilities; to contribute to the <Col N="431"/>protection of civilians under imminent threat of physical violence in the areas of its deployment and without prejudice to the responsibility of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo; to contribute to airport protection in Kinshasa; to ensure the security and freedom of movement of the personnel as well as the protection of the installations of EUFOR RD Congo; and to execute operations of limited character to extract individuals in danger.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>This reflects the discussion we had earlier on Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s query about establishment. It is well covered in the new legislation. The Explanatory Memorandum states:</P>
    <P LI="1">Section 1 [of the Bill] amends the definition of &ldquo;International United Nations Force&rdquo;, as provided for in the 1960 and 1993 Acts, to reflect the changes in the organisation and structure of forces deployed on Peace Support Operations under a UN mandate, in particular, the use of regional organisations to provide forces for peace support operations. It also reflects the variations in the language used in UN Security Council Resolutions, such that, the Permanent Defence Force will not be precluded from participating in a UN peace support operation, solely on the basis of the specific language used in a resolution.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Once again, the language used was &ldquo;established&rdquo;. This mission was not established by the United Nations. It is a EUFOR operation. The United Nations was not responsible for establishing it but it authorised it. The same situation arises in this case. Are seven people deployed in the Congo for whom there is no strict legal basis under the 1960 or the 1993 legislation? We cannot pursue the matter any further until we examine the Attorney General&rsquo;s legal opinion given to the Minister but there is a question mark over it because the purpose of this legislation is to rectify that situation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated to Deputy Costello in reply to an earlier question, the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice was given at a time before I came into the Department, because this matter had happened before that. Nevertheless, I have to accept the advice of the Attorney General. The Government acts on the advice of the Attorney General whenever troops are being deployed abroad. When we are deploying troops abroad, we do so in accordance with our domestic legislation. Successive Attorneys General have advised us that if the wording of the resolution says &ldquo;authorised&rdquo;, we are covered.</P>

     <asker>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
     <Quest>if he will take steps to amend the time limit in the Defence Force&rsquo;s regulations governing the awarding of posthumous medals and decorations to allow four members of the Air Corps, who died in County Waterford in July 1999 while carrying out a dangerous rescue mission, to be honoured with medals for their courageous service.</Quest>
     <QRef>[23958/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I take this opportunity to once again acknowledge the supreme sacrifice of the Air Corps personnel who so tragically lost their lives in the Tramore helicopter crash and to extend my renewed sympathy to their families, friends and also their colleagues in the Air Corps. We all recognise and appreciate the nature of the tragic loss occasioned by their deaths. I also fully understand that the question of acknowledging their service in a tangible lasting manner is of great personal importance to the families concerned.</P>
    <P>The award of medals, including the Distinguished Service Medal, is governed by Defence Force Regulations, A9. The regulations set out the procedure for the award of medals, including that the award is made by the Minister on the recommendation of a military board appointed by the Chief of Staff. The recommendation must be made not later than four years after the performance of the act in respect of which the recommendation is made. I am advised by the military authorities that in spite of the tragic nature of this accident, it was not considered appropriate to initiate a recommendation for the award. Consideration of an amendment to the regulations to lengthen the timeframe within <Col N="433"/>which a recommendation can be initiated does not therefore arise.</P>
    <P>Recognition of the devotion to duty and loyal service to the Defence Forces of the personnel who lost their lives has been marked in a very fitting and personal way by their colleagues in the Air Corps, who commissioned and installed a special memorial window in the church at Casement Aerodrome, dedicated to the memory of the four Air Corps personnel killed in the accident at Tramore on 2 July 1999. A permanent memorial was also erected by the Air Corps to their memory at Finner Camp in Donegal, where the crew had been previously stationed.</P>
    <P>Official recognition of this tragic loss of life was marked by my Department&rsquo;s close involvement with Tramore Town Commissioners and Waterford County Council who erected a memorial in honour of the memory of the four Air Corps personnel. My Department contributed &pound;10,000 towards this memorial and also assisted the town commissioners in the organisation of a formal ceremony in Tramore on 4 September 2000 where the memorial was unveiled by President McAleese. This ceremony was attended by the families and colleagues of those who died along with the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, the then Chief of Staff and senior officers. This memorial and those in Baldonnel and Finner are a fitting public acknowledgement of the crew&rsquo;s devoted service to the State and to the esteem in which their service and sacrifice is held.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a problem with the regulations. If an investigation has occurred, as in this case, until it is completed, which can sometimes take a number of months or years, the time limit is being eaten into because of the short four-year period within which a recommendation can be made. I ask the Minister to request the military authorities to look again at making a recommendation that the men be awarded a medal. They went out in very bad weather, risked life and limb in an incident which involved the rescue of a child, among others. Not making a recommendation to honour them suggests that something untoward happened. The State, while contributing to the monument that was built, has so far not taken any initiative in its own right to honour their memories. It has participated in initiatives, but has not put in place any initiative itself. It is important the sacrifice which Captains Dave O&rsquo;Flaherty and Michael Baker, Sergeant Paddy Mooney and Corporal Niall Byrne made be recognised fully by the State. In the past the State has made posthumous awards. In particular, I do not know how many people in this the 90th anniversary of 1916 managed to get medals for their families, posthumously. It looked as if everybody was in the GPO at one stage. I am not saying we should demean the Distinguished Service Medal in such a way, but there should be some slight leeway. Perhaps the close of investi<Col N="434"/>gations might be taken for the start of the timespan rather than the date of the incident. Some way should be found to ensure the families get the medals the four men deserve for their courage on that day.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh makes a very valid point as regards the time. The four-year period should not include the time during which an inquiry is taking place. I shall certainly examine that. It is even more relevant as regards the other type of medal, for gallantry, because there is only a two-year timespan there. As the Deputy has rightly said, these inquiries can take a long time. That is a very valid point.</P>
    <P>As regards the award of medals generally, there is no reflection whatsoever on those young men. Their sacrifice is well recognised. I want to be as sensitive as I can, given that there are families involved. The fact is that medals are awarded by the military. My function is merely a rubber stamp in these matters. As a result of the military board of inquiry the recommendation comes to me and I simply sign off on it. I am certain there has been no case in the history of the State where the military decided to either award or not award a medal, which was totally within its own power, where the Minister for Defence intervened to question such a decision. That is the reality.</P>
    <P>However, in view of Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh&rsquo;s interest in this matter I will take a look at the criteria used internationally as regards medals of this type. I will discuss those criteria with the military. The procedure, as regards the awarding of medals, is that the recommendation must come from within the Defence Forces, to the Chief of Staff. He must be persuaded there is a case. He then appoints a military board to establish whether there is a case. I shall look at the international situation to determine whether norms exist about which I can talk to the military.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh&rsquo;s point is well made and I support it. Will the Minister say whether any outstanding issues remain as regards the families concerned? I know the Department of Defence was in discussion with one or more of the families as regards outstanding liabilities. I wonder whether these matters have been finalised.</P>
    <P>Finally, will he consider re-establishing the Air Corps search and rescue service? It is a terrible loss. I know it was not lost strictly for political reasons and that there were internal difficulties. I ask him to review the question of re-establishing the service. It was lifeblood to the Air Corps.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s first question, I understand that all the civil matters have not been settled, awards of damages etc.</P>
    <P>As regards the search and rescue service, we have discussed this matter in the House previously. The reason the search and rescue service <Col N="435"/>was replaced in the only place where it remained, the north west, was because it could not guarantee a 24-hour service. My understanding now is that the new service put in place in the north west, similar to that for the rest of the country, is working very well. I assume that is what the Deputy is referring to. My advice is that it is working very well. If the Deputy has any information to the effect that it is not, I would appreciate him drawing it to my attention.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend my sympathy to the families of the four members of the Air Corps who died in such tragic circumstances. Will the Minister say why there should be a time limit as regards the awarding of posthumous honours to somebody? Yesterday was the 100th anniversary of the Dreyfus affair. Many years go by before certain matters can ever be resolved. I do not see that it serves any purpose. Would it not be best to eliminate the time limit?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>In any legislation with a time limit, the reason given for it will be to bring finality to a situation. In cases where people have died, the Deputy may well have a point. I will give some thought to it.</P>

    <P>Discussions with like-minded states have begun regarding battle groups. A delegation consisting of representatives from the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Defence Forces met our Swedish counterparts in Stockholm on 9 and 10 March to discuss possible participation by the Defence Forces in the Nordic battle group. Our representatives outlined Ireland&rsquo;s position on battle group participation and international peacekeeping, and gave a presentation on the capabilities which Ireland can make available to a battle group. These range from smaller niche capabilities to an APC mounted light infantry company group of approximately 200 personnel, plus support elements.</P>
    <P>Further consultation between the Defence Forces, the Swedish armed forces and officials from their respective ministries are continuing, including technical discussions and a memorandum of understanding on the specific nature of our contribution. Pending completion of these discussions, I am unable to state the nature or extent of our contribution to the Nordic battle group. However, any decision on a specific contribution to a battle group will be subject to formal Government approval. It will be met within the context of the overall ceiling of 850 personnel serving overseas at any one time, as set out in the White Paper on Defence.</P>
    <P>The Nordic battle group was organised some time ago and most of the core elements are already in place. In addition, battle groups covering the period through to 2010 have already been announced and on this basis, I expect that our contribution in the period to 2010 is likely to be limited. However, this will be a matter for ongoing discussion with other member states over the coming months, in particular, with Finland and Austria with whom we have also had some initial informal discussions. The discussions with these countries have been of a purely exploratory nature, as the main focus is on concluding arrangements with Sweden regarding the Nordic battle group.</P>
    <P>Most training for the battle groups will take place in the contributing member states, that is, Irish troops will mainly be trained in Ireland. However, some level of joint training with other battle group elements will be an imperative. The extent of any such joint training and whether training will extend to exercising is a matter for decision by battle group participants. No such training has taken place to date. The Attorney General has advised that there is a constitutional impediment to training foreign troops in Ireland. As such, there are no plans for training foreign troops in Ireland. However, as we are not a framework nation, this should not be a problem. As a framework nation for the Nordic battle group, Sweden has confirmed that there will be no requirement for joint training or exercises by the Nordic battle group in Ireland.</P><Col N="438"/>
    <P>When fully operational, the EU will have two battle groups available and on stand-by to respond to crises as they arise. As in the case of the forthcoming operation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the UN may request the EU and, thereafter, authorise the deployment of an EU force to undertake a peace support operation on its behalf. It will be a matter for the EU to decide whether the battle group is the appropriate response, having regard to the circumstances pertaining to the operation. Battle groups will not be established by the UN. The UN will authorise the deployment of a force and the EU will decide whether the battle group or some other force is to be deployed.</P>
    <P>The decision to use Northwood as the operational headquarters was taken by the current participating states in the Nordic battle group and is obviously a matter for them to decide. I can only assume that it is because Northwood has all the necessary infrastructure, communications systems, facilities and support which may not be otherwise available within the member states currently participating in the Nordic battle group. The establishment of an operational headquarters is not a simple matter. There are only a small number of such facilities in Europe, mainly in the larger member states. For example, Germany has such a facility in Potsdam, which is currently being used for the EU operation in the Congo. I welcome the contribution of the UK to the development of EU crisis-management response capabilities by making available the technical and support facilities at Northwood.</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied that our participation in the battle group concept in no way weakens or undermines Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality. On many occasions, I reiterated that our participation in peace support operations will continue to require UN authorisation. Participation in battle groups will not diminish this requirement in any way. Ireland&rsquo;s basis for participation in missions undertaken by the EU is grounded in the legitimacy conveyed by the UN Security Council. That will not change. The triple lock of UN, Government and D&aacute;il approval will remain in place.</P>

    <P>Section 8 in the new Act is at the hub of the sham debate we have had about neutrality in this country. It represents an Irish solution to an Irish problem. Irish troops may be somewhere in Europe, waiting to cross the start line. They may have D&aacute;il and Government approval, but cannot move until the Americans, Russians and Chinese solve their old problems and come forward with a UN Security Council resolution.

	<P>I do not agree with Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s final point. We will have to agree to disagree.</P>
    <P>With regard to his technical questions on training, the troops will not be trained here. If we join the Nordic battle group, we will not be training in the UK. The training usually takes place in the framework state, which for the Nordic battle group is Sweden. It is 99.9% probable that the training will take place in Sweden. The Deputy also asked about a referendum to change the Constitution to allow foreign troops to train here. It is not high on the Government&rsquo;s list of priorities at the moment, but I do not think it is necessary in any case. The practice in multinational battle groups is that training usually takes place in the framework state. In this case, the framework state is Sweden. If we decide to join another battle group after 2010, it is most unlikely that we will be a framework state at that stage either. There are other issues on which we could hold a <Col N="440"/>referendum that the Government might regard as more urgent.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>At the moment, it does not seem that any Irish troops are serving abroad legally.</P>
    <P Just="Left">My question was about the establishment of battle groups. The Minister is saying they will be authorised, rather than established, by the United Nations. How will the troops involved train and how will they be deployed for training outside this country if they have not been established by the UN? This raises serious questions about section 3 of the new legislation. That section bypasses the triple lock mechanism by providing that a contingent or member of the Permanent Defence Force may, with only the sole prior approval of the Government, conduct or participate in training, undertake monitoring, observation or advisory duties abroad, and participate in or undertake recognisance or fact finding missions. Does that appear to provide for the deployment of troops abroad to be trained in various military exercises that may or may not become a battle group authorised by the United Nations at some time in the future?</P>
    <P>How can the Minister manage to authorise a battle group, which is a rapid response mechanism, if he must wait for authorisation from the Security Council and UN General Assembly? They meet only on a regular scheduled basis and do no have urgent meetings to consider matters of that nature. What will happen in this regard? If an engineering section or signal section of Irish troops are to be deployed, will the battles take place and the war be over before they are deployed? There is nothing in the legislation that indicates how the Minister will get such an authorisation in time to effectively operate a battle group.</P>

I am simply told the Bill will be debated in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il at a certain time. If Deputy Gormley is on this side of the House after the next election, he will find that is the position. The Minister does not have any input on the allocation of such time.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer the questions the Deputy asked me. If he is right in saying we have no authority to send out forces which are only authorised by the United Nations, a point on which I do not agree with him, he would still be wrong in his statement that there is nobody abroad serving legally because the force in Liberia, which is our largest force, was established by the United Nations.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the key point. I am glad the Minister admitted that. We have one force established under UN mandate.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the other matters concerning training and whether there will be training and exercises, that will all be dealt with on Second and Committee Stages of the legislation. The Deputy&rsquo;s point about a force being authorised rather than established is not relevant to battle groups because our contribution to a battle group will take place only after the legislation has been passed, and the legislation will clarify that.</P>

	<P>No, this has nothing to do with the Seanad, it has more to do with operational matters. That is the issue.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister agree there is a broad remit in the provision of the legislation dealing with battle groups where it states the international United Nations force means an international force or body established, mandated, authorised, endorsed, supported, approved or otherwise sanctioned? Will the Minister agree that George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld have said their troops are in Iraq because their mission there has been otherwise sanctioned by the Security Council? In other words, this legislation has become meaningless &mdash; it is such a broad stroke, and it is a stroke.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of the deadline of 7 July, we are literally the last into the field in terms of a contribution to a battle group, about which I have taken a certain amount of criticism.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>

	<P>It is not our fault.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not excluding the Minister in this respect.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the Government&rsquo;s fault either. We had certain legislative and technical difficulties to overcome and we have done that, and people are literally waiting for a decision. On the last occasion I answered questions in the House, I gave an undertaking that this legislation would be through the Houses hopefully by the summer recess. I could not guarantee that but I said that was my ambition. There is still a fortnight before the summer recess. I do not choose the times for the taking of legislation.</P>
    <P>On Deputy Gormley&rsquo;s question as to whether participants in a humanitarian mission can return fire if they are fired on, my understanding is that if troops are on a humanitarian mission, generally speaking, they would be unarmed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is saying troops will be unarmed if they are part of a battle group.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>It will depend on the circumstances of the mission.</P>
    <P>In regard to what the Deputy said about a force being endorsed, supported, sanctioned and so on, the law provides and will continue to provide that we will only commission troops on international peacekeeping operations if the United Nations directs that we do so. Everybody knows the United Nations want troops to keep the peace or to prevent people from being murdered in various regions but we cannot contribute such troops because of a technicality. The wording of the United Nations resolution does not meet the requirements of the Irish Defence Act, and it is not as if the Security Council of the United Nations would have a copy of the Irish Defence Act before it whenever it draws up a resolution. That would be absurd.</P>

	<P>We spoke earlier about Irish personnel who participated in Partnership for Peace and that the legislation is being brought in to confirm their legal status.

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The advice on that matter has been given by the Attorney General with reference to a particular article in the Constitution. The advice is that those people are not unconstitutionally allowed to come here whereas contingents of troops coming here bearing arms would be unconstitutional.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 78 together.</P>
    <P>There is no judicial decision of the courts relating to the compulsory retirement of the individual concerned from the Permanent Defence Force in 1969, nor is there a judicial decision that fair procedures were not followed with regard to the retirement of the individual from the Permanent Defence Force in 1969.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The High Court judgment of 27 July 2005 related to a report completed by the civilian Judge Advocate General in September 2002. The presiding judge, Mr. Justice Quirke, held that the report should be quashed because fair procedures had not been applied in the compilation and production of the report and in the timing of the release by the Department of Defence of certain documents. He concluded his judgment by stating: &ldquo;The decision made in 1969 to recommend the Applicant&rsquo;s retirement from the Defence Forces remains unaffected by any Order made in these proceedings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The individual concerned was retired by the President, on the advice of the Government, with effect from a date in June 1969. The retirement was effected pursuant to section 47(2) of the Defence Act 1954 and Paragraph 18(1)(<i>f</i>) of Defence Force Regulations A.15, which provide that an officer may be retired &ldquo;in the interests of the service&rdquo;. The House will appreciate that a decision to retire an officer in the interests of the service is only taken for the most compelling reasons. The Government advice to the President in 1969 was on grounds of security. I am satisfied the matter was handled in an entirely appropriate and proper manner in 1969 and that the decision was taken only after detailed and due consideration.</P>
    <P>The individual concerned initiated proceedings in the High Court in November 1998 with regard to the circumstances of his retirement some 29 years earlier. The High Court found in favour of the State in June 1999 on grounds of inordinate delay in the bringing of the proceedings. The individual appealed to the Supreme Court in September 1999 and it refused that appeal in January 2001.</P>
    <P>In early July 2002, arising from a newspaper feature article on the case published on 29 June 2002, the then Minister requested the Judge Advocate General to examine and review the case. The Judge Advocate General, a civilian barrister, carried out a detailed examination and review of all the historical documentation relating to the decision to retire the individual concerned by reference to the entirety of both the civil and military files in the matter. Her report was sub<Col N="446"/>mitted to the then Minister in mid-September 2002 and published in October 2002.</P>
    <P Just="Left">In December 2002 the individual applied to the High Court for an order quashing the report of the Judge Advocate General. As I have already said, the High Court found in favour of the applicant for reasons enumerated in the text of the High Court judgment. It should be emphasised again, however, that the High Court judgment in the matter of the report of the Judge Advocate General specifically related to the actual procedures utilised by the Judge Advocate General in the course of her review and examination of this matter in 2002 and to the release by the Department of Defence of certain documents to the individual only after completion of the report. The individual concerned specifically did not seek an order for <i>mandamus</i> from the High Court and, therefore, did not request the High Court to remit the matter, or to direct a resumption of the Judge Advocate General&rsquo;s original inquiry, or to direct that a new inquiry be held by the Judge Advocate General or by any other person.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The substantive issue, namely the Government decision in 1969 to recommend the retirement of this individual from the Defence Forces by the President, remains unaffected by the judgment of the High Court, a point specifically emphasised within the text of the judgement. All the issues raised by the recently published book in connection with this case are being reviewed and I will consider whether any further action is appropriate in due course.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed by the Minister&rsquo;s response, apart from his last line which offers some encouragement.

It would be impossible to reconstitute that procedure because the nature of the court decision was that the type of inquiry necessary is not appropriate. It would be an inquiry where, on one side, the applicant gives oral evidence, but on the other side, we would have only the dusty archives or people too old or ill to give evidence. Very few people have been dismissed by the Army in the interests of the service because that is a serious matter. The issue in question was taken seriously for that sort of action to be taken.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise the issue of the media guidelines for the portrayal of suicide which were launched yesterday in Dublin and Belfast on behalf of the Irish Association of Suicidology and the Samaritans, which are both Thirty-two County organisations.</P>
    <P>Any suicide is a newsworthy event. The fact that an individual has chosen to end his or life deliberately and prematurely attracts public attention. The sad truth is that there are more than 500 suicides each year, but a more frightening statistic is that more than 11,000 people each <Col N="448"/>year present at accident and emergency units having attempted suicide or self harmed. It is estimated that the number of those who self harm is in excess of 60,000. The majority of suicide deaths go unreported, yet the effect of each individual suicide has a profound impact on family, friends, colleagues and community.</P>
    <P>For journalists, a suicide presents a difficult dilemma. As an issue of concern to the public, it is clearly the responsibility of the reporter to present the facts as they happen without glamorising the story or imposing on the grief of those affected. Research from the UK, the USA, Australia and other countries overwhelmingly indicates that public presentation, whether factual or fictional, can and does lead to so called copycat suicides, also known as suicide contagion.</P>
    <P>Specific concerns in this regard suggests those most affected are under the age of 24, although there is now more evidence that elderly people are also more prone to copycat suicide. The risk is greater when there is a sense of identification with the deceased, such as the case of a celebrity suicide or the suicide of a fictional character with whom the vulnerable person empathises and identifies, for example, because of age or background. Research suggests that romanticising suicide, idealising those who take their own lives or portraying suicide as a heroic act, even inadvertently, may encourage others to identify with the victim and view suicide as an attractive option and an acceptable strategy for dealing with their problems.</P>
    <P>Providing specific details of a suicide method gives vulnerable people the knowledge they need to take their own lives. Media portrayal does not just affect choice of method but can increase the numbers of suicides. Written media, newspapers, magazines, books and websites are more likely to provide an incentive for imitation than broadcast media. This seems to be because the affected person can look at, absorb and be influenced by the information on a number of occasions whereas broadcast coverage is more transitory.</P>
    <P>The Irish Association of Suicidology&rsquo;s and Samaritan Association&rsquo;s media guidelines for the portrayal of suicide highlight the fact that suicide is a difficult and complex issue, but that it is also a legitimate topic for serious discussion in factual and fictional media. The associations disagree with the view that suicide should not be discussed. Instead the guidelines highlight some of the ways the media can avoid perpetuating myths and misinformation and make a positive difference in people&rsquo;s attitudes.</P>
    <P>The organisations&rsquo; guidelines offer practical and sensible advice regarding the reporting of suicide. They advise reporters not to provide explicit or technical details of suicide methods, to avoid prominent or front page coverage, not to use dramatic photographs, not to romanticise or glorify suicide, not to imply there are positive <Col N="449"/>results to be gained from suicide, to include details of further sources of information and advice and to avoid the use of phrases such as &ldquo;a successful or unsuccessful suicide attempt&rdquo;, &ldquo;suicide victim&rdquo;, &ldquo;just a cry for help&rdquo;, &ldquo;suicide prone&rdquo; and &ldquo;stop the spread or epidemic of suicide&rdquo;. They suggest instead that reporters should use phrases like &ldquo;a suicide&rdquo;, &ldquo;a suicide attempt&rdquo;, &ldquo;take his or her life&rdquo;, &ldquo;die by suicide&rdquo;, &ldquo;a completed suicide&rdquo;, &ldquo;person at risk of suicide&rdquo; and &ldquo;help prevent suicide&rdquo;. Regarding the dramatic portrayals of suicide, if the viewer or listener feels they can identify with the character, then the likelihood of imitative behaviour is increased. This is particularly the case if the character concerned is young and sympathetic. Young people and the elderly are at great risk of suicide and research shows that they are the most likely groups to be influenced by media presentation. The time of year is also important. Christmas Day and St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day, for example, are particularly difficult times as they mark major anniversaries without a loved one.</P>
    <P>The guidelines on portrayal of suicide in the media were drawn up jointly by the Irish Association of Suicidology and the Samaritans. This was an update of the publication of January 2002. Speaking on my own behalf and not on behalf of any of the organisations involved, I seriously question the decision of the HSE national office of suicide prevention in giving an interview to <i>The Irish Times</i> on the day before the launch of the publication and giving an interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on the day of the launch which had a serious effect on the success of the event. I can only assume that the office has so little success since its inception that it decided to hijack the work of two NGOs. This sends a very bad message to NGOs working in the area of suicide prevention.</P>
    <P>When reporting suicide, a fine line must be drawn between sensitive intelligent reporting and excessively sensational portrayal of suicide. The most important guiding principle is to consider the reader, listener or viewer who might be in crisis when they read, hear or see the piece. Will the piece make it more likely that they will attempt suicide or more likely that they will seek help? Will the piece cause more pain to the bereaved of suicide?</P>

   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on today&rsquo;s adjournment.</P>
    <P>The media play a very important part in raising awareness about suicide and suicide prevention, and in changing the stigma and our attitudes to suicidal behaviour and to mental illness. Suicides can be newsworthy and dramatic events. That an individual has chosen to end his or her life, delib<Col N="450"/>erately and prematurely, suggests that there is a story to be told. For journalists and editors, suicide presents a dilemma. It can be an issue of public interest, thereby coming within the ambit of news reporting. There can be a positive aspect to reporting suicide, as debate may help to de-stigmatise the subject and provoke a wider discussion about the importance of good emotional health. However, research also shows that inappropriate reporting or photography can lead to copycat suicides.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of the Media Guidelines for the Portrayal of Suicide, which the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy O&rsquo;Malley, launched on Tuesday of this week. The publication is a joint collaboration by the Irish Association of Suicidology and the Samaritans and has been produced primarily to help those working in the media. It makes suggestions for journalists, writers, photographers and directors, working in television, radio, theatre, film, print and electronic media.</P>
    <P>The guidelines are not meant to be exhaustive and they do not seek to dictate, because each situation is different. They aim to offer support in deciding how to approach what is undoubtedly one of the most difficult matters to cover. These guidelines offer practical suggestions on appropriate reporting of suicide, such as the use of appropriate language, including details of sources of information, the avoidance of simplistic explanations for suicide and the avoidance of detailed descriptions of suicide methods.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, there was in the past a reluctance to even discuss the issue of suicide. Thankfully, this situation has now changed. In Ireland, the level of discussion and openness on mental health issues, including deliberate self-harm and suicide has increased significantly in recent years, which is very welcome. However, we need to ensure that public discussion and media coverage of suicide and deliberate self-harm remains measured, well informed and sensitive to the needs and well-being of psychologically vulnerable and distressed individuals in our society. In particular, we need to continue to work as a society to create a culture and environment where people in psychological distress feel able to seek help from family, friends and health professionals.</P>
    <P>Suicide touches the lives of many people and is in every case a tragedy, both for the life that has ended and the family, friends and community left behind. Many of us will know someone who has attempted suicide or died by suicide. The number of deaths by suicide registered by the Central Statistics Office was 431 in 2005. Young males have shown a significant increase in the rate of suicide in the past decade, with 321 such deaths in 1995 rising to 353 in 2005. These findings reinforce the need for sustained and co-ordinated <Col N="451"/>action in response to the ongoing problem of suicidal behaviour.</P>
    <P>I recognise the many challenges that lie ahead and I am aware that there are no easy or single interventions that will bring a guarantee of success. International evidence shows that reducing the suicide rate and preventing suicides requires a collective, concerted effort from all groups in society &mdash; health, social services and other professionals, communities, voluntary and statutory agencies and organisations, parents, friends, neighbours and individuals.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the national strategy for action on suicide prevention was launched on 8 September last by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. A fundamental aim of the new strategy is to prevent suicidal behaviour, including deliberate self-harm, and to increase awareness of the importance of good mental health among the general population. The Health Service Executive is taking a lead role in overseeing the implementation of the strategy, in partnership with those statutory and voluntary organisations that have a key role to play in making the actions happen. Driving the implementation of the strategy is the national office for suicide prevention within the national population health directorate of the HSE. The role of the national office is to co-ordinate suicide prevention activities across the State, consult widely on the planning of future initiatives, and ensure best practice in suicide prevention. This year an additional &euro;1.2 million was allocated to the national office.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the implementation of suicide prevention initiatives and the further development of our mental health services in order to prevent, and reduce, further tragic loss of life.</P>

N&iacute;l s&eacute; ar intinn agam a bheith drochbh&eacute;asach.</P>
    <P>In the absence of the success of the HSE in providing a facility that would meet the needs of the Irish-speaking people in Connemara, this building was provided and has been available since September 2005. Nothing has happened since. I have received a letter from the Health Service Executive stating that in the past ten years 49 public nursing home spaces have been provided in County Galway, 12 in &Aacute;ras Ron&aacute;n on the Aran Islands, 17 in Carna and 20 in Carraroe. The letter states that in the next five years no new nursing home spaces are envisaged. No spaces have been provided in Galway City for the past ten years. There are 32 beds in St. Francis Home.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>We have a facility made available through voluntary work, the opening of which the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs attended as did the chief executive of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. No representative of the Health Service Executive was available to attend the open day. Local people are looking after the building. They go in and switch off the alarm which is regularly activated. The building, which is surrounded by 20 small houses for the elderly, has been ready to be fitted out for two years. This contrasts with the speed with which private hospitals are being facilitated on the grounds of University College Galway. Bids have been sought, to be submitted before 30 June, for a new hospital and the successful applicants will be selected within weeks of that date from consortia currently seeking shares from consultants who are contracted to provide public health care. In Connemara, on the other hand, people must look at a building for which no provision has been made for maintenance, security or operations, despite old people living around it.</P><?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
    <P>The building to which I refer was given as a gift, as it were, a gesture that deserves praise. The way in which the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government combined with other bodies to provide this facility is precisely the type of approach we need. The other logical and practical step to take in Connemara would be to introduce a mobile service because many of the elderly people in the area cannot make the journey into Galway city. It makes no sense that the building lies empty and in danger with local people having to look after it. I ask the Minister of State to raise the matter with the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Without wishing to detract from the position of the Ministers of State who are present, I object to the Minister&rsquo;s decision not to come before the House.</P>
    <P>The matter I raise also concerns an empty building. The Minister for Education and Science has refused to accede to the demand made by parents of children in Naas that the new 16 classroom school in the town be fully opened for pupils in September this year. The background to this astonishing situation is that the four well established national schools in Naas are bursting at the seams with class sizes of up to 32 pupils and play areas packed with prefabricated buildings. More than 400 children are being taught in this type of unsuitable and, allegedly, temporary accommodation and for many of them prefabs <Col N="454"/>will be the only type of school accommodation they will ever experience. As we speak, further prefabricated buildings are being added to existing schools. Despite this, 40 children have been denied places in Naas schools this year because they are overflowing and unable to take further pupils.</P>
    <P>A long and sustained campaign mounted to have a new national school in Naas was successful and a new school with 16 classrooms was opened earlier this year. At this point, however, the logic of a lunatic asylum took over. The Education Act gives parents the right to send their children to the school of their choice and individual schools the power to adopt their own enrolment policies. The Minister and the planning section of her Department in Tullamore are seeking to deny these rights to the parents in Naas and the board of the new school, Scoil Bhr&iacute;de. The Minister restricted enrolment in the new school to two infant classes, a practice she described as the norm. In response to a parliamentary question, however, she was unable to indicate another school where this approach had been taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed me in a written answer that the existing schools had sufficient places, whereas her Department has confirmed that more than 40 eligible children cannot be accommodated in Naas schools. The Minister of State should address this contradiction. The Minister recently informed the principal of Scoil Bhr&iacute;de that the 40 surplus pupils can be enrolled in the new school and any children moving into the area during the school year may also be enrolled. It appears from this statement &mdash; I have copies of the relevant letters &mdash; that other classes, apart from infant classes, will partially open but the staff required to open all the classes will not be provided and children who live across the road from the school will not be allowed to enrol.</P>
    <P>I demand that the messing and uncertainty cease, the Minister allow Scoil Bhr&iacute;de to establish its an enrolment policy that would enable it to open fully in September for all 16 classes, as it is entitled to do under the Act, and the parents be afforded their right under the Education Act to send their children to the school of their choice. What should have been a good news story for the Minister and the parents, pupils and teachers of Naas has turned into a crazy nightmare scenario in which children in the town are packed into unfit prefabricated buildings while a new state-of-the-art, 16-classroom primary school provided by the parents&rsquo; taxation lies idle. I ask the Minister to apply her renowned common sense to this issue and open the new school fully in September.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity of outlining to the House, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, the actions being <Col N="455"/>taken by the Department of Education and Science with regard to the enrolments of the new primary school in Naas.</P>
    <P>Scoil Bhr&iacute;de national school is a new school which opened in September 2005. It currently accommodates two junior infant classes and when fully occupied it will operate as a two-stream, 16-classroom school. To enable it develop in this manner, it can only enrol two junior infant classes annually. This incremental development is common to all newly established schools to ensure that a shortage of accommodation at the school is avoided by over-enrolment in the early stages and, crucially, that the enrolments and staffing levels in other schools in the area, from which older pupils would inevitably be drawn, are not adversely affected. Notwithstanding this position and as an exceptional matter, the school has been given approval to enrol three junior infant classes for the next school year on the grounds that this will not impact negatively on the other schools in question.</P>
    <P>Typically, a new school commences in temporary accommodation, which is provided incrementally thereafter to meet the school&rsquo;s junior infant intake level each year in the context of junior infant accommodation available in other schools in the area. A new school would have achieved a certain sustainable growth level without affecting other schools before transferring to its permanent accommodation. Its developmental curve would continue on this basis until all its accommodation is in use.</P>
    <P>If a building is available for the school in question at inception, it does not mean that an orderly growth can be abandoned given the effect excessive enrolments will have on other schools in the area which have also been funded by the taxpayer. While enrolment policies are a matter for school authorities, the Department of Education and Science expects the enrolment polices of individual schools to complement the demand for pupil places in an area and, as in this case, to assist the growth of the new school in an orderly fashion. This is in the best interests of the schools, pupils and wider community alike.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, the existing schools, which have served the community well, particularly by obliging with extra pupil places when there was severe pressure for such places in recent years, now have a certain level of accommodation and teaching allocations in place. This cannot be ignored because a new school and new building have come on stream which will, in their own right, cater for the continuing growing needs of the area, as was always the Department&rsquo;s intention. The new school will of course be expected to cater for the small number of pupils in classes higher than infants for whom no place is available in the existing established schools in the town. The new school will be expected to cater for the <Col N="456"/>small number of pupils in classes higher than infants for whom no place is available in the existing established schools in the town. The Department is confident that, between them, the primary schools in Naas can meet the needs of the increasing schoolgoing population in the town. I hope my reply was of some benefit to the Deputy.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>This country is facing a number of crises. We have all realised that a crisis exists in the health services, and a drug epidemic is sweeping the country, especially in terms of cocaine. Figures revealed in the Permanent TSB-ESRI house price index confirm what everybody but the Government believes, namely, a housing crisis has also arisen. House prices have risen by an explosive 270% over the past decade. It must be asked whether the wages of working men and women have increased accordingly. I do not think they have.</P>
    <P>The review also revealed that house prices in Dublin are a massive &euro;130,000 more expensive than the rest of the State. In 1996, the difference was &euro;10,000. When I got married 20 years ago, I could not afford a house in Rathfarnham where I grew up, so my wife and I had to move to Tallaght. Now, however, young people from Tallaght have to move as far away as Portlaoise to afford a house. Many of the young people I know must live at home until their late 20s or even 30s. Generations are living in the same house.</P>
    <P>The Government emphasises shared ownership and affordable housing, options which are welcome for many people. However, people on social welfare or low incomes do not have the option of buying their homes. The roll-out of affordable housing is not much use to lone parents or part-time workers.</P>
    <P>Nine years ago, the Government woke up to the fact that housing problems existed and commissioned Mr. Peter Bacon to compile a series of reports. Mr. Bacon made a number of recommendations but these seemed to have fallen on deaf ears. Investors get mortgage relief on second houses at a cost of &euro;60 million per year to the taxpayer. When this relief was abolished in 2001, the housing market improved. However, despite the recommendation in the Bacon report that the relief be removed for good, it was reimposed by the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy. The National Economic and Social Council also recommended the removal of the relief because it drives up the price of houses for local people. The Government&rsquo;s priority should be on homes for people, not on holiday homes.</P>
    <P>Some 44,000 people are on waiting lists for social housing. Sinn F&eacute;in has campaigned for the <Col N="457"/>introduction of a constitutional right to a roof over people&rsquo;s heads. In one of the wealthiest countries in the world, it should not be seen as a privilege to have a home.</P>
    <P>A global housing survey indicated that Irish house prices are unsustainable. While the cost of land is on average 20% of the total cost of house construction in industrial countries, it is 50% in Ireland. The contentious Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 stipulates that 20% of residential development sites must be used for social and affordable housing, but many builders pay money instead of delivering housing units. The <i>Building Industry Bulletin</i> of 2002 found that the profit on building land in Ireland was 300% above average profits. The Kenny report recommended a ceiling on the price of land of the existing value of agricultural land plus 25%. Again, however, no action was taken by the Government. Many young people in Ireland face difficulties, yet the Government does not seem to realise that a crisis exists.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter, as well as the other comments made on house prices in recent days, arise mainly from a press release by Permanent TSB, the special tenth anniversary edition of the Permanent TSB-ESRI house price index. This has the appearance of a rather contrived piece of publicity, given that the first issue of the index was only published in July 1998, even if it contained backdated figures to 1996. The launch of an affordability index by EBS also generated a lot of publicity, even though the affordability figures turned out to be well within the criteria applied by lending institutions themselves.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that an institution such as Permanent TSB is eager to dramatise house price increases. Last year, when I voiced concern about the likely impact on house prices of increased lending and 100% mortgages, Permanent TSB responded by pointing out that the rate of house price growth had been moderating, which was the case until then, and stated that it believed the introduction of 100% mortgages would not have any impact on moderation or in any way contribute to house price inflation. Few now agree with that prediction and statistics do not give any credence to it. In a recent quarterly bulletin, the Central Bank noted that the gradual acceleration in house price inflation since last autumn had coincided with some easing of credit conditions. The bank stated that this seemed, at least in part, to reflect an increased effort on the part of mortgage lenders to market new products, specifically, 100% mortgages.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank&rsquo;s comments are helpful and I hope they will promote a more restrained approach than the presentation made by a Permanent TSB representative at a conference earlier this year which proclaimed the merits of 100% mortgages, interest-only mortgages, 40-year <Col N="458"/>mortgage terms, the inclusion of room rental potential in income assessment and, as a more radical solution for the future, the prospect of intergenerational mortgages.</P>
    <P>Many financial institutions have hyped up the price of houses over the past year. My belief that it is time for more sanity in the mortgage lending area broadly accords with the sentiments expressed yesterday by the President of the European Central Bank. We could do with much less hype in the housing market and an end to scaremongering about the inability of first-time buyers to gain a foothold in the market. This is important because price expectations have an important influence on the market. A certain amount of damage has been done by hype and overly aggressive marketing. Some people have been stampeded into buying sooner than may be necessary, putting first-time buyers into competition with each other and stretching buyers&rsquo; borrowing to the limit of what may be prudent.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It would be foolish to ignore the potential implications of excessive lending at individual and macro levels for house prices, which are determined not only by the numbers seeking houses but also by the volume of available funds. While easier credit may seem a panacea for some individuals in the short term, the overall impact on market prices and the long-term implications in terms of personal debt are not likely to be favourable. If things go wrong, the Government can always be blamed. The figures quoted by PTSB do not show the full picture. They are based purely on PTSB&rsquo;s lending and relate to a mixture of new and second hand houses. My Department&rsquo;s statistics, based on returns from all mortgage lending institutions, show that the rate of increase for new houses nationally was a good deal less, 210%. Prices in Dublin have also been skewed by a number of high profile and highly priced new developments, while second-hand prices are often inflated by demand for houses with potential development sites attached, as well as scarcity in highly sought after areas. Typical first-time buyer prices are a good deal lower than the overall average &mdash; on average approximately 13% less and lower in some cases. In Deputy Crowe&rsquo;s constituency affordable housing has been put on sale at &euro;142,000 for a two bedroom house and &euro;172,000 for a three bedroom house.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, Mr. Dick Roche, T.D., Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government has responsibility for the National Emergency Plan for Nuclear Accidents and he has informed me that the Irish Government has in place the National Emergency Plan for Nuclear Accidents. The Plan was first drawn up and published in 1992 and the most recent revision took place in December 2005. This Plan is designed to provide the framework for the response to a major emergency at a nuclear installation in the UK or elsewhere if there is a risk that radioactive contamination could reach Ireland. It conforms to the best international standards and practice as established by the International Atomic Energy Agency and is continuously reviewed and updated in the light of technological, scientific and medical advances, although the core messages remain the same.</P>
    <P>A major exercise of the Plan takes place every few years in order to test its effectiveness and to enhance emergency preparedness. The most recent exercise, in 2005, called &ldquo;INEX-3&rdquo;, was carried out under the guidance of the OECD&rsquo;s Nuclear Energy Agency. The particular exercise was mainly concerned with the testing of decision making in relation to agricultural countermeasures and food restrictions following a <Col N="462"/>simulated nuclear accident in the UK. A report on this exercise will be published in due course.</P>
    <P>The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are represented on the Emergency Response Coordination Committee under the National Emergency Plan for Nuclear Accidents. The principal roles of the Defence Forces under the Plan include the collection of sea water samples by the Naval Service, the provision of aircraft for such aerial surveys as may be required, the monitoring of radiation levels by the Reserve Defence Forces, and such other assistance as may be required in the implementation of countermeasures.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 205 together.</P>
    <P>The Government agreed on 16 December 2003 to the release of circa 2.5 acres at St. Bricin&rsquo;s Military Hospital, Dublin for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress Affordable Housing Initiative. The primary purpose of the Initiative is to maximize the early delivery of affordable housing units. The site is being transferred to Dublin City Council as specified by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for a nominal consideration.</P>
    <P>A valuation carried out by the Commissioner of Valuation in February 2005 indicated an estimated value of &euro;9.5 million. It is the responsibility of Dublin City Council, as advised by the <Col N="463"/>National Development Finance Agency, to ensure that value for money is achieved in respect of the use of the site for the initiative. The legal formalities in relation to the transfer of the site to Dublin City Council are nearing completion.</P>

	<P>Bere Island, Co. Cork, was among the Coastal Defence Properties handed over to Irish administration in 1938. At that time, approximately 800 acres was taken over by my Department. However, since the 1960&rsquo;s, the State has sold a considerable area of land and my Department currently administers approximately 176 acres on the island. The property is vested in the Minister for Finance.</P>

     <Quest>his proposals for the replacement of 1916 and War of Independence medals for those families who feel proud of their ancestors service and contribution to the founding of the State and would like a visible expression of same, in view of the recent Easter 1916 commemorations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated in the course of my reply to the Adjournment debate in the Seanad on the 17th May 2006, my Department receives requests from time to time for the replacement of lost, stolen or destroyed medals awarded to Veterans of the 1916 Rising and the War of Independence. It has been settled Departmental policy for many years that replacement medals were issued on a once only basis on receipt of a bona-fid&eacute; request from the Veteran to whom the medals were originally awarded. This policy was adopted in the interest of preserving the intrinsic value of these medals and to strictly limit the number of medals issued in any particular case. Although almost all of the Veterans are now deceased, the rationale for restricting the issue of replacement medals is still valid.</P>
    <P>While this has been the long-standing Departmental policy, I can understand the feelings of the family members of Veterans when requests for replacement Medals are refused. I have therefore decided that an official certificate should be issued in such cases confirming that one of the medals in question was awarded to the named Veteran. If more than one medal was awarded, a separate certificate would be provided for each medal.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
    <P>My Department is in the process of finalising the format and design of the certificates and, once this process has been completed, will make con<Col N="464"/>tact with those people who have recently sought replacement medals.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 22, 40 and 47 together.</P>
    <P>Ireland is currently contributing 678 Defence Forces personnel to 19 different missions throughout the world. Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement.</P>
    <P>The main commitments are to the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), with 333 personnel, to the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo, with 213 personnel and to EUFOR, the EU-led operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with 60 personnel. Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the UN, EU, OSCE and NATO.</P>
    <P>With regard to future participation by the Defence Forces in UNMIL, the original plan was to withdraw the Irish Contingent towards the end of this year. However, in response to a recent request from UN Secretary-General Annan to the Taoiseach, it has been decided to extend the duration of the deployment in Liberia to May 2007.</P>
    <P>In March 2004, a reorganisation and downsizing of the NATO led forces in KFOR, which had partly commenced earlier, was deferred following civil disturbances in Kosovo at that time. That restructuring has now recommenced and is ongoing. However, having regard to the fragility of the peace in Kosovo, and subject to ongoing assessments of the situation on the ground, both myself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are <Col N="465"/>agreed on the importance of maintaining an Irish presence in the Western Balkans in 2006/2007. There is no plan to alter the Irish contribution to EUFOR&rsquo;s Operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina over the next twelve months.</P>
    <P>Ireland receives requests from time to time in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. On 9 May, 2006, the Government authorised the dispatch of members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the new EU military operation, Eufor RD Congo, in support of the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC), authorised under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1671 of 25 April, 2006. The main purpose of the EU operation is to be available to support MONUC during the upcoming election process, due to take place under UN supervision in July 2006, for a four month period. A total of seven Defence Forces personnel will be deployed with the EU mission.</P><Col N="466"/>
    <P>An informal request for Irish Defence Forces participation in a new UN force in Darfur was received from the UN last month. However, after careful consideration of the request, the UN was advised that due to our extended engagement in Liberia to May 2007, we are not at this time in a position where we could provide additional troops or support to the prospective UN Mission in Sudan.</P>
    <P>Ireland&rsquo;s commitment under the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System (UNSAS) is 850 which represents 10% of the total Army strength. This is the figure set in the White paper on Defence and is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas operations. There are no plans at this time to increase the level of our commitment to UNSAS and any contribution to EU or UN Missions will be met within the context of the 850 ceiling. </P><Col N="465"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 69 together.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that I have recently received the military authorities report on the minimum height standards for Defence Force <Col N="468"/>personnel prepared in the context of encouraging more women to apply to join the Defence Forces. The report deals comprehensively with the complex issues relating to this matter and as such requires careful consideration. I will be reviewing the height requirement for entry to both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force, in the light of this report, and would expect to be able to make a decision on this matter shortly. It is also my intention to publish the report in the near future.</P>
    <P>I must point out that height is not the only issue in encouraging more women to apply to join the Defence Forces and I have recently initiated more general research in this area. To this end, tenders have been received from companies willing to undertake research into the issue of recruitment and retention of women in the Defence Forces. It is intended that the research will test women&rsquo;s attitudes to military life and a career in the Defence Forces. I envisage that the research will include interviews with currently serving female members of both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force and members of the general public. The contract will be awarded for the research in the very near future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 24 together.</P>
    <P>A computer and security card, which were the subject of a recent article in the print media, were stolen from a member of the Permanent Defence Force, who was serving with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitoring mission in Georgia in April 2004. The computer was taken from the officer&rsquo;s apartment together with a number of personal items in the city of Tbilisi. The computer did not contain material of a classified nature.</P>
    <P>The OSCE mission in Georgia was established in December 1992 in response to armed conflicts in the country. The mission assists the Government of Georgia in the fields of conflict settlement, democratisation, human rights and the rule of law. Irish Defence Forces personnel have been deployed to the mission since 1994. One officer currently serves with the mission. The nature of the officer&rsquo;s duties, as defined by the OSCE, involve promoting negotiations between the conflicting parties in Georgia, which are aimed at achieving a peaceful political settlement.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
     <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that <Col N="471"/>the frontline aircraft of the Irish Air Corps are not able to match the speed of a regular jet airliner; if he will respond to the attached analysis of military aircraft; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[23738/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Air Corps is the air component of the Defence Forces and as such its military roles and functions are those of an Army Air Corps rather than a conventional military air service. The Air Corps has traditionally discharged a mix of functions based on the need to supply a range of different services. Over the years a generally favourable security climate resulted in the need for a very limited military air capability. To exceed this capability would require a level of investment in personnel, equipment and infrastructure which could not be justified.</P>
    <P>The Government in formulating the White Paper on Defence decided that the broad profile of Air Corps roles would be maintained and that future development of the Air Corps would be determined within policy parameters which set out the general air-based military and non-military capabilities which the State will seek to provide. Aspirations to broaden the range of available air based capabilities have to be balanced against real world constraints. The fact is that, given the enormous costs involved, few small countries possess the ability to provide a comprehensive air based defence capability. The choice must lie between maintaining an essentially token force to address all dimensions of national defence or seeking to perform a selected range of tasks to a professional standard. The latter option has been the one chosen in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Pilatus PC 9 aircraft were obtained as trainer aircraft for the purpose of training pilots in the Air Corps. They are capable of being armed and as such have a limited defensive capability. They are not fighter aircraft and would not be able to match the speed of a civil airliner. As indicated already, the security climate is such that it is considered that there is no need for the Air Corps to acquire fighter aircraft, the cost of which would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>In this connection the Air Corps fleet has been considerably modernized in recent times with the acquisition of two EC 135 helicopters for pilot training, in addition to the eight Pilatus aircraft. A further four AW 139 helicopters will be delivered in 2006/2007 which will permit the Air Corps to participate in military operations involving troop transport. As the document provided by the Deputy does not reflect the policy in this area no useful purpose would be served by commenting on it at this time.</P>

	<P>The Reserve Defence Force&rsquo;s most important contribution, as outlined in the White Paper on Defence, is to support the Permanent Defence Force in its contingency defence roles in an emergency situation. In peacetime, the main function of the RDF centres on training and preparing for these contingency roles.</P>
    <P>The Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan, which was formally launched in July 2004 and will continue over the period to end 2009, sets out an ambitious programme of change that will result in the Reserve Defence Force having enhanced capabilities and improved interoperability with the Permanent Defence Force. To date the Reserve has been re-organised along similar lines to the Permanent Defence Force with a three Brigade structure and Reserve Defence Force Training authority as well as a dedicated Naval Service Reserve. Improved training, equipment and clothing are also provided for in the plan and to date significant advances have occurred.</P>
    <P>The plan also provides for the development of an element of the Reserve, known as the Integrated Reserve, which will comprise Reserve personnel who will train with PDF units and operate as part of those units in contingency situations. This aspect of the plan is currently being addressed and pilot schemes will commence in 2007.</P>
    <P>Another important recommendation was that Reserve personnel should be afforded the opportunity to serve on overseas peace support missions. While there are no immediate plans for participation by members of the Reserve in overseas missions, policies to support the selection of suitably qualified personnel for overseas duties will be developed over the lifetime of the implementation plan. Any such participation by members of the Reserve is likely to be in specialised areas such as medical, transport, engineering and communications and information services. This will also be subject to personnel having suitable qualifications, their personal availability and appropriate advance training. The legislative changes required will be addressed in due course.</P>

	<P>A decision to establish an intergovernmental agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments, known as the European Defence Agency (EDA) was formally adopted at the General Affairs and Exter<Col N="473"/>nal Relations Council meeting on 12 July, 2004. At the meeting of the European Defence Agency Steering Board on 21 November 2005, agreement was reached on an intergovernmental regime (a voluntary Code of Conduct) to encourage competition in the European Defence Equipment Market. The voluntary Code of Conduct will seek to eliminate or reduce the use of Article 296 and the use of offsets and other market distortion instruments.</P>
    <P>The Code of Conduct will be introduced for subscribing Member States on 1 July 2006. Twenty two Member States have agreed to implement the Code (Spain and Hungary have opted out and Denmark does not participate in the EDA). While Ireland is not a major consumer of defence equipment in relative terms, developments which improve market efficiencies or which may yield some economies of scale for equipment procurement for the Defence Forces, should be encouraged and would obviously be beneficial in terms of driving prices down. It is hoped that the effect of the code of conduct would be to deliver more efficiency in terms of our investment in defensive equipment for the Defence Forces.</P>

	<P>An informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers was held in Brussels on 15 May 2006. At the meeting, progress on the development of Strategic Airlift and the Implementation of the Battlegroup Concept were reviewed. Another important step was the completion of the Requirements Catalogue 2005 and the finalisation of the Headline Goal Questionnaire. It is envisaged that the Force Catalogue will be produced in the second semester of 2006.</P>
    <P>A report was received from the Operational Commander of the planned EU Support mission in the Congo. As the House will be aware, Ireland offered up to 10 Staff Officers for the Headquarters. The mission is oversubscribed, so 7 of the 10 will be deployed, 5 in Potsdam in the <Col N="474"/>Operational Headquarters and 2 in Kinshasa in the Force Headquarters.</P>
    <P>Progress made by the Austrian Presidency on Civil Military Coordination (CMCO), was reviewed. CMCO is an initiative commenced under the UK Presidency and will continue through the forthcoming Finnish Presidency. This issue has to do with the very practical matter of co-ordinating the various strands of EU civil and military actions in crisis management operations so as there is an overall coherence to the EU&rsquo;s approach. There was a discussion on Security Sector reform regarding the need for increased coordination among the EU institutions and other international actors so as to maximise the impact of our joint efforts on Security Sector Reform in the Balkans.</P>
    <P>On the same day, the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency (EDA) met. Developments to support improved competition within the European Defence market were discussed and a Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain was agreed. The proposals are designed to facilitate increased competition among sub-contractors supplying the larger equipment producers. This should result in increased opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME&rsquo;s). The Steering Board had previously agreed a Code of Conduct in defence procurement, which will become operational from 1 July 2006, and which will help to open up the defence procurement market generally.</P>

	<P>In general, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor pays the costs of the State&rsquo;s legal team. This includes Counsel Fees, Medical Fees, Fees for Expert Witnesses, State solicitors, Stenographers etc. These costs are charged to the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Chief State Solicitor has advised us that in the period 1998 to date, when the vast majority of Army Hearing Loss cases were finalised, it has paid a total of &euro;17.8m in such fees. This included &euro;11.4m for Counsel Fees. During this period, the Department of Defence also directly paid &euro;2.0m in other costs associated with the processing of hearing loss claims.</P>
    <P>These amounts do not include the costs of staff and overheads in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, the Defence Forces, or the Department of Defence incurred in processing these claims.</P>
    <P>The management of new and outstanding hearing loss claims was delegated to the State Claims Agency with effect from 1st September 2005. Since that date, my Department has paid a total of &euro;601,000 in Plaintiff and Agency legal, and related costs to the State Claims Agency in respect of hearing loss claims.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service operates eight general-purpose patrol ships. All eight ships are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies such as Internal Waters, Territorial Sea and the Irish Sector of the Exclusive Economic Zone.</P>
    <P>The main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State&rsquo;s obligations as a member of the European Union. The Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the <Col N="476"/>shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Fishery Limits.</P>
    <P>The current Exclusive Fishery Limits extend to 200 miles offshore and cover an area of 132,000 square miles. The Naval Service currently patrols the entire 200 mile limit and periodically patrols beyond these limits to protect specific fisheries. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. The number of Patrol Vessels on patrol in Irish waters at any one time varies between three and seven. The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time.</P>
    <P>Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two Casa maritime patrol aircraft. Fishery protection activity accounts for over 90% of all Naval Service patrol time and more or less all of the Maritime Squadron&rsquo;s output.</P>
    <P>The operational targeting of the fishery protection effort is coordinated with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in accordance with procedures set down in the Service Level Agreement between the Departments. Such targeting takes account of previous history of fishing, infringements, sightings, fishing zones, closed areas and species and allocated quotas, amongst other things. There is a comprehensive process in place to identify and agree patrol plans and inspection targets. The objective in all cases is the protection of the fishing assets of the State.</P>
    <P>The patrol vessel concentration for other EU States is a matter for the individual member states.</P>

As regards the question of honouring surviving veterans, the special 90th anniversary commemoration of the events of Easter 1916 constituted a most significant public recognition by the State of the roles played by all who participated in the events of 1916 through to 1922.</P>
    <P>The surviving veterans were invited to be guests on the reviewing stand for the military par<Col N="477"/>ade and later at an official reception in Dublin Castle.

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 58 and 79 together.</P>
    <P>On 2 February, 2006, I received a report from Mr. Sean Hurley, who I had appointed to carry out an independent review of the interaction between the Department of Defence/Defence Forces and parents and family of Private Kevin Barrett in the aftermath of his tragic death, on 18 February, 1999, while serving with the 84th Infantry Battalion in Lebanon. Mr Hurley has looked in detail at how the Department and the Defence Forces interacted with the Barrett family after Kevin&rsquo;s death and has identified some clear failings and shortcomings. Important lessons have been learnt for the future and errors that have occurred in the handling of this tragic case, outlined by Mr. Hurley, must never be repeated. Mr Hurley acknowledges that some of these have since been addressed in the new &ldquo;Guidelines for Dealing with Bereaved Families&rdquo; introduced by the Defence Forces in 2001.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of Mr Hurley&rsquo;s report, the recommendations and conclusions in relation to procedural and operational issues have been considered by the Defence Forces to see how they might best be implemented. The military authorities have undertaken a review of the guidelines for dealing with bereaved families in the light of Mr Hurley&rsquo;s recommendations. I am advised that, while there is no proposal to further amend the <Col N="478"/>revised arrangements put in place in 2001, the guidelines continue to be reviewed on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces standard operating procedures in relation to the investigation, reporting and handling of such incidents are also being reviewed to take account of the various other recommendations in the report. Any changes deemed necessary will be incorporated into Defence Forces Administrative Instructions and Directives. Finally, the recommendation in relation to the role of the attending Medical Officer in the case of autopsies conducted outside the jurisdiction is also being reviewed to see how this might be implemented, having regard to the fact that the Medical Officer may have no standing in the foreign jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Immediately on receipt of Mr. Hurley&rsquo;s report, I contacted the Garda Commissioner and asked him to provide me with his early views in relation to any possible assistance that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might be in a position to provide. The Garda officer assigned to the case is currently examining my Department&rsquo;s and the Defence Forces files in the case, with a view to determining whether the Garda&iacute; can provide any assistance in the matter. Liaison arrangements have been set up between the Garda&iacute; and the Defence Forces, who continue to provide the fullest cooperation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
    <P>To date the Defence Forces have assisted in providing access to the considerable number of witnesses associated with the case and have also facilitated the visit by the investigation team to Lebanon and Israel. The weapon that fired the fatal shot has been handed over by the Defence Forces to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for tests and arrangements are underway for the return to Ireland of the billet in which Pte Barrett died. The Garda inquiries are ongoing and when completed, I expect the Commissioner will contact me in the matter.</P>

	<P>The Government decision on decentralisation, announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement on 3 December 2003, provides for the transfer of all of my Department&rsquo;s<?oasys _jy ?>Dublin based civil service staff to Newbridge, Co. Kildare. The number of staff to be relocated to Newbridge is 200. A total of 385 personnel, of which 60 are from within the Department, have opted to move to Newbridge. An additional seventeen staff from outside my Department have been assigned to this Department for the purpose of relocating to Newbridge.</P>
    <P>Twenty four members of staff who opted not to move to Newbridge have volunteered to transfer to other Government Departments that have units that are proposed for decentralisation, and some have already moved to their new Departments. One hundred and fifty personnel have opted to remain in Dublin, and to date, ten of these have been reassigned, with a further number to be assigned over the coming months. The Government decision also provides for the transfer of 300 Defence Forces Headquarters staff to the Curragh, Co. Kildare.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 72 together.</P>
    <P>The lead responsibility for specific emergency planning functions remains with the relevant lead Government Departments and those bodies under their aegis. Emergency plans are <Col N="480"/>coordinated and exercised by the various lead Government Departments at a national level and through the Local Authorities, including the Fire Services, the Health Service Executive and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at local and regional level.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, I have requested Departments and key public authorities to ensure that there are structured exercise programmes in place and to report to the Task Force on the status and progress of these programmes. In the past six months I have attended two simulated exercises; the first in Dublin Airport on 28 March and the second in Shannon Airport on 25 April. The Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern TD, attended the Dublin Airport Exercise. The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Mr. Pat the Cope Gallagher TD also attended.</P>
    <P>This Dublin Airport Exercise scenario involved a MAYDAY call to the Airport&rsquo;s Air Traffic Control Service from an incoming flight. The exercise was carried out as part of the Irish Aviation Authority&rsquo;s licensing requirements for Dublin Airport and was simulated as a &lsquo;real&rsquo; event. Along with the Dublin Airport Authority personnel (Airport Police Fire Service and Airport Police) the emergency was also attended by the key agencies that would be involved in a real event &mdash; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin Fire Brigade and the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Ambulance Service. Overall it was considered that the exercise went well and the objectives were met.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Airport Exercise &lsquo;Exercise Eagle&rsquo; took place on 25 April at Shannon Airport. The aim of the exercise was to test the inter agency response to an aircraft accident at Shannon Airport. The Agencies involved were the Airport Police and Rescue Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Air Traffic Control, Clare County Council, Clare County Fire Service, Health Service Executive (West), Health Service Ambulance Service (West) and Shannon Airport Authority Management and Operations. The Exercise Eagle Report will be formulated by the Exercise Committee in due course.</P>
    <P>I believe that the development of structured exercise programmes is essential in order to refine and develop the arrangements that exist, to continuously improve them through review and revision, and to generally provide the basis for an increased confidence in the emergency planning process. A comprehensive programme of exercises for 2006 is in train. I have asked Departments and key public authorities to identify suitable exercises that I or my cabinet colleagues may attend.</P>

	<P>In July 2005 the Government approved the establishment of a National Emergency Coordination Centre. The primary purpose of this Centre will be to provide a dedicated, central and multifunctional facility in which a high-level inter-departmental group of Ministers or senior officials would convene to coordinate the response in the event of a national level emergency.</P>
    <P>A suitable location for the National Emergency Coordination Centre has been selected. However, some refurbishment works were required in order to facilitate the relocation of staff from the selected location to alternative accommodation. I understand that this work is now complete. The completion of this work facilitates the commencement of the substantive refurbishment works to meet the requirements of a National Emergency Coordination Centre. I understand that tenders for this work have been received and are currently being assessed. It is hoped that a contract will be placed in the very near future.</P>
    <P>A further contract process is in train to address the technical and communications needs of the National Emergency Coordination Centre. I understand that contract documents are now being finalised in relation to this aspect of the work.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 56, 63, 64, 73 and 80 together.</P>
    <P>I established an interdepartmental group made up of representatives from the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Department of An Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, to examine all issues relating to Ireland&rsquo;s potential participation in an EU-led rapid response capability. As part of its study the interdepartmental group recommended changes to current legislation in relation to overseas service. The main elements of these changes concern the updating of the Defence Acts in relation to UN mandated peace support operations, humanitarian operations, overseas training and exercises and a number of avoidance of doubt provisions. The requirement for this amending legislation arises irrespective of our participation in Battle groups.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, Ireland participates in missions either established or authorised by the UN Security Council. The consistent advice of the Attorney General is, and continues to be, that missions established or authorised by the UN Security Council fall within the requirements of the existing Defence Acts. However, there is a question as to whether other terms such as endorses or supports, which are a feature of such resolutions, would pass the test in the current Defence Acts. It would be unacceptable that, as a result of a legal technicality in our Defence Acts, the Permanent Defence Force would be precluded from participating in a legitimate UN peace support operation, solely on the basis of the specific language used in a resolution. As such, I am taking the opportunity in this Bill to put this issue beyond doubt. In doing so, I am also taking the prudent approach of putting beyond question any possible challenge to our participation in missions authorised by the UN. The Triple Lock requirement of UN, Government and D&aacute;il approval will continue to stand.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that there is no question over the legality of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in UNMIL, KFOR, EUFOR or any other peace support mission which is the subject of a UN Security Council Resolution. Participation in all such missions is subject to the advice of the Attorney General on the relevant resolution. As <Col N="483"/>I already stated, the consistent advice of the Attorney General is, and continues to be, that missions established or authorised by the UN Security Council are consistent with the requirements of the existing Defence Acts.</P>
    <P>In the Defence Amendment Bill, 2006, I also propose to provide for the participation by Defence Forces personnel in humanitarian operations in response to natural and man-made disasters such as the tsunami in South East Asia or the earthquake in Pakistan. Having regard to the contribution which Defence Forces personnel can play in disaster areas and Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to support disaster relief and humanitarian response, it is important that the Defence Forces can be deployed to such missions in an appropriate manner, under normal military command and control, and with the appropriate safeguards. It is also vital that Government can respond to legitimate and urgent requests for humanitarian relief by affected States involving resources and equipment which may only be available from military means in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, such as, temporary accommodation, tents, water treatment plant, generators, lifting equipment and other capabilities.</P>
    <P>The advice of the Attorney General, contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Group, is that members of the Permanent Defence Forces may only be despatched for service outside the State as part of an International United Nations Force, that is, a force established or authorised by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations. Under the current Defence Acts, the option to despatch a contingent of the Defence Forces on humanitarian operations is not available to the Government, as such events are not the subject of UN Security Council resolutions. In these cases, Defence Forces personnel must volunteer for service with a civil undertaking (such as an NGO), in the same manner as any ordinary citizen, whereupon the NGO would then deploy them to the disaster area. The provision in the proposed legislation will enable the Government to deploy members of the Permanent Defence Force as Defence Forces personnel under military command in response to a disaster or emergency.</P>
    <P>In the case of rapid response, including Battle group commitments, it will probably be necessary to have equipment containerised and despatched, together with personnel, while the UN Security Council resolution is being finalised. In addition, members or contingents of the Permanent Defence Force may have to assemble in the Framework Nation for the Battle group, with their equipment, ready for despatch in advance of the formal adoption of the Resolution. The Defence (Amendment) Bill 2006 is designed to facilitate this type of rapid response deployment, a facility, I might add, that has been welcomed and is strongly supported by the United Nations.</P><Col N="484"/>
    <P>The provision in the Bill in relation to overseas training will include exercises. This is vitally important in the context of interoperability with other forces contributing to international peace support operations, and to rapid response and is an important force protection issue. Currently, in Liberia we are operating jointly as the quick reaction force and in KFOR as part of a multinational task force. However, we can&rsquo;t continue with the current situation where our first joint training is when we are on the ground in a real, live and potentially dangerous environment. In certain situations, we will need to engage in joint training with other countries with whom we will be deployed, so as we can operate from the outset as an effective and cohesive force.</P>
    <P>The amendments in relation to training are designed solely to improve Ireland&rsquo;s interoperability with other forces with which it will be operating when deployed on peace support operations on foot of a UN Security Council Resolution. It is a force protection issue, mainly related to our participation in EU Battle groups. There is no connection between this legislative amendment and our participation in PfP.</P>
    <P>Alongside these changes, I am also bringing forward a number of avoidance of doubt provisions relating to the deployment of members of the Permanent Defence Forces in international organisations such as the EU and the UN, the deployment of Defence Forces personnel in monitoring and advisory roles, the undertaking of training, reconnaissance and fact finding mission etc., all of which have been a facet of Defence Forces operations for many years.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the advice from the Attorney General to the effect that there is no formal basis in the Defence Acts for the despatch of Permanent Defence Force personnel on such duties, I think it important that the matter be put beyond doubt. I am taking the opportunity in the Defence (Amendment Bill) 2006 to do this.</P>
    <P>All of these issues are important and have been addressed explicitly in the Bill. With the co-operation of the Oireachtas, I would hope to have this legislation enacted before the summer recess.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I am conscious of the need to keep the public fully informed of developments in the emergency planning area. Following consultation with the key Government Departments and public authorities involved in emergency planning, I decided in <Col N="485"/>2005 to proceed with a market research programme into public attitudes and awareness of emergency planning in Ireland. The results of this research, which took place in late 2005 and early 2006, will be used to underpin a public information and awareness campaign on emergency planning.</P>
    <P>The research provided the following conclusions:- The level of public worry about extreme but unlikely emergencies is at quite a low level though this is susceptible to change in the light of events and media coverage of them. Expectations about the degree of planning likely to have been made by the authorities for an emergency vary widely, with the knowledge about what has actually been done being very limited. There is likely to be a negative reaction to the perception that substantial public resources are being diverted to prepare for events which may never happen, when there are so many urgent priorities to address. It is desired that there be some degree of official preparedness and, in the absence of much existing awareness of any of this, there is clearly a communications job to be done.</P>
    <P>Based on the results of this market research, a communications company was commissioned to devise a strategy on the approach to be taken by Government in its future public information and awareness campaign on emergency planning in the short, medium and long term. This work was recently completed and is being examined at present.</P>

	<P>Military vehicles undergo regular maintenance and overhauls to ensure that they are roadworthy and provide value for money service. When, having regard to age, condition and mileage, vehicles are considered by military transport personnel to have reached the end of their economic life, they are proposed for disposal. Before the disposal action can be commenced, each vehicle requires examination and certification by a Military Board of Survey. A procedure has been adopted in recent years whereby all military vehicles are disposed of by public auction with due cognisance given to the age, condition and mileage of the vehicles and their suitability for sale in that manner.</P>
    <P>From time to time charitable organisations approach the Department requesting that an obsolete vehicle, such as an old ambulance or minibus, be donated to them. Such requests are <Col N="486"/>considered on their own merit. Registered Charitable Organisations are assisted when possible, allowing for the fact they would not be in a financial position to purchase such a vehicle otherwise.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The tender for the supply of foodstuffs is an estimation of requirements published to inform suppliers of the type and quantity of products that may be required on a particular running contract. The tender is not a reflection of the exact diet of members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Efforts have been made over the past year by the Food Procurement Section of the Defence Forces to increase the variety of food products available to members of the Defence Forces through the Value Based Ration System. Considerable attention has been given to the addition of whole food products such as wholegrain bread, pasta and rice to running contracts. A 300% increase in the range/type of fruit and vegetable products available to Defence Forces personnel has also been brought about by allowing retailers to tender for a much larger variety of goods than had been the case in the past. These product areas were selected for attention, as these products are low in saturated fats and high in fibre, vitamins and minerals.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces are also committed to involvement in the Food Safety of Ireland salt reduction programme and are currently seeking low sodium alternatives to regular food products from suppliers. The fact remains that, due to the often strenuous nature of their work, the calorific energy requirement of the daily diet of Defence Forces personnel would be in excess of the 2,000 kcal &mdash; 2,500 kcal required by the sedentary population. The range of foodstuffs available ensures that these extra calorie needs can be met in a healthy manner.</P>
    <P>All senior catering managers receive training on the requirement for a healthy diet, ensuring that personnel can avail of meals incorporating all of the major food groups with the correct proportions of carbohydrate, protein and fats. With regard to the weight and fitness levels of Defence Forces members, there is a requirement on all <Col N="487"/>personnel to pass an annual fitness test. Physical training is an integral element of each unit&rsquo;s daily programme of training. Levels of fitness in the Defence Forces have improved greatly in recent years since this became a compulsory requirement.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 71 and 76 together.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence outlines the blueprint for a new Reserve Defence Force. An Implementation Plan has been developed that will ensure the realisation of the White Paper vision. This will be rolled out over the period to the end of 2009. The new Reserve will have a clearly defined role, an enhanced relationship with the PDF, better equipment and training and opportunities to serve on overseas peace support missions.</P>
    <P>The Reserve has already seen significant improvements in terms of clothing, equipment, training and resourcing. It is now organised along similar lines to the PDF and the introduction of the integrated element of the Reserve is currently being addressed. All of these changes will enhance the capabilities of the Reserve as well as improving interoperability with the PDF. These factors are significant enablers in facilitating any future participation by Reserve personnel in overseas missions.</P>
    <P>While there are no immediate plans for participation by members of the Reserve in overseas missions, policies to support the selection of suitably qualified personnel for overseas duties will be developed over the lifetime of the Implementation Plan i.e. over the period to end 2009. In other countries, service by Reservists on overseas peace support missions is quite common, although as specified in the Plan, any such participation by members of the Reserve is likely to be in specialised areas such as medical, transport, engineering and communications and information services. This will also be subject to personnel having suitable qualifications, their personal availability and appropriate advance training.</P>
    <P>Development of policies to support the selection of suitably qualified Reserve personnel for overseas duties will include consideration of the <Col N="490"/>impact of overseas duties on the employment of Reserve personnel and the question of legislation will also be considered in this context.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of existing Defence legislation, only members of the Permanent Defence Force are permitted to serve overseas and an amendment to the Defence Act will be required in order that members of the Reserve can serve overseas. This will be addressed in due course.</P>

     <Quest>the number of times the Air Corps has been requested to assist in search and rescue at Glendalough, County Wicklow since 1 January 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Air Corps has not received any requests from the Irish Coast Guard or any other agency to assist in a Search and Rescue mission at Glendalough, Co. Wicklow since 1 January 2005.</P>
    <P>The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime Search and Rescue services within the Irish Search and Rescue Region. The Air Corps withdrew entirely from the provision of Search and Rescue (SAR) services in October, 2004, following a handover of this role to CHCI, a private operator, which now provides the service at the country&rsquo;s SAR bases at Dublin, Shannon, Waterford and Sligo. I understand that the mission list for the Coast Guard&rsquo;s service includes air ambulance, island relief, medevac, etc.</P>
    <P>However, the Air Corps continues to provide limited non-maritime search and rescue response and the specification for the new helicopters being acquired for the Air Corps has this capability.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence establishes the roles of the Defence Forces as including the provision of service to civil authorities as and when required. The Defence Forces have never been found wanting in this regard, and in the event of an emergency request from the Coast Guard, or, indeed from any other service, the Air Corps will obviously respond to any such request in its usual efficient and supportive manner and to the best of its capability.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 61 together.</P>
    <P>The military authorities advise that at present the staff strength of the Military Archives is three, comprising a commissioned officer, a non-commissioned officer and a private. The military authorities advise me that a strength of 5, including suitably qualified replacements for two retired Officers, is sufficient to meet the current demands on the Military Archives. I appreciate the importance of returning to five full-time equivalent staff in the military archives without delay.</P>
    <P>The requirement for a more suitable home for the Military Archives has been recognised for some time. The primary focus has so far been on the National Museum of Ireland facility at the former Collins Barracks Dublin, long considered as the most appropriate location for the Military Archives.</P>
    <P>Facilities are required to protect and safeguard the material currently stored and to provide for the deposition of future material, as well as permitting easy public access. An Inter Departmental Committee was established in early 2003 with terms of reference to examine and to advise on the best means of protecting and safeguarding the Military Archives by way of securing their removal from Cathal Brugha Barracks to new premises to be developed at the former Collins Barracks Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Inter Departmental Committee focused on feasibility studies based on a detailed examination of various locations around and within the Collins Barracks site. These studies were carried out up to early 2005 by a firm of architectural consultants engaged through the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The consultants identified potential locations within the Collins Barracks site. However, these feasibility studies also raised serious issues around the cost, planning and building/ architectural protection considerations involved in meeting the demands of the Military Archives on the Collins Barracks site. The implications of the serious questions raised about the location of the full Military Archives on this site are being examined in my Department.</P>
    <P>Particular challenges and difficulties in re-housing the Military Archives at Collins Barracks would be posed by the provision of extensive modern purpose-built facilities within the restrictions of an historic built environment. Consideration of some usage of the Collins Barracks site <Col N="492"/>has not been exhausted. However, I have asked the Interdepartmental Committee to extend its search beyond Collins Barracks and to revert to me with options. I have also requested that any scope for locating the Military Archives together with or alongside the National Archives continue to be explored in line with that body&rsquo;s own development plans.</P>

	<P>It is not generally the practice to sell defensive equipment. Such equipment is normally scrapped when it is considered to be defunct.</P>
    <P>However, there are a number of categories of equipment that are disposed off. The main category relates to military vehicles. Military vehicles undergo regular maintenance and overhauls to ensure that they are roadworthy and provide value for money service. When, having regard to age, condition and mileage, vehicles are considered by military transport personnel to have reached the end of their economic life, they are proposed for disposal. Before the disposal action can be commenced, each vehicle requires examination and certification by a Military Board of Survey. A procedure has been adopted in recent years whereby all military vehicles are disposed of by public auction with due cognisance given to the age, condition and mileage of the vehicles and their suitability for sale in that manner.</P>
    <P>Tender competitions are held with regard to the disposal of items such as empty Brass Cartridges and used tyres. The main prerogative here for the Department is that tenderers comply with all legislative requirements for the disposal of such goods following which the goods are sold to the highest bidder. In the case of tyres, the Department now pays for the disposal of such used tyres.</P>
    <P>From time to time, a major asset (s), which has reached the end of its economic working life, is sold off by public tender. An example is the sale of the Naval Ship, L&Eacute; Deirdre, which was sold <Col N="493"/>for &euro;270,000 with the assistance of an agent/auctioneer in June 2001.</P>
    <P>The income from the sale of surplus equipment, including vehicles, over the past five years was &euro;800,000 approx.</P>
    <P>With the arrival of the eight new Pilatus aircraft and two EC 135 helicopters and the planned arrival of four AW 139 helicopters, two in November 2006 and two in 2007, the disposal of six Marchetti aircraft, four Dauphin helicopters and one Gazelle helicopter by tender competition is ongoing.</P>
    <P>Tenders have been received for the Marchetti&rsquo;s and it is expected that a sales agreement will be made shortly. Additionally, tenders were received last week in respect of the disposal of four Dauphin and one Gazelle helicopter, associated spares, special tools etc. It is expected that the sale of the helicopters will be completed within the next three months.</P>

	<P>The revised Cadet competition is now seen as the primary means of commissioning from the ranks. The cadet competition has been revised to increase the maximum entry age to 28 and to award bonus marks to candidates with previous experience in the PDF or RDF. Results for the 2005 cadet competition are encouraging with 14% of PDF and 8% of RDF applicants being successful in obtaining cadetships as against 4% of &ldquo;civilian&rdquo; candidates.</P>
    <P>Commissioning from the ranks may also take place through periodic Potential Officers Courses (POC) that are held for non-commissioned personnel as required. Personnel are selected for such courses on a competitive basis and those who successfully complete the course are commissioned as Officers in the Permanent Defence Force. Finally, non-commissioned personnel who hold appropriate qualifications may be commissioned to fill specialist appointments where vacancies arise.</P>
    <P>It is intended to hold a competition later this year to provide an opportunity for enlisted personnel who have passed the cadet entry age to compete for entry on a potential Officers Course and ultimately, a commission. Consultations with the representative associations are ongoing. The outcome of this competition will inform policy on the issue of similar future competitions.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>When the difficulty with Dr. Lieberthal&rsquo;s registration came to light the first priority was the welfare of the troops who were attended to by him. The Director of the Medical Corps contacted each person who had served in Liberia during the period in question alerting them to the situation and advising them of the measures the Medical Corps were putting in place to deal with any concerns they may have.</P>
    <P>As a result any Defence Force member who wished to discuss any aspect of his or her treatment with a Medical Officer was invited to consult their local military Medical Officer or alternatively to contact the special medical hotline established by the Army Medical Corps.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Chief of Staff has reported to me on the circumstances that gave rise to this difficulty. I am satisfied that arrangements have now been put in place to ensure that, should the need arise in the future, only doctors registered to practise in Ireland will be engaged for service with the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Legal advice has been sought by my Department from the office of the Attorney General as to the performance of the specialist medical recruitment agency engaged to provide suitably qualified doctors. While this advice is still awaited it would not be appropriate, at this stage, to anticipate the outcome of the advice or possible follow-up action.</P>

	<P>I felt that the 90th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising would be an appropriate time to show the country&rsquo;s appreciation of the major part played by Veterans of the War of Independence and their spouses in the foundation of the State. Accordingly, I sought and obtained the approval of the Minister for Finance for an increase of 50% in these pensions effective from the 1st April 2006. The increased rates of pension, together with the arrears due from the 1st April, have been included with the June pensions recently paid by my Department. The increase is estimated to cost &euro;0.6m in 2006 and &euro;0.78m in 2007.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals to extend the War of Independence pensions to any additional categories. The level of these pensions is reviewed from time to time. They were last increased by 50% from the 1st July 2004 and previously from the 1st January 2000, also by 50%. The combined effect of the recent increases means that the pension rates have been more than trebled since the 1st January 2000.</P>

	<P>During the period 12 to 14 June, 2006, I took the opportunity to pay a short visit to Kosovo where I met with the Irish personnel of 32nd Infantry Battalion serving with the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of my visit was to see at first hand the work of the Irish Defence Forces personnel serving with KFOR and to convey to them, on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland, the deep appreciation felt regarding the outstanding manner in which they perform their duties in this challenging mission. On my visit, I was accompanied by the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and the Assistant Secretary General of the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>During the course of my visit I had a number of briefings and opportunities to see the work being done by the Irish Defence Forces personnel serving with KFOR. On 12 June, 2006, I visited Camp <Col N="497"/>Clarke to meet with the members of the 32nd Infantry Group stationed there. I had the opportunity to informally meet and speak with the troops and found morale to be very high. I was also impressed by the range of humanitarian activities being supported by Irish Defence Forces personnel. I was pleased to confirm that Irish Aid was providing &euro;25,000 to fund three specific local projects supported by the troops. These are the refurbishment of three school classrooms in Rasince, the construction of a sports arena for the school in Oklap and the refurbishment of school toilets in Bandukic.</P>
    <P>I later met Albiona Jashari and her family. Albiona Jashari is a young local girl whose critical eye operation is arranged and paid for from voluntary contributions raised by Irish troops.</P>
    <P>On 13 June, 2006, I had detailed discussions and briefings from the KFOR Commander: Lieutenant General Giuseppe Valotto at the KFOR HQ at Film City in Pristina. Lt Gen Valotto gave a full assessment of the current position across Kosovo and was fulsome in his praise for the Irish Defence Forces personnel serving there, including the Senior Irish Officer serving with KFOR.</P>
    <P>I had lengthy discussions with representatives from UNMIK at UNMIK Headquarters. There we discussed issues relating to economic and infrastructural difficulties in Kosovo and the timetable for the Status Talks. This was followed by a detailed briefing by an officer of the Irish Defence Forces, who is the Chief Military Liaison Officer with UNMIK to KFOR.</P>
    <P>That afternoon I travelled to Camp Ville to meet Col Miroslav Hlavac, the Commander of the KFOR Multinational Task Force Centre (MNTFC) and received a briefing by his Chief of Staff, who is an officer of the Irish Defence Forces. This was followed by a Helicopter flight and drive through the Irish Area of Responsibility. The visit was concluded by an informal dinner, hosted by me, in Pristina.</P>
    <P>KFOR was established on 10 June, 1999, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244, for an initial period of twelve months, to continue thereafter unless the UN Security Council decides otherwise. The role of KFOR is to support the maintenance of civil law and order within Kosovo so as to develop a climate of safety and security, which will enable the transfer of increased responsibility to the civil authorities. Ireland has participated in the KFOR since August 1999.</P>
    <P>In March 2004, a reorganisation and downsizing of the NATO led forces in KFOR, which had partly commenced earlier, was deferred following civil disturbances in Kosovo at that time. That restructuring has now recommenced and is ongoing. However, having regard to the fragility of the peace in Kosovo, and subject to ongoing assessments of the situation on the ground, both myself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are <Col N="498"/>agreed on the importance of maintaining an Irish presence in the Western Balkans in 2006/2007.</P>
    <P>The situation in the KFOR mission area has improved since the serious outbreak of violence in March 2004, the situation remains tense with sporadic violent incidents continuing. The KFOR mandate is expected to continue for some considerable time to come.</P>
    <P>The Irish contingent currently comprises an Infantry Group of some 213 personnel including a number of personnel in staff posts at various Headquarters. The Infantry Group was first deployed in September 2003. Previously a Transport Group had been deployed with KFOR since August 1999.</P>
    <P>The Irish Infantry Group operates as part of a multinational grouping, within the Czech led Multi National Task Force (Centre). It comprises a Mowag APC Mounted Company together with support and logistic elements. The main tasks of the Irish Infantry Group include the following; provision of general security to all ethnic groups, institutions and cultural sites; provision of support to UNMIK Police and other agencies with security tasks; identification of and reporting on extremist groups and activities; vehicle and foot patrols; vehicle checkpoints and operation of Observation Posts.</P>

	<P>The primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the Garda as required. Defence Forces Border operations are undertaken as aid to civil power (ATCP) requests. The Defence Forces also assist the Garda in relation to prisoner escorts, cash escorts and explosives escorts.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces have three Infantry Battalions and a Cavalry Squadron tasked with Border Security. They receive direct support from Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams and air support from the Air Corps. These units are based in barracks and military posts in counties <Col N="499"/>Donegal, Longford, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.</P>
    <P>The demands on the Defence Forces in relation to Border duty depend on the nature of the requests for assistance received from the Garda at any particular time. These requests include the provision of armed parties for the purpose of protecting garda&iacute; and the carrying out of duties such as vehicle checkpoints, mobile patrols, specialist search team tasks and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) tasks.</P>
    <P>The level of demand for Defence Forces assistance to the Garda in the Border area has reduced significantly in recent times and will be kept under review in my Department in consultation with the relevant Government Departments as well as with the Garda authorities.</P>

     <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
     <Quest>the average length of time between application and successful conclusion that couples wait in this country for inter country adoption; if there are regional variations in such waits; and the reason for such delays.</Quest>

	<P>Intercountry Adoption applications are received by and assessed by the Health Service Executive and PACT. PACT is a recognised adoption agency.</P>
    <P>According to the latest figures supplied to my Department by the HSE and PACT, at 31 March 2006, the average length of time between application and the conclusion of intercountry adoption assessment process is 25 months. There are regional variances in the length of that process, for example from 12 months in North Western Area to 37 months in the Mid Western Area.</P>
    <P>Following an examination of the intercountry adoption waiting list issue by the HSE and the Adoption Board in 2005 they indicated that waiting times for intercountry adoption assessment have been increasing because of: an increase in the total number of applicants; an increase in the number of Declarations of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt abroad; the significant increase in the number of post-placement reports resulting from the increase in successful applicants; and population movements within Ireland, which have also shifted the pattern of demand, increasing it in particular areas.</P>
    <P>In response the Government did allocate &euro;1 million to the HSE in additional ongoing funding commencing in 2005 to assist in tackling intercountry adoption waiting times. I understand that this additional funding is being used to pilot measures which will, for example, allow for more flexible working arrangements within the HSE with a view to addressing waiting times. The registered Adoption Society, PACT, has also <Col N="500"/>received significant additional funding to allow them to expand their intercountry adoption services.</P>

     <Quest>when her Department will bring in legislation whereby adopted children will have automatic access to their original birth certificate at the age of 18 without having to go through a contact register or other agency; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The current administrative arrangements that pertain regarding the release of original birth certificates to adopted persons in Ireland are as follows. The Adoption Board can and does release original birth certificates to adopted people based on applications received from the adopted person and with the co-operation of the original adoption placement agency. In only a small number of cases are such applications refused. The process involves the Adoption Board contacting the placement agency and asking them to determine the current circumstances of the natural mother and, if possible, to ascertain her views on the release of the birth certificate. The Board must also take into account the motives and intentions of the applicant.</P>
    <P>In 2003, 39 applications were approved, 55 were awaiting further information and 3 were refused. In 2004, 53 applications were approved, 30 were awaiting a report from the placement agency and 4 were refused. These arrangements derive from case law including consideration of the issue by the Supreme Court regarding the rights of the child to know the identity of one&rsquo;s natural mother and the need for the State to respect and vindicate the sometimes conflicting rights of the natural mother, being the right to privacy and confidentiality in respect of the adoption. Neither set of rights is considered absolute. Nevertheless, from the data above it is clear that in the majority of cases applications for the release of birth certificates are successful. These are not contingent on separate arrangements regarding a contact register.</P>
    <P>It was in light of the very complex nature of information and tracing in the area of adoption that the Minister for Children undertook a consultation process in 2003 in relation to adoption legislation and proposals for change. Following this process, administrative provisions relating to contact were drawn up with regard to the views of adopted persons, natural parents, adoptive parents, professionals working in the private and public adoption agencies as well as international best practice.</P>
    <P>The administrative arrangement which has emerged is the establishment of a Register, maintained by the Adoption Board. This allows <Col N="501"/>people affected by adoption to register their preferences on whether they want to be contacted. As outlined above, joining the Contact Register does not preclude an adopted person from applying for the release of their original birth certification. In fact, many adopted people have been made aware of their right to apply for the release of their original birth certificate when making inquiries to the Board about joining the register.</P>
    <P>This single register allows the Adoption Board to identify individuals whose names are entered on the register who have expressed a preference to have contact with one another. It is operating successfully. There is no &ldquo;veto&rdquo; register and no offences related to an individual&rsquo;s choice of whether to be included on the register or not or whether to agree to contact subsequently. The Register is an addition to the existing tracing/reunion services run by the HSE Regional Adoption Services and registered adoption societies. It is anticipated that the legislation currently being drafted will reflect these administrative arrangements.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government&rsquo;s actions to date, and its intention to place these arrangements on a statutory footing, demonstrate the balanced and considered approach which is being taken in relation to this complex and sensitive issue.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has statutory responsibility for the implementation of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996 and (Amendment) Regulations 1997, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 and provide for notification to, and inspection by the Health Service Executive of pre-school services. The Regulations apply to pre-schools, play groups, day nurseries, cr&egrave;ches, childminders looking after more than three pre-school children (other than their own such children, children of relatives or a sibling group) in the childminders own home and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
    <P>A review of the Regulations was undertaken by a group chaired by the Department of Health and Children which included the childcare organisations and the HSE. Work on the revised Regulations is at a very advanced stage following the consideration of various technical and legal issues. It is the intention that the revised Regulations will be signed shortly and introduced later in the year.</P>
    <P>The notification and inspection service is managed by the pre-school inspection teams of the Health Service Executive who are appointed by <Col N="505"/>the Executive as authorised persons for this purpose. These teams also provide an advisory service to the services which are statutorily required to notify in order to assist them in achieving and maintaining the appropriate standard. They also provide information to interested persons including parents, on pre-school services in the area.</P>
    <P>Following inspection of a service the inspectors provide the service provider with a report on the outcome of the inspection. The teams then work closely with service providers in addressing the recommendations of the inspection reports. Where persistent breaches of legislation occur the Health Service Executive can initiate prosecutions. In addition the inspection teams on receipt of a warrant from the District Court can inspect a premises where it is believed that a pre-school service is being carried on without notification having been given to the Health Service Executive.</P>
    <P>In 2001, a childminder advisory service was put in place to support and advise childminders of pre-school children who are exempt from notification under the legislation i.e. those caring for 3 or less pre-school children, a sibling group of pre-school children or pre-school children of relatives. Such childminders are encouraged to voluntarily notify this service. The childminder advisory service is operated at local level through the County Childcare Committees/HSE. The childminder advisory officers provide networking opportunities, advice, advisory visits, support and training for childminders who voluntarily notify.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I published on 7 April 2006, for consultation purposes, the draft Heads and General Scheme of a Bill providing for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). Included in the Scheme is provision for the establishment of the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services within HIQA. The Office of the Chief Inspector will be assigned responsibility for the inspection of residential services for older people, including private nursing homes. The closing date for receipt of submissions was 26 May.</P>
    <P>Approximately 70 submissions have been received. These submissions are currently being examined. I intend to submit revised Heads of Bill to Government soon seeking approval to commence drafting the full Bill. It is my intention to publish the Bill during the Autumn Session. The Department will continue to ensure that all International Charters regarding the care of older people are adhered to, as far as possible.</P>

The Deputy&rsquo;s questions relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>In line with the Government decision of 1998, which provided for the mainstreaming of services for people with disabilities, responsibility for the provision of vocational training and employment services transferred from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 2000. At that time an Inter-Departmental Committee, the National Coordination Committee on Training, Work and Employment (NCC), was established to co-ordinate activities during the transition period and to plan for the further development of these services in the following years.</P>
    <P>The work of the NCC is on-going and it continues to provide a valuable forum for the consideration of new and effective enhancements for these key services. In the estimates for 2006, significant additional funding totalling &euro;100 million has been included for the improvement of health funded support services for people with disabilities. As part of this provision, funding of &euro;10 million has been made available to address core under-funding and core staffing issues in services provided by the voluntary sector. The Health <Col N="510"/>Service Executive has been asked to allocate this funding on an equitable basis, having regard to the needs of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I expect that the Executive&rsquo;s consideration of these needs will take into account any urgent case for funding of necessary services currently provided through F&Aacute;S employment schemes.</P>

	<P>I should first explain that the Financial Regulator is responsible for implementing Section 19(1) of the Building Societies Act 1989, although the Financial Regulator is obliged to consult with my Department regarding the fixing of a limit. Under the Building Societies Act, 1976 the Registrar of Building Societies set a limit of IR&pound;3,000 on the amount which a Society could pay to the representatives of a deceased shareholder, without Grants of Probate or Representation being extracted. On 16 May 1991 the Central Bank specified, with immediate effect, a revised limit of IR&pound;5,000 after consultation with my Department. This limit was reviewed and amended in June 2002 from IR&pound;5,000 to &euro;10,000. It is understood from the Financial Regulator that the limit is scheduled to be reviewed again in 2007.</P>

This has been a long-standing policy.</P>
    <P>I have announced plans for the development of a comprehensive strategy to take the sector forward and inform funding priorities for the 2007-2013 period. The strategy will cover all aspects of the seafood sector including the fishing fleet, both inshore and offshore. The development of this strategy will involve a number of key elements including, the appointment of an independent leader of the strategy team, and the holding of regional meetings to hear views from all parts of the sector. The matters raised by the Deputy would, I believe, be appropriate for consideration within this framework.</P>

	<P>My Department has recently tendered for a Gas to the Northwest Study, in the context of the Government&rsquo;s objective for regional policy in the National Development Plan and having regard to the National Spatial Strategy. The scope of this study is firstly, to determine the feasibility of bringing gas from the Mayo-Galway pipeline to Donegal Town via Sligo, considering three specified alternative routes; secondly, to examine and assess options for and issues surrounding the development of gas-fired power generation along the pipeline routes; and finally, to present options for the provision of gas pipeline infrastructure and gas-fired power generation, with recommendations as to how best the options may be pursued.</P>
    <P>The alternative pipeline routes under consideration to bring gas from the Mayo-Galway pipeline to Donegal Town are: via Ballina and Sligo, via Castlebar, Claremorris, Knock and Sligo, or via Claremorris, Ballyhaunis, Ballaghaderreen and Sligo. A range of gas-fired generation plant sizes and types will be considered for each location. These locations are in or close to Bellacorick, Ballina, Sligo Town, Donegal, Castlebar, Claremorris, and Ballaghaderreen.</P>
    <P>In considering the benefits of the recommended options, the study will take into account the role of enhanced energy infrastructure in facilitating regional development and the National Spatial Strategy objectives. The study is expected to take about 6 months to complete and I expect that the contract will be awarded in July. The provision of gas to Fermanagh is a matter for the Northern Ireland Authorities in the first instance.</P>

    <P>The establishment of a national truth and reconciliation commission and the strengthening of the Burundian judicial system proposed by Secretary General Annan should contribute significantly to ending the culture of impunity as well as hopefully giving renewed impetus into the investigation of the many unsolved murders, including those of Mr. Mfayokurera and Mr. Ndikumana, committed in Burundi during its recent conflict.

In my responses of 5 and 10 May 2005 and 11 October 2005 to written questions from the Deputy regarding these cases, I referred to the importance for the Colombian peace process of a comprehensive legal framework for the process of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of the illegal armed groups, based on the principles of truth, justice and reparations for victims.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118, 135, 136 and 137 together.</P>
    <P>Ireland takes a consistently strong position on Burma, including in the European Union framework and at the United Nations. Together with our EU partners, we avail of all opportunities to condemn the abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Burma and deplore the lack of progress towards democracy. The recent visit by UN Under-Secretary-General (UN USG) Gambari to Burma from 18-20 May, was the first high-level visit to that country by a UN representative in more than two years. I welcome the fact that he was able to meet with the most senior Burmese leaders as well as with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and representatives of her party, the National League for Democracy, during the visit. I also welcome the agreement by the Burmese government that the UN should play a role in promoting common ground between the government and the National League for Democracy so that the National Convention, which is due to resume its work in October, can proceed in a more inclusive way. I would appeal to the Burmese authorities to live up to their undertakings in this regard.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the above developments, I remain very concerned about the situation. On 26 May, the EU issued a statement which noted with deep concern that the process of democratisation in Burma had recently suffered a worrying setback as the Burmese government stepped up its pressure against ethnic groups and the two main political parties. The statement noted that these actions contradict the professed intention to establish a genuine democratic nation. The statement also urged the Burmese government to accelerate the democratisation process, a process which should engage all political and ethnic forces in the country in a genuine dialogue and lead to the speedy completion of a constitution under civilian rule, which commands popular support and promotes peaceful and sustainable development.</P>
    <P>I remain deeply concerned that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been detained continuously for three years without charge and, once more, urge the Burmese government to restore fully her freedom and civil liberties. UN USG Gambari&rsquo;s visit generated high hopes that her detention under house arrest, which was up for renewal a few days after <Col N="517"/>he left Burma, might not be renewed by the authorities. This did not happen.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.6- ?>
    <P>On his meeting with her, Mr Gambari said that she appeared quite well. He had asked her whether she was well and, not being a doctor, whether he could say that she was well. She had said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to both. On 27 May, the EU issued a further statement which deeply regretted the decision of the Burmese government to extend the house arrest of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and deplored the fact that international appeals, including that of the EU, had once again gone unheard. It said that this decision will be seen as yet another sign that the Burmese government is unwilling to compromise and move in the direction of an all-inclusive democracy.</P>
    <P>I will continue to raise concerns about Burma on all possible occasions and to call on the Burmese government to assume its responsibilities towards its people and to allow the fullest possible UN involvement in a genuine process of democratisation and reconciliation. I am also strongly supportive of the fullest possible involvement by the UN Secretary-General, and his representatives, in working with the Burmese authorities on a genuine process of democratisation and reconciliation and in responding to the humanitarian needs of the long-suffering Burmese people. I would be very pleased if the UN Security Council were to consider the question of Burma, but I am not aware of any such plans beyond the recent briefing from UN USG Gambari.</P>
    <P>As regards the question from Deputy Keaveney, the Governing Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union adopted a further resolution on 12 May 2006 concerning parliamentarians in Burma. The latest resolution recalls the twenty three cases included in the earlier resolution and includes three further recent reports of arbitrary detention, unfair trial and harassment. I am not aware of any recent developments regarding these particular cases but have asked that they be kept under review in the period ahead.</P>

The Government shares the concerns which have been expressed about the conduct of the case and conditions under which the person is being held. We continue to monitor the case. In bilateral contacts with Israel, and together with its partners in the EU, the Government has regularly conveyed its <Col N="518"/>concerns about the human rights implications of Israeli security policies, and the importance of full compliance with international humanitarian law.</P>

    <P>The only significant development since my reply to question number 240 from the Deputy <Col N="519"/>on this matter, on 11 October 2005, is that Mr. Anwar filed a lawsuit on 27 January against Malaysia&rsquo;s former Prime Minister Mahathir for defamation, following remarks allegedly made by the former Prime Minister last September. He is seeking compensation and a Court injunction to prevent Mr. Mahathir from repeating the alleged defamatory words. The matter is before the Courts and a date has not yet been set for the trial. As I mentioned in the previous reply referred to, Mr. Anwar, while acquitted and released from prison in September 2004, is prevented from holding political office until April 2008.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 126 together.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Governing Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Council adopted further resolutions regarding these two cases at its most recent session on 12 May. There have been some developments in the case of Mr. Asif Ali Ardari, exiled leader of the Pakistan People&rsquo;s party and husband of exiled former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, since my reply to question number 242 from the Deputy on 11 October 2005. I under<Col N="520"/>stand that Mr. Zardari remains in the United States where he is convalescing following recent heart surgery. Mrs. Bhutto is believed to be in exile in Dubai.</P>
    <P>I am informed that a Court in Pakistan issued arrest warrants for Mr. Zardari and Mrs. Bhutto on 3 June in connection with alleged electoral irregularities. Mr. Babar Awan, lawyer for Mr. Ardari and Mrs. Bhutto, challenged the basis for the issuing of arrest warrants as both Mr. Ardari and Mrs. Bhutto had gone abroad with the permission of the Court. He also challenged the Court&rsquo;s assertion that Mr. Zardari is an absconder for his failure to appear in Court.</P>
    <P>I am advised that Mr. Makhdoom Javed Hashmi, leader of the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy party, who is currently serving a twenty-three year prison sentence for charges relating to defamation of the Pakistani authorities, applied for bail last July and that his application has been adjourned for an indefinite period. I understand that an appeal is also due to be heard on an application by the Prosecution to increase the sentence handed-down on Mr. Hashmi and that the Court has directed that both appeals be heard together. A date has not yet been set for the appeals. I understand also that Mr. Hashmi has reportedly been recently transferred to a prison outside Lahore where he is held in solitary confinement with limited visiting rights.</P>
    <P>Ireland and our EU partners continue to raise human rights and democratisation issues with the Pakistani authorities on a regular basis. Last December the EU troika of Heads of Mission in Islamabad carried out the regular half-yearly human rights d&eacute;marche with the Secretary of the Pakistani Ministry of Law, Justice and Human Rights. Concerns about a range of human rights issues, including the need to urgently establish a Human Rights Commission, were conveyed to the Pakistani authorities. We will continue to monitor closely the two cases the Deputy has raised in the period ahead.</P>

	<P>I regret that there have been no positive developments in this matter and that the situation remains as was set out in my reply of 5 May 2005 to the Deputy. As I mentioned in my previous reply, with regard to the disappearance of Mr. Gonchar and 3 others in 1999/2000, the EU in December 2004 placed a visa ban on four persons who failed in their responsibility to initiate an independent investigation and prosecution.</P><Col N="521"/>
    <P>On 10 April 2006 this measure was incorporated into a wider EU visa ban on members of the Belarussian leadership and officials responsible for the violation of international electoral standards and for the crackdown on civil society and democratic opposition. This ban, together with other measures recently adopted, reflects the serious concern shared by Ireland and our EU partners concerning the human rights situation in Belarus, and its failure to respect international standards in respect of democracy and the rule of law.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 134 together.</P>
    <P>There is no inconsistency between my statement to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of 13 June 2006 and the Reply of the Government to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe of February last. The question of the Government&rsquo;s withdrawing, amending or qualifying its Reply does not, therefore, arise. In its Reply, the Government stated that there were two circumstances under which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may consent to the transit of a prisoner through Irish territory. Specifically, one of these circumstances was where a prisoner is being transferred through Irish territory pursuant to Article 16 of the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.</P>
    <P>Article 16 of the Convention, to which Ireland and the United States are parties, sets out matters relating to the transit of prisoners. Arrangements for such transits would, under the terms of the Convention, require the prior consent of the relevant authorities here which in this case would be the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. For the reasons stated by the US, this Convention was not invoked. Had it been, further information in relation to the transfer of the sentenced prisoner would, of course, have been sought by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>More generally, under customary international law, a State may not exercise its sovereign powers on the territory of another sovereign State, without the consent of that State. This principle includes the detention by a State of a prisoner on the territory of another State. As a result of this principle a number of international conventions dealing with subjects such as extradition and the transfer of sentenced persons have provided mechanisms through which a State which wished to transit a prisoner through the territory of <Col N="524"/>another State can obtain the consent of that State (usually through its Minister for Justice) to such transit.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that under Article 29 of the Constitution, Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States and the Article also deals with the use of executive power in that regard.</P>

	<P>It is intended that work will begin later this year on the conservation of the Asgard and that it will be on public exhibition from 2009 onwards. The Asgard is currently in the care of the National Museum of Ireland. It is housed in the Museum&rsquo;s gymnasium building at Collins Barracks and a substantial amount of work on the conservation can be done in that location. A new gallery will be required for the display of the vessel. This can also accommodate the final phase of conservation. A group comprising representatives of the National Museum of Ireland, the Office of Public Works and my Department is overseeing the project.</P>

	<P>My Department administers the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which provides grant aid to local authorities in respect of the capital costs of a new swimming pool, a replacement pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool. The closing date for receipt of applications under the current round of this Programme was 31 July 2000 and since then a total 57 projects have or are being dealt with. Of the 57 projects within the Programme, 19 have been <Col N="530"/>completed and 14 are now under construction or are about to start construction. In addition, 24 other projects are at various stages in the Programme &mdash; 7 at tender stage, 9 at contract document stage and 8 at preliminary report stage. Details of these projects are provided hereunder. The Deputy should note that the progress of projects through the various stages of the programme is largely determined not by my Department, but by the speed at which local authorities progress their individual projects.</P>
    <P>My Department is carrying out an Expenditure Review of the Programme which is examining, among other things, how it has worked to date and what amendments, if any, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery. This Review is expected to be completed by end July. On completion of this Review, the question of re-opening the Programme can be addressed.</P>

     <Quest>the progress which has been made by the inter agency forum set up to address the situation following the closure announcement of Waterford Crystal&rsquo;s Dungarvan plant; the additional investment which has been made in the Dungarvan area through the efforts of the forum; the number of new jobs that have been created as a result of such investment; the number of former Waterford Crystal employees that have secured employment as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The inter agency forum in question was established by the Waterford County Manager. It includes representatives of the relevant Industrial Development agencies under the aegis of my Department. The forum has put in place a coordinated response for the provision of information to the relevant employees. Presentations, which provided details on Social Welfare Benefits, Revenue, Training Opportunities, Employment Opportunities and Business Start Ups, were made to the employees. Co-ordination by the participants in the forum has ensured that information has been presented to employees in a timely and meaningful manner.</P>
    <P>I understand that 289 workers have now completed training courses. Following those courses, all of the redundant workers were surveyed in April, 2006 to advise them of a weekly clinic provided by F&Aacute;S and other facilities available in Dungarvan. I understand that approximately half of these workers are claiming unemployment benefit. However, F&Aacute;S is continuing to meet with redundant staff and they are being encouraged to utilise the services available through the weekly F&Aacute;S Clinic in Dungarvan.</P>
    <P>In January 2006, I announced the extension of the Enterprise Ireland Community Enterprise Centre Scheme. Under this Scheme, Dungarvan is to receive &euro;300,000 from Enterprise Ireland for the construction of a new Enterprise Centre. A further &euro;200,000 is being provided by the Waterford County Enterprise Board. Furthermore, businesses assisted by the CEB created 40 new jobs last year and a similar number is predicted for 2006. Last August, I announced that the US based financial services company, Bisys Hedge <Col N="534"/>Fund Services was to establish a new operation in Waterford that would create over 250 new<?oasys _jy ?>jobs.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the ongoing work of the Industrial Development agencies will continue to provide good employment opportunities for Dungarvan and the surrounding area.</P>

	<P>Under current legislation if a non-EEA national wishes to take up employment in Ireland they will require some form of an employment permit. In relation to health professionals who wish to work in public hospitals in the state the appropriate permit required would be a Work Authorisation or Work Visa. The prospective employee is granted the authorisation/visa at an Irish Embassy or Consulate on the basis of a job offer in that sector, by an employer in Ireland. In the event that the proposed employee wishes to work with an employer not covered by the Work Authorisation/Work Visa Scheme then that employer will have to apply for a Work Permit on their behalf.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s policy is that new work permits are only being considered for highly skilled and highly paid positions which it is not possible to fill from within the EEA. Detailed guidelines for each Scheme are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.entemp.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 and 146 together.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. The marketing of individual areas, including Waterford and Dungarvan, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency. While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others. I have been informed by the agency that, from January 2002 to the end of May 2006 there have been thirty nine site visits to Waterford and four site visits to Dungarvan. The tabular statement sets out the number of site visits to each location in each of those years.</P>
    <P>The pursuit of the national goal of balanced and sustainable regional development is an important goal for my Department and the agencies under its remit. The National Spatial Strategy provides a framework for this goal wherein the focus is on the Gateway and Hub locations throughout the State. As the Gateway location for the South-East region IDA Ireland is seeking to develop Waterford City as a first-class location for overseas investment with the necessary infrastructure, skills availability and support services capable of attracting investment into Waterford and the entire region.</P>
    <P>In Waterford City IDA is actively marketing its new Business &amp; Technology Park on 70 acres on the Cork Road Planning permission is currently being sought to build a second 30,000 sq ft Advance Office Building on the park, now that the first building is occupied by IDA Ireland and Bisys Hedge Fund Services. In addition the agency is developing a major Greenfield site at Belview (3 miles from Waterford City) capable of accommodating large-scale utility intensive industry, most likely in the Pharma and ICT sectors. In Dungarvan, the agency owns 35 acres of land, adjacent to its Industrial Park in the town. Phase 1 of the site development has been completed and the first client has been secured. The profile of Industry in Waterford has been changing over the last few years with companies such as Genzyme, Sun Life and AOL representing investment in the newer knowledge-based industry sectors. Meanwhile, IDA Ireland continues to work its portfolio of existing clients in an effort to encourage them to re invest in the area.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by these Agencies together with the ongoing commitment by Government to regional development and the National Development Plan will bear fruit in terms of investment <Col N="536"/>and jobs for the people of Waterford, Dungarvan and the region as a whole.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
     <Quest>further to Parliamentary Question No. 150 of 14 June 2006, the results of his Department&rsquo;s consultation with southern and eastern regional assembly in regard to the way in which a designated area can qualify under the regional aid guidelines; if an area (details supplied) in County Kildare has been considered in view of the fact that there has been no industrial growth in this area for some time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[24247/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Southern &amp; Eastern Regional Assembly accepted the findings of an independent report which it commissioned from the National Institute for Spatial and Regional Analysis, at NUI Maynooth, and proposed that, in addition to the BMW Region and the South East Region, which automatically qualify, the remaining areas to be designated for 2007-2013, should be Clare, Limerick, North Tipperary and Kerry. The regional aid rates currently available in Dublin and the Mid East are already lower than those in all other regions of Ireland. As Dublin and the Mid East continue to enjoy a more favourable economic situation, they cannot qualify for designation, within the permitted population threshold, ahead of other regions.</P>
    <P>In relation to industrial development, IDA Ireland is a member of the Athy Investment Forum which is the body responsible for the recent development of the Athy Community Enterprise Centre. Until recently the IDA Advance Factory was occupied by an indigenous Irish company. The company has now vacated the facility and IDA Ireland is actively marketing the facility to potential clients.</P>
    <P>Kildare has in recent years attracted some world class manufacturing companies such as Intel, Wyeth Medica, Braun Oral B and Hewlett Packard. At present there are 25 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kildare employing approximately 10,818 people. There are four IDA Ireland assisted companies in Athy alone, employing a total of 425 people. IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions in the County, in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the <Col N="537"/>County. IDA Ireland is also working with FAS to provide guidance in developing the skill set needed by those already in the workforce who are interested in upskilling.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of 2003 Enterprise Ireland has approved over &euro;12m and made payments of over &euro;4.4 in support to companies in Kildare to help them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation and new product development in order that they can compete on world markets. Enterprise Ireland supported the development of the Athy Community Enterprise Centre on a Greenfield site at Woodstock Industrial Estate in Athy under its Community Enterprise Centre Programme 2002, contributing &euro;300,000 in capital funding. The centre is a state of the art building of 12,500 sq. ft. divided into 20 commercial units. When fully operational the centre which is already 80% occupied will house at least 40 people. In addition Enterprise Ireland has supported the development of Community Enterprise Centres in County Kildare, at Allenwood and Clane, under previous CEC programmes.</P>
    <P>Kildare has benefited from a significant investment in recent years in the technological infrastructure in NUI Maynooth. This will be the key to ensuring that Kildare is an attractive location for knowledge-based industry in future years. Enterprise Ireland has made a particular effort to ensure that Maynooth continues to develop strong links with industry in the region. To support innovation partnerships with industry, Enterprise Ireland approved funding approved of over &euro;2.2 million in support of 50 projects to NUI Maynooth during the period beginning 2003 to date as well as making payments of over &euro;2.3 million.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The power to determine the location of bus stops is vested in the Garda Commissioner under section 85 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. Under that section, the Commissioner may issue a direction to a bus operator identifying the specific location of bus stops and termini in respect of any bus route and in that context may determine that certain stops may only be used for passengers boarding or leaving buses. I understand that the garda&iacute; engage in a consultation process with both the local authority and the bus service provider before issuing a direction under section 85.</P>
    <P>Before a passenger licence is granted to a private operator for the provision of a public bus service in accordance with the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, my Department requires the operator to submit to my Department the approval of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for bus stops proposed on public roads, and/or approval from relevant institutions or bodies e.g. Airport Authority, College, etc., for proposed stops on private property.</P>
    <P>In the context of modernising the regulatory framework governing public transport and the provision of bus services by both public and private operators to which I am committed, the possible need for reform of the arrangements in relation to the provision and management of bus stops will also be considered. I will finalise my consideration of how best to proceed with public transport reform and further market opening in the context of the institutional structures recommended by the team appointed to finalise the remit, structures and human resource requirements of the proposed Dublin Transport Authority. I would hope to be in a position to publish legislation on the matter in the current year.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The DTO National Urban Cycle Facilities Manual (published in 1997) provides guidance on the design of cycle facilities in Ireland. It is available on the DTO website (<i>www.dto.ie</i>). This manual is supplemented by the DTO Traffic Management Manual, published in September 2003. Following an earlier review of the cycle manual, preparatory material has been collated for a new Cycle Facilities Manual, including new design, improved readability and layout and additional design information. I understand from the DTO that the Manual will be issued shortly in draft form for consultation, with a view to issuing a final draft in September 2006, and completion before the end of 2006.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of funding, the DTO administers the Traffic Management Grants (TMG) scheme in support of the implementation of its transportation strategy for the Greater Dublin Area. From the Transport 21 funding envelope, my Department has made &euro;40 million available to the grant scheme this year, with a provision for additional funding, if required. I understand that the DTO Traffic Management Grants (TMG) Committee, which administers the scheme on behalf of the DTO Steering Group, recently decided that the original amount of &euro;40 million will adequately meet the need to fund current year traffic management projects within the Greater Dublin Area. The rate of deployment of funds and completion of projects will continue to be monitored throughout the year, and if additional worthwhile projects are generated, the TMG Committee will review its decision in relation to funding needs.</P>

    <P>I understand from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that the capital cost of the signalling upgrades on the Westport and Ballina lines is &euro;27.86 million. This <Col N="541"/>covers the signalling at all stations and signalling at all level crossings between stations. The signalling system will be available continuously 24 hours a day for all operational use including passenger and freight. In relation to freight traffic, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has informed me that it has recently reintroduced a container service from Ballina to Waterford and that the existing pulpwood traffic from Westport and Ballina to Waterford will continue. This traffic benefits from past investment in the freight yard facility in Ballina and the recent investment in signalling.</P>
    <P>I understand that discussions are also being held with another shipping company regarding the potential for a trainload service for containers between Ballina and Dublin Port. The decision by Diageo to withdraw from keg distribution by rail will have an impact on the Claremorris freight facility.

     <Quest>the all-Ireland work which has been carried out in relation to transport; and if there have been discussions to establish an all-Ireland road and rail integrated public transportation strategy.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department and its agencies, assisted by the framework provided by the institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement, have been working closely with counterparts in Belfast and London to develop and implement transport policies, services and agreed initiatives so as to maximize the benefits for both jurisdictions. One of the most notable examples of this very practical all-island approach has been the development of the M1, where upgrading works to date on both sides of the border have already resulted in dramatically improved journey times. Meanwhile, significant improvements on the N2 from Dublin to the North West are being complemented by upgrades on the A5 in Northern Ireland, while the further development of the Atlantic Road Corridor from Waterford to the North West which is planned under the Transport 21 capital investment programme will have a beneficial impact on both sides of the border.</P>
    <P>Further examples of this policy in action include: the decision in principle of both Governments to offer a joint package of funding to the City of Derry Airport. This airport is already linked to Dublin by an air service which is operated as a Public Service Obligation and funded by the Irish Government; close co-operation between the National Safety Council and the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment in developing joint road safety advertising campaigns; and work being undertaken by officials in both jurisdictions in the context of the British-Irish Council aimed at introducing bilateral arrangements for mutual recognition of driving disqualifications as envisaged in the EU Convention on Driving Disqualifications.</P>
    <P>There is already a high level of co-operation and integration in the delivery of cross-border public transport services. Translink operate joint services with Bus &Eacute;ireann on most of their cross-border routes, while Irish Rail are in discussions on an ongoing basis with NIR/Translink regarding the jointly-operated Enterprise service and <Col N="543"/>options for its future development. There have been no discussions on the question of establishing a formal all-Ireland public transportation strategy. However, there is a clear record of making real progress on all-island transport issues through practical co-operation in the planning, delivery and improvement of both infrastructure and services. That policy will continue to underpin our efforts to achieve further tangible and cost-effective benefits for users of the island&rsquo;s public transport network.</P>

	<P>The deployment of its fleet is an operational matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. However, I am advised by the company that, most of 36 new modern DMU railcars delivered in 2005 were allocated to the Dublin-Sligo railway line to replace life-expired rolling stock as well as increasing capacity. The frequency of service on this line was improved from three to five daily return services. In addition, an order for a fleet of 150 new high-specification Intercity railcars has been placed by Irish Rail. They will enter service from 2007 onwards and some of these will be deployed by the company on the Dublin-Sligo route from 2008, further improving levels of passenger comfort and frequency of service.</P>

It is advertised annually and supports the activities of local voluntary and community groups in their community. The 2005 Programme made funds available for small scale refurbishment of premises, for the purchase of essential equipment, including I.T. equipment, and for education, training and research. The maximum grant for refurbishment was &euro;40,000; for equipment was &euro;10,000; and for training, education and research was also &euro;10,000.</P>
    <P>The Scheme is currently being reviewed and the 2006 Programme will be advertised in the coming weeks in the national and provincial newspapers. I have arranged for a copy of the application form and guidelines to be sent to the group in question as soon as they become available should the group wish to make an application under this year&rsquo;s scheme. It is possible also that funding for a project such as this may be available under the LEADER Programme.

	<P>My Department has identified the presence of Equine Infectious Anaemia in two horses on two separate establishments in County Meath. My Department&rsquo;s immediate priority has been to identify the source and extent of the disease and to trace the direct and indirect contacts from the infected premises. The two premises in question are now both under restriction for trade purposes. Our initial investigations suggest that <Col N="546"/>the source of the disease may have been from imported equine serum that was inadvertently or accidentally contaminated with the EIA virus prior to importation. Enquiries are continuing to confirm this initial view.</P>
    <P>Based on our enquiries and the knowledge acquired to date, we have no reason to believe that the disease is any more widespread than those cases of which we are currently aware. Results of blood tests from other horses on the two infected premises have, to date, been negative for EIA and tracing of animals that passed through those premises is continuing. As a precaution, and in the interests of horse owners, trainers, stud managers and the bloodstock industry, my Department has advised that all horses that may have moved during the breeding season be tested for any evidence of the disease. Approximately 1,000 tests taken by owners/trainers/stud managers throughout the bloodstock industry have all been negative for EIA.</P>
    <P>The Department had advised any other Member States to which horses were exported from either of the infected premises since the suspected date of infection and the date of confirmation and all blood test results from any such horses have, to date, been negative, though they are not yet complete. I expect that within a week, by which time we will have more test results available, we will be in a position to clarify the position further.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 168 together.</P>
    <P>Council Directive 91/628/EEC on the protection of animals during transport, as transposed by the recently adopted European Communities (Protection of Animals during Transport) Regulations 2006, sets down the conditions for the transport of dogs within Ireland and to and from Ireland. The legislation does not apply to non-commercial transport or to the transport of pet animals accompanying their owners on private <Col N="547"/>journeys or to the transport of animals over distances of less than 50 km.</P>
    <P>Provisions in the legislation include inter alia requirements that transporters must ensure that the animals are fit for transport and that they are accommodated so as to avoid risk of injury or unnecessary suffering. Animals must be provided with adequate ventilation and space to stand naturally and to lie down. Food and water must be available to the animals so that they can be fed at intervals not exceeding 24 hours and watered at intervals not exceeding 12 hours.</P>
    <P>The legislation also requires that transport of animals by air must be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the latest edition of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) live animals Regulations. These Regulations relate to international standards for containers, pens or stalls appropriate for the transport of live animals by air. The IATA is a self regulating body that represents airlines in promoting safe, reliable and secure air services.</P>
    <P>In March 2004 my Department introduced a system of registration of transporters of dogs for commercial purposes and the inspection of vehicles engaging in such transport to the Continent. Commercial consignments of dogs are examined and certified prior to departure to ensure compliance with the provisions of EU and national legislation. However, these requirements do not apply in respect of commercial consignments to the UK and vice versa due to the common rabies-free status of both territories. Nevertheless commercial consignments transiting ports or airports are liable to random welfare inspections.</P>
    <P>Council Regulation (EC) 1 of 2005 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations will come into operation on 5 January 2007. This Regulation replaces Council Directive 91/628/EEC and will introduce additional conditions in relation to the authorisation of the mode of transport, loading and unloading facilities and in particular the training of transporters and operators. I believe that this Regulation will further improve the conditions under which animals are transported throughout the European Union. My Department is currently preparing legislation to provide for implementation of the Council Regulation.</P>

	<P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government made Regu<Col N="548"/>lations in December 2005 giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme. They came into effect on 1 February 2006, but the Minister then announced a brief de facto deferral of the implementation of Part 3 of the Regulations dealing with nutrient management. This was to allow time for Teagasc to submit revised scientific advice, which was received early in March.</P>
    <P>Detailed proposals for amendments to the Regulations, along with the scientific arguments to justify the changes, were forwarded to the Commission by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 18 May. There have since been discussions and other contacts between officials of the two Departments, Teagasc representatives and the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The proposals, which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has outlined, were developed in conjunction with my Department and with the input of Teagasc and address a range of important issues identified in the Teagasc submission and raised by the farming bodies. I am satisfied that the changes proposed to the Commission will be of major benefit to Irish farmers, in that they will provide them with greater flexibility in complying with fertiliser limits and simplify certain aspects of the Regulations.</P>

This means that the value of any such national retirement pension payable must be deducted from the Early Retirement Pension.</P>
    <P>The person named entered the Early Retirement Scheme on 3 January 1997 under the joint management arrangement and her participation in the Scheme is due to finish on 2 January 2007 when she has completed 10 years in the Scheme. Her husband became entitled to a Contributory Old Age pension from 6 July 2001 and, as required under the Scheme, the amount of his Old Age pension had to be offset against the Early Retirement pension.</P>
    <P>The person named became entitled to a Contributory Old Age pension in her own right from 6 June 2003. As the total amount of her and her husband&rsquo;s Old Age pensions exceeded the amount payable under the Early Retirement Scheme, no further payments could be made to her under the Early Retirement Scheme.</P>
    <P>Due to difficulties experienced by the person named in finding a qualified transferee to lease her lands and the fact that payment of the Early Retirement pension has ceased, she is now being afforded the opportunity of opting out of the Early Retirement Scheme, without penalty. My Department wrote to the applicant concerned on 13 June 2006 advising her of this option.</P>

	<P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), in particular, take a proactive and vigorous approach in preventing and combating trafficking of human beings. The GNIB works closely with other specialist units, e.g., the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau. A number of ongoing Garda operations, including &ldquo;Operation Hotel&rdquo; and &ldquo;Operation Quest&rdquo;, are in place to tackle the phenomenon. The approach taken in tackling trafficking is, where possible, to prevent it occurring, or where it does occur, to seek to prosecute the perpetrators and to protect the victims.</P><Col N="551"/>
    <P>The Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000, Section 2, created the offence of Trafficking in Illegal Immigrants. I have been informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that since the enactment of the Act, convictions have been achieved in respect of ten breaches of Section 2 of the Act.</P>
    <P>The information available to me from the Garda Authorities indicates that two convictions were secured in 2001. These related to organising or facilitating the arrival of Ukrainian nationals in the State; another two convictions occurred in 2004 and related to Brazilian nationals while the remaining six convictions in 2006 related to Indian nationals.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 creates an offence of trafficking in children for sexual exploitation. I am informed that no prosecutions have been achieved in respect of this offence to date.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There were eight civilian staff employed in Waterford Garda Station in 2001. In the years since 2001, these numbers have been increased and today stand at 11, including 1 District Finance Officer, 1 Staff Officer, and 9 Clerical Officers. The District Finance Officer was appointed in line with the 2001 Civilianisation Report and is carrying out the Finance function previously performed by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
    <P>While progress in relation to the appointment of additional Clerical Officers to Garda Stations has been stalled for some time now due to the Equal Pay case taken by the Civil, Public and Services Union (CPSU), I am pleased to say that other elements of the Civilianisation Programme are continuing apace and are contributing to the freeing-up of Garda&iacute; for front-line policing. I would refer the Deputy in particular, to the establishment of the Garda Information Service Centre (GISC) in Castlebar. Whereas previously Garda&iacute; had to return to their Stations following a crime event to enter data on PULSE, they now make a call to GISC, where civilian colleagues input the data for them, allowing officers to remain &ldquo;on the beat&rdquo;. This new system, which has already been rolled out in the South-East Region, <Col N="552"/>including Waterford, is yielding enormous benefits to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to my Reply to D&aacute;il Question No. 74 of 15 June, 2006 in relation to the cases of the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the asylum cases of the two persons concerned fall under the terms of Council Regulation (E.C.) No. 343/2003 and, as stated in my previous Reply, a Transfer Order has been signed and issued in respect of the mother in this case.</P>
    <P>As previously stated, I understand from the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC), that they are in the process of requesting the United Kingdom to accept the asylum case of the child under Article 4 (3) of the Regulation. It should be noted that as the Regulation is an asylum measure, the provisions of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, (and in particular Section 3 of that Act), do not apply to such cases. The facility therefore for making representations to the Minister for permission to remain temporarily in the State is not applicable in this instance.</P>
    <P>All representations in relation to Dublin II cases must be made to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner for consideration in advance of its determination. Any appeal afterwards in relation to a determination to transfer should be made directly to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, and not to the Minister. If such an appeal is successful, the person concerned is admitted to the substantive asylum process in this State. However since the ORAC have already made a determination on the mother&rsquo;s case, it is not possible for her to make representations on <Col N="556"/>humanitarian or compassionate grounds at this late stage.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should note that it is not open to an asylum applicant to choose whether their asylum application is examined in this State or in another State. Instead, the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation apply where asylum applications have been lodged in more than one jurisdiction and this is clearly the case in so far as the mother in this case is concerned. In the case of the child, his position has not yet been finalised, but this will be done as soon as all necessary formalities with the UK authorities have been satisfactorily completed. However, on the basis of all known information, it would appear that the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation will apply equally to his case.</P>

Other reports included in the list comprise detailed research projects which have a vital role in creating the foundation for sound, evidence based policy making. Others again represent the culmination of major reviews of legislation and policy in such key areas as the management of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. A further category of reports are those which include the findings of inquiries established over time into certain matters in the public interest.</P><Col N="555"/>

	<P>It is not true to say that Sligo is 17th on list for provision of closed circuit television. As the Deputy is aware Sligo is one of the 17 remaining locations nationwide which form part of the Garda CCTV programme. As part of this programme 17 Garda Town Centre CCTV Systems, including Sligo, will be implemented in the following locations: Athlone, Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Kinsale, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght, Tullamore and Waterford. The locations are listed in alphabetical order.</P>
    <P>As I indicated previously I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of this CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard. I believe that the answer is to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the Garda authorities are currently finalising a comprehensive and detailed Request for Tender (RFT) for the outsourced service provision of these 17 Garda CCTV systems, including Sligo. Once finalised, this RFT will be subject to a peer review process by the Department of Finance. My Department and the Garda authorities have consulted with the Department of Finance with a view to preparing for the required peer review process in respect of this procurement. Following the successful conclusion of this review it is intended to issue the Request for Tender.</P>
    <P>My ambition is to have a Garda CCTV system operating in Sligo and in the other 16 locations at the earliest opportunity, subject to compliance with relevant procurement legislation and procedures.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 12,641 (all ranks) on Thursday 8 June with the attestation of 273 new members. This compares <Col N="582"/>with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 1,939 (or 18.1%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.</P>
    <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of the Sligo/Leitrim Division as at 21 June, 2006 was 283 (all ranks). The personnel strength of the Sligo/Leitrim Division as at 31 December, 1997 was 257 (all ranks). This represents an increase of 26 (or 10.11%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.</P>
    <P>Garda Management state that this includes seven Garda&iacute; allocated to the Sligo/Leitrim Division on 9 June, 2006 in conjunction with the most recent allocation of Probationer Garda&iacute;. Local Management report that these newly allocated Garda&iacute; will take up duty on the regular uniform units at Sligo Garda Station, which will result in extra members performing beat duty.</P>
    <P>Local Garda Management report that a high visibility pilot scheme has been introduced throughout the Sligo/Leitrim Division, which will result in an increased visible Garda presence in the high density population centres in County Sligo namely Sligo Town, Ballymote and Tubbercurry. As part of this pilot scheme local Garda Management have introduced &ldquo;Operation Yellow&rdquo; a local initiative in Sligo town, which commenced on 14 June, 2006 ensuring that Garda&iacute; at all ranks perform more beat duty.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
    <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. The first group of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and the second such group did so on 8 of June. Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the areas referred to by the Deputy will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

	<P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to applications for permission to remain in the State made pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended).</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department will at any time have a considerable number of such cases on hands with these cases arising predominantly from persons whose asylum applications have been formally rejected with smaller numbers of cases arising in respect of persons who have otherwise become illegal in the State, e.g. where they overstayed a Visa or Work Permit etc. In all such cases, regardless of their origin, each person is served with a notice of intention to deport, as set out in Section 3(3) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and the person is advised of the three options open to them at that point in time namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to deportation or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations setting out reasons why they should not be deported i.e. why they should be permitted to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
    <P>Where an application for permission to remain temporarily in the State is submitted, this must be examined having regard for all of the factors specified in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) which are as follows: </P>
    <P LI="1">(a) the age of the person, </P>
    <P LI="1">(b) the duration of residence in the State of the person, </P>
   <P LI="1">(c) the family and domestic circumstances of the person, </P><Col N="584"/>
    <P LI="1">(d) the nature of the person&rsquo;s connection with the State, if any, </P>
    <P LI="1">(e) the employment (including self-employment) record of the person, </P>
    <P LI="1">(f) the employment (including self-employment) prospects of the person, </P>
    <P LI="1">(g) the character and conduct of the person both within and (where relevant and ascertainable) outside the State (including any criminal convictions), </P>
    <P LI="1">(h) humanitarian considerations, </P>
  <P LI="1">(i) any representations duly made by or on behalf of the person, </P>
    <P LI="1">(j) the common good and </P>
    <P LI="1">(k) considerations of national security and public policy. </P>
    <P FLI="0">It might be noted that each case is considered individually and regardless of whether written representations are submitted or not by or on behalf of the person. Following a detailed examination of each individual case, including a consideration having regard to Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, a recommendation is made as to whether a Deportation Order should be issued or permission to remain in the State granted. Refoulement essentially relates to the safety of returning a failed applicant to their country of origin.</P>
    <P>In light of the detailed assessment required to be carried out in each individual case, the Deputy will appreciate that this is a resource intensive exercise and, as such, it is obviously difficult to have some of the more complex cases processed as quickly as would be desirable. The Deputy will appreciate also that other factors sometimes come into play while such an application is being examined, i.e. where an applicant&rsquo;s circumstances change, e.g. where they marry an EU or Irish National or a recognised refugee and seek to have their position in the State regularised on such a basis. Equally, some applicants, either directly or indirectly, submit several sets of written representations which makes it difficult to complete the processing of a case within a short time-frame.</P>
    <P>Overall, I would estimate that a relatively straight-forward application can be finalised within a matter of weeks of receipt while some others, because of the complexity of the case or other factors, will take considerably longer to finalise.</P>
    <P>The Deputy might also wish to note that cases from certain prioritised countries, namely Bulgaria, Croatia, Nigeria, Romania and South Africa, have their asylum applications and, where appropriate, their applications for permission to remain temporarily in the State finalised within prescribed timeframes. Such cases, with occasional exceptions, are the subject of accelerated processing on the basis that, in the case of <Col N="585"/>four of those States, they have been designated as safe countries of origin while, in the case of Nigerian applications, the accelerated processing of such cases is based on the fact that Nigeria would not normally be regarded as a refugee generating country.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that all applications for permission to remain temporarily in the State are considered on their individual merits, having regard for all relevant criteria. The Deputy can also be assured that, in general, any delay in having such a case finalised will arise from the complexities associated with such a case.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule for the 2006/07 school year is outlined in Primary Circular 23/06 which issued to all primary schools recently.</P>
    <P>The staffing schedule is structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to an average mainstream class size of 29 pupils. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007/2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. School authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and the smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>In the current school year the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy comprises of a Principal and seven mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 180 pupils at 30 September, 2004. The school also has two Permanent Learning Support-Resource posts and one Temporary Learning Support-Resource post.</P>
    <P>The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2006/2007 school year will remain at a Principal and seven mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 190 pupils at 30 September, 2005.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>if she has received a petition in June 2006 from the INTO regarding the issue of class size and other Government commitments; her views on the issues raised; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[24239/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I can confirm that a petition has been received in my office. Major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years with the hiring of more than 5,000 additional primary teachers. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.</P>
    <P>Today there is one teacher for every 17 children, the lowest pupil teacher ratio in the history of the State. Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. Under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion that I launched in May, 2005, there will be a reduction in class sizes to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in the 180 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. With more than 600 extra resource teachers put in place in this school year, children with special needs are getting more support than ever before. It should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in this area in recent years.</P>
    <P>Recently I announced that I have secured sufficient funding to provide even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year, and the Minister for Finance has committed to a further reduction in class size in the following year. Accordingly, over the next 2 years, my Department will put 500 extra teachers into primary schools to reduce class size and to tackle disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream <Col N="590"/>posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools.</P>
    <P>At present the general rule is that the schedule provides at least one classroom teacher for every 29 pupils in the school. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007/2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
    <P>In speaking about staffing in our schools, we have consistently said that priority would be given in the first instance to children in disadvantaged schools and those with special needs. We have done this. And now, in line with the Government commitment, mainstream class sizes are also being reduced.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Defence Forces personnel have for many years attended workshops, training courses, desktop exercises, seminars and other events overseas as part of their military training and will continue to do this. The Defence Forces have also attended training courses and workshops under PfP PARP, the purpose of which is to learn from best practice in other Defence Forces and includes improving the level of interoperability between forces in the context of Peace Support Operations and the Petersberg Tasks. While there are no plans for the involvement of Naval or Air Corps assets, individual members of the Naval Service or Air Corps may be deployed on overseas peace support operations as they have been in the past. Members of the Naval Service and Air Corps being deployed on overseas missions undergo the same training as any other personnel.</P>
    <P>In relation to training for Battlegroups, most training will take place in the contributing member States, i.e. Irish troops will mainly be trained in Ireland. That said, some level of joint training with other Battlegroup participants will be an imperative. The extent of any such joint training and whether training will extend to exercising is a matter for decision by Battlegroup participants. No such training has taken place to date.</P>
    <P>There are no plans to engage in general EU or NATO based field exercises and no basis or reason for such. The rationale for field exercises will be to improve interoperability among Battlegroup participants and, as such, I would expect that any field exercises will be for the Battlegroup participants alone.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s Presentation Document for participation in PfP was approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 9 November, 1999 and, following D&aacute;il approval, Ireland joined PfP on 1 December, 1999. Ireland also participates in the PfP Planning and Review Process (known as PARP). In common with the other EU neutrals, Ireland is using the PARP process in <Col N="593"/>connection with planning for humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping and crisis management, collectively known as the Petersberg tasks. The scope of our involvement in PARP is focused on enhancing interoperability and familiarity with operating procedures in a multinational environment.</P><?oasys _cl10.5- ?>
    <P>Participation in Partnership for Peace (PfP) activities is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is, a State selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation. It is Government policy to stay in the mainstream of peacekeeping. Ireland&rsquo;s participation in Partnership for Peace (PfP) enables our peacekeepers to remain abreast of developments in preparation for peacekeeping in areas such as training, interoperability and humanitarian aspects of peacekeeping. Participation enhances the ability of our peacekeepers to work with those of other countries and also enables us to share our own peacekeeping skills with a wide range of countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland currently participates in 2 NATO/PfP-led peace support operations under UN authorisation, namely in Kosovo (KFOR) and Afghanistan (ISAF).</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209, 210, 211, 215 and 217 together.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. Recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper as required to meet military needs. The Defence Forces continue to have a proactive approach to all aspects of recruiting.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Permanent Defence Force, the number of female personnel by rank and the strength of the Reserve Defence Force, as advised by the military authorities, is provided in the form of a Tabular Statement, which I propose to circulate with the Official Report. The figures provided are as at 30 April, 2006.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence provides for an allocation of up to 850 Permanent Defence Force personnel to be deployed overseas at any one time through the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System (UNSAS). While this may be exceeded for short periods, deployments above this level are not sustainable on an ongoing basis within existing resources. Any commitments to EU or UN missions will be met within this context. There are no plans to increase the numbers serving in the Defence Forces above the levels provided for in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking and other such illegal activities rests primarily with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners. The White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for both the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work. While the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State&rsquo;s obligations as a member of the European Union, Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, (including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving the Garda&iacute;, the Customs Service and the Naval Service), have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking. The Air Corps provide air support and on occasion carry the Customs National Drugs Team in an observation capacity, for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking or other such illegal activities.</P>
    <P>There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and the Naval Service and the Air Corps in this important area. I am satisfied that the extent of Naval Service and Air Corps reconnaissance, in conjunction with the Garda&iacute; and the Customs Service, has had a major and beneficial impact in deterring drug trafficking and other such illegal activities.</P><Col N="593"/>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I had a number of discussions with the Irish Bankers Federation (IBF) in relation to this matter last year, with a view to increasing the level of contribution by the Banks in respect of the costs incurred by the Department in the provision of Cash Escorts. Following detailed and intensive discussions between officials of the IBF, the member Banks and the Department, a detailed formal agreement was signed on 11 May, 2005.</P>
    <P>This agreement, which is for a 5 year period, provides that the banks will pay the total actual costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of cash escorts. Costs in respect of each 12 month period to end-December, will be paid the following year on or before the 1st June. This is to allow for the compilation of returns from the brigades and allocation of costs following the year-end. The first payment under the new system was paid on 1 June 2006. I agreed, at the <Col N="598"/>bank&rsquo;s request, to defer the first payment to that date to meet the banks budgeting and accounting timeframe.</P>
    <P>In return for my agreement to this deferral, a transitional payment of &euro;1 million, payable before the end of 2005, was negotiated as part of the overall agreement. Therefore in 2005 the banks made their annual payment of &euro;2.86m plus the additional &euro;1m making a total contribution of &euro;3.86m. A figure of &euro;6.03 million was paid in 2006. The amount to be paid in 2007 (costs for 2006) will not be available until early 2007.</P>
    <P>Prior to this initiative it had been the case that an annual contribution of &euro;2.86m was being paid by the banks to my Department in respect of the provision of cash escorts since 1995. This figure was set by the Department of Finance in the 1995 budget and had not been altered since. The contribution from the Banks was designed to part-cover the total costs to the State of providing cash escorts. At that time, the contribution covered approximately 72% of the total cost arising to the Defence Forces. Based on annual costings by the Department, the relative level of the contribution had fallen in real terms over the years to the situation where it was only covering 43% of the total costs.</P>
    <P>The total cost in respect of the provision by the Defence Forces of assistance to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in protecting movements of cash for the years 2001 to 2005 is contained in the table.</P><Col N="597"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213, 218 and 219 together.</P>
    <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. The potential threats to the State arising from terrorism are continuously monitored by them in cooperation with the Defence Forces. It is important that all prudent precautions are taken and that matters are kept under continuous review. The objective of the Government is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any large-scale emergency irrespective of whether it arises from an act of terrorism or from a man-made or natural disaster. The key issue in relation to responding to any terrorist attack is to have in place appropriate and effective plans to respond to the impact of that attack and to protect the civilian population.</P>
    <P>The Government Task Force on Emergency Planning has worked, since it was set up in 2001, to coordinate emergency planning and response arrangements across those Government Departments that lead and support the State&rsquo;s response in an emergency. The focus for this work continues to be on making the necessary arrangements to, at best, prevent or, at least, minimise the risks from terrorist activities, ensuring that the protection available to the Irish people is maximised, putting mechanisms in place to support the response agencies and providing coordination for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces make contingency plans for a range of scenarios where the security of the State may be at risk. In addition, the Defence Forces have contingency plans in place in relation to the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (meaning in practice to assist, when requested, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na), and the provision of assistance <Col N="600"/>to the Civil Authorities for a range of emergency situations.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting their members in dealing with Nuclear, Biological or Chemical (NBC) threats identified from time to time. They hold an extensive range of modern NBC equipment that meets their current requirements. This range includes approximately 9,500 NBC suits, of which 800 were delivered in January 2006. In addition, the Defence Forces has sufficient stock of Respirators for each individual soldier. They also have 98 of the most technologically up to date Chemical Agent Monitors and Defence Forces personnel have been trained on their operation. Other equipment on hands includes Biological Agent Detector and Screening Kits, Group Decontamination Equipment and Personal Decontamination Equipment.</P>
    <P>The requirement for additional NBC equipment is kept under continuous review by the Defence Forces. A programme for the purchase of NBC equipment is ongoing and whatever equipment deemed necessary is purchased expeditiously to meet the changing requirements.</P>
    <P>The Deputy specifically refers to body armour. In that regard, a tender competition was held in 2005 for the provision of body armour for the individual soldier on operational duties. An order has now been placed for 6000 units for delivery this year. The new body armour provides significantly greater protection, comfort and coverage than the old model as well as a doubling of the range of sizes available.</P>

	<P>Personnel on being discharged from the Permanent Defence Force are obliged to vacate married quarters within a short period of the dates of their discharge. The provision of housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities and married personnel have an equal claim on such housing as other members of the community in the same income category.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to examine all options, including affordable housing and voluntary and co-operative housing schemes, in relation to the re-housing of those overholders who would in the normal way be eligible for Local Authority Housing.</P>

	<P>The Defence Forces are committed to providing support to the civil authorities specifically in relation to Search and Rescue. The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime Search and Rescue services within the Irish Search and Rescue Region, and the Naval Service and the Air Corps provide support to the Coast Guard in this regard as the need arises and within their available capability. While the Air Corps has withdrawn from the direct provision of Search and Rescue services, Air Corps pilots continue to train in search and rescue techniques and to provide a limited non-maritime search and rescue response. The specification for the new helicopters being acquired for the Air Corps includes a Search and Rescue capability.</P>
    <P>Search and Rescue capability requires a wide range of available skills: piloting, winching, medical, vessel crewing, radar etc. I am advised by the military authorities that the availability of these skills within the Defence Forces is sufficient to meet their continuing commitments in this area.</P><Col N="602"/>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force all ranks comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. There are no proposals to increase the strength of the Permanent Defence Force above the White Paper figure of 10,500. Recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at the approved level.</P>

     <Quest>the dialogue he has had with Kildare County Council following the publication of the Irish Business against Litter survey in May 2006; if he has satisfied himself that Kildare County Council has sufficient staffing and financial resources to ensure adequate enforcement of the litter laws and seven day street sweeping systems; if he agrees with IBAL that these two elements are of key importance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[24251/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>IBAL is one of a number of anti-litter initiatives assisted by my Department aimed at raising public awareness of litter pollution and energising support for local authority anti-litter actions. This specific initiative has been supported since 2003. My Department liaise on a regular basis with local authorities in relation to anti-litter initiatives and activities, including IBAL.</P>
    <P>Under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2003, primary responsibility for tackling litter pollution, including allocation of resources, rests with local <Col N="604"/>authorities. The appointment of litter wardens, within each authority&rsquo;s current authorised staffing level, is also a matter for individual local authorities and is one in which my Department has no function.</P>
    <P>Each local authority determines its level of expenditure on individual local services, including its anti-litter operations, as part of its annual estimates process. Such expenditure is funded from a variety of sources such as rates, fees, charges and the Local Government Fund. Since 2003, Kildare County Council has received increases in general purpose funding from the Local Government Fund in excess of 44%. In 2006, the general purpose allocation for Kildare County Council is &euro;23.8 million, representing an increase of 9.6% over 2005 and is well ahead of the corresponding national average increase of 6.73%.</P>
    <P>In addition, since 2003 my Department has allocated a total of over &euro;1.85 million in grants to local authorities for public education and awareness initiatives against litter: Kildare County Council received &euro;62,000 in grant aid during this period. I envisage making further allocations of this kind to local authorities in 2006.</P>
    <P>The National Litter Pollution Monitoring System, which measures the extent and severity <Col N="605"/>of litter pollution nationally, shows that there has been an improvement in litter pollution levels countrywide in recent years. The positive trend shown by the Monitoring system is also reflected in the IBAL League results, which record that cleanliness levels in the 53 participating towns and cities are generally improving.</P>
    <P>Litter enforcement statistics are available in the Oireachtas Library and show that local authority performance on enforcement of the litter laws continues to improve. More litter wardens have been employed and there have been substantial increases in the number of prosecutions taken and on-the-spot fines issued annually.</P>
    <P>The eradication of litter pollution will only be achieved through a partnership approach in which all sectors &mdash; businesses, community groups, residents associations, schools and individuals &mdash; play their part. In addition to enforcement of our litter laws, awareness raising and education initiatives are vitally important if we are to change the behaviour and attitude of people, so that they dispose of their litter in a responsible way.</P>

The measures include the use of Census enumerators or other temporary personnel to <Col N="606"/>support local authorities in preparing the next Register.</P>
    <P>My Department is working with a group of local authority managers and senior officials to put in place the enhanced programme for improving the next Register. This would include ensuring that each household is visited and provided with forms and information at least twice, if necessary. In the event that this process does not satisfactorily register the household, it is proposed that written notification would then be given cautioning of the danger of being omitted from the Register.</P>
    <P>Updated and consolidated guidance has been issued by my Department to local authorities setting out best practice to be followed by authorities in preparing and maintaining the Register. I am prepared to make increased, ring fenced financial resources available to local authorities this year to update the Register; the details involved are being examined at present.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 227 and 228 together.</P>
    <P>The provision of a fire service, including equipment, is a statutory function of the individual fire authorities and my Department has no direct role in this matter. My Department supports the local fire authorities through the setting of general policy, the provision of capital funding, the issue of guidance to fire authorities in relation to fire prevention and operational matters and other such initiatives.</P>
    <P>Over the past 25 years, almost &euro;240 million has been provided to local fire authorities under the fire services capital programme for the provision of new and refurbished fire stations and the purchase of fire appliances and other equipment. At this stage, over two-thirds of our fire stations, <Col N="607"/>including almost all of the busiest stations, have been replaced, we have a modern fleet of front-line fire appliances, and we have a modern emergency response communications system. In the current year almost &euro;20 million has been allocated to the Fire Services capital programme. This allocation will be used to further modernise and update the resources available to the fire authorities.</P>
    <P>In addition, since 2001, my Department has provided almost &euro;4.2 billion in general purpose grants to assist the local authorities in carrying out their statutory functions, including the provision of fire services.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My Department constantly generates internal reports in the course of its work.  These reports are generated on an almost daily basis, vary in size and complexity and cover a range of topics across the entire business remit of the Department. Among the Department's more significant published reports that were prepared internally are the National Spatial Strategy, the National Biodiversity Plan &amp; Update, Progress Report on Climate Change Strategy, and the review of the operation of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998. My Department also produces an Annual Report each year in accordance with the requirements under the Public Service Management Act.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of external reports have also been commissioned within the different business areas of my Department. Details of these are being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly.</P>
    <P>In sourcing such consultancy reports, my Department operates in accordance with relevant guidelines from the Department of Finance, which are designed to ensure compliance with both good procurement practice and value for money.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My Department coordinates and finances a major programme of investment in new and improved water services infrastructure. Details of projects approved for Departmental funding are set out in the Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007 which is available in the Oireachtas Library. The water supply schemes included in the Programme are derived mainly from regular assessments of needs undertaken by local authorities, at my Department&rsquo;s request, as an input to the overall strategy for meeting water supply production, treatment and distribution requirements.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have recently been requested to carry out fresh assessments of needs and to submit these to my Department by end July 2006. Any new priorities identified by these latest assessments will inform scheme selection under future phases of the Water Services Investment Programme.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007 also incorporates a national water conservation sub-programme under which &euro;281 million is available to local authorities specifically to fund:</P>
    <P LI="1">(a) management systems to monitor water use and loss in supply networks;</P>
   <P LI="1">(b) targeted leakage control measures; and</P>
    <P LI="1">(c) rehabilitation and replacement of obsolete supply networks. In November 2005, I increased the rate of Exchequer grant available for network rehabilitation and replacement from 75% to 90% to secure greater progress on the sub-programme.</P>
    <P FLI="0" Just="Left">My Department's draft guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans, which were issued for public consultation in April 2006, are explicit in enjoining regard for the existing and future availability of, or the capacity to provide, infrastructure. The draft guidelines emphasise that while services are not available, zoning for development should only be contemplated where there is a reasonable expectation of the services being provided in the development plan period. Land should not be zoned if there is no reliable prospect of providing key physical infrastructure, within the plan development period or a reasonable time period thereafter, such as improved roads, footpaths, drainage and lighting to serve likely future development.</P>
